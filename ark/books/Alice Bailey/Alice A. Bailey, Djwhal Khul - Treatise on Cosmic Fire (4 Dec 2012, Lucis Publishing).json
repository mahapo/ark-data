I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity. The beauty and the strength of this Invocation lies in itssimplicity, and in its expression of certain central truths which all men,innately and normally, accept—the truth of the existence of a basic Intelligenceto Whom we vaguely give the name of God; the truth that behind all outerseeming, the motivating power of the universe is Love; the truth that a greatIndividuality came to earth, called by Christians, the Christ, and embodied thatlove so that we could understand; the truth that both love and intelligence areeffects of what is called the Will of God; and finally the self-evident truththat only through humanity itself can the Divine Plan work out.”ALICE A. BAILEY"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION“To the God Who is in the FIRE and Who is in the waters;To the God Who has suffused Himself through all the world;To the God Who is in summer plants and in the lords of the forest;To that God be adoration, adoration.”Sh’vet Upanishad, II.17[vi] The story of the many years of telepathic work by the Tibetan with Alice A.Bailey is revealed in her Unfinished Autobiography , published in 1951. Thisincludes the circumstances of her first contact with him, on the physical plane,which took place in California in November 1919. Thirty years’ work was planned.When this had been accomplished, and within thirty days after that period, Mrs.Bailey gained her release from the limitations of the physical vehicle.The Autobiography also contains certain statements by the Tibetan in regard tohis work and some information as to the reasons why it was undertaken. In theearly stages the work involved careful attention to the physical planeconditions which might best help to make the telepathic process more successful.But during the latter years the technique was so perfected and the ethericmechanism of A.A.B. so skilfully attuned and adjusted that the whole process waspractically effortless, and the reality and practical usefulness of telepathicinterplay was demonstrated to an unique degree.The spiritual truths dealt with involved in many cases the expression by thelower concrete mind (often with the insuperable restrictions of the Englishlanguage) of abstract ideas and hitherto quite unknown concepts of spiritualrealities. This unescapable limitation of truth has been frequently called tothe attention of the readers of the books so produced but is all too oftenforgotten. Its constant remembrance will constitute in the years to come one ofthe chief factors in preventing the crystallisation of the teaching fromproducing yet one more dogmatic sectarian cult.The present volume, A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , first published in 1925, was thethird book jointly produced and carries inherent evidence that it will stand asthe major and most far-reaching portion of the thirty-year teachings,notwithstanding the profundity and usefulness of the volumes published in theseries [vii] entitled A Treatise on the Seven Rays or of any other of the books.During the long course of the work the minds of the Tibetan and A.A.B. became soclosely attuned that they were in effect—so far as much of the production of theteaching was concerned—a single joint projecting mechanism. Even to the endA.A.B. often spoke of her amazement at the glimpses she obtained through contactwith the Tibetan’s mind, of limitless vistas of spiritual truths which she couldnot possibly have otherwise contacted, and often of a quality she could notpossibly express. This experience was the basis of her often proclaimed butfrequently little-understood assertion that all the teachings she was aiding inproducing was in fact only the A B C of esoteric knowledge, and that in thefuture she would gladly abandon any pronoucement in the present teaching, whenshe found better and more deeply esoteric teaching available. Clear and profoundas the teaching actually is in the books published in her name, the truthsimparted are so partial and subject to later revelation and expansion that thisfact, if constantly remembered, will give us a second much-needed safeguardagainst that quality of the concrete mind which constantly tends to producesectarianism.At the very beginning of the joint effort and after careful consideration it wasdecided between the Tibetan (D.K.) and A.A.B. that she as the working discipleon the outer plane should shoulder as much as possible of karmic responsibilityon that plane, and that the teaching should go to the public over her signature.This involved the burden of leadership in the esoteric field and precipitatedattack and condemnation from persons and organisations whose positions andactivities were more Piscean and authoritarian.The entire platform upon which esoteric teaching stands before the public todayhas been liberated from the limitations and follies of mystery, glamour,claim-making and impracticality, by the position taken by the Tibetan and A.A.B.The stand taken against dogmatic assertion has helped to establish a new era ofmental freedom for the students of the progressively unfolding revelation of theAgeless Wisdom.[viii] The age-old method of arriving at truth by the process of accepting newauthorities and comparing them with previously established doctrines, while ofundoubted value in the training of the mind, is gradually being transcended. Inits place is emerging in both the religious and philosophical worlds a newcapacity to take a more scientific position. Spiritual teaching will beincreasingly accepted as an hypothesis to be proved less by scholasticism,historical foundation and authority, and more by the results of its effect uponthe life lived and its practical usefulness in solving the problems of humanity.Heretofore, advanced esoteric teaching has almost invariably been obtainableonly by the student’s acceptance of the authority of the teacher, varyingdegrees of personal obedience to that teacher and pledges of secrecy. As the newAquarian dispensation progresses these limitations will disappear. The personalrelation of the disciple to the Master remains, but already discipleshiptraining has been attempted in Group formation. The record of one suchexperiment and attempt to use this new age method has been made available to thepublic in the book entitled Discipleship in the New Age , which gives the directpersonal instructions by the Tibetan to a selected group.In A Treatise on Cosmic Fire the Tibetan has given us what H. P. Blavatskyprophesied he would give, namely the psychological key to the Cosmic Creation.H.P.B. stated that in the 20th century a disciple would come who would give thepsychological key to her own monumental work The Secret Doctrine on whichtreatise the Tibetan worked with her; and Alice A. Bailey worked in completerecognition of her own task in this sequence.FOSTER BAILEY, Tunbridge Wells, December 1950"},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD[xii] This “Treatise on Cosmic Fire’’ has a fivefold purpose in view:First, to provide a compact and skeleton outline of a scheme of cosmology,philosophy, and psychology which may perhaps be employed for a generation as areference and a textbook, and may serve as a scaffolding upon which moredetailed instruction may later be built, as the great tide of evolutionaryteaching flows on.Secondly, to express that which is subjective in comprehensible terms, and topoint out the next step forward in the understanding of the true psychology. Itis an elucidation of the relation existing between Spirit and Matter, whichrelation demonstrates as consciousness . It will be found that the Treatisedeals primarily with the aspect of mind, with consciousness and with the higherpsychology, and less with matter as we know of it on the physical plane. Thedanger involved in giving out information concerning the various energies ofatomic matter is too great, and the race as yet too selfish to be entrusted withthese potencies. Man is already, through the able work of the scientists,discovering the needed knowledge with adequate rapidity. The emphasis in thisbook will be found to be laid upon those forces which are responsible for theobjective manifestation of a solar Logos and of man, and only in the firstsection will indication be given as to the nature of those energies which arestrictly confined to the physical plane.Thirdly, to show the coherent development of all that is found within a solarsystem; to demonstrate that everything which exists evolves (from the lowestform of life at the densest point of concretion up to the highest and mosttenuous manifestation) and that all forms are but the expression of a stupendousand divine Existence. This expression is caused by the blending of two divineaspects through the influence of a third, and produces the manifestation whichwe call a form, starting it upon its [xiii] evolutionary cycle in time andspace. Thus is form brought to the point where it is an adequate medium for thedemonstration of the nature of that which we call God.Fourthly, to give practical information anent those focal points of energy whichare found in the etheric bodies of the solar Logos, the macrocosm , and of man,the microcosm . As the etheric substratum which is the true substance underlyingevery tangible form is understood, certain great revolutions will be broughtabout in the domains of science, of medicine and of chemistry. The study ofmedicine, for instance, will eventually be taken up from a new angle, and itspractice will be built upon a comprehension of the laws of radiation, ofmagnetic currents, and of the force centres found in men’s bodies and theirrelationship to the force centres and currents of the solar system.Fifthly, to give some information, hitherto not exoterically imparted as to theplace and work of those myriads of sentient lives who form the essence ofobjectivity; to indicate the nature of those Hierarchies of Existences who formout of their own substance all that is seen and known, and who are themselvesFire and the cause of all the heat, warmth, life and motion in the universe. Inthis way the action of Fire on Water, of Heat in Matter, whether macrocosmicallyor microcosmically considered, will be touched upon and some light thrown uponthe Law of Cause and Effect (the Law of Karma) and its significance in the solarsystem.To sum up the matter, the teaching in this book should tend to an expansion ofconscionsness, and should bring about a recognition of the adequacy, as aworking basis, for both science and religion, of that interpretation of theprocesses of nature which has been formulated for us by the Master Minds of alltime. It should tend to bring about a reaction in favor of a system ofphilosophy which will link both Spirit and matter, and demonstrate the essentialunity of the scientific and religious idea. The two are at present somewhatdivorced, and we are only just beginning to grope our intellectual way out ofthe depths of a materialistic interpretation. It must not be forgotten, however,that under the Law of Action and Reaction, the long period of materialisticthought has been a necessary one for humanity, because the mysticism of theMiddle Ages has led [xiv] us too far in the opposite direction. We are nowtending to a more balanced view, and it is hoped that this treatise may formpart of the process through which equilibrium is attained.In studying this treatise the student is asked to bear in mind certain things:a. That in dealing with these subjects we are concerned with the essence of thatwhich is objective, with the subjective side of manifestation, and with theconsideration of force and of energy. It is well nigh impossible to reduce suchconcepts to concrete formulas and to express them in such a way that they can beeasily apprehended by the average man.b. That as we use words and phrases and speak in terms of modern language thewhole subject necessarily becomes limited and dwarfed, and much of the truth isthereby lost.c. That all that is in this treatise is offered in no dogmatic spirit but simplyas a contribution to the mass of thought upon the subject of world origins andto the data already accumulated as to the nature of man. The best that man canoffer as a solution of the world problem must perforce take a dual form and willdemonstrate through a life of active service, tending to amelioration ofenvironal conditions, and through a formulation of some cosmological scheme orplan which will seek to account as much as may be for conditions as they areseen to exist. Arguing as men do at present from the basis of the known and thedemonstrated and leaving untouched and unaccounted for, those deep-seated causeswhich must be presumed to be producing the seen and known, all solutions as yetfail and will continue to fail in their objective.d. That all attempts to formulate in words that which must be felt and lived inorder to be truly comprehended must necessarily prove distressingly inadequate.All that can be said will be after all but the partial statements of the greatveiled Truth, and must be offered to the reader and student as simply providinga working hypothesis, and a suggestive explanation. To the open-minded studentand the man who keeps the recollection in his mind that the truth isprogressively revealed, it will be apparent that the fullest expression of thetruth possible at any one time will be seen later to be but a fragment of awhole, and [xv] later still be recognised to be only portions of a fact and thusin itself a distortion of the real .This treatise is put out in the hope that it may prove useful to allbroad-minded seekers after truth and of value to all investigators into thesubjective Source of all that which is tangibly objective. It aims to provide areasonably logical plan of systemic evolution and to indicate to man the part hemust play as an atomic unit in a great and corporate Whole. This fragment of theSecret Doctrine, in the turning of the evolutionary wheel, goes out to the worldmaking no claims as to its source, its infallibility or the correctness indetail of its statements.No book gains anything from dogmatic claims or declarations as to theauthoritative value of its source of inspiration. It should stand or fall solelyon the basis of its own intrinsic worth, on the value of the suggestions made,and its power to foster the spiritual life and the intellectual apprehension ofthe reader. If this treatise has within it anything of truth and of reality, itwill inevitably and unfailingly do its work, carry its message, and thus reachthe hearts and minds of searchers everywhere. If it is of no value, and has nobasis in fact, it will disappear and die, and most rightly so. All that is askedfrom the student of this treatise is a sympathetic approach, a willingness toconsider the views put forth and that honesty and sincerity of thought whichwill tend to the development of the intuition, of spiritual diagnosis, and adiscrimination which will lead to a rejection of the false and an appreciationof the true.The words of the Buddha most appropriately have their place here, and make afitting conclusion to these preliminary remarks:THE LORD BUDDHA HAS SAID“that we must not believe in a thing said merely because it is said; nortraditions because they have been handed down from antiquity; nor rumours, assuch; nor writings by sages, because sages wrote them; nor fancies that we maysuspect to have been inspired in us by a Deva (that is, in presumed spiritualinspiration); nor from inferences drawn from some haphazard assumption we mayhave made; nor [xvi] because of what seems an analogical necessity; nor on themere authority of our teachers or masters. But we are to believe when thewriting, doctrine, or saying is corroborated by our own reason andconsciousness. ‘’For this,” says he in concluding, “I taught you not to believemerely because you have heard, but when you believed of your consciousness, thento act accordingly and abundantly.”—Secret Doctrine III. 401.May this be the attitude of every reader of this “Treatise on Cosmic Fire.’’ALICE A. BAILEY.Note:—In the footnotes throughout this treatise ‘’The Secret Doctrine” by H. P.Blavatsky is designated by the initials S.D.

The total lack of a widerconsciousness than the individual and the personal, acts as a bar to the truecomprehension of things macrocosmic, but if the occult method is adhered to, ifthe Law of Correspondences is studied, and if we ever reason upward from themicrocosm to the greater Whole, then glimpses will be caught of vast realms ofrealisation and vistas of spiritual unfoldment will open up before us, undreamtof hitherto.CHARTSI.

These postulates are simply extensions of thethree fundamentals to be found in the Proem in the first volume of the SecretDoctrine (p 42-44) by H. P. Blavatsky. Students are recommended to study themcarefully; in this way their understanding of the Treatise will be greatlyaided.I. There is one Boundless Immutable Principle; one Absolute Reality which,antecedes all manifested conditioned Being. It is beyond the range and reach ofany human thought or expression.The manifested Universe is contained within this Absolute Reality and is aconditioned symbol of it.In the totality of this manifested Universe, three aspects are to be conceived.1. The First Cosmic Logos, impersonal and unmanifested, the precursor of theManifested.2. The Second Cosmic Logos, Spirit-Matter, Life, the Spirit of the Universe.3. The Third Cosmic Logos, Cosmic Ideation, the Universal World-Soul.From these basic creative principles, in successive gradations there issue inordered sequence the numberless Universes comprising countless Manifesting Starsand Solar Systems.Each Solar System is the manifestation of the energy and life of a great CosmicExistence, Whom we call, for lack of a better term, a Solar Logos.[4] This Solar Logos incarnates, or comes into manifestation, through the mediumof a solar system.This solar system is the body, or form, of this cosmic Life, and is itselftriple.This triple solar system can be described in terms of three aspects, or (as theChristian theology puts it) in terms of three Persons.ELECTRIC FIRE, or SPIRIT.1st Person . . . Father. Life. Will. Purpose. Positive energy.SOLAR FIRE, or SOUL.2nd Person . . . Son. Consciousness. Love-Wisdom. Equilibrised energy.FIRE BY FRICTION, or Body, or Matter.3rd Person . . . Holy Spirit. Form. Active Intelligence. Negative energy.Each of these three is also triple in manifestation, making thereforea. The nine Potencies or Emanations.b. The nine Sephiroth.c. The nine Causes of Initiation.These, with the totality of manifestation or the Whole, produce the ten (10) ofperfect manifestation of the perfect MAN.These three aspects of the Whole are present in every form.a. The solar system is triple, manifesting through the three above mentioned.b. A human being is equally triple, manifesting as Spirit, Soul and Body, orMonad, Ego and Personality.c. The atom of the scientist is also triple, being composed of a positivenucleus, the negative electrons, and the totality of the outer manifestation,[5] the result of the relation of the other two.The three aspects of every form are inter-related and susceptible ofintercourse, becausea. Energy is in motion and circulates.b. All forms in the solar system form part of the Whole, and are not isolatedunits.c. This is the basis of brotherhood, of the communion of saints, and ofastrology.These three aspects of God, the solar Logos, and the Central Energy or Force(for the terms are occultly synonymous) demonstrate through seven centres offorce,—three major centres and four minor. These seven centres of logoic Forceare themselves so constituted that they form corporate Entities. They are knownasa. The seven planetary Logoi.b. The seven Spirits before the Throne.c. The seven Rays.d. The seven Heavenly Men.The Seven Logoi embody seven types of differentiated force, and in this Treatiseare known under the names of Lords of the Rays. The names of the Rays areRay I Ray of Will or Power 1st Aspect Ray II Ray of Love-Wisdom 2nd Aspect RayIII Ray of Active Intelligence 3rd AspectThese are the major Rays.Ray IV Ray of Harmony, Beauty and Art. Ray V Ray of Concrete Knowledge orScience. Ray V Ray of Devotion or of Abstract Idealism. Ray VII Ray ofCeremonial Magic or Order.II. There is a basic law called the Law of Periodicity .1. This law governs all manifestation, whether it is the manifestation of asolar Logos through the [6] medium of a solar system, or the manifestation of ahuman being through the medium of a form. This law controls likewise in all thekingdoms of nature.2. There are certain other laws in the system which are linked with this one;some of them are as follows:a. The Law of Economy the law governing matter, the third aspect. b. The Law ofAttraction the law governing soul, the second aspect. c. The Law of Synthesisthe law governing spirit, or the first aspect.3. These three are cosmic laws. There are seven systemic laws, which govern themanifestation of our solar Logos:a. The Law of Vibration.b. The Law of Cohesion.c. The Law of Disintegration.d. The Law of Magnetic Control.e. The Law of Fixation.f. The Law of Love.g. The Law of Sacrifice and Death.4. Each of these Laws manifests primarily on one or other of the seven planes ofthe solar system.5. Each law sweeps periodically into power and each plane has its period ofmanifestation and its period of obscuration.6. Every manifested life has its three great cycles: [7]Birth Life Death. Appearance growth disappearance. Involution evolutionobscuration. Inert motion activity rhythmic motion. Tamasic life rajasic lifesattvic life.7. Knowledge of the cycles involves knowledge of number, sound and colour.8. Full knowledge of the mystery of the cycles is the possession only of theperfected adept.III. All souls are identical with the Oversoul .1. The Logos of the solar system is the Macrocosm. Man is the Microcosm.2. Soul is an aspect of every form of life from a Logos to an atom.3. This relationship between all souls and the Oversoul constitutes the basisfor the scientific belief in Brotherhood. Brotherhood is a fact in nature, notan ideal.4. The Law of Correspondences will explain the details of this relationship.This Law of Correspondences or of Analogy is the interpretive law of the system,and explains God to man.5. Just as God is the Macrocosm for all the kingdoms in Nature, so man is theMacrocosm for all the sub-human kingdoms.6. The goal for the evolution of the atom is self-consciousness as exemplifiedin the human kingdom.The goal for the evolution of man is group consciousness, as exemplified by aplanetary Logos. (Ancient of Days. Daniel VII, pp.13, 22.)The goal for the planetary Logos is God consciousness, as exemplified by thesolar Logos.7. The solar Logos is the sum-total of all the states of consciousness withinthe solar system.

When the lower pointvibrates, when the sacred triangle glows, when the point, the middle center, andthe apex, connect and circulate the Fire, when the threefold apex likewiseburns, then the two triangles—the greater and the lesser—merge into one flame,which burneth up the whole.STANZA II[12] “AUM,” said the Mighty One, and sounded forth the Word. The sevenfold wavesof matter resolved themselves, and varied forms appeared. Each took its place,each in the sphere ordained. They waited for the sacred flood to enter and tofill.The Builders responded to the sacred sound. In musical collaboration theyattended to the work. They built in many spheres, beginning with the third. Uponthis plane their work commenced. They built the sheath of atma and strung it toits Primary.“AUM,” said the Mighty One. “Let now the work proceed. Let the Builders of theair continue with the plan.”The Deva-Lord and Builders upon the plane of air worked with the forms withinthat sphere which is reckoned mainly theirs. They wrought for union, each in hisgroup assigned. The moulds grew fast beneath their hands.The sacred plane of juncture, the fourth great plane, became the sphere withinthe greater circle which marked the goal for man.“AUM,” said the Mighty One, He breathed forth to the fifth, the plane which isthe burning-ground, the meeting place for fire. This time a cosmic note is heardbeneath the sound systemic. The fire within, the fire without, meet with thefire ascending. The guardians of the cosmic fire, the devas of fohatic heat,watched o’er the forms that formless stood, waiting a point in time.[13] The builders of a lesser grade, devas who work with matter, wrought at theforms. They stood in fourfold order. Upon the threefold levels in empty silencestood the forms. They vibrated, they responded to the key, yet useless stood anduninhabited.“AUM,” said the Mighty One, “let the waters too bring forth.” The builders ofthe watery sphere, the denizens of moisture, produced the forms that move withinthe kingdom of Varuna. They grew and multiplied. In constant flux they swayed.Each ebb of cosmic motion increased the endless flow. The ripple of the formswas seen.“AUM,” said the Mighty One, “let the Builders deal with matter.” The moltensolidified. The solid forms were built. The crust cooled. The rocks congealed.The builders wrought in tumult to produce the forms of maya. When the rockystrata were completed the work stood in completion. The builders of the lowestgrade announced the work was finished.Forth from the rocky strata emerged the covering next. The builders of thesecond agreed the work was done. The first and second on the upward way stoodforth in fourfold form. The inner five was somewhat seen by those whose sightwas keen.“AUM,” said the Mighty One, and gathered in His Breath. The spark within thepeopling third impelled to further growth. The builders of the lowest forms,manipulating densest maya, merged their production with the forms built by thewatery ones. Matter and water merged produced the third in time. Ascension thusprogressed. The builders worked in union. They called the guardians of the fieryzone. [14] Matter and water mixed with fire, the inner spark within the formwere blended all together.The Mighty One looked down. The forms met His approval. Forth came the cry forfurther light. Again He gathered in the sound. He drew to higher levels thefeeble spark of light. Another tone was heard, the sound of cosmic fire, hid inthe Sons of Manas. They called to their Primaries. The lower four, the higherthree, and the cosmic fifth met at the great inbreathing. Another sheath wasformed.STANZA III[15] The great Wheel turned upon itself. The seven lesser wheels rushed intobeing. They revolve like their Mother, around, within and forward. All thatexisteth was.The wheels were diverse, and in unification, one. As evolved the great Wheel,the inner fire burst forth. It touched into life wheel the first. It circulated.A million fires rose up. The quality of matter densified, but form was not. TheSons of God arose, scanned the depth of Flame, took from its heart the sacredStone of Fire, and proceeded to the next.In turning next the Great Wheel launched the second. Again the flame burstforth, took to its heart the Stone and proceeded in revolution. The Sons of Godagain arose, and sought within the flame. “The form sufficeth not,” they said,“remove from without the fire.”Faster revolved the greater Wheel, blue white emerged the flame. The Sons of Godagain came down and a lesser wheel revolved. Seven times the revolution, andseven times great the heat. More solid grew the formless mass, and deeper sankthe Stone. To the heart of inmost fire the sacred Stone went down. This time thework was better done, and the product more perfected. At the seventh revolution,the third wheel rendered back the Stone. Triple the form, rosy the light, andsevenfold the eternal principle.[16] From out the greater Wheel, down from the vault of heaven, came into lightthe lesser wheel that counted as the fourth. The eternal Lhas looked down, andthe Sons of God reached forth. Down to the inmost point of death They flung thesacred Stone. The plaudits of the Chohans rose. The work had turned a point.From the pit of outer darkness, They gathered forth the Stone, translucent nowand unalloyed, of colour rose and blue.The turning of the fifth wheel and its action on the Stone rendered it stillmore fit. Yellow the blending tint, orange the inner fire, till yellow, rose andblue mingled their subtle tones. The four wheels with the greater worked thusupon the Stone till all the Sons of God acclaimed, and said: “The work is done.”STANZA IV[17] In revolution fifth of the great Wheel the period set was reached. Thelesser wheel, that responded to that fifth great turn, passed through the cycleand entered into peace.The lesser wheels come forth and likewise do their work. The great Wheel gathersback the emanating sparks. The Five dealt with the work, the lesser two butwrought with detail. The Stone had gathered fire, lambent with flame it shone.The outer sheath met not the need till the sixth wheel and the seventh hadpassed it through their fires.The Sons of God emerged from out their source, gazed on the sevenfold work, andstated it was good. The Stone was set alone. In dual revolution moved thegreater Wheel. The fourth Lord of the greater Twelve handled the work ofsevenfold fire. “It is not fit,” He said, “merge thou this Stone within thewheel which started revolution.”The lords of the greater seven plunged the Stone within the moving wheel. Thelords of the greater fifth and sixth likewise plunged their Stone.Within the fire, deep at the inmost sphere, as whirled through space the greaterWheel, bearing the lesser seven, the two were fused. The fourth, the fifth, thesixth blended, merged and intermingled.The aeon closed, the work was done. The stars stood still. The eternal Onescried to inmost heaven: “Display the work. Draw forth the Stones.” And lo, theStones were one.STANZA V[18] The moment manvantaric, for which had waited all the Triads, the hour thatmarked the solemn point of juncture, arrived within the scope of time, and lo,the work was done.The hour for which the seven groups purushic, each vibrant to the sounding ofthe Word, seeking the adding of the power, had waited for millennia, passed in aflash of time, and lo, the work was done.The First Degree in mighty acclamation deeming the hour propitious, sounded thetriple note in threefold reverberation. The echo reached the goal. They threetimes sent it forth. Restless the sphere of blue felt the vibration andanswering, roused herself and hastened to the call.The Second, with wise insistence, hearing the First sound forth, knowing thehour had likewise come, echoed the sound or note quadruple. This fourfoldreverberation circled the gamut of the spheres. Again it was sent forth. Threetimes the note was sounded, pealing across the heavens. At the third intoningcame the answer to the call. Vibrant as a key attuned, the eternal Primaryreplied. The blue to the dense one answered and responded to the need.Quivering the sphere heard the third take up the note, pealing it forth, afull-toned chord smote on the ears of the Watchers of the Flame.The Lords of Flame arose and prepared Themselves. It was decision’s hour. Theseven Lords of the seven spheres watched breathless the result. The [19] greatLord of sphere the fourth awaited the oncoming.The lower was prepared. The upper was resigned. The great Five waited for thepoint of equidistant merging. The foundation note ascended. Deep answered untodeep. The fivefold chord awaited the response from Those Whose hour had come.Dark grew the space between the spheres. Radiant two balls became. The threefoldthirty-five, finding the distance just, flashed like a sheet of intermittentflame, and lo, the work was done. The great Five met the Three and Four. Thepoint intermediate was achieved. The hour of sacrifice, the sacrifice of Flame,arrived, and for aeons hath endured. The timeless Ones entered into time. TheWatchers began Their task, and lo, the work proceeds.STANZA VI[20] Within the cavern dark the fourfold one groped for expansion and forfurther light. No light above, and all around the gloom enveloped. Pitchy thedarkness that surrounded it. To the innermost centre of the heart, throbbingwithout the Warming Light, crept in the icy cold of uttermost darkness.Above the cavern dark shone all the light of day; yet the fourfold one saw itnot, nor did the light pervade.The rending of the cavern precedes the light of day. Great, then, must be theshattering. No help is found within the cave, nor any hidden light. Around thefourfold one lieth the vault of stone; beneath him menaceth the root ofblackness, of utter denseness; beside him and above, naught but the same isseen.The threefold Watchers know and see. The fourfold is now ready; the work ofdenseness is completed; the vehicle prepared.Soundeth the trump of shattering. Blinding the power of the oncoming flame. Themystic earthquake rocks the cavern; the burning Flames disintegrate the maya,and lo, the work is done.Gone is the gloom and the blackness; rent is the cavern’s roof. The light oflife shines in; the warmth inspires. The Lords on-looking see the work commence.The fourfold one becomes the seven. The [21] chant of those who flame rises toall creation. The moment of achievement is attained.Proceedeth the work anew. Creation moveth on its way, while waxeth the lightwithin the cavern.STANZA VII[22] Riseth the cave of beauty rare, of colour iridescent. Shineth the wallswith azure tint, bathed in the light of rose. The blending shade of blueirradiates the whole and all is merged in gleaming.Within the cave of iridescent colour, within its arching circle, standeth thefivefold One demanding further light. He struggleth for expansion, he wrestlethtowards the day. The Five demand the greater Sixth and Seventh. The surroundingbeauty meeteth not the need. The inner warmth sufficeth but to feed the urge forFIRE.The Lords of Flame look on; they chant aloud: “The time is come, that time forwhich We wait. Let the Flame become the FIRE and let the light shine forth.”The effort of the Flame within the crystal cave becometh ever greater. The crygoes forth for other aid from other Flaming Souls. The response comes.The Lord of Flame, the Ancient One, the Mighty Lord of Fire, the Point of Bluewithin the hidden diamond, the Youth of Timeless Aeons, assisteth in the work.The inner burning light and the outer waiting fire,—together with the ROD,—meeton the sphere of crystal, and lo, the work is done. The crystal rends andquivers.Seven times the work proceeds. Seven the efforts made. Seven the applications ofthe Rod, held by a Lord of Flame. Three are the lesser touches; four [23] thedivine assistance. At the final fourth the work is done and the whole cavedisrupts. The lighted flame within spreads through the rending walls. Itmounteth to its Source. Another fire is merged; another point of blue findethits place within the diadem logoic.STANZA VIII[24] The greater Three, each with their seven lesser wheels, in spiralevolution, rotate within the timeless Now, and move as one. The cosmic Lordsfrom Their high place, view the past, control the Now, and ponder on the Day bewith us.The Lhas of the eternal Sound, the product of the time that was, surmount thesevenfold display. Within the Ring-pass-not the Word of Love sounds forth.The sevenfold Lords proceed with just vibration to carry out the work. Theysound forth each a note of the deep logoic chord. Each to His greater Lord makesrecord due. In the solemn breathing forth the forms are built, the colour justapportioned, and the flame within reveals itself with ever growing light.Blue to the green is added and completion quick is seen. The vibration of thethird is added to the one. Blue to the orange blends, and in their wiseadmixture is seen the stable scheme. To the yellow and the red, to the purpleand the ultimate is the vibration of the seventh adjusted as the Primary.Each of the seven Lords, within Their seven schemes, adjusted to the secondkarmic circle, merge [25] Their migrating spheres and blend Their myriad atoms.The forms through which They work, the lesser million spheres, the cause ofseparation and the curse of the Asuras, shatter when sounds the Sacred Wordwithin a point in time.The life logoic surges out. The streams of colour melt together. The forms areleft behind, and Parabrahm stands complete. The Lord of the cosmic Third uttersa Word unknown. The sevenfold lesser Word forms part of the vaster chord.The Now becomes the time that was. The aeon mergeth into space. The Word ofMotion hath been heard. The Word of Love succeedeth. The Past controlled theform. The Now evolves the life. The Day that is to be sounds forth the Word ofPower.The form perfected and the life evolved hold the third secret of the greaterWheel. It is the hidden mystery of living motion. The mystery, lost in the Nowbut known to the Lord of Cosmic Will.STANZA IX[26] The thirty thousand million Watchers refused to heed the call. “We enternot the forms,” they said, “until the seventh aeon.” The twice thirty thousandmillion hearkened to the call and took the forms designed.The rebellious ones laughed within themselves, and sought pralayic peace untilthe seventh aeon. But the seven great Lords called to the greater Chohans, andwith the eternal Lhas of the third cosmic heaven entered into debate.The dictum then went forth. The laggards in the highest sphere heard it echothrough the scheme. “Not till the seventh aeon, but at the fourteenth seventhwill the chance again come round. The first shall be the last and time be lostfor aeons.”The obedient Sons of Mind connected with the Sons of Heart, and evolutionspiralled on its way. The Sons of Power stayed in their appointed place, thoughcosmic karma forced a handful to join the Sons of Heart.At the fourteenth seventh aeon, the Sons of Mind and Heart, absorbed by endlessflame, will join the Sons of Will, in manvantaric manifestation. Three times thewheel will turn.At the centre stand the buddhas of activity, helped by the lords of love, andfollowing their twofold work will come the radiant lords of power.The buddhas of creation from out the past have [27] come. The buddhas of loveare gathering now. The buddhas of will at the final turn of the third majorwheel will flash into being. The end will then be consummated.STANZA X[28] The Fifth progresseth and from the remnants of the Fourth multiplied andreproduced. The waters arose. All sank and was submerged. The sacred remnant, inthe place appointed, emerged at later date from out the zone of safety.The waters dissipated. The solid ground emerged in certain destined places. TheFifth o’er-ran the Sacred Land, and in their fivefold groups developed the lowerFifth.They passed from stage to stage. The watching Lords, recognising the rupasformed, gave a sign to the circulating Fourth and it speeded faster on its way.When the lesser Fifth had midway passed and all the lesser four were peoplingthe land, the Lords of Dark Intent arose. They said: “Not so shall go the force.The forms and rupas of the third and fourth, within the corresponding Fifth,approach too close the archetype. The work is far too good.”They constructed other forms. They called for cosmic fire. The seven deep pitsof hell belched forth the animating shades. The incoming seventh reduced toorder all the forms,—the white, the dark, the red, and shaded brown.The period of destruction extended far on either hand. The work was sadlymarred. The Chohans of the highest plane gazed in silence on the work. TheAsuras and the Chaitans, the Sons of Cosmic Evil, and the Rishis of the darkestconstellations, [29] gathered their lesser hosts, the darkest spawn of hell.They darkened all the space.* * * * *From the coming of the heaven-sent One peace passed upon the earth. The planetstaggered and belched forth fire. Part rose. Part fell. The form was changed.Millions took other forms or ascended to the appointed place of waiting. Theytarried till the hour of progress should again sound forth for them.* * * * *The early Third produced the monsters, great beasts and evil forms. They prowledupon the surface of the sphere.The watery Fourth produced within the watery sphere, reptiles and spawn of evilfame, the product of their karma. The waters came and swept away the progenitorsof the fluidic spawn.The separating Fifth built in the rupa sphere the concrete forms of thought.They cast them forth. They peopled the lower four, and like a black and evilcloud shut out the light of day. The higher three were hid.* * * * *The war upon the planet had been waged. Both sides descended into hell. Thencame the Conqueror of form. He drew on the Sacred Fire, and purified the rupalevels. The fire destroyed the lands in the days of the lesser Sixth.When the Sixth appeared the land was changed. The surface of the globe circledthrough another cycle. Men of the higher Fifth mastered the lower [30] three.The work was shifted to the plane whereon the Pilgrim stood. The lesser trianglewithin the lower auric egg became the centre of cosmic dissonance.STANZA XI[31] The wheel of life turns within the wheel of outer form.The matter of Fohat circulateth, and its fire hardeneth all the forms. The wheelthat is not glimpsed moveth in rapid revolution within the slower outer case,till it weareth out the form.The forty-nine fires burn at the inner centre. The thirty-five circulating fieryvortices extend along the circle of the periphery. Between the two passeth inordered sequence the various coloured flames.The great Triangles in their just arrangement hold hid the secret of the wheelof life. The cosmic fire radiates as directed from the second sphere, controlledby the Ruler of the merging ray. The cohorts of the third encircling sphere invaried ranks mark out the lesser threes.The wheel of life still moves within the form. The devas of the fourth connectthe thirty-five, and blend them with the central forty-nine. Above they work,seeking to merge the whole. Upward they strive, who in their myriad formsrevolve within the wheels of lesser magnitude. The whole is one, yet on thelower spheres only the forms appear. They seem in their divisions more than canbe grasped or met.The many circulate. The forms are built, become too firm, are broken by thelife, and circulate again. The few revolve, holding the many in the heat ofmotion. The one embraces all, and carries all from great activity into the heartof cosmic peace.STANZA XII[32] The Blessed Ones hide Their threefold nature but reveal Their tripleessence by means of the three great groups of atoms. Three are the atoms andthreefold the radiation.The inner core of Fire hides itself and is known only through radiation and thatwhich radiates. Only after the blaze dies out and the heat is no longer felt canthe fire be known.STANZA XIII[33] Through the band of violet that encircleth the Heavens passeth the globe ofpurple dark. It passeth and returneth not. It becometh enrapt in the blue. Threetimes the blue enfoldeth, and when the cycle is completed the purple fadeth andis merged into the rose, and the path again is traversed.Three the great colours in the cycle that counteth as the fourth, violet, blueand rose, with the basic purple in revolution.Four are the colours secondary in the cycle of discrimination in which therevolution taketh place. It is circled to the midmost point and somewhat passed.Yellow the band that cometh, orange the cloud that hideth, and green forvivification. Yet the time is not yet.Many the circling fires; many the revolving rounds, but only when thecomplementary colours recognise their source, and the whole adjusteth itself tothe seven will be seen completion. Then will be seen each colour in adjustmentright, and the cessation of revolution."},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE. THE INTERNAL FIRES - FIRE BY FRICTIONINTRODUCTORY REMARKSI. Fire in the Macrocosm.II. Fire in the Microcosm.III. Fire in manifestation.[37] We purpose in these few introductory remarks to lay down the foundation fora ‘Treatise on Cosmic Fire,’ and to consider the subject of fire bothmacrocosmically and microcosmically, thus dealing with it from the standpoint ofthe solar system, and of a human being. This will necessitate some preliminarytechnicalities which may seem at first perusal to be somewhat abstruse andcomplicated but which, when meditated upon and studied, may eventually proveilluminating and of an elucidating nature, and which also, when the mind hasfamiliarised itself with some of the details, may come to be regarded asproviding a logical hypothesis concerning the nature and origin of energy. Wehave elsewhere, in an earlier book, touched somewhat upon this matter, but wedesire to recapitulate and in so doing to enlarge, thus laying down a broadfoundation upon which the subject matter can be built up, and providing ageneral outline which will serve to show the limits of our discussion.Let us, therefore, look at the subject macrocosmically and then trace thecorrespondence in the microcosm, or human being.I. FIRE IN THE MACROCOSMIn its essential nature Fire is threefold, but when in manifestation it can beseen as a fivefold demonstration, and be defined as follows: [38]1. Fire by friction , or internal vitalising fire. These fires animate andvitalise the objective solar system. They are the sumtotal of logoic kundalini,when in full systemic activity.2. Solar Fire , or cosmic mental fire. This is that portion of the cosmic mentalplane which goes to the animation of the mental body of the Logos. This fire maybe regarded as the sumtotal of the sparks of mind, the fires of the mentalbodies and the animating principle of the evolving units of the human race inthe three worlds.3. Electric Fire , or the logoic Flame Divine. This flame is the distinguishingmark of our Logos, and it is that which differentiates Him from all other Logoi;it is His dominant characteristic, and the sign of His place in cosmicevolution.This threefold fire may be expressed in ray terms as follows:First, we have the animating fires of the solar system, which are the fires ofthe primordial ray of active intelligent matter; these constitute the energy ofBrahma, the third aspect of the Logos. Next are to be found the fires of thedivine Ray of Love-Wisdom, the ray of intelligent love, which constitutes theenergy of the Vishnu aspect, the second aspect logoic. (4)[text00028.html#Y_FN4] Finally are to be found [39] the fires of the cosmicmental plane, which are the fires of the cosmic ray of will. They might bedescribed as the rays of intelligent will and are the manifestation of the firstaspect logoic, the Mahadeva aspect. (5) [text00028.html#Y_FN5] Therefore we havethree cosmic rays manifesting:The Ray of intelligent activity . This is a ray of a very demonstrable glory,and of a higher point of development than the other two, being the product of anearlier mahakalpa, or a previous solar system. (6) [text00028.html#Y_FN6] Itembodies [40] the basic vibration of this solar system, and is its greatinternal fire, animating and vitalising the whole, and penetrating from thecentre to the periphery. It is the cause of rotary motion, and therefore of thespheroidal form of all that exists.The Ray of intelligent love . This is the ray which embodies the highestvibration of which our solar Logos or Deity is capable in this present solarsystem. It is not yet vibrating adequately nor has it yet attained the peak ofits activity. It is the basis of the cyclic spiral movement of the body logoic,and just as the Law of Economy is the law governing the internal fires of thesystem so the cosmic Law of Attraction and Repulsion is the basic law of thisdivine Ray.The Ray of intelligent will . Little as yet can be said about this ray. It isthe ray of cosmic mind and in its evolution parallels that of cosmic love, butas yet its vibration is slower and its development more retarded. This isdefinitely and deliberately so, and is due to the underlying purpose and choiceof the solar Logos, Who seeks on His high level (just as do His reflections, thesons of men) to achieve a more rounded out development, [41] and He thereforeconcentrates on the development of cosmic love in this greater cycle.This ray is governed by the Law of Synthesis, and is the basis of the systemicmovement which may be best described as that of driving forward through space ,or forward progression. Little can be predicated anent this ray and itsexpression. It controls the movements of the entire ring-pass-not in connectionwith its cosmic centre. (7) [text00028.html#Y_FN7]The tabulation on page 42 may make the above ideas somewhat clearer.These three expressions of the divine Life may be regarded as expressing thetriple mode of manifestation. First, the objective or tangible universe; second,the subjective worlds or form; and thirdly, the spiritual aspect which is to befound at the heart of all. (8) [text00028.html#Y_FN8] The internal fires thatanimate and vitalise shew themselves in a twofold manner: [42]TABULATION I.Fire Ray Aspect Expression Law Quality 1. Internal Primordial IntelligentActivity Rotary motion Economy Fire by friction 2. Of Mind Love Intelligent LoveSpiral Cyclic motion Attraction Solar Fire. 3. Divine Flame Will IntelligentWill. Forward Progression Synthesis Electric Fire.[43] First as latent heat . This is the basis of rotary motion and the cause ofthe spheroidal coherent manifestation of all existence, from the logoic atom,the solar ring-pass-not, down to the minutest atom of the chemist or physicist.Second, as active heat . This results in the activity and the driving forward ofmaterial evolution. On the highest plane the combination of these three factors(active heat, latent heat and the primordial substance which they animate) isknown as the ‘sea of fire,’ of which akasha is the first differentiation ofpregenetic matter. Akasha, in manifestation, expresses itself as Fohat, ordivine Energy, and Fohat on the different planes is known as aether, air, fire,water, electricity, ether, prana and similar terms. (9) [text00028.html#Y_FN9] ,(10) [text00028.html#Y_FN10] , (11) [text00028.html#Y_FN11] It is the sumtotal[44] of that which is active, animated, or vitalized, and of all that concernsitself with the adaptation of the form to the needs of the inner flame of life.It might here be useful to point out that magnetism is the effect of the divineray in manifestation in the same sense that electricity is the manifested effectof the primordial ray of active intelligence. It would be well to ponder on thisfor it holds hid a mystery.The fires of the mental plane also demonstrate in a twofold manner:First, as the Fire of Mind , the basis of all expression and in one peculiaroccult sense the sumtotal of existence. It provides the relation between thelife and the form, between spirit and matter, and is the basis of consciousnessitself.Second, as the Elementals of Fire , or the sumtotal of the active expression ofthought, showing itself through the medium of those entities who, in their veryessence, are fire itself.These dualities of expression make the four necessary factors in the logoicquaternary, (12) [text00028.html#Y_FN12] or the lower nature of the Logosviewing His manifestation from one esoteric angle; exoterically, they are thesumtotal of the logoic quaternary, plus the logoic fifth principle, cosmic mind.The divine spark does not as yet manifest (as do the other two fires) as aduality, though what lies hidden in a later cycle, evolution alone willdisclose. This third fire, along with the other two, make the necessary five oflogoic evolutionary development and by its perfected merging with the other twofires as the evolutionary process proceeds is seen the goal of logoic attainmentfor this greater cycle or period of this solar system.[45] When the primordial ray of intelligent activity, the divine ray ofintelligent love, and the third cosmic ray of intelligent will meet, blend,merge, and blaze forth, the Logos will take His fifth initiation, thuscompleting one of His cycles. When the rotary, the forward, and the spiralcyclic movements are working in perfect synthesis then the desired vibrationwill have been reached. When the three Laws of Economy, of Attraction, and ofSynthesis work with perfect adjustment to each other, then nature will perfectlydisplay the needed functioning, and the correct adaptation of the material formto the indwelling spirit, of matter to life, and of consciousness to itsvehicle.II. FIRE IN THE MICROCOSMLet us briefly consider therefore the correspondence between the greater wholeand the unit man and then block out our subject in detail and consider thesections into which it will be wise to divide it.Fire in the Microcosm is likewise threefold in essence and fivefold inmanifestation.1. There is Internal Vitalising Fire , which is the correspondence to fire byfriction. This is the sumtotal of individual kundalini; it animates thecorporeal frame and demonstrates also in the twofold manner:First, as latent heat which is the basis of life of the spheroidal cell, oratom, and of its rotary adjustment to all other cells.Second, as active heat or prana; this animates all, and is the driving force ofthe evolving form. It shows itself in the four ethers and in the gaseous state,and a correspondence is here found on the physical plane in connection with manto the Akasha and its fivefold manifestation on the plane of the solar system.This fire is the basic vibration of the little system in which the monad orhuman spirit is the logos, and it [46] holds the personality or lower materialman in objective manifestation thus permitting the spiritual unit to contact theplane of densest matter. It has its correspondence in the ray of intelligentactivity and is controlled by the Law of Economy in one of its subdivisions, theLaw of Adaptation in Time.2. There is next the Fire or Spark of Mind which is the correspondence in man tosolar fire. This constitutes the thinking self-conscious unit or the soul. Thisfire of mind is governed by the Law of Attraction as is its greatercorrespondence. Later we can enlarge on this. It is this spark of mind in man,manifesting as spiral cyclic activity, which leads to expansion and to hiseventual return to the centre of his system, the Monad—the origin and goal forthe reincarnating Jiva or human being. As in the macrocosm this fire alsomanifests in a twofold manner.It shows as that intelligent will which links the Monad or spirit with itslowest point of contact, the personality, functioning through a physicalvehicle.It likewise demonstrates, as yet imperfectly, as the vitalising factor in thethought forms fabricated by the thinker. As yet but few thought forms,comparatively, can be said to be constructed by the center of consciousness, thethinker, the Ego. Few people as yet are in such close touch with their higherself, or Ego, that they can build the matter of the mental plane into a formwhich can be truly said to be an expression of the thoughts, purpose or desireof their Ego, functioning through the physical brain. Most of the thought formsat present in circulation may be said to be aggregations of matter, built intoform with the aid of kama-manas (or of desire faintly tinged with mind producingthus an admixture of astral and mental matter, mostly astral), and largely dueto reflex elemental action.These dualities of expression are: [47]1. Active fire or prana.Latent fire or bodily heat.2. Mental energy in the mental body.Purely mental thought forms, animated by self-engendered fire, or by the fifthprinciple, and therefore part of the sphere, or system of control, of the Monad.These form an esoteric quaternary which with the fifth factor, the divine sparkof intelligent will, make the five of monadic manifestation—manifestation inthis case connotating a purely subjective manifestation which is neitheraltogether spiritual nor altogether material.3. Finally there is the Monadic Flame Divine . This embodies the highestvibration of which the Monad is capable, is governed by the Law of Synthesis,and is the cause of the forward progressive movement of the evolving Jiva.We now come, in due course, to the point of merging or to the end ofmanifestation, and to the consummation (viewing it monadically) of the greatcycle or manvantara. What shall we therefore find? Just as in the macrocosm theblending of the three essential fires of the cosmos marked the point of logoicattainment, so, in the blending of the essential fires of the microcosm, do wearrive at the apotheosis of human attainment for this cycle.When the latent fire of the personality or lower self blends with the fire ofmind, that of the higher self, and finally merges with the Divine Flame, thenthe man takes the fifth Initiation in this solar system, and has completed oneof his greater cycles. (13) [text00028.html#Y_FN13] When the three blaze forthas one fire, liberation from matter, or from material form is achieved. Matterhas been correctly adjusted to spirit, and finally the indwelling life slipsforth out of its sheath which forms now only a channel for liberation.III. FIRE IN MANIFESTATION.[48] To continue our consideration of the fires which sustain the economy of thevisible solar system, and of the visible objective human being, which produceevolutionary development, and which are the bases of all objectiveefflorescence, it must be noted that they demonstrate as the sumtotal of thevital life of a solar system, of a planet, of the entire constitution of activefunctioning man upon the physical plane, and of the atom of substance.Speaking broadly we would say that the first fire deals entirely with:a. Activity of matter.b. The rotary motion of matter.c. The development of matter by the means of friction, under the law of Economy.H. P. B. touches on this in the Secret Doctrine . ( 14 [text00028.html#Y_FN14] )The second fire , that from the cosmic mental plane, deals with:a. The expression of the evolution of mind or manas.b. The vitality of the soul.c. The evolutionary expression of the soul as it shows forth in the form of thatelusive something which brings about the synthesis of matter. As the two mergeby means of this active energising factor, that which is termed consciousnessappears. (15) [text00028.html#Y_FN15] As [49] the merging proceeds and the firesbecome more and more synthesised, that totality of manifestation which we regardas a conscious existence becomes ever more perfected.d. The operation of this fire under the Law of Attraction.e. The subsequent result in the spiral-cyclic movement which we call, within thesystem, solar evolution, but which (from the standpoint of a cosmos) is theapproximation of our system to its central point. This must be considered fromthe standpoint of time. (16) [text00028.html#Y_FN16]The third fire deals with:a . The evolution of spirit.Practically nothing can at this stage be communicated anent this evolution. Thedevelopment of spirit can be only expressed as yet in terms of the evolution ofmatter, and only through the adequacy of the vehicle, and through thesuitability of the sheath, the body or form, can the point of [50] spiritualdevelopment reached in any way be appraised. A word of warning should here beinterpolated:—Just as it is not possible upon the physical plane for the physical vehiclefully to express the total point of development of the Ego or higher self, so itis not possible even for the Ego fully to sense and express the quality ofspirit. Hence the utter impossibility for human consciousness justly to appraisethe life of the spirit or Monad.b. The working of the flame divine under the Law of Synthesis—a generic termwhich will be seen eventually to include the other two laws as subdivisions.c . The subsequent result of forward progressive motion—a motion which isrotary, cyclic and progressive.The whole matter dealt with in this Treatise concerns the subjective essence ofthe solar system, not primarily either the objective or spiritual aspect. Itconcerns the Entities who indwell the form, who demonstrate as animating factorsthrough the medium of matter, and primarily through etheric matter; who areevolving a second faculty, the fire of mind, and who are essentially themselvespoints of fire, cast off through cosmic friction, produced by the turning of thecosmic wheel, swept into temporary limited manifestation and due eventually toreturn to their central cosmic centre. They will return plus the results ofevolutionary growth, and through assimilation they will have intensified theirfundamental nature, and be spiritual fire plus the fire manasic.The internal fire of matter is called in the Secret Doctrine “Fire by Friction.”It is an effect and not a cause. It is produced by the two fires of spirit andof mind (electric and solar fire) contacting each other through the medium ofmatter. This energy demonstrates in [51] matter itself as the internal fires ofthe sun, and of the planets and finds a reflection in the internal fires of man.Man is the Flame Divine and the fire of Mind brought into contact through themedium of substance or form. When evolution ends, the fire of matter is notcognisable. It persists only when the other two fires are associated, and itdoes not persist apart from substance itself.Let us now briefly recognise certain facts regarding fire in matter and let ustake them in order, leaving time to elucidate their significance. First we mightsay that the internal fire being both latent and active, shows itself as thesynthesis of the acknowledged fires of the system, and demonstrates, forinstance, as solar radiation and inner planetary combustion. This subject hasbeen somewhat covered by science, and is hidden in the mystery of physical planeelectricity, which is an expression of the active internal fires of the systemand of the planet just as inner combustion is an expression of the latentinternal fires. These latter fires are to be found in the interior of eachglobe, and are the basis of all objective physical life.Secondly, we might note that the internal fires are the basis of life in thelower three kingdoms of nature, and in the fourth or human kingdom in connectionwith the two lower vehicles. The Fire of Mind, when blended with the internalfires, is the basis of life in the fourth kingdom, and united they control(partially now and later entirely) the lower threefold man or the personality;this control lasts up to the time of the first Initiation.The fire of Spirit finally, when blended with the two other fires (whichblending commences in man at the first initiation), forms a basis of spirituallife or existence. As evolution proceeds in the fifth or spiritual kingdom,these three fires blaze forth simultaneously, producing perfected consciousness.This blaze results in the final [52] purification of matter and its consequentadequacy; at the close of manifestation it brings about eventually thedestruction of the form and its dissolution, and the termination of existence asunderstood on the lower planes. In terms of Buddhistic theology it producesannihilation; this involves, not loss of identity, but the cessation ofobjectivity and the escape of Spirit, plus mind, to its cosmic centre. It hasits analogy in the initiation at which the adept stands free from thelimitations of matter in the three worlds.The internal fires of the system, of the planet, and of man are threefold:1. Interior fire at the centre of the sphere, those inner furnaces which producewarmth. This is latent fire.2. Radiatory fire. This type of fire might be expressed in terms of physicalplane electricity, of light rays, and of etheric energy. This is active fire.3. Essential fire, or the fire elementals who are themselves the essence offire. They are mainly divided into two groups:a. Fire devas or evolutionary entities.b . Fire elementals or involutionary entities.Later we will elaborate on this when we consider the Fire of Mind and deal withthe nature of the thought elementals. All these elementals and devas are underthe control of the fire Lord, Agni. When considering Him and His kingdom thesubject can be taken up at greater length.We might here point out, however, that our first two statements concerning theinternal fires, express the effect that the fire entities have upon theirenvironment. Heat and radiation are other terms which might be applied in thissense. Each of these effects produces a [53] different class of phenomena.Latent fire causes the active growth of that in which it is embedded and causesthat upward pushing which brings into manifestation all that is found in thekingdoms of nature. Radiatory fire causes the continued growth of that which hasprogressed, under the influence of latent fire, to a point receptive of theradiatory. Let us tabulate it thus:Systemic or Macrocosmic : The solar Logos or The Grand Man of the Heavens.Latent or interior fire produces the internal heat which makes the solar systemproductive of all forms of life. It is the inherent warmth that causes allfertilisation, whether human, animal, or vegetable.Active or radiatory fire retains in life and causes the evolution of all thathas evolved into objectivity by means of latent fire.Planetary, or the Heavenly Men:What is laid down anent the system, as a whole, can be predicated of all planetswhich in their nature reflect the Sun, their elder brother.Human, or the Microcosmic Man:Human latent fire, the heat interior of the human frame causes production ofother forms of life, such as—1. The physical body cells.2. Organisms nourished by the latent heat.3. The reproduction of itself in other human forms, the basis of the sexfunction.Human radiatory, or active fire, is a factor as yet but little comprehended; itrelates to the health aura and to that radiation from the etheric which makes aman a healer, and able to transmit active heat.It is necessary to differentiate between this radiation from the etheric, whichis a radiation of prana, and magnetism, which is an emanation from a subtlerbody (usually the astral), and has to do with the manifestation of [54] theDivine Flame within the material sheaths. The Divine Flame is formed on thesecond plane, the monadic, and magnetism (which is a method of demonstratingradiatory fire) is therefore felt paramountly on the fourth and sixth planes, orthrough the buddhic and astral vehicles. These are, as we know, closely alliedto the second plane. This distinction is of importance and should be carefullyrecognised.Having, therefore, made the above statements, we can proceed to take up somewhatin greater detail the interior fires of the systems, microcosmic andmacrocosmic."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION A - THE INTERNAL FIRES OF THE SHEATHS.I. The three channels.II. Fire Elementals and devas.I. THE THREE CHANNELS FOR THE FIRE[55] From the very use of the term “sheath” it will be noted that we areconsidering those fires which manifest through the medium of thoseexternalities, of those veils of substance which hide and conceal the innerReality. We shall not here take up the subject of the sheaths on the higherplanes, but simply deal with the fires that animate the three lowervehicles,—the physical body in its two divisions (etheric and dense), theemotional or astral body, and the mental sheath. It is frequently overlooked bythe casual student that both the astral and the mental bodies are material, andjust as material in their own way, as is the dense physical body, and also thatthe substance of which they are composed is animated by a triple fire, as is thephysical.In the physical body we have the fires of the lower nature (the animal plane)centralised at the base of the spine. They are situated at a spot which standsin relation to the physical body as the physical sun to the solar system. Thiscentral point of heat radiates in all directions, using the spinal column as itsmain artery, but working in close connection with certain central ganglia,wherever located, and having a special association with the spleen. [56]CHART IChart I [Image00005.jpg][57] In the etheric body , which is an exact replica of its denser counterpart,we have the organ of active or radiatory fire, and, as is well known, thevehicle of prana. Its function is to store up the rays of radiatory light andheat which are secured from the sun, and to transmit them, via the spleen, toall parts of the physical body. Hence in the future it will come to berecognised that the spine and the spleen are of the utmost importance to thephysical well-being of man, and that when the spinal column is duly adjusted andaligned, and when the spleen is freed from congestion and in a healthycondition, there will be little trouble in the dense physical body. When thephysical furnace burns brightly and when the fuel of the body (pranic rays) isadequately assimilated, the human frame will function as desired.The subject of the blending of these two fires, which is complete in a normaland healthy person, should engross the attention of the modern physician. Hewill then concern himself with the removal of nerve congestion or materialcongestion, so as to leave a free channel for the inner warmth. This blending,which is now a natural and usual growth in every human being, was one of thesigns of attainment or of initiation in an earlier solar system. Just asinitiation and liberation are marked in this solar system by the blending of thefires of the body, of the mind and of the Spirit, so in an earlier cycleattainment was marked by the blending of the latent fires of matter with theradiatory or active fires, and then their union with the fires of mind. In theearlier period the effects in manifestation of the divine Flame were so remoteand deeply hidden as to be scarcely recognisable, though dimly there. Itscorrespondence can be seen in the animal kingdom, in which instinct holds theintuition in latency, [58] and the Spirit dimly overshadows. Yet all is part ofa divine whole.The subject of the radiatory heat of the macrocosmic and microcosmic systemswill be dealt with in detail in a later subdivision. Here we will only deal withthe latent interior fire of thea . Sun.b . Planet.c . Man.d. Atom.We must remember that in both the astral and the mental sheaths there exist thecounterparts of the centres as found in the physical body. These centres concernmatter and its evolution. One fundamental statement can be laid down anent theinternal fires of all these four (sun, planet, man, and atom):There exists in the Sun, in the planet, in man, and in the atom, a central pointof heat, or (if I might use so limiting and inappropriate a term) a centralcavern of fire, or nucleus of heat, and this central nucleus reaches the boundsof its sphere of influence, its ring-pass-not by means of a threefold channel.(17) [text00028.html#Y_FN17]a. The Sun. Within the sun, right at its very heart, is a sea of fire or heat,but not a sea of flame. Herein may lie a distinction that perhaps will convey nomeaning to some. It is the centre of the sphere, and the point of fiercestinternal burning, but has little relation to the flames or burning gases(whatever terms you care [59] to use) that are generally understood to existwhenever the sun is considered. It is the point of fiercest incandescence, andthe objective sphere of fire is but the manifestation of that internalcombustion. This central heat radiates its warmth to all parts of the system bymeans of a triple channel, or through its “Rays of Approach” which in theirtotality express to us the idea of “the heat of the sun.”1. The akasha , itself vitalised matter, or substance animated by latent heat.2. Electricity , substance of one polarity, and energised by one of the threeaspects logoic. To express it more occultly, substance showing forth the qualityof the cosmic Lord Whose energy it is.3. Light Rays of pranic aspect , some of which are being now recognised by themodern scientist. They are but aspects of the latent heat of the sun as itapproaches the Earth by a particular line of least resistance.When the term “channel or ray of approach” is used, it means approach from thecentre of solar radiation to the periphery. What is encountered during thatapproach—such as planetary bodies, for instance—will be affected by the akashiccurrent, the electrical current, or the pranic current in some way, but all ofthese currents are only the internal fires of the system when viewed from someother point in universal, though not solar, space. It is, therefore, obviousthat this matter of fire is as complex as that of the rays. The internal firesof the solar system become external and radiatory when considered from thestandpoint of a planet, while the internal fires of the planet will affect ahuman being as radiation in exactly the same way as the pranic emanations of hisetheric body affect another physical body as radiatory. The point to be graspedin all these [60] aspects is that one and all have to do with matter orsubstance, and not with mind or Spirit.b. The Planet . Deep in the heart of the planet—such a planet as the Earth, forinstance—are the internal fires that occupy the central sphere, or the cavernswhich—filled with incandescent burning—make life upon the globe possible at all.The internal fires of the moon are practically burnt out, and, therefore, shedoes not shine save through reflection, having no inner fire to blend and mergewith light external. These inner fires of the earth can be seen functioning, asin the sun, through three main channels:1. Productive substance , or the matter of the planet vitalised by heat. Thisheat and matter together act as the mother of all that germinates, and as theprotector of all that dwells therein and thereon. This corresponds to theakasha, the active vitalised matter of the solar system, that nourishes all asdoes a mother.2. Electrical fluid , a fluid which is latent in the planet though as yet butlittle recognized. It is perhaps better expressed by the term “animalmagnetism.” It is the distinctive quality of the atmosphere of a planet, or itselectrical ring-pass-not. It is the opposite pole to the solar electrical fluid,and the contact of the two and their correct manipulation is the aim—perhapsunrealised—-of all scientific endeavor at this time.3. That emanation of the planet which we might term Planetary Prana . It is thatwhich is referred to when one speaks of the health-giving qualities of MotherNature, and which is back of the cry of the modern physician, when he wiselysays “Back to the Earth.” It is the fluidic emanation of this prana which actsupon the physical body, though in this case not via the etheric body. It isabsorbed [61] through the skin purely and the pores are its line of leastresistance.c. The Man. At the base of the spine lie hid the fires of the human system, orthe internal fires of the Microcosm. The centre is located there, and from itthe radiations go forth along the three channels, recognisable in the spine.1. Bodily warmth , the channel along which the heat radiates and which finds thegoal of its attention to be the heating of the corporeal frame. Thisvitalisation of the dense matter of the body finds its correspondence in thesystemic akasha, and in planetary productive substance.2. Nervous response . This is the vitalising tenuous fluid which applies itselfto the stimulation of the nervous centres, and which creates electrical responseto contact between the nerves and the brain. It should now be more closelystudied. It corresponds to systemic electricity, and to planetary electricity.3. Pranic emanation. The emanation, via the etheric body, which corresponds inman to solar prana and to planetary prana. This demonstrates principally in thehealth aura and has naught to do with magnetic qualities, as generallyinterpreted when considering a personality, or man as a unit. I make thisrepetition as it is very necessary that no mental confusion exists between thatmagnetism which is a spiritual emanation and that which is purely animal.It might be wise here to point out that this triple manifestation of firedemonstrates in the astral and mental bodies likewise, having to do with thesubstance of those bodies. We might express this fire in its triplemanifestation as the sumtotal of the essential fire, or life activity of thethird Logos. It should be carefully borne [62] in mind that the manifestation ofthe work of the three Logoi is the expression of the mind of some cosmic Entity.In the same way, the seven planetary Entities, the seven Heavenly Men, are sevenLogoi (likewise cosmic Beings) Who in Their totality form the Body of thethreefold Logos. We have, therefore:1. The undifferentiated Logos—a cosmic Entity.2. The Logos, threefold in manifestation:a. The cosmic Lord of Will Power.b. The cosmic Lord of Love and Wisdom.c. The cosmic Lord of Active Intelligence.3. The triple Logos, sevenfold in manifestation., i.e. The seven planetaryLogoi. (18) [text00028.html#Y_FN18] , (19) [text00028.html#Y_FN19] , (20)[text00028.html#Y_FN20][63] Each of these cosmic Entities is, in His essential essence, Fire ; eachmanifests as fire in a threefold manner. In point of time the cosmic Lord ofactive Intelligence, considered from the standpoint of cosmic evolution, is moreevolved than His two Brothers. He is the life of matter, its latent internalFire. His is the fire essence that lies at the heart of the Sun, of the planet,and of man’s material forms. He is the sumtotal of the Past.The Lord of Cosmic Love now seeks union with His Brother, and, in point of time,embodies all the Present. He is the sumtotal of all that is embodied; He isconscious Existence. He is the Son divine and His life and nature evolve throughevery existent form. The Lord of Cosmic Will holds hid the future within Hisplans and consciousness. They are all three the Sons of one Father, all threethe aspects of the One God, all three are Spirit, all three are Soul, and allthree are Rays emanating from one cosmic centre. All three are substance, but inthe past one Lord was the elder Son, in the present another Lord comes to thefore, and in the future still another. But this is so only in Time. From thestandpoint of the Eternal Now, none is greater nor less than another, for thelast shall be first, and the first last. Out of manifestation time is not, andfreed from objectivity states of consciousness are not.The fire of Spirit is the essential fire of the first Lord of Will plus the fireof the second Logos of Love. These two cosmic Entities blend, merge, anddemonstrate as Soul, utilising for purposes of manifestation the aid of thethird Logos. The three fires blend and merge. In this fourth round and on thisfourth globe of our planetary scheme, the fires of the third Logos ofintelligent matter are fusing somewhat with the fires of cosmic [64] mind,showing as will or power, and animating the Thinker on all planes. The object ofTheir co-operation is the perfected manifestation of the cosmic Lord of Love.This should be pondered upon for it reveals a mystery.The blending of the three fires, the merging of the three Rays, and theco-operation of the three Logoi have in view (at this time and within this solarsystem) the development of the Essence of the cosmic Lord of Love, the secondPerson in the logoic trinity. Earlier it was not so, later it will not be, butnow it is. When viewed from the cosmic mental plane these Three constitute thePERSONALITY OF THE LOGOS, and are seen functioning as one . Hence the secret(well recognised as fact, though not understood) of the excessive heat ,occultly expressed, of the astral or central body of the triple personality. Itanimates and controls the physical body, and its desires hold sway in themajority of cases; it demonstrates in time and space the correspondence of thetemporary union of spirit and matter, the fires of cosmic love and the fires ofmatter blended. A similar analogy is found in the heat apparent in this secondsolar system.d. The Atom . The inner fires of the atom can likewise be seen functioning alongsimilar lines, their demonstration being already somewhat recognised by science.This being so there exists no necessity for further elaboration. (21)[text00028.html#Y_FN21]II. FIRE ELEMENTALS AND DEVAS[65] We might now briefly consider the subject of the fire elementals and devas,and then deal with the relation of the Personality Ray to this internal fire ofthe system in its threefold manifestation.Certain facts are known in connection with the fire spirits (if so they may betermed). The fundamental fact that should here be emphasised is that AGNI, theLord of Fire, rules over all the fire elementals and devas on the three planesof human evolution, the physical, the astral, and the mental, and rules overthem not only on this planet, called the Earth, but on the three planes in allparts of the system. He is one of the seven Brothers (to use an expressionfamiliar to students of the Secret Doctrine ) Who each embody one of the sevenprinciples, or Who are in Themselves the seven centres in the body of the cosmicLord of Fire, called by H. P. B. “Fohat.” He is that active fiery Intelligence,Who is the basis of the internal fires of the solar system. On each plane one ofthese Brothers holds sway, and the three elder Brothers (for always the threewill be seen, and later the seven, who eventually merge into the primary three)rule on the first, third and the fifth planes, or on the plane of adi, of atma(22) [text00028.html#Y_FN22] and of manas. It is urgent that we here rememberthat They are fire viewed [66] in its third aspect, the fire of matter . InTheir totality these seven Lords form the essence of the cosmic Lord, called inthe occult books, Fohat. (23) [text00028.html#Y_FN23]This is so in the same sense as the seven Chohans, (24) [text00028.html#Y_FN24]with Their affiliated groups of pupils, form the essence or centres in the bodyof one of the Heavenly Men, one of the planetary Logoi. These seven again inTheir turn form the essence of the Logos.Each of the seven Lords of Fire (25) [text00028.html#Y_FN25] are differentiatedinto numerous groups of fire entities, from the Deva-Lords of a plane down tothe little salamanders of the internal furnaces. We are not dealing with thefiery essences of the higher planes at this stage in our discussion. We willonly enumerate somewhat briefly some of the better known groups, as contacted inthe three worlds.1. Physical Plane.Salamanders, those little fire elementals who can be seen dancing in everyflame, tending the fires of the hearth and the home, and of the factory. Theyare of the same group as the fire spirits who can be contacted deep in the fierybowels of the planet.Fire spirits , latent in all focal points of heat, who are themselves theessence of warmth, and can be contacted [67] in the heat of the bodily frame,whether human or animal, and who are likewise the warmth terrestrial.The Agnichaitans , a higher grade of fire spirit, who form a vortex of fire whenviewed on a large scale, such as in volcanoes and large destructive burnings.They are closely allied to a still more important group of devas, who form thefiery envelope of the sun.The pranic elementals , those minute fiery essences who have the ability topermeate the texture of the human body, of a tree, or of all that may be foundin the human, vegetable and animal kingdoms, and who blend with the fires of themicrocosmic systems.Certain of the deva kingdom who may be described as ensouling certain of thegreat light rays, and Who are in Themselves the essence of those rays. Otherforms of such elemental lives and of deva groups might be enumerated, but theabove tabulation will suffice for our present purpose.2. The Astral Plane.The fiery essences of this plane are more difficult for us to comprehend, havingnot, as yet, the seeing eye upon that plane. They are in themselves the warmthand heat of the emotional body, and of the body of feeling. They are of a loworder when upon the path of desire, and of a high order when upon the path ofaspiration, for the elemental is then transmuted into the deva.Their grades and ranks are many, but their names matter not save in oneinstance. It may be of interest to know the appellation applied to the devas offire whose part it is to tend the fires that will later destroy the causal body.We need to remember that it is the upspringing of the latent fire of matter andits merging with two other fires that causes destruction. These elementals anddevas are called the Agnisuryans, and in [68] their totality are the fieryessences of buddhi, hence their lowest manifestation is on the sixth plane, theastral.Further information concerning these deva lives will be found further on in theTreatise, where they are dealt with at some length."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION B - THE PERSONALITY RAY AND FIRE BY FRICTIONI. The work of the three rays1. The personality ray.2. The wgoic ray.3. The monadic ray.II. The personality ray and the permanent atom.III. The personality ray and karma,I. THE WORK OF THE THREE RAYS[69] We here touch upon a matter of wide general interest yet which is withalvery little comprehended. I refer to the subject of the permanent atoms. (26)[text00028.html#Y_FN26] Each body or form wherein Spirit functions has, for itsfocal point on each plane, an atom composed of matter of the atomic subplane ofeach plane. This serves as a nucleus for the distribution of force, for theconservation of faculty, for the assimilation of experience, and for thepreservation [70] of memory. These atoms are in direct connection with one orother of the three Great rays in connection with the microcosm:—a. The Monadic Ray, the synthetic ray of the microcosm.b. The Egoic Ray.c. The Personality Ray.of the higher Triad) and these three give rise to the dense physicalmanifestation.Each of these rays has a connection with one or other of the permanent atoms inthe lower threefold man, and has a direct action upon the spirillae (27)[text00028.html#Y_FN27] found within the atom. We have noted in “Letters onOccult Meditation” that the atoms of the lower threefold man underwent a twofoldprocess:—They were first vivified in rotation, and each held the light in orderedsequence until the lower triangle was entirely illumined.Eventually transmutation took place, or (to word it otherwise) the polarisationeventually shifted into the three permanent atoms of the Triad, and out of thethree permanent atoms of the lower triangle. The physical permanent atom istranscended and the polarisation becomes manasic or mental, the astral permanentatom is transcended and the polarisation becomes buddhic, while the mental unitis superseded by the permanent [71] atom, of the fifth plane, the atmic. This isall brought about by the action of the three rays upon the atoms and upon thelife within each atom. The relationship between these three rays and thepermanent atoms might be summarised as follows:The Personality Ray has direct action upon the physical permanent atom.The Egoic Ray has a similar action upon the astral permanent atom.The Monadic Ray has a close connection with the mental unit.The effect which they have is threefold, but is not simultaneous; they workever, as do all things in Nature, in ordered cycles. The stimulation, forinstance, that is the result of the action of the monadic Ray upon the mentalunit is only felt when the aspirant treads the Path, or after he has taken thefirst Initiation. The action of the egoic Ray upon the astral permanent atom isfelt as soon as the Ego can make good connection with the physical brain; whenthis is so the egoic ray is beginning to affect the atom powerfully andcontinuously; this occurs when a man is highly evolved and is nearing the Path.This threefold force is felt in the following way:First. It plays upon the wall of the atom as an external force and affects itsrotary and vibratory action.Second. It stimulates the inner fire of the atom and causes its light to shinewith increasing brilliancy.Third. It works upon the spirillae, and brings them all gradually into play.II. THE PERSONALITY RAY AND THE PERMANENT ATOMThe Personality Ray deals with the first four spirillae, and is the source oftheir stimulation. Note here the [72] correspondence to the lower quaternary andits stimulation by the ego. The Egoic Ray concerns itself with the fifthspirilla and with the sixth, and is the cause of their emerging from latency andpotentiality into power and activity. The Monadic Ray is the source of thestimulation of the seventh spirilla.There is great interest attached to this subject and wide reaches of thought andvast fields for investigation open up before the earnest student. This threefoldaction varies in point of time and sequence according to the ray itself uponwhich the Monad may be found; but the subject is too vast to be handled at thistime.In looking at the matter from the standpoint of fire the idea may be grasped alittle through the realisation that the latent fire of matter in the atom isbrought into brilliance and usefulness by the action of the personality Raywhich merges with this fire and stands in the same position to the permanentatom in the microcosm as FOHAT does on the cosmic plane. The fire is therehidden within the sphere (whether the sphere systemic or the sphere atomic) andthe personality Ray in the one case, and Fohat in the other, acts as the forcewhich brings latency into activity and potentiality into demonstrated power.This correspondence should be thought out with care and judgment. Just as Fohathas to do with active manifestation or objectivity, so the personality Ray hasto do with the third, or activity aspect in the microcosm. The work of the thirdaspect logoic was the arranging of the matter of the system so that eventuallyit could be built into form through the power of the second aspect. Thus thecorrespondence works out. By life upon the physical plane (that life wherein thephysical permanent atom has its full demonstration) the matter is arranged andseparated that must eventually be built into the Temple of Solomon, the egoicbody, through the agency of the egoic life, the second [73] aspect. In thequarry of the personal life are the stones prepared for the great Temple. Inexistence upon the physical plane and in the objective personal life is thatexperience gained which demonstrates as faculty in the Ego. What is heresuggested would richly repay our closest attention, and open up before usreaches of ideas, which should eventuate in a wiser comprehension, a sounderjudgment, and a greater encouragement to action.III. THE PERSONALITY RAY AND KARMAIt might be wise here to recapitulate a little so that in the refreshing of thememory may come the basis of further knowledge. We dealt first with the threefires of the system, macrocosmic and microcosmic, and having laid down certainhypotheses we passed to the consideration of the first of the fires, that whichis inherent in matter. Having studied it somewhat in its threefold manifestationin the various parts of the system, including man, we took up the matter of thepersonality Ray and its relationship to this third fire. We must recall herethat all that has been dealt with has been in relation to matter, and for thewhole of this first section this thought must be borne carefully in mind.In our second section we will consider all from the standpoint of mind, and inthe final from the standpoint of the Divine Ray. Here we are dealing with whatH. P. B. calls the primordial ray and its manifestations in matter. (See S. D.,I, 108; II, 596.) All these Rays of Cosmic Mind, Primordial Activity, and DivineLove-Wisdom are but essential quality demonstrating through the agency of someone factor.The Primordial Ray is the quality of motion, demonstrating through matter.[74] The Ray of Mind is the quality of intelligent organisation, demonstratingthrough forms, which are the product of motion and matter.The Ray of Love-Wisdom is the quality of basic motive that utilises theintelligent organisation of matter in motion to demonstrate in one syntheticwhole the great Love aspect of the Logos. (S. D., I, 99, 108; II, 596.)This line of thought can be worked out also correspondingly in the Microcosm,and will show how individual man is engaged in the same type of work on a lesserscale as the solar Logos.At this point in the treatise we are confining our attention to the Ray ofActive Matter, or to that latent heat in substance which underlies its activityand is the cause of its motion. If we think with sincerity and with clarity wewill see how closely therefore the Lipika Lords or the Lords of Karma areassociated with this work. Three of Them are closely connected with Karma as itconcerns one or other of the three great Rays, or the three FIRES, while thefourth Lipika Lord synthesizes the work of his three Brothers and attends to theuniform blending and merging of the three fires. On our planet, the Earth, Theyfind Their points of contact through the three “Buddhas of Activity,” (30)[text00028.html#Y_FN30] (the correspondence should be noted here) and the fourthKumara, the Lord of the World. Therefore, we arrive at the realisation that thepersonality Ray, in its relation to the fire of matter, is directly influencedand adjusted in its working by one of the Buddhas of Activity.[75] The karma ( 31, 32, 33 [text00028.html#Y_FN31] ) of matter itself is anabstruse subject and has as yet scarcely been hinted at. It is neverthelessindissolubly mixed up with the karma of the individual. It involves a control ofthe evolution of the monadic essence, the elemental essence and of the atomicmatter of the plane; it is concerned with the development of the four spirillae,with their activity, with their attachment to forms when atomic, and with thedevelopment of the inner latent heat and its gradual fiery increase until wehave within the atom a repetition of what is seen within the causal body: thedestruction of the periphery of the atom by the means of burning. It deals withthe subject of the building of matter into form by the interaction of the tworays, the Divine and the Primordial, producing thereby that fire by frictionwhich tends to life and fusing.The karma of form is likewise a vast subject, too [76] involved for averagecomprehension but a factor of real importance which should not be overlooked inconnection with the evolution of a world, a synthesis of worlds, or of a systemwhen viewed from higher levels. Everything is, in its totality, the result ofaction taken by cosmic Essences and Entities in earlier solar systems, which isworking out through the individual atoms, and through those congeries of atomswhich we call forms. The effect of the personality Ray upon the internal firesis therefore, in effect, the result of the influence of the planetary Logos ofwhatever ray is implicated, as He works out that portion of Karma which falls toHis share in any one cycle, greater or lesser. He thus brings about andeventually transmutes, the effects of causes which He set in motion earlier inrelation to His six Brothers, the other planetary Logoi. We get an illustrativeparallel in the effect which one individual will have upon another in worldlycontact, in moulding and influencing, in stimulating or retarding. We have toremember that all fundamental influence and effects are felt on the astral planeand work thence through the etheric to the dense physical thereby bringingmatter under its sphere of influence, yet not itself originating on the physicalplane."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION C - THE ETHERIC BODY AND PRANA(34) [text00028.html#Y_FN34]I.

Macrocosmic pralaya.I. THE NATURE OF THE ETHERIC BODY[77] In our consideration of the internal fires of the system we shall find muchof very real interest to the coming [78] generation of thinkers for three mainreasons, which might be enumerated as follows:1. Its Purpose and DescriptionFirst. In the study of the etheric body lies hid (for scientists and those ofthe medical profession) a fuller comprehension of the laws of matter and thelaws of health. The word health has become too localised in the past, and itsmeaning confined to the sanity of the body corporeal, to the co-operative actionof the atoms of the physical body of man, and to the full expression of thepowers of the physical elemental. In days to come it will be realised that thehealth of man is dependent upon the health of all allied evolutions, and uponthe co-operative action and full expression of the matter of the planet and ofthe planetary elemental who is himself a composite manifestation of the physicalelementals of all manifested nature.Second. In the study of the etheric body and prana lies the revelation of theeffects of those rays of the sun which (for lack of better expression), we willcall “solar pranic emanations.” These solar pranic emanations are the producedeffect of the central heat of the sun approaching other bodies within the solarsystem by one of the three main channels of contact, and producing on the bodiesthen contacted certain effects differing somewhat from those produced by theother emanations. These effects might be considered as definitely stimulatingand constructive, and (through their essential quality) as producing conditionsthat further the growth of cellular matter, and concern its adjustment toenvironing conditions; they concern likewise the internal health (demonstratingas the heat of the atom and its consequent activity) and the uniform evolutionof the form of which that particular atom of matter forms a constituent part.Emanative prana does little in connection with [79] form building; that is notits province, but it conserves the form through the preservation of the healthof its component parts. Other rays of the sun act differently, upon the formsand upon their substance. Some perform the work of the Destroyer of forms, andothers carry on the work of cohering and of attracting; the work of theDestroyer and of the Preserver is carried on under the Law of Attraction andRepulsion. Some rays definitely produce accelerated motion, others produceretardation. The ones we are dealing with here—pranic solar emanations—workwithin the four ethers, that matter which (though physical) is not as yetobjectively visible to the eye of man. They are the basis of all physical planelife considered solely in connection with the life of the physical plane atomsof matter, their inherent heat and their rotary motion. These emanations are thebasis of that “fire by friction” which demonstrates in the activity of matter.Finally , in the study of the etheric body and prana comes comprehension of themethod of logoic manifestation, and therefore much of interest to themetaphysician, and all abstract thinkers. The etheric body of man holds hid thesecret of his objectivity. It has its correspondence on the archetypalplane,—the plane we call that of the divine manifestation, the first plane ofour solar system, the plane Adi. The matter of that highest plane is calledoften the “sea of fire” and it is the root of the akasha, the term applied tothe substance of the second plane of manifestation. Let us trace the analogy alittle more in detail, for in its just apprehension will be found much ofillumination and much that will serve to elucidate problems both macrocosmic andmicrocosmic. We will begin with man and his etheric body.The etheric body has been described as a network, permeated with fire, or as aweb, animated with golden light. It is spoken of in the Bible as the “goldenbowl.” [80] It is a composition of that matter of the physical plane which wecall etheric, and its shape is brought about by the fine interlacing strands ofthis matter being built by the action of the lesser Builders into the form ormould upon which later the dense physical body can be moulded. Under the Law ofAttraction, the denser matter of the physical plane is made to cohere to thisvitalised form, and is gradually built up around it, and within it, until theinterpenetration is so complete that the two forms make but one unit; the pranicemanations of the etheric body itself play upon the dense physical body in thesame manner as the pranic emanations of the sun play upon the etheric body. Itis all one vast system of transmission and of interdependence within the system.All receive in order to give, and to pass on to that which is lesser or not soevolved. Upon every plane this process can be seen.Thus the etheric body forms the archetypal plane in relation to the densephysical body. The thinker on his own plane stands, in relation to the physical,as the Logos to His system. In the synthesis of thought it might be expressedthus: The thinker on the astral plane, the plane of desire and of necessity,stands to the physical body as the Logos on the cosmic astral plane stands toHis system.As we continue the study we will work out the correspondence in the cosmos, thesystem, and in the three worlds, for we need to remember that the analogy mustbe perfect.1. Man, the Microcosm, the manifesting Monad, or One.2. The Heavenly Man, the planetary Logos, or the manifesting group.3. The Grand Man of the Heavens, the Macrocosm, the solar Logos, themanifestation of all groups and of all evolutions within His Body, the solarsystem.[81] All these bodies—the body of a man, a planetary Logos, and a solarLogos—are the product of desire originating on the planes of abstract mind,whether cosmic, systemic, or mind in the three worlds, whether cosmicdesire-mind or human desire-mind, and all their bodies are “Sons of Necessity,”as H. P. B. so aptly expressed it. (S. D., I, 74) , (36) [text00028.html#Y_FN36]2. Eight Statements.It is with the etheric bodies of all we are dealing, and with their vivificationby prana (whether cosmic, solar, planetary or human), with the organs ofreception and with the basis of emanations. Here, therefore, we can arrive atcertain dicta anent the etheric body which for purposes of clarity might well beenumerated:First . The etheric body is the mould of the physical body.Second. The etheric body is the archetype upon which [82] the dense physicalform is built, whether it is the form of a solar system, or of a human body inany one incarnation.Third. The etheric body is a web or network of fine interlacing channels, formedof matter of the four ethers, and built into a specific form. It forms a focalpoint for certain radiatory emanations, which vivify, stimulate and produce therotary action of matter.Fourth. These pranic emanations when focalised and received, react upon thedense matter which is built upon the etheric scaffolding and framework.Fifth. This etheric web, during incarnation, forms a barrier between thephysical and astral planes, which can only be transcended when consciousness issufficiently developed to permit of escape. This can be seen in both themicrocosm and the macrocosm. When a man has, through meditation andconcentration, expanded his consciousness to a certain point he is enabled toinclude the subtler planes, and to escape beyond the limits of the dividing web.Physical Sub Planes Solar System Planes 1. First ether. Atomic plane Adi.Divine. Sea of fire. First cosmic ether. 2. Second ether. Sub-atomic Anupadaka.Monadic plane. Akasha. Second cosmic ether. 3. Third ether. Super-etheric Atmic.Spiritual plane. Aether. Third cosmic ether. 4. Fourth ether. Super-gaseousBuddhic. Intuitional Plane. Air. Fourth cosmic ether. Dense Physical Planes ofHumanity 5. Gaseous. Sub-etheric Mental. Fire. Cosmic gaseous. 6. Liquid Astral.Emotional plane. Water. Cosmic liquid. 7. Earthly. Dense Physical plane. Earth.Cosmic dense.[83] When the Logos has expanded His Consciousness on cosmic levels He can thentranscend the logoic etheric web, and escape beyond the ring-pass-not of Hisobjective manifestation. In thinking out this analogy we must hold closely inmind the fact that the seven major planes of our solar system are the sevensubplanes of the cosmic physical or the lowest cosmic plane.We might note here the accurate working out of the correspondence in matter andthe radiatory correspondence is equally accurate.Sixth . In all the three bodies—human, planetary, and systemic or logoic—will befound a great organ within the organism which acts as the receiver of prana.This organ has its etheric manifestation and its dense physical correspondence.In the system. In the system, the organ of cosmic prana, of the force vitalisingmatter, is the central sun, which is the direct receiver and dispenser of cosmicradiation. This is one of the threefold divisions of the Primordial Ray ofactive intelligence. Each of the cosmic Rays is in essence threefold, a factwhich is oft overlooked, though logically obvious; each Ray is the vehicle for acosmic Entity, and all existence is necessarily triple in manifestation. Thecentral Sun has within its periphery a centre of reception with a surfaceradiation.In the Planet. In the planet there will be found a similar organ or receiverwithin its etheric body, the locality of which is not for exoteric publicationand cannot therefore be revealed. It is connected with the location of the twopoles, north and south, and is the centre around which the globe rotates, and isthe source of the legend of a sacred fertile land within the sphere of polarinfluences. The mythic land of exceeding fertility, of abundant [84] luxuriance,and of phenomenal growth, vegetable, animal and human would naturally lie whereprana is received. It is the esoteric Garden of Eden, the land of physicalperfection. Surface radiation demonstrates, after distribution, as planetaryprana.In Man . The organ of reception is the spleen through its etheric counterpart.After distribution over the entire body via the etheric network it demonstratesin surface radiation as the health aura.Seventh. Thus in all the three bodies will the resemblance clearly be seen, andthe working out in perfect correspondence is easily demonstrable:PRANA OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMTHE SOLAR SYSTEMEntity manifesting The solar Logos. Body of manifestation The solar system.Receptive centre Pole of the central Sun. Surface radiation or emanation Solarprana. Movement produced Systemic rotation. Distributive effect Solar ethericradiation (felt cosmically).THE PLANETEntity manifesting A planetary Logos. Body of manifestation A planet. Receptivecentre The planetary pole. Surface radiation or emanation Planetary prana.Movement produced Planetary rotation. Distributive effect Planetary ethericradiation (felt within the system).A HUMAN BEINGEntity manifesting The thinker, a Dhyan Chohan Body of manifestation Physicalbody. Receptive centre The spleen. Surface radiation or emanation Health aura.Movement produced Atomic rotation. Distributive effect Human etheric radiation(felt by environment).[85]THE ATOM OF MATTEREntity manifesting An elementary life. Body of manifestation The atomic sphere.Receptive centre Pole of the atom. Surface radiation or emanation Contributionof atom to the united health aura of body. Movement produced Atomic rotation.Distributive effect Atomic etheric radiation (felt within the physical form).Eighth . When the “will to live” vanishes, then the “Sons of Necessity” ceasefrom objective manifestation. This is logically inevitable, and its working outcan be seen in every case of entified objectivity . When the Thinker on his ownplane withdraws his attention from his little system within the three worlds andgathers within himself all his forces, then physical plane existence comes to anend and all returns within the causal consciousness; this is as much anabstraction in the three worlds of the Thinker as the Absolute is in thethreefold solar system of the Logos. This demonstrates on the physical plane inthe withdrawing from out of the top of the head of the radiant etheric body andthe consequent disintegration of the physical. The framework goes and the densephysical form falls apart; the pranic life is abstracted bodily from out of thedense sheath, and the stimulation of the fires of matter ceases to be. Thelatent fire of the atom remains; it is inherent, but the form is made by theaction of the two fires of matter—active and latent, radiatory andinherent—aided by the fire of the second Logos, and when they are separated theform falls apart. This is a picture in miniature of the essential duality of allthings acted upon by Fohat.[86] There is a close connection between the spleen and the top of the head inconnection with the etheric body. The organ of the spleen has an interestingcorrespondence to the umbilical cord which attaches an infant to the mother forpurposes of nourishment, and which is separated at birth. When a man starts tolive his own life of conscious desire, when a man is born into a new world of asubtler form of life, that interlaced cord of etheric matter (which had unitedhim to his physical body) is broken; the “silver cord is loosed” and the mansevers his connection with the dense physical body and passes out through thehighest center of the body instead of the lowest to life in a higher world andof another dimension. So it will be found in all the bodies and sheaths of themicrocosm, for the analogy will persist on all planes during manifestation. Whenmore scientific knowledge has been gained it will be found that the sameprocedure on a larger scale, takes place in planetary manifestation. A planet isbut the body of a planetary Logos, that body being etheric, and the Logosexpressing Himself through it and building upon the etheric scaffolding avehicle of manifestation. The MOON once was the body of expression for one ofthe Logoi; the Earth now is, and the cycles change continuously. The centre ofescape for the etheric body is found likewise in a physical planet, and theplanetary silver cord is loosed at the time appointed; but the times and cycles,their commencement and termination are hid in the mysteries of Initiation, anddo not concern us.Again in the solar system itself similar action will eventuate at the close of aMahamanvantara. The Logos will withdraw within Himself, abstracting His threemajor principles. (37) [text00028.html#Y_FN37] His body of manifestation—the Sun[87] and the seven sacred Planets, all existing in etheric matter—will withdrawfrom objectivity and become obscured. From the usual physical standpoint, thelight of the system will go out. This will be succeeded by a gradual inbreathinguntil He shall have gathered all unto Himself; the etheric will cease to exist,and the web will be no more. Full consciousness will be achieved, and in themoment of achievement existence or entified manifestation will cease. All willbe reabsorbed within the Absolute; pralaya, (38) [text00028.html#Y_FN38] or thecosmic heaven of rest will then ensue, and the Voice of the Silence will beheard no more. The reverberations of the WORD will die away, and the “Silence ofthe High Places” will reign supreme.II. THE NATURE OF PRANAIn dealing with the subject of the etheric body and its functions as anassimilator and distributor of prana, we have dealt with it from the standpointof its place in the scheme of things. We have considered this matter of ethericsfrom the angle of correspondences, and have traced analogies in the system, theplanet, and man. We have seen that it formed the foundation of the densephysical form, and in itself constituted a most important link between:a . Physical man, and the emotional or astral plane.b. Planetary Man, and essential emotional quality.c. The Logos, the grand Heavenly Man, and the cosmic astral plane.We might now narrow the subject down to the consideration of the etheric body ofthe human being and not touch upon correspondences to things systemic or cosmicat all, though it may be necessary to remind ourselves that for the wise studentthe line along which wisdom [88] comes is the interpretative one; he who knowshimself (in objective manifestation, essential quality, and comprehensivedevelopment) knows likewise the Lord of his Ray, and the Logos of his system. Itis only then a matter of application, conscious expansion, and intelligentinterpretation, coupled to a wise abstention from dogmatic assertion, and arecognition that the correspondence lies in quality and method more than indetailed adherence to a specified action at any given time in evolution.All that it is possible to give here is material which, if rightly pondered on,may result in more intelligent practical living in the occult sense of the term“living”; which, if studied scientifically, religiously and philosophically, maylead to the furthering of the aims of the evolutionary process in theimmediately coming lesser cycle. Our aim, therefore, is to make the secondarybody of man more real, and to show some of its functions and how it caneventually be brought consciously into the range of mental comprehension.Science, as we know, is fast reaching the point where it will be forced to admitthe fact of the etheric body, because the difficulties of refusing toacknowledge it, will be far more insuperable than an admission of its existence.Scientists admit already the fact of etheric matter; the success of photographicendeavor has demonstrated the reality of that which has hitherto been consideredunreal, because (from the standpoint of the physical) intangible. Phenomena areoccurring all the time which remain in the domain of the supernatural unlessaccounted for through the medium of etheric matter, and in their anxiety toprove the spiritualists wrong, scientists have aided the cause of the true andhigher spiritism by falling back on reality, and on the fact of the ethericbody, even though they consider it a body of [89] emanative radiation—beingconcerned with the effect and not having yet ascertained the cause. Medical menare beginning to study (blindly as yet) the question of vitality, the effect ofsolar rays upon the physical organism, and the underlying laws of inherent andradiatory heat. They are beginning to ascribe to the spleen functions hithertonot recognised, to study the effect of the action of the glands, and theirrelation to the assimilation of the vital essences by the bodily frame. They areon the right road, and before long (perhaps within this century) the FACT of theetheric body and its basic function will be established past all controversy,and the whole aim of preventive and curative medicine will shift to a higherlevel. All we can do here is to give simply, and in a condensed form, a fewfacts which may hasten the day of recognition, and further the interest of thetrue investigator. Let me, therefore, briefly state what will be dealt with inour remaining three points:The functions of the etheric body.Its relation to the physical during life.The ills or diseases of the etheric body (taking care to retain the originalmeaning of the word “disease.”)Its after death condition.This will embody all that is as yet of practical use. More may later beforthcoming for our helping if that which is now given to the public iscarefully followed up, and if investigators wisely, sanely and broadly studythis important matter.As the nature and functions of the etheric body of man assume their rightfulplace in the thought of the world and as it is realised that the etheric is themost important of the two physical bodies, man will be brought into closerconscious contact with the other evolutions [90] that evolve in etheric matterjust as he does in a dense physical body. There are certain large groups ofdevas, called “the devas of the shadows,” or the violet devas, who are closelyallied with the evolutionary development of man’s etheric body, and who transmitto him solar and planetary radiation. The etheric body of man receives prana indifferent ways and of different kinds, and all these ways bring him into touchwith varying entities.1. Solar prana .This is that vital and magnetic fluid which radiates from the sun, and which istransmitted to man’s etheric body through the agency of certain deva entities ofa very high order, and of a golden hue. It is passed through their bodies andemitted as powerful radiations, which are applied direct through certain plexiin the uppermost part of the etheric body, the head and shoulders, and passeddown to the etheric correspondence of the physical organ, the spleen, and fromthence forcibly transmitted into the spleen itself. These golden hued pranicentities are in the air above us, and are specially active in such parts of theworld as California, in those tropical countries where the air is pure and dry,and the rays of the sun are recognised as being specially beneficial. Relationsbetween man and this group of devas are very close, but fraught as yet with muchdanger to man. These devas are of a very powerful order, and, along their ownline, are further evolved than man himself. Unprotected man lies at their mercy,and in this lack of protection, and man’s failure to understand the laws ofmagnetic resistance, or of solar repulsion comes, for instance, the menace ofsunstroke. When the etheric body and its assimilative processes are comprehendedscientifically, man will then be immune from dangers due to solar radiation. Hewill protect himself by the application of the laws governing [91] magneticrepulsion and attraction, and not so much by clothing and shelter. It is largelya question of polarisation. One hint might here be given: When men understandthe deva evolution somewhat more correctly and recognise their work alongcertain lines in connection with the Sun and realise that they represent thefeminine pole as they themselves represent the masculine (the fourth CreativeHierarchy being male) (39) [text00028.html#Y_FN39] they will comprehend themutual relationship, and govern that relationship by law.These solar devas take the radiatory rays of the sun which reach from its centreto the periphery along one of the three channels of approach, pass them throughtheir organism and focalise them there. They act almost as a burning glass acts.These rays are then reflected or transmitted to man’s etheric body, and caughtup by him and again assimilated. When the etheric body is in good order andfunctioning correctly, enough of this prana is absorbed to keep the formorganised . This is the whole object of the etheric body’s functioning, and is apoint which cannot be sufficiently emphasised. The remainder is cast off in theform of animal radiation, or physical magnetism—all terms expressing the sameidea. Man therefore repeats on a lesser scale the work of the great solar devas,and in his turn adds his quota of repolarised or remagnetised emanation to thesumtotal of the planetary aura.2. Planetary prana.This is the vital fluid emanated from any planet, which constitutes its basiccoloring or quality, and is produced by a repetition within the planet of thesame process [92] which is undergone in connection with man and solar prana. Theplanet (the Earth, or any other planet) absorbs solar prana, assimilates what isrequired, and radiates off that which is not essential to its well-being in theform of planetary radiation. Planetary prana, therefore, is solar prana whichhas passed throughout the planet, has circulated through the planetary ethericbody, has been transmitted to the dense physical planet, and has been cast offthence in the form of a radiation of the same essential character as solarprana, plus the individual and distinctive quality of the particular planetconcerned . This again repeats the process undergone in the human body. Thephysical radiations of men differ according to the quality of their physicalbodies. So it is with a planet.Planetary emanative prana (as in the case of solar prana) is caught up andtransmitted via a particular group of devas, called the “devas of the shadows,”who are ethereal devas of a slightly violet hue. Their bodies are composed ofthe matter of one or other of the four ethers, and they focalise and concentratethe emanations of the planet, and of all forms upon the planet. They have aspecially close connection with human beings owing to the fact of the essentialresemblance of their bodily substance to man’s etheric substance, and becausethey transmit to him the magnetism of “Mother Earth” as it is called. Thereforewe see that there are two groups of devas working in connection with man:a. Solar devas, who transmit the vital fluid which circulates in the ethericbody.b . Planetary devas of a violet color, who are allied to man’s etheric body, andwho transmit earth’s prana, or the prana of whichever planet man may befunctioning upon during a physical incarnation.A very pertinent question might here be asked, and though we may not fullyexplain the mystery, a few suggestive [93] hints may be possible. We might ask:What causes the apparent deadness of the Moon? Is there deva life upon it? Doessolar prana have no effect there? What constitutes the difference between theapparently dead Moon, and a live planet, such as the Earth? (S. D., I, 170-180.)Here we touch upon a hidden mystery, of which the solution lies revealed forthose who seek, in the fact that human beings and certain groups of devas are nolonger found upon the Moon. Man has not ceased to exist upon the Moon because itis dead and cannot therefore support his life, but the Moon is dead because manand these deva groups have been removed from off its surface and from its sphereof influence . (S. D., I, 179.) Man and the devas act on every planet asintermediaries, or as transmitting agencies. Where they are not found, thencertain great activities become impossible, and disintegration sets in. Thereason for this removal lies in the cosmic Law of Cause and Effect, or cosmickarma, and in the composite, yet individual, history of that one of the HeavenlyMen Whose body, the Moon or any other dead planet at any time happened to be.3. The prana of forms .It must first be pointed out that forms are necessarily of two kinds, eachhaving a different place in the scheme:Forms that are the result of the work of the third and the second Logos, andTheir united life. Such forms are the units in the vegetable, animal and mineralkingdoms.Forms that are the result of the united action of the three Logoi, and comprisethe strictly deva and human forms.There is also the still simpler form embodied in the substance of which all theother forms are made. This matter is strictly speaking the atomic and molecularmatter, and is animated by the life or energy of the third Logos.[94] CHART II — LOGOS OF A SOLAR SYSTEM[Image00006.jpg][95] In dealing with the first group of forms, it must be noted that the pranicemanations given off by units of the animal and vegetable kingdom (after theyhave absorbed both solar and planetary prana) are naturally a combination of thetwo, and are transmitted by means of surface radiation , as in solar andplanetary prana, to certain lesser groups of devas of a not very high order, whohave a curious and intricate relationship to the group soul of the radiatinganimal or vegetable. This matter cannot be dealt with here. These devas are alsoof a violet hue, but of such a pale color as to be almost grey; they are in atransitional state, and merge with a puzzling confusion with groups of entitiesthat are almost on the involutionary arc. ( 42, 43, 43a [text00028.html#Y_FN42])[96] In dealing with the second group, the human form transmits the emanativeradiations to a much higher grade of deva. These devas are of a more pronouncedhue, and after due assimilation of the human radiation, they transmit itprincipally to the animal kingdom, thus demonstrating the close relationshipbetween the two kingdoms. If the above explanation of the intricateinter-relation between the sun and the planets, between the planets and theevolving forms upon them, between the forms themselves in ever descendingimportance demonstrates nothing more than the exquisite interdependence of allexistences, then much will have been achieved.Another fact which must also be brought out is the close relationship betweenall these evolutions of nature, from the celestial sun down to the humblestviolet via the [97] deva evolution which acts as the transmitting transmutingforce throughout the system.Lastly, all work with fire. Fire internal, inherent and latent; fire radiatoryand emanative; fire generated, assimilated and radiated; fire vivifyingstimulating, and destroying; fire transmitted, reflected, and absorbed; fire,the basis of all life; fire, the essence of all existence; fire, the means ofdevelopment, and the impulse behind all evolutionary process; fire, the builder,the preserver and the constructor; fire, the originator, the process and thegoal; fire the purifier and the consumer. The God of Fire and the fire of Godinteracting upon each other, till all fires blend and blaze and till all thatexists, is passed through the fire—from a solar system to an ant—and emerges asa triple perfection. Fire then passes out from the ring-pass-not as perfectedessence, whether essence emerging from the human ring-pass-not, the planetaryring-pass-not or the solar. The wheel of fire turns and all within that wheel issubjected to the threefold flame, and eventually stands perfected.III. THE FUNCTION OF THE ETHERIC BODYWe will now continue with the discussion of the etheric body, and take up theconsideration of its function and its relation to the physical body.The two may wisely be considered together, for the inter-relation is so closethat it is not possible to discuss them separately. Primarily the functions ofthe etheric body are three in number:1. It is the receiver of prana.2. It is the assimilator of prana.3. It is the transmitter of prana.1. The receiver of prana .The etheric body may therefore be described as negative or receptive in respectto the rays of the sun, and as [98] positive and expulsive in respect to thedense physical body. The second function—that of assimilation—is strictlybalanced or internal. As stated earlier, the pranic emanations of the sun areabsorbed by the etheric body, via certain centres which are found principally inthe upper part of the body, from whence they are directed downwards to thecentre which is called the etheric spleen, as it is the counterpart in ethericmatter of that organ. The main centre for the reception of prana at present is acentre between the shoulder blades. Another has been allowed to become partiallydormant in man through the abuses of so-called civilisation, and is situatedslightly above the solar plexus. In the coming rootrace, and increasingly inthis, the necessity for the exposure of these two centres to the rays of thesun, will be appreciated, with a corresponding improvement in physical vitalityand adaptability. These three centres,1. Between the shoulder blades,2. Above the diaphragm,3. And the spleenmake, if one could but see it, a radiant etheric triangle, which triangle is theoriginating impulse for the later pranic circulation throughout the entiresystem. The etheric body is really a net-work of fine channels, which are thecomponent parts of one interlacing fine cord,—one portion of this cord being themagnetic link which unites the physical and the astral bodies and which issnapped or broken after the withdrawal of the etheric body from the densephysical body at the time of death. The silver cord is loosed, as the Bibleexpresses it (The Bible. Ecc: XII, 6.) , and this is the basis of the legend ofthe fateful sister who cuts the thread of life with the dreaded shears.The etheric web is composed of the intricate weaving of this vitalised cord, andapart from the seven centres [99] within the web (which correspond to the sacredcentres, and of which the spleen is frequently counted as one) it has the twoabove mentioned, which make—with the spleen—a triangle of activity. The ethericweb of the solar system is of an analogous nature, and likewise has its threereceptive centres for cosmic prana. The mysterious band in the heavens, which wecall the Milky Way , (S. D. II. 250) is closely connected with cosmic prana, orthat cosmic vitality or nourishment which vitalises the solar etheric system.2. The assimilator of prana.The process of assimilation is carried on in this triangle, and the prana whichenters into either centre, circulates three times around the triangle beforebeing transmitted to all parts of the etheric vehicle and from thence to thedense physical body. The main organ of assimilation is the spleen—the ethericcentre and the dense physical organ. The vital essence from the sun is passedinto the etheric spleen, and is there subjected to a process of intensificationor devitalisation, according to the condition, healthy or not, of that organ. Ifthe man is in a healthy state the emanation received will be augmented by hisown individual vibration, and its rate of vibration will be keyed up before itis passed on into the physical spleen; or it will be slowed down and lowered ifthe man is in a poor condition of health.These three centres are in the form that all centres take, of saucer-likedepressions, resembling somewhat the appearance of small whirlpools, and whichdraw within their sphere of influence the currents that come their way.The centres should be pictured as whirling vortices with a closely woventhreefold channel passing from each centre to the other, and forming an almostseparate circulatory system. This finds its point of departure for [100] theentire system at the further side of the spleen to that at which the pranaentered. The vital fluid circulates through and between these three centresthree times, before it finally passes out from them to the periphery of itslittle system. This final circulation carries the prana, via the fineinterlacing channels, to every part of the body, which becomes entirelyimpregnated by these emanations, if it might be so expressed. These emanationsfind their way finally out of the etheric system by means of surface radiation.The pranic essence escapes from the circumference of its temporary ring-pass-notas emanative human prana, which is the same prana as earlier received, plus thepeculiar quality that any single individual may convey to it during itstransitory circulation. The essence escapes, plus individual quality.Here again can be seen the correspondence to the escape of all essences fromwithin any ring-pass-not when the cycle has been completed.This matter of the etheric body is of a very practical interest, and when itsimportance is better realised, men will attend to the distribution of pranawithin the body with closer attention, and will see that the vitalisation of thebody, via the three centres, proceeds unhindered.The subject has necessarily to be handled in a superficial manner, and onlyoutlines and scattered hints can be given. Nevertheless, it will be found thatif this teaching is studied with care, it will convey a knowledge of truthswhose calibre and content will prove invaluable and of a kind hitherto not givenout. The place of the etheric sheath as a separator or ring-pass-not, and itsfunctions as a receiver and distributor of prana, are dealt with here in alarger sense than heretofore, and the subject may later be enlarged.Two fundamental truths stand out from the aggregate of facts so slightly dealtwith here: [101]First. The fourth etheric subplane of the physical plane is the immediateconcern ofa . Man, the Microcosm,b . The Heavenly Man, the planetary Logos,c. The Grand Man of the Heavens, the solar Logos.Second. In this fourth chain and fourth round, the fourth ether is beginning tobe studied, and—viewed as a separating web—it permits occasional exit to thoseof suitable vibration.3. The Transmitter of Prana.We have touched but little on the subject of the fire, the purpose of theetheric body being to convey it and distribute it to all parts of its system. Wehave dwelt on facts which might stimulate interest and emphasise the utility ofthis pranic vehicle. Certain facts need emphasis and consideration as we studythis static ring and its circulating fires. Let me briefly recapitulate for thesake of clarity:The System receives prana from cosmic sources via three centres, andredistributes it to all parts of its extended influence, or to the bounds of thesolar etheric web. This cosmic prana becomes colored by solar quality andreaches the furthest confines of the system. Its mission might be described asthe vitalisation of the vehicle which is the physical material expression of thesolar Logos.The Planet receives prana from the solar centre, and redistributes it via thethree receiving centres to all parts of its sphere of influence. This solarprana becomes colored by the planetary quality and is absorbed by all evolutionsfound within the planetary ring-pass-not. Its mission might be described as thevitalisation of the vehicle which is the physical material expression of one orother of the seven Heavenly Men.[102] The Microcosm receives prana from the sun after it has permeated theplanetary etheric vehicle, so that it is solar prana, plus planetary quality.Each planet is the embodiment of some one ray aspect, and its quality is markedpredominantly on all its evolution.Prana, therefore, which is active radiatory heat, varies in vibration andquality according to the receiving Entity. Man passes the prana through hisetheric vehicle, colors it with his own peculiar quality, and so transmits it tothe lesser lives that make up his little system. Thus, the great interactiongoes on, and all parts blend, merge and are interdependent; and all partsreceive, color, qualify and transmit. An endless circulation goes on that hasneither a conceivable beginning nor possible end from the point of view offinite man, for its source and end are hid in the unknown cosmic fount. Wereconditions everywhere perfected this circulation would proceed unimpeded andmight result in a condition of almost endless duration, but limitation andtermination result as the effects of imperfection giving place to a gradualperfection. Every cycle originates from another cycle of a relativecompleteness, and will give place ever to a higher spiral; thus eventuateperiods of apparent relative perfection leading to those which are stillgreater.The aim for this greater cycle is the blending, as we know, of the two fires ofmatter, latent and active, and their merging with the fires of mind and spirittill they are lost from sight in the general flame; the fires of mind and spiritburn up matter and thereby bring about liberation from the confining vehicles.The altar of earth is the birthplace of spirit, its liberator from the mother(matter), and its entrance into higher realms.Hence, when the pranic vehicle is working perfectly in all three groups, human,planetary and solar, the union with latent fire will be accomplished. Here lies[103] the reason for the emphasis laid on the necessity for building pure,refined physical vehicles. The more refined and rarefied the form, the better areceiver of prana will it be, and the less will be the resistance found to theuprising of kundalini at the appointed time. Coarse matter and crude immaturephysical bodies are a menace to the occultist, and no true seer will be foundwith a body of a gross quality. The dangers of disruption are too great, and themenace of disintegration by fire too awful. Once in the history of the race (inLemurian days) this was seen in the destruction of the race and the continentsby means of fire. (45) [text00028.html#Y_FN45] The Guides of the race at thattime availed Themselves of just this very thing to bring about the finish of aninadequate form. The latent fire of matter (as seen in volcanic display, forinstance) and the radiatory fire of the system were combined. Planetarykundalini and solar emanation rushed into conjunction, and the work ofdestruction was accomplished. The same thing may again be seen, only in matterof the second ether, and the effects therefore will be less severe owing to therarity of this ether and the comparatively greater refinement of the vehicles.We might here note a fact of interest, though of a mystery insoluble as yet tomost of us, and that is, that these destructions by fire are part of the testsby fire of an initiation of that one of the Heavenly Men Whose karma is bound upwith our earth.Each destruction of a portion of the web results in a greater facility of exit,and is in reality (when seen from the higher planes) a step forward and anexpansion. A repetition of this takes place likewise in the system at the statedcycles.[104]4. Disorders of the etheric body.We will now study the etheric body, and its ills and also its after deathcondition. This matter can be only briefly touched upon. All that may now beindicated is a general idea of the fundamental ailments to which the etheric maybe subject, and the trend which applied medicine may later take when occult lawsare better understood. One fact must here be brought out—a fact but littlecomprehended or even apprehended. This is the significant fact that the ills ofthe etheric vehicle, in the case of the microcosm, will be found likewise in theMacrocosm. Herein lies the knowledge that ofttimes explains the apparentmiseries of nature. Some of the great world evils have their source in ethericills, extending the idea of the etheric to planetary conditions and even tosolar. As we touch upon the causes of etheric distress in man, their planetaryand solar correspondences and reactions may perhaps be realised. We will need tobear carefully in mind when studying this matter, that all the diseases of theetheric body will appertain to its threefold purpose and be either:a. Functional and thereby affecting its apprehension of prana,b. Organic , and thereby affecting its distribution of prana,c. Static , and thereby affecting the web, when viewed solely from the angle ofproviding a physical ring-pass-not, and acting as a separator between thephysical and the astral.These three different groups of functions or purposes are each of paramountinterest, lead to totally different results, and react in a different mannerboth outwardly and inwardly.Viewed from the planetary standpoint the same conditions will be perceived, andthe etheric planetary body [105] (which is fundamentally the body in the case ofthe sacred planets, of which the Earth is not one) will have its functionaldisorders, which will affect its reception of prana, will suffer its organictroubles which may affect its distribution, and those disorders which permit oftrouble in the etheric web, which forms the ring-pass-not for the involvedplanetary Spirit. Here I would point out that in the case of the planetarySpirits Who are on the divine evolutionary arc, the Heavenly Men Whose bodiesare planets, the etheric web does not form a barrier, but (like the Karmic Lordson a higher plane) They have freedom of movement outside the bounds of theplanetary web within the circumference of the solar ring-pass-not. (46)[text00028.html#Y_FN46]Again from the systemic standpoint, these same effects may be observed,functionally, this time in connection with the cosmic centre; organically, inconnection with the sum total of the planetary systems; and statically, inconnection with the solar or logoic ring-pass-not.We might now, for purposes of clarity, take up these three groups separately andbriefly touch upon them and hint (for more will not be possible) at methods ofcure and of adjustment.a. Microcosmic functional disorders. These have to do with the reception by man,via the necessary centres, of the pranic fluids. We must always bear in mind,and thus keep the distinction clear, that these emanations of prana have to dowith the heat latent in matter; when received and functioning through theetheric body correctly, they co-operate with the natural latent bodily [106]warmth, and (merging therewith) hold the body in a vitalised condition, imposingupon the matter of the body a certain rate of vibratory action that leads to thenecessary activity of the physical vehicle, and the right functioning of itsorgans. It will, therefore, be apparent that the A. B. C. of bodily health iswrapped up in the right reception of prana, and that one of the basic changesthat must be made in the life of the human animal (which is the aspect we aredealing with now) will be in the ordinary conditions of living.The three fundamental centres whereby reception is brought about must be allowedto function with greater freedom, and with less restriction. Now, owing tocenturies of wrong living, and to basic mistakes (originating in Lemurian days)man’s three pranic centres are not in good working order. The centre between theshoulder blades is in the best receptive condition, though owing to the poorcondition of the spinal column (which in so many is out of accurate alignment),its position in the back is apt to be misplaced. The splenic centre near thediaphragm is sub-normal in size and its vibration is not correct. In the case ofthe aboriginal dwellers in such localities as the South Seas, better ethericconditions will be found; the life they lead is more normal (from the animalstandpoint) than in any other portion of the world.The race suffers from certain incapacities, which may be described as follows:First. Inability to tap pranic currents, owing to the unhealthy lives passed byso many. This involves the cutting off of the source of supply, and theconsequent atrophying and shrinkage of the receptive centres. This is seen in anexaggerated form in the children of the congested quarters of any great city,and in the vitiated anemic dwellers of the slums. The cure is apparent—thebringing about of better living conditions, the employment [107] of moreappropriate clothing, and the adoption of a freer and more salubrious mode ofliving. When the pranic rays can find free access to the shoulders, and to thediaphragm, the subnormal state of the average spleen will adjust itselfautomatically.Second. Over-ability to tap pranic currents. The first type of functionaldisorder is common and widespread. Its reverse can be found where conditions oflife are such that the centres (through too direct and prolonged submittal tosolar emanation) become overdeveloped, vibrate too rapidly, and receive prana intoo great an amount. This is rarer, but is found in some tropical countries, andis responsible for much of the troublesome debility that attacks dwellers inthese lands. The etheric body receives prana or solar rays too rapidly, passesit through and out of the system with too much force, and this leaves the victima prey to inertia and devitalisation. Putting it otherwise, the etheric bodybecomes lazy, is like an unstrung web, or (to use a very homely illustration) itresembles a tennis racket which has become too soft, and has lost itsresilience. The inner triangle transmits the pranic emanations with too greatrapidity, giving no time for the subsidiary absorption, and the whole system isthereby the loser. Later it will be found that many of the ills that Europeans,living in India, fall heir to, originate in this way; and by attention,therefore, to the spleen, and by wise control of living conditions, some of thetrouble may be obviated.In touching upon similar conditions in the planet, both these types of troublewill be found. More cannot be said, but in the wise study of solar radiationupon the surface of the planet in connection with its rotary action, some of thegroup rules of health may be comprehended and followed. The spirit of the planet(or the planetary entity) likewise has his cycles, and in the absorption of[108] planetary prana, and in its correct distribution, lies the secret offertility and equable vegetation. Much of this is hidden in the fabled story ofthe war between fire and water, which has its basis in the reaction of the firelatent in matter, to the fire emanating outside of matter, and playing upon it.In the interval that has to elapse while the two are in process of blending,come those periods where, through karmic inheritance, reception is unstable anddistribution inequable. As the point of race equilibrium is reached, soplanetary equilibrium will likewise be attained, and in planetary attainmentwill come the equilibrium that must mutually take place between the solarplanets. When they attain a mutual balance and interaction then the system isstabilised and perfection reached. The even distribution of prana will parallelthis balancing in the man, in the race, in the planet and in the system. This isbut another way of saying that uniform vibration will be achieved.b. Microcosmic organic disorders . These are basically two in number:Troubles due to congestion.Destruction of tissue due to over-absorption of prana, or its too rapid blendingwith latent physical fire.We have a curious illustration of both of these forms of trouble in sun strokeand in heat stroke. Though supposedly understood by physicians, they arenevertheless altogether etheric disorders. When the nature of the etheric bodyis better understood, and its wise care followed both these types of diseasewill be prevented. They are due to solar pranic emanation; in one case theeffect of the emanation is to bring about death or serious illness through thecongestion of an etheric channel, while in the other the same result is broughtabout by destruction of etheric matter.The above illustration has been used with definite intent, [109] but it shouldbe pointed out that etheric congestion may lead to many forms of disease and ofmental incompetence. Etheric congestion leads to the thickening of the web to anabnormal extent, and this thickening may prevent, for instance, contact with thehigher Self or principles and its resultants, idiocy and mental unbalance. Itmay lead to abnormal fleshy development, to the thickening of some internalorgan, and consequent undue pressure; one portion of the etheric body beingcongested may lead to the entire physical condition being upset, resulting indiverse complaints.Destruction of tissue may lead to insanity of many kinds, especially those kindsdeemed incurable. The burning of the web may let in extraneous astral currentsagainst which man is helpless; the brain tissue may be literally destroyed bythis pressure, and serious trouble be caused through the etheric ring-pass-nothaving been destroyed in some one place.In connection with the planet a similar state of affairs may be found. Laterinformation may be forthcoming, which is at present withheld; this will showthat whole races have been influenced, and certain kingdoms of nature troubledby planetary etheric congestion, or the destruction of planetary etheric tissue.We have dealt with the functional and organic ills of the etheric, givingcertain indications for the extension of the concept to other realms than thepurely human. In the human kingdom lies the key, but the turning of that keyopens up a door to a wider interpretation as it admits one into the mysteries ofnature. Though that key has to be turned seven times, yet even one turn revealsuntold avenues of eventual comprehension. ( 47, 48 [text00028.html#Y_FN47] )[110] We have considered the reception and distribution of pranic emanations inman, the planet, and the system, and have seen what produces temporarydisorders, and the devitalisation or the over-vitalisation of the organic form.Now we can look at the subject from a third angle and therefore study:c. Microcosmic static disorders , or a consideration of the etheric body inconnection with its work of providing a ring-pass-not from the purely physicalto the astral. As has been said, both here and in the books of H. P. B., thering-pass-not (48a) [text00028.html#Y_FN48a] is that confining barrier whichacts as a separator or a division between a system and that which is external tothat system. This, as may well be seen, has its interesting correlations whenthe subject is viewed (as we must consistently endeavour to view it) from thepoint of view of a human being, a planet and a system, remembering always thatin dealing with the [111] etheric body we are dealing with physical matter .This must ever be borne carefully in mind. Therefore, one paramount factor willbe found in all groups and formations, and this is the fact that thering-pass-not acts only as a hindrance to that which is of small attainment inevolution, but forms no barrier to the more progressed. The whole questiondepends upon two things, which are the karma of the man, the planetary Logos,and the solar Logos, and the dominance of the spiritual indwelling entity overits vehicle.IV. MACROCOSMIC AND MICROCOSMIC ETHERS1. The Planetary Logos and the EthersMan, the indwelling thinker, passes at night from out of his ethericring-pass-not and functions elsewhere. Therefore, under the law, the planetaryLogos likewise can pass His ring-pass-not at stated seasons which correspond inthe planet to the hours of man’s temporary repose, or pralaya.The solar Logos likewise does the same during stated cycles, which are not thecycles succeeding those which we term solar pralaya, but lesser cyclessucceeding the ‘days of Brahma’ or periods of lesser activity, periodicallyviewed. All these are governed by karma, and just as the true Man himselfapplies the law of karma to his vehicles, and in his tiny system is thecorrespondence to that fourth group of karmic entities whom we call the LipikaLords; He applies the law to his threefold lower nature. The fourth group ofextra-cosmic Entities Who have Their place subsidiary to the three cosmic LogoiWho are the threefold sumtotal of the logoic nature, can pass the bounds of thesolar ring-pass-not in Their stated cycles. This is a profound mystery and itscomplexity is increased by the recollection that the fourth Creative Hierarchyof human Monads, and the Lipika Lords in Their three groups (the first [112]group, the second, and the four Maharajahs, making the totality of the threefoldkarmic rulers who stand between the solar Logos and the seven planetary Logoi),are more closely allied than the other Hierarchies, and their destinies areintimately interwoven.A further link in this chain which is offered for consideration lies in the factthat the four rays of mind (which concern the karma of the four planetary Logoi)in their totality hold in their keeping the present evolutionary process forMan, viewing him as the Thinker. These four, with the karmic four, work in theclosest co-operation. Therefore, we have the following groups interacting:First. The four Maharajahs, the lesser Lipika Lords, (49)[text00028.html#Y_FN49] who apply past karma and work it out in the present.Second. The four Lipikas of the second group, referred to by H. P. B. asoccupied in applying future karma, and wielding the future destiny of the races.The work of the first group of four cosmic Lipika Lords is occult and is onlyrevealed somewhat at the fourth Initiation (and even then but slightly) so itwill not be touched upon here.Third. The fourth Creative Hierarchy of human Monads, held by a fourfold karmiclaw under the guidance of the Lipikas.Fourth. The four planetary Logoi (50) [text00028.html#Y_FN50] of Harmony,Knowledge, Abstract Thought and Ceremonial, who [113] are in Their totality theQuaternary of Manas while in process of evolution, and who pass under Theirinfluence all the sons of men.Fifth. The Deva Lords of the four planes of Buddhi, or the plane of spiritualIntuition, Manas, or the mental plane, Desire, and the Physical, who arelikewise allied to the human evolution in a closer sense than the higher three.A further interesting correspondence is found in the following facts that areeven now in process of development:The fourth plane of Buddhi is the one on which the planetary Logoi begin to makeTheir escape from Their planetary ring-pass-not, or from the etheric web thathas its counterpart on all the planes.When man begins in a small sense to co-ordinate the buddhic vehicle or, toexpress it otherwise, when he has developed the power to contact ever soslightly the buddhic plane, then he begins simultaneously and consciously toachieve the ability to escape from the etheric web on the physical plane. Laterhe escapes from its correspondence on the astral plane, and finally from thecorrespondence on the fourth subplane of the mental plane this time via themental unit. This leads eventually to causal functioning, or to the ability todwell, and to be active in, the vehicle of the Ego, who is the embodiment of thelove and wisdom aspect of the Monad. Note here the correspondence to that provedfact, that many can even now escape from the etheric body, and function in their[114] astral sheath, which is the personality reflection of that same secondaspect.When a man takes the fourth Initiation, he functions in the fourth planevehicle, the buddhic, and has escaped permanently from the personalityring-pass-not, on the fourth subplane of the mental. There is naught to hold himto the three worlds. At the first Initiation he escapes from the ring-pass-notin a more temporary sense, but he has yet to escape from the three higher mentallevels, which are the mental correspondences to the higher ethers, and todevelop full consciousness on these three higher subplanes. We have here acorrespondence to the work to be done by the initiate after he has achieved thefourth solar plane, the buddhic. There yet remains the development of fullconsciousness on the three higher planes of spirit before he can escape from thesolar ring-pass-not, which is achieved at the seventh Initiation, takensomewhere in the system, or in its cosmic correspondence reached by the cosmicsutratma, or cosmic thread of life. (51) [text00028.html#Y_FN51]This fourth earth chain is in this connection one of the most important, for itis the appointed place for the domination of the etheric body by the humanmonad, with the aim in view of both human and planetary escape from limitations.This earth chain, though not one of the seven sacred planetary chains, is ofvital importance at this time to the planetary Logos, who temporarily employs itas a medium of incarnation, and of expression. This fourth round finds thesolution of its strenuous and chaotic life in the very simple fact of theshattering of [115] the etheric web in order to effect liberation, and permit alater and more adequate form to be employed.A further chain of ideas may be followed up in the remembrance that the fourthether is even now being studied and developed by the average scientist, and isalready somewhat harnessed to the service of man; that the fourth subplane ofthe astral plane is the normal functioning ground of the average man and that inthis round escape from the etheric vehicle is being achieved; that the fourthsubplane of the mental plane is the present goal of endeavor of one-fourth ofthe human family; that the fourth manvantara will see the solar ring-pass-notoffering avenues of escape to those who have reached the necessary point; thatthe four planetary Logoi will perfect Their escape from Their planetaryenvironment, and will function with greater ease on the cosmic astral plane,paralleling on cosmic levels the achievement of the human units who are thecells in Their bodies.Our solar Logos, being a Logos of the fourth order, will begin to co-ordinateHis cosmic buddhic body, and as He develops cosmic mind He will graduallyachieve, by the aid of that mind, the ability to touch the cosmic buddhic plane.These possibilities and correspondences have been somewhat dwelt upon, as it isnecessary for us to realise the work to be done in connection with the ethericweb before we take up the matter of the various causes which may hinder thedesired progress, and prevent the appointed escape and destined liberation.Later we will take up the consideration of the etheric web, and its staticcondition. This will entail the recollection of two things:First, that this static condition is only so when viewed from the standpoint ofman at the present time, and is [116] only termed so in order to make plainerthe changes that must be effected and the dangers that must be offset. Evolutionmoves so slowly from man’s point of view that it seems to be almost stationary,especially where etheric evolution is concerned.Second, that we are only concerning ourselves with the physical etheric body andnot with its correspondences on all planes. This is because our system is on thecosmic etheric levels, and hence is of prime importance to us.2. Cosmic and Systemic EthersFor the sake of those who read this treatise, and because the sequentialrepetition of fact makes for clarity, let us here briefly tabulate certainfundamental hypotheses that have a definite bearing upon the matter in hand, andwhich may serve to clear up the present existing confusion concerning the matterof the solar system. Some of the facts stated are already well known, others areinferential, while some are the expression of old and true correspondencescouched in a more modern form.a. The lowest cosmic plane is the cosmic physical, and it is the only one whichthe finite mind of man can in any way comprehend.b. This cosmic physical plane exists in matter differentiated into sevenqualities, groups, grades, or vibrations.c. These seven differentiations are the seven major planes of our solar system.For purposes of clarity, we might here tabulate under the headings physical,systemic, and cosmic, so that the relationship and the correspondences may beapparent, and the connection to that which is above, and to that which is below,or included, may be plainly seen. [117]CHART III[Image00007.jpg]THE PLANES [118]Physical Plane Systemic Planes Cosmic Planes 1. Atomic plane Divine. Adi. Atomicplane 1st ether Primordial matter 1st ether 2. Sub-atomic Monadic.

Gaseous Mental. Fire Gaseous Sub-etheric 6.Liquid Astral. Emotional Liquid 7. Dense physical Physical plane Dense physicald . These major seven planes of our solar system being but the seven subplanesof the cosmic physical plane, we can consequently see the reason for theemphasis laid by H. P. B. (S. D., I, 136, 354; I, 87, 136, 731, 732. See alsonote page 8.) upon the fact that matter and ether are synonymous terms and thatthis ether is found in some form or other on all the planes, and is but agradation of cosmic atomic matter, called when undifferentiated mulaprakriti orprimordial pre-genetic substance, and when differentiated by Fohat (or theenergising Life, the third Logos or Brahma) it is termed prakriti, or matter. (54 [text00028.html#Y_FN54] )e. Our solar system is what is called a system of the fourth order; that is, ithas its location on the fourth cosmic etheric plane, counting, as always, fromabove downwards.[119]f. Hence this fourth cosmic etheric plane forms the meeting ground for the pastand the future, and is the present.g. Therefore, also, the buddhic or intuitional plane (the correspondence in thesystem of this fourth cosmic ether) is the meeting ground, or plane of union,for that which is man and for that which will be superman, and links the pastwith that which is to be.h. The following correspondences in time would repay careful meditation. Theyare based on a realisation of the relationship between this fourth cosmic ether,the buddhic plane, and the fourth physical etheric subplane.The fourth subplane of mind, the correspondence on the mental plane of thephysical etheric, is likewise a point of transition from out of a lower into ahigher, and is the transferring locality into a higher body.The fourth subplane of the monadic plane is in a very real sense the place oftransition from off the egoic ray (whichever that ray may be) on to the monadicray; these three major rays are organised on the three higher subplanes of themonadic plane in the same way that the three abstract subplanes of the mentalare the group of transference from off the personality ray on to the egoic.The four lesser rays blend with the third major ray of active intelligence onthe mental plane and on the atmic plane. The four Logoi or planetary Spiritswork as one, on the atmic plane.i. Another synthesis takes place on the synthetic second ray on the secondsubplane of the buddhic plane and the monadic plane, while the comparatively fewMonads of will or power are synthesised on the atomic subplane of the atmic. Allthree groups of Monads work in triple form on the mental plane under theMahachohan, the Manu, and the Bodhisattva, or the Christ; on the second ormonadic plane they work as a unit, only demonstrating [120] their dual work onthe atmic plane, and their essential triplicity on the buddhic plane. ( 55[text00028.html#Y_FN55] )The fourth etheric plane holds the key to the dominance of matter, and it mightbe noted that:On the fourth physical ether man begins to co-ordinate his astral, or emotionalbody, and to escape at ever more frequent intervals into that vehicle.Continuity of consciousness is achieved when a man has mastered the four ethers.On the fourth subplane of the mental plane, man begins to control his causal oregoic body, and to polarise his consciousness therein until the polarisation iscomplete. He functions then consciously on it when he has mastered thecorrespondences to the ethers on the mental plane.On the buddhic plane (the fourth cosmic ether) the Heavenly Men (or the groupedconsciousness of the human and deva Monads) begin to function, and to escapeeventually from the cosmic etheric planes. When these three cosmic ethers aremastered, the functioning is perfected, polarisation is centred in the monadicvehicles, and the seven Heavenly Men have achieved Their goal.j. On these etheric levels, therefore, the Logos of our [121] system repeats, asa grand totality, the experiences of His tiny reflections on the physicalplanes; He co-ordinates His cosmic astral body, and attains continuity ofconsciousness when He has mastered the three cosmic ethers.k. It is to be observed that just as in man the dense physical body in its threegrades—dense, liquid and gaseous—is not recognised as a principle, so in thecosmic sense the physical (dense) astral (liquid) and mental (gaseous) levelsare likewise regarded as non-existing, and the solar system has its location onthe fourth ether. The seven sacred planets are composed of matter of this fourthether, and the seven Heavenly Men, whose bodies they are, function normally onthe fourth plane of the system, the buddhic or the fourth cosmic ether. When manhas attained the consciousness of the buddhic plane, he has raised hisconsciousness to that of the Heavenly Man in whose body he is a cell. This isachieved at the fourth Initiation, the liberating initiation. At the fifthInitiation he ascends with the Heavenly Man on to the fifth plane (from thehuman standpoint), the atmic, and at the sixth he has dominated the secondcosmic ether and has monadic consciousness and continuity of function. At theseventh Initiation he dominates the entire sphere of matter contained in thelowest cosmic plane, escapes from all etheric contact, and functions on thecosmic astral plane.The past solar system saw the surmounting of the three lowest cosmic physicalplanes viewed from the matter standpoint and the co-ordination of the densethreefold physical form in which all life is found, dense matter, liquid matter,gaseous matter. A correspondence may be seen here in the work achieved in thefirst three rootraces. ( 56, 57 [text00028.html#Y_FN56] )[122] 3. The Protective Purpose of the Etheric Body.Now let us, after this somewhat lengthy digression, leave things cosmic andincomprehensible, and come down to practical evolution, and to the study of thematter of man’s etheric body, and of the harm that may ensue to him should thatbody (through the breaking of the law) no longer perform its protectivefunction. Let us see first of all what those protective functions are:First. The etheric web acts as a separator or a dividing web between the astraland the dense physical body.Second. It circulates the inflowing vitality or pranic fluid and carries on itswork in three stages.The first stage is that wherein the pranic fluid and [123] solar radiations arereceived, and circulated three times around the triangle, thence beingdistributed to the periphery of the body, animating and vitalising all thephysical organs and conducing to the automatic subconscious workings of the bodyof dense matter. When perfectly accomplishing its object it protects fromdisease, and the ills of the flesh are unknown to the man who absorbs anddistributes prana with accuracy. This hint is recommended to all physicians, andwhen properly comprehended, will result in a basic change in medicine, from acurative to a preventive foundation.The second stage is that in which the pranic fluids begin to blend with the fireat the base of the spine and to drive that fire slowly upwards, transferring itsheat from the centres below the solar plexus to the three higher centres—that ofthe heart, the throat and the head. This is a long and slow process when left tothe unaided force of nature, but it is just here that (in a few cases) aquickening of the process is permitted in order to equip workers in the field ofhuman service. This is the object of all occult training. This angle of thematter we will take up in still greater detail when we handle our next point of“Kundalini and the Spine.”The third stage is that in which active radiatory matter or prana is blendedever more perfectly with the fire latent in matter; this results (as will bebrought out later) in certain effects.It produces a quickening of the normal vibration of the physical body so that itresponds with more readiness to the higher note of the Ego, and causes a steadyrising of the blending fires through the threefold channel in the spinal column.In the second stage this vitalising blended fire reaches a centre between thelower part of the shoulder blades, which is the point of conjunction, and ofcomplete merging, of the fire from the base of the [124] spine and the firecirculating along the pranic triangle. It will be remembered how one point ofthis triangle originates there. When the threefold basic fire and the threefoldpranic fire meet and merge, then evolution proceeds with greatly increasedvelocity. This is effected definitely at the first Initiation when thepolarisation becomes fixed in one or other of the three higher centres,—whichcentre being dependent upon a man’s ray.The result of this merging leads to a change in the action of the centres. Theybecome “wheels turning upon themselves,” and from a purely rotary movementbecome fourth dimensional in action, and manifest as radiant whirling centres ofliving fire.The three major head centres (the sequence varying according to ray) becomeactive and a similar process is effected between them as was effected in thepranic triangle. From being three centres that react faintly to each other’svibratory movement (feeling the warmth and rhythm of each other, yet separated),the fire leaps from centre to centre, and each whirling wheel becomes linked bya chain of fire till there is a triangle of fire through which the kundalini andpranic fires radiate back and forth. Circulation is also carried on. The fire ofkundalini produces the heat of the centre, and its intense radiance andbrilliance, while the pranic emanatory fire produces ever increasing activityand rotation.As time elapses between the first and fourth Initiation, the threefold channelin the spine, and the entire etheric body is gradually cleansed and purified bythe action of the fire till all “dross” (as the Christian expresses it) is burntaway, and naught remains to impede the progress of this flame.As the fire of kundalini and prana proceed with their work, and the channelbecomes more and more cleared, the centres more active, and the body purer, theflame [125] of spirit, or the fire from the Ego, comes more actively downwardstill a flame of real brilliance issues from the top of the head. This flamesurges upwards through the bodies towards its source, the causal body.Simultaneously with the activity of these fires of matter and of Spirit, thefires of mind, or manas, burn with greater intensity. These are the fires givenat individualisation. They are fed continuously by the fire of matter, and theirheat is augmented by solar emanatory fire, which originates on the cosmic levelsof mind. It is this aspect of the manasic fire that develops under the forms ofinstinct, animal memory, and functional recollection which are so apparent inthe little evolved man. As time progresses the fire of mind burns more brightlyand thus reaches a point where it begins to burn through the etheric web—thatportion of the web that can be found guarding the centre at the very top of thehead, and admitting entrance to the downflow from the Spirit. By its meanscertain things are brought about:The kundalini fire is consciously directed and controlled by the mind or willaspect from the mental plane. The two fires of matter by the power of the mindof man are blended first with each other, and, secondly, with the fire of mind.The united result of this blending is the destruction (under rule and order), ofthe etheric web, and the consequent production of continuity of consciousnessand the admission into the personal life of man of “Life more abundant,” or thethird fire of Spirit.The downrush of Spirit, and the uprising of the inner fires of matter(controlled and directed by the conscious action of the fire of mind) producecorresponding results on the same levels on the astral and mental planes, sothat a paralleling contact is brought about, and the great work of liberationproceeds in an ordered manner.The three first initiations see these results perfected, [126] and lead to thefourth, where the intensity of the united fires results in the complete burningaway of all barriers, and the liberation of the Spirit by conscious directedeffort from out its threefold lower sheath. Man has consciously to bring abouthis own liberation. These results are self-induced by the man himself, as he isemancipated from the three worlds, and has broken the wheel of rebirth himselfinstead of being broken upon it.It will be apparent from this elucidation that the exceeding importance of theetheric vehicle as the separator of the fires has been brought forward, andconsequently we have brought to our notice the dangers that must ensue shouldman tamper injudiciously, ignorantly or wilfully with these fires.Should a man, by the power of will or through an over-development of the mentalside of his character, acquire the power to blend these fires of matter and todrive them forward, he stands in danger of obsession, insanity, physical death,or of dire disease in some part of his body, and he also runs the risk of anover-development of the sex impulse through the driving of the force in anuneven manner upwards, or in forcing its radiation to undesirable centres. Thereason of this is that the matter of his body is not pure enough to stand theuniting of the flames, that the channel up the spine is still clogged andblocked, and therefore acts as a barrier, turning the flame backwards anddownwards, and that the flame (being united by the power of mind and not beingaccompanied by a simultaneous downflow from the plane of spirit), permits theentrance, through the burning etheric, of undesirable and extraneous forces,currents, and even entities. These wreck and tear and ruin what is left of theetheric vehicle, of the brain tissue and even of the dense physical body itself.The unwary man, being unaware of his Ray and therefore of the proper geometricalform of triangle that is [127] the correct method of circulation from centre tocentre, will drive the fire in unlawful progression and thus burn up tissue;this will result then (if in nothing worse), in a setting back for several livesof the clock of his progress, for he will have to spend much time in rebuildingwhere he destroyed, and with recapitulating on right lines all the work to bedone.If a man persists from life to life in this line of action, if he neglects hisspiritual development and concentrates on intellectual effort turned to themanipulation of matter for selfish ends, if he continues this in spite of thepromptings of his inner self, and in spite of the warnings that may reach himfrom Those who watch, and if this is carried on for a long period he may bringupon himself a destruction that is final for this manvantara or cycle. He may,by the uniting of the two fires of matter and the dual expression of mentalfire, succeed in the complete destruction of the physical permanent atom, andthereby sever his connection with the higher self for aeons of time. H. P. B.has somewhat touched on this when speaking of “lost souls”; ( 58,59[text00028.html#Y_FN58] ) we must here emphasise the reality of this diredisaster and sound a warning note to those who approach this subject of thefires of matter with all its latent dangers. The blending of these fires must bethe result of spiritualised knowledge, and must be directed solely by the Lightof the Spirit, who works through love and is love, and who seeks thisunification and this utter merging not from the point of view of sense or ofmaterial gratification, but because liberation and purification is desired inorder that the higher union with the Logos may be effected; this union must bedesired, not for selfish ends, but because group perfection is the goal andscope for greater service to the race must be achieved.V. DEATH AND THE ETHERIC BODY[128] It is not our purpose to give facts for verification by science, or evento point the way to the next step onward for scientific investigators; that wemay do so is but incidental and purely secondary. What we seek mainly is to giveindications of the development and correspondence of the threefold whole thatmakes the solar system what it is—the vehicle through which a great cosmicENTITY, the solar Logos, manifests active intelligence with the purpose in viewof demonstrating perfectly the love side of His nature. Back of this design liesa yet more esoteric and ulterior purpose, hid in the Will Consciousness of theSupreme Being, which perforce will be later demonstrated when the presentobjective is attained. The dual alternation of objective manifestation and ofsubjective obscuration, the periodic out-breathing, followed by the in-breathingof all that has been carried forward through evolution embodies in the systemone of the basic cosmic vibrations, and the key-note of that cosmic ENTITY whosebody we are. The heart beats of the Logos (if it might be so inadequatelyexpressed) are the source of all cyclic evolution, and hence the importanceattached to that aspect of development called the “heart” or “love aspect,” andthe interest that is awakened by the study of rhythm. This is true, not onlycosmically and macrocosmically, but likewise in the study of the human unit.Underlying all the physical sense attached to rhythm, vibration, cycles andheart-beat, lie their subjective analogies—love, feeling, emotion, desire,harmony, synthesis and ordered sequence,—and back of these analogies lies thesource of all, the identity of that Supreme Being Who thus expresses Himself.Therefore, the study of pralaya, or the withdrawal of the life from out of theetheric vehicle will be the same [129] whether one studies the withdrawal of thehuman etheric double, the withdrawal of the planetary etheric double, or thewithdrawal of the etheric double of the solar system. The effect is the same andthe consequences similar.What is the result of this withdrawal, or rather what causes that somethingwhich we call death or pralaya? As we are strictly pursuing the text-book stylein this treatise, we will continue our methods of tabulation. The withdrawal ofthe etheric double of a man, a planet, and a system is brought about by thefollowing causes:a. The cessation of desire . This should be the result of all evolutionaryprocess. True death, under the law, is brought about by the attainment of theobjective, and hence by the cessation of aspiration. This, as the perfectedcycle draws to its close, will be true of the individual human being, of theHeavenly Man, and of the Logos Himself.b. By the slowing down and gradual cessation of the cyclic rhythm, the adequatevibration is achieved , and the work accomplished. When the vibration or note isperfectly felt or sounded it causes (at the point of synthesis with othervibrations) the utter shattering of the forms.Motion is characterised, as we know, by three qualities:1. Inertia,2. Mobility,3. Rhythm.These three are experienced in just the above sequence and presuppose a periodof slow activity, succeeded by one of extreme movement. This middle periodproduces incidentally (as the true note and rate is sought) cycles of chaos, ofexperiment, of experience and of comprehension. Following on these two degreesof motion (which are characteristic of the atom, Man, of the Heavenly Man [130]or group, and of the Logos or the Totality) comes a period of rhythm and ofstabilisation wherein the point of balance is achieved. By the force ofbalancing the pairs of opposites, and thus producing equilibrium, pralaya is theinevitable sequence.c. By the severing of the physical from the subtler body on the inner planes,through the shattering of the web. This has a threefold effect:First. The life that had animated the physical form (both dense and etheric) andwhich had its starting point in the permanent atom and from thence “pervaded themoving and the unmoving” (in God, the Heavenly Man, and the human being, as wellas in the atom of matter) is withdrawn entirely within the atom upon the planeof abstraction. This “plane of abstraction” is a different one for the entitiesinvolved:a. For the physical permanent atom, it is the atomic level.b. For man, it is the causal vehicle.c. For the Heavenly Man, it is the second plane of monadic life, His habitat.d. For the Logos, it is the plane of Adi.All these mark the points for the disappearance of the unit into pralaya. Weneed here to remember that it is always pralaya when viewed from below . Fromthe higher vision, that sees the subtler continuously overshadowing the densewhen not in objective manifestation, pralaya is simply subjectivity, and is notthat “which is not,” but simply that which is esoteric.Second. The etheric double of a man, a planetary Logos, and a solar Logos, beingshattered, becomes nonpolarised as regards its indweller, and permits thereforeof escape. It is (to word it otherwise) no longer a source of attraction, nor afocal magnetic point. It becomes non-magnetic, and the great Law of Attractionceases to [131] control it; hence disintegration is the ensuing condition of theform. The Ego ceases to be attracted by its form on the physical plane, and,proceeding to inbreathe, withdraws its life from out of the sheath. The cycledraws to a close, the experiment has been made, the objective (a relative onefrom life to life and from incarnation to incarnation) has been achieved, andthere remains nothing more to desire; the Ego, or the thinking entity, losesinterest therefore in the form, and turns his attention inward. His polarisationchanges, and the physical is eventually dropped.The planetary Logos likewise in His greater cycle (the synthesis or theaggregate of the tiny cycles of the cells of His body) pursues the same course;He ceases to be attracted downward or outward, and turns His gaze within; Hegathers inward the aggregate of the smaller lives within His body, the planet,and severs connection. Outer attraction ceases and all gravitates towards thecentre instead of scattering to the periphery of His body.In the system, the same process is followed by the solar Logos; from His highplace of abstraction, He ceases to be attracted by His body of manifestation. Hewithdraws His interest and the two pairs of opposites, the spirit and the matterof the vehicle, dissociate. With this dissociation the solar system, that “Sonof Necessity,” or of desire, ceases to be, and passes out of objectiveexistence.Third . This leads finally, to the scattering of the atoms of the etheric bodyinto their primordial condition. The subjective life, the synthesis of will andlove taking active form, is withdrawn. The partnership is dissolved. The formthen breaks up; the magnetism that has held it in coherent shape is no longerpresent, and dissipation is complete. Matter persists, but the form no longerpersists.The work of the second Logos ends, and the divine [132] incarnation of the Sonis concluded. But the faculty or inherent quality of matter also persists, andat the end of each period of manifestation, matter (though distributed againinto its primal form) is active intelligent matter plus the gain of objectivity,and the increased radiatory and latent activity which it has gained throughexperience. Let us illustrate: The matter of the solar system, whenundifferentiated, was active intelligent matter, and that is all that can bepredicated of it. This active intelligent matter was matter qualified by anearlier experience, and coloured by an earlier incarnation. Now this matter isin form , the solar system is not in pralaya but in objectivity,—his objectivityhaving in view the addition of another quality to the logoic content, that oflove and wisdom. Therefore at the next solar pralaya, at the close of the onehundred years of Brahma, the matter of the solar system will be coloured byactive intelligence, and by active love. This means literally that the aggregateof solar atomic matter will eventually vibrate to another key than it did at thefirst dawn of manifestation.We can work this out in connection with the planetary Logos and the human unit,for the analogy holds good. We have a correspondence on a tiny scale in the factthat each human life period sees a man taking a more evolved physical body of agreater responsiveness, tuned to a higher key, of more adequate refinement, andvibrating to a different measure. In these three thoughts lies much information,if they are carefully studied and logically extended.d. By the transmutation of the violet into the blue . This we cannot enlarge on.We simply make the statement, and leave its working out to those students whosekarma permits and whose intuition suffices.e. By the withdrawal of the life, the form should gradually dissipate . Thereflex action here is interesting to note, for the greater Builders and Devaswho are the [133] active agents during manifestation, and who hold the form incoherent shape, transmuting, applying and circulating the pranic emanations,likewise lose their attraction to the matter of the form, and turn theirattention elsewhere. On the path of out-breathing (whether human, planetary orlogoic) these building devas (on the same Ray as the unit desiringmanifestation, or on a complementary Ray) are attracted by his will and desire,and perform their office of construction. On the path of in-breathing (whetherhuman, planetary or logoic) they are no longer attracted, and the form begins todissipate. They withdraw their interest and the forces (likewise entities) whoare the agents of destruction, carry on their necessary work of breaking up theform; they scatter it—as it is occultly expressed—to “The four winds of Heaven,”or to the regions of the four breaths,—a fourfold separation and distribution. Ahint is here given for careful consideration.Though no pictures have been drawn of death bed scenes nor of the dramaticescape of the palpitating etheric body from the centre in the head, as mighthave been anticipated, yet some of the rules and purposes governing thiswithdrawal have been mentioned. We have seen how the aim of each life (whetherhuman, planetary or solar) should be the effecting and the carrying out of adefinite purpose. This purpose is the development of a more adequate form forthe use of the spirit; and when this purpose is achieved then the Indwellerturns his attention away, and the form disintegrates, having served his need.This is not always the case in every human life nor even in each planetarycycle. The mystery of the moon is the mystery of failure. This leads, whencomprehended, to a life of dignity and offers an aim worthy of our bestendeavour. When this angle of truth is universally recognised, as it will bewhen the intelligence of the race suffices, then evolution will proceed withcertainty, and the failures be less numerous."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION D - KUNDALINI AND THE SPINE( 60, 61 [text00028.html#Y_FN60] )[134] I. Kundalini and the three triangles.1. In the head.2. In the body.3. At the base of the spine.II. The arousing of Kundalini.Very briefly, owing to the impossibility of revealing much on this necessarilydangerous subject, we will consider the subject of kundalini and the spine.We must remember here that we are dealing with the etheric counterpart of thespine, and not with the bony structure which we call the spine or spinal column.This is a fact not sufficiently recognised by those who treat of the matter. Toomuch emphasis has been laid on the three spinal channels that compose thethreefold spinal cord.These channels are important in connection with the [135] nervous system of theman, but in relation to the matter in hand, they are not primarily so importantas the etheric channel, which is the unit enclosing these three. Therefore, wemust strictly remember that we are dealing witha. The etheric channel,b. The fire that passes up the channel,c. The conjunction of this fire with the radiatory energising fire of thephysical body at the point between the shoulder blades,d . Their united ascension into the head,e. Their blending eventually with the manasic fire which energises the threehead centres.I. KUNDALINI AND THE THREE TRIANGLESThe fire energising the triangle in the head is the higher correspondence to thetriangle of prana, midway in the body, and its lower reflection at the base ofthe spine. We have, therefore, in the human unit three important triangles:1. In the head: The triangle of the three major centres,a. The pineal gland,b. The pituitary body,c. The alta major centre.2. In the body: The triangle of prana,a. Between the shoulders,b. Above the diaphragm,c. The spleen.3. At the base of the spine: The three lower centres,a. A point at the bottom of the spinal column.b. and c. The two major sex organs in the male and female. ( 62[text00028.html#Y_FN62] )[136] The merging of the fires of matter and the fires of mind results in theenergising of the sumtotal of the atoms of the matter of the body. This is thesecret of the immense staying power of the great thinkers and workers of therace. It results also in a tremendous stimulation of the three higher centres inthe body, the head, the heart, the throat and in the electrification of thisarea of the body. These higher centres then form a field of attraction for thedownflow of the third fire, that of Spirit. The many-petalled head centre at thetop of the head becomes exceedingly active. It is the synthetic head centre, andthe sumtotal of all the other centres. The stimulation of the centres throughoutthe body is paralleled or duplicated by the concurrent vivification of themany-petalled lotus. It is the meeting place of the three fires, those of thebody, of the mind, and of the Spirit. The at-one-ment with the Ego is completedwhen it is fully stimulated, and combustion then ensues; this is duplicated inthe subtler vehicles and causes the final consummation and the liberation ofSpirit.The merging of the fires of matter is the result of evolutionary growth, whenleft to the normal, slow development that time alone can bring. The junction ofthe two fires of matter is effected early in the history of man, and is thecause of the rude health that the clean-living, high-thinking man shouldnormally enjoy. When the fires of matter have passed (united) still furtheralong the etheric spinal channel they contact the fire of manas as it radiatesfrom the throat centre . Clarity of thought is here essential, and it will benecessary to elucidate somewhat this rather abstruse subject.1. The three major head centres (from the physical standpoint) are the:a . Alta centre,b. Pineal gland,c. Pituitary body. [137]2. They form a manasic triangle, after their juncture with the two fires of thetwo lower triangles, i.e., when they become synthetic.3. But the purely manasic triangle prior to this merging is,a. The throat centre,b . The pineal gland,c. Pituitary body.This is during the period when the human unit consciously aspires and throws hiswill on the side of evolution, thus making his life constructive.The other fire of matter (the dual fire) is attracted upward, and merges withthe fire of mind through a junction effected at the alta major centre. Thiscentre is situated at the base of the skull, and there is a slight gap betweenthis centre and the point at which the fires of matter issue from the spinalchannel. Part of the work the man who is developing thought power has to do, isto build a temporary channel in etheric matter to bridge the gap. This channelis the reflection in physical matter of the antaskarana ( 63[text00028.html#Y_FN63] ) that the Ego has to build in order to bridge the gapbetween the lower and higher mental, between the causal vehicle on the thirdsubplane of the mental plane, and the manasic permanent atom on the firstsubplane. This is the work that all advanced thinkers are unconsciously doingnow. When the gap is completely [138] bridged, man’s body becomes co-ordinatedwith the mental body and the fires of mind and of matter are blended. Itcompletes the perfecting of the personality life, and as earlier said, thisperfecting brings a man to the portal of initiation—initiation being the sealset upon accomplished work; it marks the end of one lesser cycle of development,and the beginning of the transference of the whole work to a still higherspiral.We must always bear in mind that the fires from the base of the spine and thesplenic triangle are fires of matter . We must not lose this recollection norget confused. They have no spiritual effect, and concern themselves solely withthe matter in which the centres of force are located. These centres of force arealways directed by manas or mind, or by the conscious effort of the indwellingentity; but that entity is held back in the effects he seeks to achieve untilthe vehicles through which he is seeking expression, and their directing,energising centres, make adequate response. Hence it is only in due course ofevolution, and when the matter of these vehicles is energised sufficiently byits own latent fires that he can accomplish his long-held purpose. Hence againthe need of the ascension of the fire of matter to its own place, and itsresurrection from its long burial and seeming prostitution before it can beunited with its Father in Heaven, the third Logos, Who is the Intelligence ofmatter itself. The correspondence, again, holds good. Even the atom of thephysical plane has its goal, its initiations and its ultimate triumph.Other angles of this subject, such as the centres and their relationship tomanas, the fire of Spirit and manas, and the eventual blending of the threefires, will be dealt with in our next two main divisions. In this division weare confining ourselves to the study of matter and fire, and must not digress,or confusion will ensue.II. THE AROUSING OF KUNDALINI[139] How this fire at the base of the spine can be aroused, the form itsprogression should take (dependent upon the Ray), the blending of the fire withpranic fire and their subsequent united progression, are things of the past withmany, and fortunately for the race, the work was achieved without consciouseffort. The second blending with the fire of manas has to be effected. Scarcelyas yet have men succeeded in directing the fire up more than one channel of thethreefold column; hence two-thirds of its effect in the majority is yet confinedto the stimulation of the organs of race propagation. Only when the fire hascircled unimpeded up another channel is the complete merging with the fire ofmanas effected, and only when it progresses geometrically up all the three—withsimultaneous action and at uniform vibration—is the true kundalini fire fullyaroused, and therefore able to perform its work of cleansing through the burningof the confining web and of the separating particles. When this is accomplishedthe threefold channel becomes one channel. Hence the danger.No more can be imparted concerning this subject. He who directs his efforts tothe control of the fires of matter, is (with a dangerous certainty) playing witha fire that may literally destroy him. He should not cast his eyes backwards,but should lift them to the plane where dwells his immortal Spirit, and then byself-discipline, mind-control and a definite refining of his material bodies,whether subtle or physical, fit himself to be a vehicle for the divine birth,and participate in the first Initiation. When the Christ-child (as the Christianso beautifully expresses it) has been born in the cave of the heart, then thatdivine guest can consciously control the lower material bodies by means ofconsecrated mind. Only when buddhi has assumed an ever-increasing control [140]of the personality, via the mental plane (hence the need of building theantaskarana), will the personality respond to that which is above, and the lowerfires mount and blend with the two higher. Only when Spirit, by the power ofthought, controls the material vehicles, does the subjective life assume itsrightful place, does the God within shine and blaze forth till the form is lostfrom sight, and “The path of the just shine ever more and more until the day bewith us.”"},{"pageContent":"DIVISION E - MOTION ON THE PHYSICAL AND ASTRAL PLANESI.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS[141] I would point out primarily and emphasize the fact that the motion we areconsidering is that due to the fire latent in matter itself, a motion that isthe prime characteristic and basic quality of the Primordial Ray of ActiveIntelligence. To express it otherwise: it is the outstanding faculty of thethird Logos, of Brahma [142] viewed as the Creator, and this faculty is theproduct or result of an earlier manifestation. Each of the three Logoi, when inmanifestation and thus personified, is exemplifying some one quality whichpredominates over the others. Each, more or less, exemplifies all, but eachdemonstrates one of the three aspects so profoundly as to be recognised as thataspect itself. In much the same way, for instance, the different incarnatingjivas carry a vibration which is their main measure, though they may also havelesser vibrations that are subsidiary to them. Let us get this clear, for thetruth embodied is fundamental.1. The threefold goal,2. The threefold function,3. The threefold mode of activity.The Third Logos . The third Logos, or Brahma, is characterised by activeintelligence; His mode of action is that which we call rotary , or that measuredrevolution of the matter of the system, first as a grand totality, setting inmovement the material circumscribed by the entire ring-pass-not, and secondlydifferentiating it, according to seven vibratory rates or measures into theseven planes. On each of these planes the process is pursued, and the matter ofany plane within the plane ring-pass-not shows first as a totality and then as asevenfold differentiation. This differentiation of matter is brought about byrotary motion, and is controlled by the Law of Economy (one of the cosmic laws)with which we will deal later, only pausing here to say that this Law of Economymight be considered as the controlling factor in the life of the third Logos.Therefore:a . His goal is the perfect blending of Spirit and matter.b . His function is the manipulation of prakriti, or matter, so as to make itfit, or equal to, the demands and needs of the Spirit. [143]c. His mode of action is rotary, or, by the revolution of matter, to increaseactivity and thereby make the material more pliable.All these three concepts are governed by the Law of Economy, which is the Law ofAdaptation in time and space, or the line of least resistance. This line ofleast resistance is that which is sought for and followed on the matter side ofexistence. Incidentally, Brahma manifests Will, because He is purpose, and Lovebecause in this solar system Love is the line of least resistance. While this isan occult statement worthy of consideration, yet it must be remembered that Heis primarily activity and intelligence with the aim of adaptability, and thatthis is His main characteristic.The Second Logos . The second Logos, Vishnu, the divine Wisdom Ray, the greatprinciple of Buddhi seeking to blend with the principle of Intelligence, ischaracterised by Love. His motion is that which we might term spiral cyclic .Availing Himself of the rotary motion of all atoms, He adds to that His own formof motion or of spiralling periodical movement, and by circulation along anorbit or spheroidal path (which circles around a central focal point in an everascending spiral) two results are brought about:a. He gathers the atoms into forms.b . By means of these forms He gains the needed contact, and develops fullconsciousness on the five planes of human development, gradually rarefying andrefining the forms as the Spirit of Love or the Flame Divine spirals ever onwardtowards its goal, that goal which is also the source from which it came.These forms are the sumtotal of all spheres or atoms within the solar system, orwithin the solar ring-pass-not, and in their seven major differentiations theyare the [144] spheres of the seven Spirits, or the seven planetary Logoi.All lesser spheres ranging downward from these major spheres, include all gradesof manifestation down to the elemental essence on the arc of involution. (64[text00028.html#Y_FN64] ) We need to remember that on the Path of Involution,the action of Brahma is primarily felt, seeking the line of least resistance. Onthe Path of Evolution the work of the second Logos is felt, beginning at a pointin time and space which hides the mystery of the second chain, but finding itspoint of accelerated vibration or the unification of the two modes ofmanifestation—rotary-spiral-cyclic—in the middle part of what we call the thirdchain. This is after all the blending of the activity of Brahma with the onwardprogress of Vishnu. We have the correspondence to this in the sumtotal of theeffects brought about in the second and third root races.The activity of the second Logos is carried on under the cosmic Law ofAttraction. The Law of Economy has for one of its branches a subsidiary Law ofmarked development called the Law of Repulsion. The cosmic Laws of Attractionand Economy are therefore the raison d’être (viewed from one angle) of theeternal repulsion that goes on as Spirit seeks ever to liberate itself fromform. The matter aspect always follows the line of least resistance, andrepulses all tendency to group formation, while Spirit, governed by the Law ofAttraction, seeks ever to separate itself from matter by the method ofattracting an ever more adequate type of matter in the process of distinguishingthe real from the unreal, and passing from one illusion to another until theresources of matter are fully utilised.[145] Eventually the Indweller of the form feels the urge, or attractive pull,of its Own Self. The reincarnating jiva, for instance, lost in the maze ofillusion, begins in course of time to recognise (under the Law of Attraction)the vibration of its own Ego, which stands to it as the Logos of its own system,its deity in the three worlds of experience. Later, when the body egoic itselfis seen as illusion, the vibration of the Monad is felt, and the jiva, workingunder the same law, works its way back through the matter of the two planes ofsuperhuman evolution, till it is merged in its own essence.Therefore:a. The goal of the second Logos is consciousness, to be achieved in co-operationwith the third Logos.b. His function is the building of forms to be His instruments of experience.c . His mode of action is cyclic and spiral, the revolution of the wheel ofexistence in ordered cycles for a specific purpose, and the progression of thesespheres of matter around a fixed centre, within the solar periphery.These three concepts are governed by the Law of Attraction, or the law governingthe interplay or the action and reaction.a . Between the Sun and its six brothers.b. Between the circling whirling seven planes of the solar system.c. Between everything in the matter of all forms, the spheres of matterthemselves and the aggregate of those spheres that are embodied in the forms ofstill others.The First Logos. The first Logos is the Ray of Cosmic Will. His mode of actionis a literal driving forward of the solar ring-pass-not through space, and untilthe end of this mahamanvantara or day of Brahma (the logoic [146] cycle) weshall not be able to conceive of the first aspect of will or power as it reallyis. We know it now as the will to exist, manifesting through the matter of theforms (the Primordial Ray and the Divine Ray), and we know it as that which insome occult manner links the system up with its cosmic centre. In a mannerinconceivable to us the first Logos brings in the influence of otherconstellations. When this first aspect is better understood (in the nextmahamanvantara) the work of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear, ( 65[text00028.html#Y_FN65] ) and the supreme influence of Sirius will becomprehended; in this present manifestation of the Son, or of the Vishnu aspect,we are concerned more closely with the Pleiades and their influence via the Sun,and, in relation to our planet, via Venus.This subject of the first Logos, manifesting only in connection with the othertwo in the system, is a profound mystery, which is not fully understood by eventhose who have taken the sixth Initiation.The first Logos embodies the “will to live” and it was through Hisinstrumentality that the Manasaputras came into objective existence in relationto the human and deva hierarchies. In this system, the blending of the DivineRay of Wisdom and the Primordial Ray of intelligent matter forms the great dualevolution; back of both these cosmic Entities stands another Entity Who is theembodiment of Will, and Who is the utiliser of forms—though not the forms of anyother than the Greater Building devas and the human hierarchies in time andspace. He is the animating principle; the will-to-live aspect of the sevenHierarchies. Nevertheless these seven Hierarchies are (as says H. P. B.) thesevenfold ray of wisdom, the dragon in its seven forms. (S. D., I, 100-108.) (67, 68 [text00028.html#Y_FN67] ) This is a [147] deep mystery, and only a clueto it all can be found at this time by man in the contemplation of his ownnature in the three worlds of his manifestation. Just as our Logos is seekingobjectivity through His solar system in its threefold form of which the presentis the second, so man seeks objectivity through his three bodies—physical,astral and mental. At this time he is polarised in his astral body, or in hissecond aspect in like manner as the undifferentiated Logos is polarised in Hissecond aspect. In time and space as we now conceive it, the sum total of jivasare governed by feeling, emotion, and desire, and not by the will, yet at thesame time the will aspect governs manifestation, for the Ego who is the sourceof personality shows in manifestation the will to love.The difficulty lies in the inability of the finite mind to grasp thesignificance of this threefold manifestation, but by thoughtful brooding overthe Personality and its relation to the Ego, who is the love aspect and whonevertheless in relation to manifestation in the three worlds is the will aspectlikewise , will come some faint light upon the same problems raised to Deity, orexpanded from microcosmic to macrocosmic spheres.The Mahadeva aspect or the first Logos (who embodies cosmic will) is controlledby the Law of Synthesis, the cosmic law governing the tendency to unification;only in this case, it is not the unification of matter and Spirit, but theunification of the seven into the three, and into the one. These three figuresprimarily stand for Spirit, [148] for quality, for principle, and not soprimarily for matter, although matter, being inspired by spirit, conforms. TheLaw of Synthesis has a direct connection with One Who is still higher than ourLogos, and is the law of control exercised by Him upon the Logos of our system.This is a spiritual relationship that tends to abstraction or to that synthesisof the spiritual elements that will result in their conscious return (the wholepoint lying in that word “conscious”) to their cosmic point of synthesis, or ofunification with their source. Their source is the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BESAID, as we have earlier seen.Therefore, in connection with the first Logos, we can sum up as we did with theother Logoi:a. His goal is the synthesis of the Spirits who are gaining consciousnessthrough manifestation, and who, by means of experience in matter, are gaining inquality.b. His function is, by means of will, to hold them in manifestation for thedesired period, and later to abstract them, and blend them again with theirspiritual source. Hence the necessity of remembering that fundamentally, thefirst Logos controls the cosmic entities or extra-systemic beings; the secondLogos controls the solar entities; the third Logos controls the lunar entitiesand their correspondences elsewhere in the system.This rule must not be carried too far in detail as long as man’s mind is of itspresent calibre. The mystery lies in the realisation that all is carried on in adivine co-operation that has its base outside the system. Hence too the factthat the first Logos is called the Destroyer, because He is abstraction, ifviewed from below upwards. His work is the synthesis of Spirit with Spirit,their [149] eventual abstraction from matter, and their unification with theircosmic source. Hence also He is the one who brings about pralaya or thedisintegration of form,—the form from which the Spirit has been abstracted.If we carry the analogy down to the microcosm a glimpse can be gained of thesame idea and hence ability to comprehend with greater facility. The Ego (beingto the man on the physical plane what the Logos is to His system) is likewisethe animating will, the destroyer of forms, the producer of pralaya and the OneWho withdraws the inner spiritual man from out of his threefold body; he drawsthem to himself the centre of his little system. The Ego is extra-cosmic as faras the human being on the physical plane is concerned, and in the realisation ofthis fact may come elucidation of the true cosmic problem involving the Logosand “the spirits in prison,” as the Christian puts it.c . His mode of action is a driving forward; the will that lies back ofevolutionary development is His, and He it is who drives Spirit onward throughmatter till it eventually emerges from matter, having achieved two things:First, Added quality to quality, and therefore emerging plus the gained facultythat experience has engendered.Second, Increased the vibration of matter itself by means of its own energy, sothat matter at the moment of pralaya and obscuration will have two maincharacteristics,—activity, the result of the Law of Economy, and a dualmagnetism which will be the result of the Law of Attraction.All of these three concepts are governed by the Law of Synthesis, which is thelaw of a coherent will-to-be, persisting [150] not only in time and space, butwithin a still vaster cycle.These preliminary statements have been laid down in an endeavour to show thesynthesis of the whole. In the use of words comes limitation, and a clouding ofthe idea; words literally veil or hide thoughts, detract from their clarity, andconfuse them by expression. The work of the second and third Logoi (being theproduction of the objectivity of the essential Spirit) is more easy to grasp inbroad outline than the more esoteric work of the first Logos, which is that ofthe animating will.In terms of fire another angle of expression may perhaps elucidate.The third Logos is fire in matter. He burns by friction, and gains speed andadded vibration by the rotation of the spheres, their interplay thus producingfriction with each other.The second Logos is solar fire. He is the fire of matter and the electric fireof Spirit blended, producing, in time and space, that fire which we call solar.He is the quality of the flame, or the essential flame, produced by thismerging. A correspondence to this may be seen in the radiatory fire of matter,and in the emanation, for instance, from the central sun, from a planet, or froma human being,—which latter emanation we call magnetism. A man’s emanation, orcharacteristic vibration, is the result of the blending of Spirit and matter,and the relative adequacy of the matter, or the form, to the life within. Theobjective solar system, or the sun in manifestation, is the result of theblending of Spirit (electric fire) with matter (fire by friction), and theemanations of the Son, in time and space, are dependent upon the adequacy of thematter, and of the form to the life within.The first Logos is electric fire, the fire of pure Spirit. Yet in manifestationHe is the Son, for by union with matter (the mother) the Son is produced by WhomHe is [151] known. “I and my Father are One” (Bible. John, 10:30) is the mostoccult statement in the Christian Bible, for it not only refers to the union ofa man with his source, the monad, via the ego, but to the union of all life withits source, the will aspect, the first Logos.We will now endeavor to confine ourselves strictly to the subject of fire inmatter, and its active effect upon the sheaths of which it is the animatingfactor, and upon the centers which come primarily under its control.As we have been told, and as is generally recognised, the effect of heat inmatter is to produce that activity which we call rotary, or the revolution ofthe spheres. Some of the ancient books, and among them a few that are not yetaccessible in the occident, have taught that the entire vault of heaven is avast sphere, revolving slowly like a stupendous wheel, and carrying with it, inits revolution, the entire number of constellations and of universes containedwithin it. This is a statement unverifiable by the finite mind of man at hispresent stage, and with his present scientific accessories, but (like all occultstatements) it contains within it the seed of thought, the germ of truths, andthe clue to the mystery of the universe. Suffice it here to say, that therotation of the spheres within the solar periphery is a recognized occult fact,and indications are available to prove that science itself likewise formulatesthe hypothesis that the solar ring-pass-not similarly rotates in its appointedplace among the constellations. But at this juncture we will not deal with thisangle of the subject, but will study the rotary action of the spheres of thesystem, and of its content—all the lesser spheres of every degree—rememberingever to keep the distinction clearly in mind that we are dealing now simply withthe inherent characteristic of matter itself, and not with matter inco-operation with [152] its opposite, Spirit, which co-operation brings aboutspiral-cyclic movement.II. THE EFFECTS OF ROTARY MOTIONEvery sphere in the body macrocosmic rotates. This rotation produces certaineffects, which effects might be enumerated as follows:1. Separation is produced by rotary movement. By means of this action, all thespheres became differentiated, and form, as we know, the following atomic units:a. The solar system, recognised as a cosmic atom, all the so-called atoms withinits periphery being regarded as molecular.b. The seven planes, regarded as seven vast spheres, rotating latitudinallywithin the solar periphery.c . The seven rays, regarded as the seven veiling forms of the Spirits,themselves spheroidal bands of colour, rotating longitudinally , and forming (inconnection with the seven planes) a vast interlacing network. These two sets ofspheres (planes and rays) form the totality of the solar system, and produce itsform spheroidal.Let us withdraw our thought at this juncture from the informing Consciousnessesof these three types of spheres, and concentrate our attention upon therealisation that each plane is a vast sphere of matter, actuated by latent heatand progressing or rotating in one particular direction. Each ray of light, nomatter of what colour, is likewise a sphere of matter of the utmost tenuity,rotating in a direction opposite to that of the planes. These rays produce bytheir mutual interaction a radiatory effect upon each other. Thus by theapproximation of the latent heat in matter, and the interplay of that heat uponother spheres that totality is produced which we call “fire by friction.”[153] In connection with these two types of spheres we might, by way ofillustration and for the sake of clarity, say that:a. The planes rotate from east to west.b. The rays rotate from north to south.Students should here bear carefully in mind that we are not referring here topoints in space; we are simply making this distinction and employing words inorder to make an abstruse idea more comprehensible. From the point of view ofthe totality of the rays and planes there is no north, south, east nor west. Butat this point comes a correspondence and a point of real interest, though alsoof complexity. By means of this very interaction, the work of the fourMaharajahs or Lords of Karma, is made possible; the quaternary and all sumtotalsof four can be seen as one of the basic combinations of matter, produced by thedual revolutions of planes and rays.The seven planes, likewise atoms, rotate on their own axis, and conform to thatwhich is required of all atomic lives.The seven spheres of any one plane, which we call subplanes, equally correspondto the system; each has its seven revolving wheels or planes that rotate throughtheir own innate ability, due to latent heat—the heat of the matter of whichthey are formed.The spheres or atoms of any form whatsoever, from the form logoic, which we havesomewhat dealt with, down to the ultimate physical atom and the molecular matterthat goes to the construction of the physical body, show similar correspondencesand analogies.All these spheres conform to certain rules, fulfil certain conditions and arecharacterised by the same fundamental qualifications. Later we will considerthese conditions, [154] but must now continue with the effect of rotary action.2. Momentum , resulting therefore in repulsion, was produced by the rotarymovement. We have referred to the Law of Repulsion as one of the subsidiarybranches of the great Law of Economy, which governs matter. Repulsion is broughtabout by rotary action, and is the basis of that separation which prevents thecontact of any atom with any other atom, which keeps the planets at fixed pointsin space and separated stably from each other; which keeps them at a certaindistance from their systemic centre, and which likewise keeps the planes andsubplanes from losing their material identity. Here we can see the beginning ofthat age-long duel between Spirit and matter, which is characteristic ofmanifestation, one aspect working under the Law of Attraction, and the othergoverned by the Law of Repulsion. From aeon to aeon the conflict goes on, withmatter becoming less potent. Gradually (so gradually as to seem negated whenviewed from the physical plane) the attractive power of Spirit is weakening theresistance of matter till, at the close of the greater solar cycles, destruction(as it is called) will ensue, and the Law of Repulsion be overcome by the Law ofAttraction. It is a destruction of form and not of matter itself, for matter isindestructible. This can be seen even now in the microcosmic life, and is thecause of the disintegration of form, which holds itself as a separated unit bythe very method of repulsing all other forms. It can be seen working outgradually and inappreciably in connection with the Moon, which no longer isrepulsive to the earth, and is giving of her very substance to this planet. H.P. B. hints at this in The Secret Doctrine , and I have here suggested the lawunder which this is so. (S. D., I, 179.) ( 70 [text00028.html#Y_FN70] )[155] 3. Frictional effect on all other bodies atomic, producing:a. Vitality of the atom,b . Coherence of the atom,c . Ability to function.d . Heat supplied to the composite form of which it may form a fragmentary part,whether it is the heat supplied by the rotation of a planet within the formmacrocosmic, or the rotation of a cell in the physical body within the formmicrocosmic.e. Final combustion or disintegration, when the fires latent and radiatory haveachieved a specific stage. This is the secret of final obscuration and ofpralaya, but cannot be dissociated from the two other factors of solar andelectric fire.4. Absorption , through that expression which is seen in all whirling spheres ofatomic matter at whichever surface in the sphere corresponds to the point calledin a planet the North Pole. Some idea of the intention that I seek to convey maybe grasped by a study of the atom as portrayed in Babbitt’s “Principles of Lightand Colour,” and later in Mrs. Besant’s “Occult Chemistry.” This depression isproduced by radiations which proceed counter to the rotations of the sphere andpass down from the north southwards to a midway point. From there they tend toincrease the latent heat, to produce added momentum and to give specific qualityaccording to the source from which the radiation comes. This absorption ofextra-spheroidal emanation is the secret of the dependence of one sphere uponanother, and has its correspondence in the cycling of a ray through any planesphere. Every atom, though termed spheroidal, is more accurately a sphereslightly depressed at one location, [156] that location being the place throughwhich flows the force which animates the matter of the sphere. This is true ofall spheres, from the solar down to the atom of matter that we call the cell inthe body physical. Through the depression in the physical atom flows thevitalising force from without. Every atom is both positive and negative; it isreceptive or negative where the inflowing force is concerned, and positive orradiatory where its own emanations are concerned, and in connection with itseffect upon its environment.This can be predicated likewise of the entire ring-pass-not of the solar systemin relation to its cosmic environment. Force flows into the solar system fromthree directions via three channels:a. The sun Sirius,b. The Pleiades,c. The Great Bear.I would here point out the connection or correspondence in this statement to anearlier one made when speaking of solar radiation, and the channels throughwhich it can be felt. These currents or radiations we calla. Akashic.b. Electrical.c. Pranic.In considering the occult meaning of what is here suggested, one point inelucidation may be imparted, leaving the working out of the other tworelationships to the student. The Pleiades are to the solar system, the sourceof electrical energy, and just as our sun is the embodiment of the heart, orlove aspect, of the Logos (Who is Himself the heart of ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAYBE SAID) so the Pleiades are the feminine opposite of Brahma. Think this out,for much is contained in this statement.Certain broad statements have been laid down here concerning the rotation ofmatter, and the results produced [157] in diverse spheres by that rotation. Whatis predicated of any one sphere or atom can be predicated of all, if it is inany way an occult statement of fact and we should be able to work out these foureffects:1. Separation, or the repulsive effect,2. Momentum, or the interior effect,3. Frictional, environal effect,4. Absorption, the receptive or attractive effect,in every grade and type of atom,—a solar system, a sun, a planet, a plane, aray, the body of the Ego, or a cell in the physical body.III. THE QUALITIES OF ROTARY MOTIONEvery rotating sphere of matter is characterised by the three qualities, ofinertia, mobility and rhythm.1. Inertia. This characterises every atom at the dawn of manifestation, at thebeginning of a solar cycle or mahamanvantara (or one hundred years of Brahma),at the commencement of a chain, of a globe, or of any spheroidal form whatsoeverwithout exception. This statement, therefore, includes the totality ofmanifesting forms within the solar system.Let us keep clearly in our minds that we are simply considering the threequalities of matter itself and are not considering consciousness. Inertia is theresult of lack of activity and the relative quiescence of the fires of matter.These fires, during obscuration or Pralaya, though latent, are free from thestimulation that comes from the aggregation of atoms into form, and theconsequent interplay of the forms upon each other. Where form exists and theLaws of Repulsion and Attraction are coming into force, making radiationtherefore possible, then comes stimulation, emanative effect, and a gradualspeeding up which eventually, from within the atom itself, by its own rotarymovement produces the next quality. [158]2. Mobility. The inherent fires of matter produce rotary movement. Eventuallythis rotation results in radiation. The radiation of matter, the result of itsdual heat, produces necessarily an effect upon other atoms in its environment(it matters not whether that environment is cosmic space, systemic space, or theperiphery of the physical body of a man), and this interaction and interplaycauses repulsion and attraction according to the polarity of the cosmic,systemic or physical atom. Eventually this produces coherence of form; bodies,or aggregates of atoms come into being or manifestation, and persist for thelength of their greater or lesser cycles until the third quality is brought intodefinite recognition.3. Rhythm , or the attainment of the point of perfect balance and ofequilibrium. This point of perfect balance then produces certain specificeffects which might be enumerated and pondered upon, even if to our finite mindsthey may seem paradoxical and contradictory.The limitation lies with us and with the use of words, and not in any realinaccuracy. These effects are:a. The disintegration of form,b. The liberation of the essence which the form confines,c. The separations of Spirit and matter,d. The end of a cycle, whether planetary, human or solar,e. The production of obscuration, and the end of objectivity or manifestation,f. The reabsorption of the essence, and the merging again of differentiatedmatter with the root of matter,g. The end of time and space as we understand it,h. The unification of the three Fires and the bringing about of spontaneouscombustion, if one might so express it, [159]i. The synthetic activity of matter in the three types of movement,—rotary,spiralling-cyclic and onward progression,—which unified movement will beproduced by the interaction of the fires of matter, of mind and of Spirit uponeach other.When the point of rhythm or balance is reached in a solar system, in a plane, ina ray, in a causal body, and in the physical body, then the occupier of the formis loosed from prison; he can withdraw to his originating source, and isliberated from the sheath which has hitherto acted as a prison; and he canescape from an environment which he has utilised for the gaining of experienceand as a battle ground between the pairs of opposites. The sheath or form ofwhatever kind then automatically disintegrates.IV. ROTARY MOTION AND SYMBOLISMEvery rotating sphere of matter can be pictured by using the same general cosmicsymbols as are used for the portrayal of evolution.1. The circle. This stands for the ring-pass-not of undifferentiated matter. Itstands for a solar system or the body logoic, viewed etherically; it stands fora planet or the body of a Heavenly Man viewed etherically; it stands for a humanbody, viewed likewise, etherically and it stands for them all at the prime orearliest epoch of manifestation. It stands finally for a single cell within thehuman vehicle, and for the atom of the chemist or physicist.2. The circle with the point in the centre . This signifies the production ofheat in the heart of matter; the point of fire, the moment of the first rotaryactivity, the first straining of the atom, motivated by latent heat, into thesphere of influence of another atom. This produced the first radiation, thefirst pull of attraction, and the [160] consequent setting up of a repulsion andtherefore producing3. The circle divided into two . This marks the active rotation and thebeginning of the mobility of the atom of matter, and produces the subsequentextension of the influence of the positive point within the atom of matter tillits sphere of influence extends from the centre to the periphery. At the pointwhere it touches the periphery it contacts the influence of the atoms in itsenvironment; radiation is set up and the point of depression makes itsappearance, marking the inflow and outflow of force or heat.We are here only showing the application of cosmic symbols to matter, and arenot dealing with manifestation from any other angle than that of the purelymaterial. For instance, we are applying the symbol of the point within thecircle to the sphere of matter, and the point of latent heat. We are nothandling at this point matter as informed by an entity who is to matter, when soinforming, a point of conscious life.We are dealing only with matter and latent heat, with the result produced byrotary movement of radiatory heat and the consequent interplay of bodies atomic.We are therefore dealing with the point we set out to consider while studyingour fifth division, motion in the sheaths.4. The Circle divided into four . This is the true circle of matter, the equalarmed cross of the Holy Spirit, Who is the personification of active intelligentmatter. This shows the fourth dimensional quality of matter and the penetrationof the fire in four directions, its threefold radiation being symbolised by thetriangles formed by the fourfold cross. This portrays the fourfold revolution ofany atom. By this is not meant the ability of any atom to make four revolutions,but the fourth dimensional quality of the revolution which is the goal aimed at,and which is even now becoming known in matter during this [161] fourth round,and in this fourth chain. As the fifth spirilla or fifth stream of force in anatom becomes developed, and man can conceive of a fourth-dimensional rotarymovement, the accuracy of this symbol will be recognised. It will then be seenthat all sheaths in their progress from inertia to rhythm, via mobility, passthrough all stages, whether they are logoic sheaths, the rays in which theHeavenly Men veil Themselves, the planes which form the bodies of certain solarentities, the causal body (or the sheath of the Ego on the mental plane), thehuman physical body in its etheric constitution, or a cell in that body etheric.All these material forms (existent in etheric matter which is the true matter ofall forms) are primarily undifferentiated ovoids; they then become activelyrotating or manifest latent heat; next they manifest duality or latent andradiatory fire; the expression of these two results in fourth dimensional actionor the wheel or rotary form turning upon itself.5. The swastika , or the fire extending not only from the periphery to thecentre in four directions, but gradually circulating and radiating from andaround the entire periphery. This signifies completed activity in everydepartment of matter until finally we have a blazing, fiery wheel, turning everyway, with radiant channels of fire from the centre to the ring-pass-not,—firewithin, without and around until the wheel is consumed and there is naughtremaining but perfected fire.V. MOTION AND THE CENTRESWe can take up this matter of the centres along three lines. Much has beenwritten and discussed anent the centres, and much mystery exists which hasaroused the curiosity of the ignorant, and has tempted many to meddle with thatwhich does not concern them. I seek to elucidate somewhat and to give a newangle of vision to [162] the study of these abstruse matters. I do not in anyway intend to take up the subject from such an angle as to convey rules andinformation that will enable a man to vivify these centres and bring them intoplay. I sound here a solemn word of warning. Let a man apply himself to a lifeof high altruism, to a discipline that will refine and bring his lower vehiclesinto subjection, and to a strenuous endeavor to purify and control his sheaths.When he has done this and has both raised and stabilised his vibration, he willfind that the development and functioning of the centres has pursued a parallelcourse, and that (apart from his active participation) the work has proceededalong the desired lines. Much danger and dire calamity attends the man whoarouses these centres by unlawful methods, and who experiments with the fires ofhis body without the needed technical knowledge. He may, by his efforts, succeedin arousing the fires and in intensifying the action of the centres, but he willpay the price of ignorance in the destruction of matter, in the burning ofbodily or brain tissue, in the development of insanity, and in opening the doorto currents and forces, undesirable and destructive. It is not the part of acoward, in these matters concerning the subjective life, to move with cautionand with care; it is the part of discretion. The aspirant, therefore, has threethings to do:1. Purify, discipline and transmute his threefold lower nature.2. Develop knowledge of himself, and equip his mental body; build the causalbody by good deeds and thoughts,3. Serve his race in utter self-abnegation.In doing this he fulfils the law, he puts himself in the right condition fortraining, fits himself for the ultimate application of the Rod of Initiation,and thus minimises the danger that attends the awakening of the fire.[163] All that is intended to do in this treatise, is to cast some further lightupon these centres, to show their interrelation, and to trace the effectsproduced by their rightful development. To do this, as before stated, thesubject will be divided into the following divisions:1. The nature of the centres.2. The centres and the rays.3. The centres and kundalini.4. The centres and the senses.5. The centres and initiation.As can be seen from the above tabulation, the subject is not only vast butabstruse. This is principally owing to the fact that until the race is normallyclairvoyant, it is not in a position to verify what is said, and has to acceptthe statements of those who profess to know. Later when man can see and provefor himself, it will be possible to check up these statements; the time is notyet, except for the few.1. The Nature of the Centres.Let us take the first point: I wish to enumerate the centres to be dealt with inthis treatise, keeping the enumeration very closely to that laid down earlier,and dealing not with all the centres, but simply with those closely concernedwith man’s fivefold evolution.As before stated, man, at the close of his long pilgrimage, will have passedthrough the five kingdoms of nature on his way back to his source:1. The mineral kingdom,2. The vegetable kingdom,3. The animal kingdom,4. The human kingdom,5. The superhuman, or the spiritual kingdom,and will have developed full consciousness on the five planes: [164]1. The physical plane,2. The emotional or astral plane,3. The mental plane,4. The intuitional, or the buddhic plane,5. The spiritual, atmic, or nirvanic plane,by means of the five senses and their correspondences on all the five planes:1. Hearing,2. Touch,3. Sight,4. Taste,5. Smell.By the time the fifth round is reached, three-fifths of the human family willhave attained this point and will have their five senses fully functioning onthe three planes in the three worlds, leaving the two other planes to besubjugated during the remaining two rounds. I would here point out a fact thatis little realised, that in this fivefold evolution of man and in this solarsystem, the two remaining rounds in any planetary cycle, and the sixth andseventh root-races in those cycles are always synthetic; their function is togather up and synthesise that which has been achieved in the earlier five. Forinstance, in this root-race, the sixth and seventh sub-races will synthesise andblend that which the earlier five have wrought out. The analogy lies in the factthat in this solar system the two higher planes (the logoic-and the monadic) aresynthetic. One is the synthesising plane for the Logos from whence He abstractsthe essence in manifestation; the other for the Monad, from whence the Monadabstracts and garners the fruits of objectivity.We will therefore only concern ourselves here with those centres which relate tothe evolution of the subtler bodies, the evolution of the psyche, and not withthose connected with the evolution and propagation of the dense physical body.These centres are five in number: [165]1. That at the base of the spine, the only one dealt with that has a physicaleffect.2. That situated at the solar plexus, the most important one in the body fromthe standpoint of the astral plane.3. That found at the throat, the most important from the standpoint of themental plane.4. That in the region of the heart, which has an occult link with the buddhicplane.5. That above the top of the head, which is the crown, and has relation with theatmic plane.We do not deal with the lower centres of generation, nor with the spleen whichhas a direct connection with the etheric, and is the transmitter of prana; theyhave been dealt with earlier.The centres in the human being deal fundamentally with the FIRE aspect in man,or with his divine spirit. They are definitely connected with the Monad, withthe will aspect, with immortality, with existence, with the will to live, andwith the inherent powers of Spirit. They are not connected with objectivity andmanifestation, but with force , or the powers of the divine life. Thecorrespondence in the Macrocosm can be found in the force which manipulates thecosmic nebulae and which by its whirling rotary motion eventually builds theminto planets or spheroidal bodies. These planets are each of them an expressionof the “will to live” of some cosmic entity, and the force that swirled, thatrotated, that built, that solidified, and that continues to hold in formcoherent, is the force of some cosmic Being.This force originates on cosmic mental levels, from certain great foci there,descends to the cosmic astral, forming corresponding cosmic focal points, and onthe fourth cosmic etheric level (the buddhic plane of our solar system) findsits outlet in certain great centres. These [166] centres are again reflected orreproduced in the three worlds of human endeavor. The Heavenly Men, therefore,have centres on three solar planes, a fact to be remembered.a. On the monadic plane, the plane of the seven Rays.b . On the buddhic plane, where the Masters and their disciples form theforty-nine centres in the bodies of the seven Heavenly Men.c. On the fourth etheric physical plane, where the sacred planets, the densebodies in etheric matter of the Heavenly Men, are to be found.Here again we can trace the microcosmic correspondence: In the human being thecentres are found on the mental plane from which originates the impulse forphysical plane existence, or the will to incarnate; from thence they can betraced to the astral level, and eventually to the etheric levels, to the fourthether, where they practically go through the same evolution that the planetarycentres went through, and are instrumental in bringing about objectivity,—beingthe force centres.The centres are formed entirely of streams of force, pouring down from the Ego,who transmits it from the Monad. In this we have the secret of the gradualvibratory quickening of the centres as the Ego first comes into control, oractivity, and later (after initiation) the Monad, thus bringing about changesand increased vitality within these spheres of fire or of pure life force.The centres, therefore, when functioning properly, form the “body of fire” whicheventually is all that is left, first to man in the three worlds, and later tothe Monad. This body of fire is “the body incorruptible” (Bible. I Cor., XV,53.) or indestructible, spoken of by St. Paul, and is the product of evolution,of the perfect blending of the three fires, which ultimately destroy the form.When the form is [167] destroyed there is left this intangible spiritual body offire, one pure flame, distinguished by seven brilliant centres of intenserburning. This electric fire is the result of the bringing together of the twopoles and demonstrates at the moment of complete at-one-ment, the occult truthof the words “Our God is a consuming Fire.” (Bible. Deut. IV, 24; Hebrews XII,29.)Three of these centres are called major centres, as they embody the threeaspects of the threefold Monad—Will, Love and Intelligence:1. The Head centre The Monad. Will or Power. 2. The Heart centre The Ego. Loveand Wisdom. 3. The Throat centre The Personality. Activity or Intelligence.The other two centres have to do primarily with the etheric body and with theastral plane. The throat centre synthesises the entire personality life, and isdefinitely connected with the mental plane,—the three planes, and the two higherplanes, and the three centres with the two other centres, the heart and head.Yet, we must not forget that the centre at the base of the spine is also asynthesiser, as would normally be expected, if it is recognised that the lowestplane of all manifestation is the point of deepest reflection. This lowestcentre, by synthesising the fire of kundalini and the pranic fires, eventuallyblends and merges with the fire of mind, and later with the fire of Spirit,producing thus consummation.We must disabuse our minds of the idea that these centres are physical things.They are whirlpools of force that swirl etheric, astral and mental matter intoactivity of some kind. Because the action is rotary, the result produced inmatter is a circular effect that can be seen by the clairvoyant as fiery wheelssituated:1. In the region of the spine, the lowest part.2. Between the ribs, just below the diaphragm. [168]3. In the region of the left breast.4. In the centre of the throat.5. Just above the top of the head.I would like to describe these centres in greater detail, dealing with them asseen in etheric matter, and basing what I say upon a similar statement by Mr. C.W. Leadbeater in “Inner Life,” Vol. 1, page 447-460. We will note the coloursand petals:1. The base of the spine, four petals. These petals are in the shape of a cross,and radiate with orange fire.2. The solar plexus, ten petals rosy color with admixture of green.3. The heart centre, twelve petals glowing golden.4. The throat centre, sixteen petals of a silvery blue, with blue predominating.5. The head centre in its twofold divisions:a . Between the eyebrows, consisting of ninety-six petals, one-half of the lotusbeing rose and yellow, and the other half blue and purple.b . The very top of the head. A centre consisting of twelve major petals ofwhite and gold, and nine hundred and sixty secondary petals arranged around thecentral twelve. This makes a total of ten hundred and sixty-eight petals in thetwo head centres (making the one centre) or three hundred and fifty-sixtriplicities. All these figures have an occult significance.Just as the Monad is the sumtotal of all the three aspects, and of the sevenprinciples of man, so is the head centre a replica of this, and has within itssphere of influence seven other centres with itself for synthesis. These sevencentres are likewise divided into the three major and the four minor centres,with their union and consummation seen in the gorgeous centre surmounting andenveloping them all. There are also three physical centres, called [169]a . The alta major centre,b . The pineal gland,c. The pituitary body,with four lesser centres. These four lesser centres are blended in that centrewhich we call the alta major centre and need not concern us. I would here alsopoint out that there is a close connection:a. Between the alta major centre and the throat centre.b. Between the heart centre and the pituitary body.c. Between the head centre and the pineal gland.It would repay the student to contemplate the interesting succession oftriangles that are to be found and the way in which they must be linked by theprogression of the fire before that fire can perfectly vivify them, and thencepass on to other transmutations. We might enumerate some of these triangles,bearing always in mind that according to the ray so will proceed the geometricrising of the fire, and according to the ray so will the points be touched inordered sequence. Herein lies one of the secrets of initiation, and herein isfound some of the dangers entailed in a too quick publication of informationconcerning the rays.1. The pranic triangle.a . The shoulder centre.b. The centre near the diaphragm.c. The spleen.2. Man controlled from the astral plane.a. The base of the spine.b. The solar plexus.c. The heart.3. Man controlled from the mental plane.a . The base of the spine.b. The heart.c. The throat. [170]4. Man partially controlled by the Ego, advanced man.a. The heart.b. The throat.c. The head, i.e., the four lesser centres and their synthesis, the alta centre.5. Spiritual man to the third Initiation.a. The heart.b . The throat.c. The seven head centres.6. Spiritual man to the fifth Initiationa. The heart.b. The seven head centres.c. The two many-petalled lotuses.All these different periods show different triangular radiances. We must notinfer from this that when the fire is centred in one triangle it is notdemonstrating in others. Once the fire has free passage along any triangle itflames continuously, but always there is one triangle more radiant and luminousthan the others, and it is from these glowing triangles of light, issuing fromwheels and vortices of fire that the clairvoyant and the teachers of the racecan appraise a man’s position in the scheme of things, and judge of hisattainment. At the culmination of life experience, and when man has reached hisgoal, each triangle is a radiant path of fire, and each centre a wheel of livingfiery force rotating at terrific speed; the centre at this stage not onlyrotates in a specific direction, but literally turns upon itself, forming aliving flaming iridescent globe of pure fire, and holding within it a certaingeometrical shape, yet withal vibrating so rapidly that the eye can scarcelyfollow it. Above all, at the top of the head will be seen a fiery display thatseems to put all the other centres into insignificance; from the heart of thismany-petalled lotus issues a flame of fire with the basic hue of a man’s ray.This flame [171] mounts upward and seems to attract downward a sheet of electriclight, which is the downflow from the spirit on the highest plane. This marksthe blending of the fires and the deliverance of man from the trammels ofmatter.We might now note that the evolution of these centres of force can be portrayed,not only in words, but under the same five symbols that have so often a cosmicinterpretation.1. The circle. At this stage the centre is seen simply as a saucer-likedepression (as Mr. C. W. Leadbeater expresses it) of dimly glowing fire, a firediffused throughout but of no real intensity. The wheel rotates slowly, but soslowly as to be almost inappreciable. This corresponds to the little developedstage, and to the early Lemurian root-race, and to that period wherein man wassimply animal; all that was being formed was a field for the appearance of thespark of mind.2. The circle with the point in the centre . The centre is here seen with apoint of glowing fire in the middle of the saucer-like depression, and therotation becomes more rapid. This corresponds to the stage wherein mind isbeginning to be felt and thus to later Lemurian days.3. The divided circle . At this stage the point of light in the centre of thevortex of fire is becoming more active; rotary motion causes it to burn morebrightly, and to cast off rays of fire in two directions, which appear to splitthe vortex into two; the motion is much accelerated, and the dividing flame inthe vortex shoots back and forth, stimulating the glow of the centre itself,till a much greater point of radiance is achieved. This corresponds to Atlanteandays.4. The circle divided into four. We come now to the point where the centre isexceedingly active, with the cross within its periphery rotating as well as thewheel itself, and causing an effect of great beauty and activity. The man hasreached a stage of very high development [172] mentally, corresponding to thefifth root-race, or to the fifth round in the larger cycle; he is conscious oftwo activities within himself, symbolised by the rotating wheel and the innerrotating cross. He is sensing the spiritual, though actively functioning in thepersonal life, and the development has reached a point wherein he is nearing theProbationary Path.5. The swastika. At this stage the centre becomes fourth-dimensional; the innerrotating cross begins to turn upon its axis, and to drive the flaming peripheryto all sides so that the centre is better described as a sphere of fire than asa wheel. It marks the stage of the Path in its two divisions, for the process ofproducing the effect described covers the whole period of the Path. At theclose, the centres are seen as globes of radiant fire with the spokes of thewheel (or the evolution of the cross from the point in the centre) merging andblending into a “fire that burneth up the whole.”A brief sentence has its place here owing to its relation to this subject.Another sentence is also added here, which, if meditated upon, will prove ofreal value and will have a definite effect upon one of the centres, which centreit is for the student himself to find out.These two sentences are as follows:“The secret of the Fire lies hid in the second letter of the Sacred Word. Themystery of life is concealed within the heart. When the lower point vibrates,when the Sacred Triangle glows, when the point, the middle centre, and the apexlikewise burn, then the two triangles—the greater and the lesser—merge with oneflame which burneth up the whole.”“The fire within the lesser fire findeth its progress much impelled when thecircle of the moving and the unmoving, of the lesser wheel within the greaterwheel that moveth not in Time, findeth a twofold outlet; it then shineth withthe glory of the twofold One and of His sixfold brother. Fohat rusheth throughspace. He searcheth for his complement. [173] The breath of the unmoving one,and the fire of the One Who seeth the whole from the beginning rush to meet eachother, and the unmoving becomes the sphere of activity.”We take up our second point in the consideration of the centres:2. The centres in connection with the Rays.This will give us a large range of subject to be dealt with, and much food forthought, surmise and wise conjecture. All that is here stated is given simply asbasic or foundation facts, upon which may be erected a structure of conjecture,and of logical reasoning, employing the imagination, and thereby effecting twothings:These are an ability to expand our mental concept and to build the antaskarana,or that bridge which all who seek to function in the buddhic vehicle must buildbetween higher and lower mind; hence the necessity for the use of theimagination (which is the astral equivalent to mental discrimination), and itsultimate transmutation into intuition.All teachers, who have taken pupils in hand for training, and who seek to usethem in world service, follow the method of imparting a fact (oft veiled inwords and blinded by symbol) and then of leaving the pupil to follow his owndeductions. Discrimination is thereby developed, and discrimination is the mainmethod whereby the Spirit effects its liberation from the trammels of matter,and discerns between illusion and that which is veiled by it.Not much can be here imparted, as the subject, if dealt with at all fully, wouldconvey too much information to those liable to misuse it. As we know, theevolution of the centres is a slow and gradual thing, and proceeds in orderedcycles varying according to the ray of a man’s Monad.[174] The life of the Pilgrim can be, for purposes of discussion, divided intothree main periods:1. That period wherein he is under the influence of the Personality Ray.2. That wherein he comes under the Ray of the Ego.3. That wherein the Monadic Ray holds sway.The first period is by far the longest, and covers the vast progression of thecenturies wherein the activity aspect of the threefold self is being developed.Life after life slips away during which the aspect of manas or mind is beingslowly wrought out, and the human being comes more and more under the control ofhis intellect, operating through his physical brain. This might be looked uponas corresponding to the period of the first solar system, wherein the thirdaspect logoic, that of Brahma, Mind, or Intelligence, was being brought to thepoint of achievement. (74 [text00028.html#Y_FN74] ) Then the second aspect beganin [175] this present solar system to be blended with, and wrought out throughit. Centuries go by and the man becomes ever more actively intelligent, and thefield of his life more suitable for the coming in of this second aspect. Thecorrespondence lies in similitude and not in detail as seen in time and space.It covers the period of the first three triangles dealt with earlier. We mustnot forget that, for the sake of clarity, we are here differentiating betweenthe different aspects, and considering their separated development, a thing onlypermissible in time and space or during the evolutionary process, but notpermissible from the standpoint of the Eternal Now, and from the Unity of theAll-Self. The Vishnu or the Love-Wisdom aspect is latent in the Self, and ispart of the monadic content, but the Brahma aspect, the Activity-Intelligenceaspect precedes its manifestation in time. The Tabernacle in the Wildernesspreceded the building of the Temple of Solomon; the kernel of wheat has to liein the darkness of mother Earth before the golden perfected ear can be seen, andthe Lotus has to cast its roots down into the mud before the beauty of theblossom can be produced.The second period, wherein the egoic ray holds sway, is not so longcomparatively; it covers the period wherein the fourth and fifth triangles arebeing vivified, and marks the lives wherein the man throws his forces on theside of evolution, disciplines his life, steps upon the Probationary Path, andcontinues up to the third Initiation. Under the regime of the Personality Ray,the man proceeds upon the five Rays to work consciously with Mind, the sixthsense, passing first upon the four minor Rays and eventually upon the third. Heworks [176] upon the third Ray, or that of active Intelligence, and from thenceproceeds to one of the subrays of the two other major Rays, if the third is nothis egoic Ray.Enquiry might naturally arise as to whether the egoic ray is necessarily one ofthe three major rays, and if Initiates and Masters are not to be found upon someof the rays of mind, the minor four.The answer lies here: The egoic ray can always be one of the seven, but we needto remember that, in this astral-buddhic solar system, wherein love and wisdomare being brought into objectivity, the bulk of the monads are on thelove-wisdom ray. The fact, therefore, of its being the synthetic ray has a vastsignificance. This is the system of the SON, whose name is Love. This is thedivine incarnation of Vishnu. The Dragon of Wisdom is in manifestation, and Hebrings into incarnation those cosmic Entities who are in essence identical withHimself. After the third Initiation all human beings find themselves on theirmonadic ray, on one of the three major rays, and the fact that Masters andInitiates are found on all the rays is due to the following two factors:First . Each major ray has its subrays, which correspond to all the seven.Second. Many of the guides of the race transfer from one ray to another as Theyare needed, and as the work may require. When one of the Masters or Initiates istransferred it causes a complete re-adjustment.When a Master likewise leaves the hierarchy of our Planet to take up workelsewhere, it frequently necessitates a complete re-organisation, and a freshadmission of members into the great White Lodge. These facts have been butlittle realised. We might here also take the opportunity to point out that weare not dealing with earth conditions when we consider the Rays, nor are we onlyconcerned with the evolution of the Monads upon this planet, but are equallyconcerned with the solar [177] system in which our earth holds a necessary butnot supreme place. The earth is an organism within a greater one, and this factneeds wider recognition. The sons of men upon this planet so often view thewhole system as if the earth were in the position of the sun, the centre of thesolar organism.Under the régime of the Ego, the ray upon which the ego can be found holds sway.This ray is simply a direct reflection of the monad, and is dependent upon thataspect of the spiritual triad which for the man is at any particular time theline of least resistance. By that we must understand that sometimes the ray willhave for its centre of force the atmic aspect, sometimes the buddhic, and atother times the manasic aspect. Though the triad is threefold, yet its egoicoutposts (if one may so express it) will be either definitely atmic, orpredominantly buddhic or manasic. Here again I would draw attention to the factthat this triple demonstration can be seen under three forms, making in all aninefold choice of rays for the Ego:Atmic aspect.1. atmic-atmic2. atmic-buddhic3. atmic-manasic.Buddhic aspect.1. buddhic-atmic2. buddhic-buddhic3. buddhic-manasic.Manasic aspect.1. manasic-atmic2. manasic-buddhic3. manasic-manasicThis literally means that the three major rays can each be subdivided (inconnection with the Ego) into three divisions. This fact is also littleappreciated.[178] The third period , wherein the monadic ray makes itself felt on thephysical plane, is by far the shortest, and covers the period in which the sixthtriangle holds sway. It marks the period of achievement, of liberation, andtherefore, although it is the shortest period when viewed from below upward, itis the period of comparative permanence when viewed from the plane of the Monad.It covers the totality of time remaining in the one hundred years of Brahma, orthe remainder of the process of manifestation.When we study, therefore, the sets of triangles earlier referred to and theperiods of ray dominance, we will find much room for thought. Let me here pointout, however, that the six groups of triangles are in all but five if weeliminate the pranic triangle which has to do with matter itself and is notcounted any more than the dense physical is counted a principle. Therefore wehave:a. Two triangles brought to vivification by the personality ray.b . Two triangles brought to vivification by the egoic ray.c. The synthesising triangle of the Monad.We must, nevertheless, recollect that the complexity is increased by the factthat the personality triangles will be brought to full activity according to theray of the Monad or Spirit . Therefore, no hard or fast rule can be laid downabout development. The egoic triangles are dependent largely upon the reflectionin the personality of the spiritual life force. They are the midway point, justas the causal or egoic body is the transmitting point (when sufficientlyequipped and built) between the higher and the lower.The permanent atoms are enclosed within the periphery of the causal body, yetthat relatively permanent body is built and enlarged, expanded and wrought into[179] a central receiving and transmitting station (using inadequate words toconvey an occult idea) by the direct action of the centres, and of the centresabove all . Just as it was spiritual force, or the will aspect, that built thesolar system, so it is the same force in the man that builds the causal body. Bythe bringing together of spirit and matter (Father-Mother) in the macrocosm, andtheir union through the action of the will, the objective solar system, or theSon, was produced—that Son of desire, Whose characteristic is love, and Whosenature is buddhi or spiritual wisdom. By the bringing together (in microcosm) ofSpirit and matter, and their coherence by means of force (or the spiritual will)that objective system, the causal body, is being produced; it is the product oftransmuted desire, whose characteristic (when fully demonstrated) will be love,the expression eventually on the physical plane of buddhi. The causal body isbut the sheath of the Ego. The solar system is but the sheath of the Son. Inboth the greater and the lesser systems, force centres exist which areproductive of objectivity. The centres in the human being are reflections in thethree worlds of those higher force centres.Before taking up the subject of kundalini and the centres, it would be well toextend the information given above, from its prime significance for man, as thatwhich concerns himself, to the solar system, the macrocosm, and to the cosmos.What can be predicated of the microcosm is naturally true of the macrocosm andof the cosmos. It will not be possible to give the systemic triangles, for theinformation would have to be so blinded that, except for those who have occultknowledge and the intuition developed, it would be practically uselessintellectually, but certain things may be pointed out in this connection thatmay be of interest.The Solar System . We might briefly look at this from [180] the standpoint ofthe centres of the Heavenly Men and of the Grand Man of the Heavens, the Logos.a. The Heavenly Men. The Heavenly Men, in Themselves, embody centres just asdoes a human being, and on Their Own plane these centres of force can be found.Again we need to recollect that these centres of force on cosmic levels, and inmanifestation in the objective system, demonstrate as the great force centres ofwhich any particular group of adepts and Their pupils are the exponents. Everygroup of Masters and all the human beings incarnate or discarnate—who are heldwithin the periphery of Their consciousness—are centres of force of someparticular kind or quality. This is a fact generally recognised, but studentsshould be urged to link up this fact with the information imparted on thecentres of the human being, and see if much is not thereby learnt. These centresof force will demonstrate on etheric levels and on the subtler planes just asthey do in a man, and they will be vivified as are the human centres byplanetary kundalini, progressing in the desired triangles.Two hints can here be given for thoughtful consideration. In connection with oneof the Heavenly Men (which one cannot at this juncture be pointed out) we haveone triangle of force to be seen in the following three centres:a. The force centre of which the Manu, and His group, are the expression.b . The centre of which the Bodhisattva or the Christ and His adherents are thefocal point.c. The centre of which the Mahachohan and his followers are the exponents.These three groups form the three centres in one great triangle—a triangle whichis not yet in complete vivification at this stage of evolutionary development.[181] Another triangle in connection with our own planetary Logos is that formedby the seven Kumaras—the four exoteric Kumaras corresponding to the four minorhead centres, and the three esoteric Kumaras corresponding to the three majorhead centres. (S. D., I, 186-189) ( 75 [text00028.html#Y_FN75] )The second hint I seek to give, lies in the triangle formed by the Earth, Marsand Mercury. In connection with this triangle, the analogy lies in the fact thatMercury and the centre at the base of the spine in the human being are closelyallied. Mercury demonstrates kundalini in intelligent activity, while Marsdemonstrates kundalini latent. The truth lies hid in their two astrologicalsymbols. In transmutation and planetary geometrising, the secret may berevealed.b. The Grand Man of the Heavens . The seven Heavenly Men are the seven centresin the body of the Logos, bearing to Him a relationship identical with thatborne by the Masters and Their affiliated groups, to some planetary Logos.Systemic kundalini goes forward to the vivification of these centres, and atthis stage of development certain centres are more closely allied than others.Just as in connection with our planetary Logos, the three etheric planets of ourchain—Earth, Mercury and Mars ( 77 [text00028.html#Y_FN77] ) —form a triangle ofrare importance, so it may be here said that at the present point in evolutionof the logoic centres, Venus, Earth and Saturn form one triangle of greatinterest. It is a triangle that is at this time undergoing vivification [182]through the action of kundalini; it is consequently increasing the vibratorycapacity of the centres, which are becoming slowly fourth-dimensional. It is notyet permissible to point out others of the great triangles, but as regards thecentres, we may here give two hints:First. Venus corresponds to the heart centre in the body logoic, and has aninter-relationship therefore with all the other centres in the solar systemwherein the heart aspect is the one of greater prominence.Second. Saturn corresponds to the throat centre, or to the creative activity ofthe third aspect.As evolution proceeds, the other centres attain a more pronounced vibration andthe fire (circulating triangularly) will bring them into greater prominence; thetwo above mentioned, however, are of prime importance at this time. These two,with the lesser triangle of our chain, constitute the focal point of energyviewed from our planetary standpoint.In addition to these some hints in connection with the microcosmic andmacrocosmic centres, we might here give the cosmic correspondences at which itis possible to hint.The Cosmos . Our solar system, with the Pleiades and one of the stars of theGreat Bear, form a cosmic triangle, or an aggregation of three centres in theBody of HIM OF WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID. The seven stars in the constellation ofthe Great Bear are the correspondences to the seven head centres in the body ofthat Being, greater than our Logos. Again, two other systems, when allied withthe solar system and the Pleiades, make a lower quaternary which are eventuallysynthesised into the seven head centres in much the same way as in the humanbeing after the fourth initiation. [183]1. The base of the spine.2. The solar plexus.3. The heart.4. The throat.The sevenfold head centre in its turn finds ultimate expression in the gorgeoustwofold centre above the top of the head and surrounding it. Equally so, beyondthe above named constellations is still another cosmic centre. The name of thiscentre is one of the secrets of the final initiation, the seventh. These are theonly correspondences that may as yet be imparted. What lies beyond the solarring-pass-not may be of intellectual interest, (S. D., I, 545,726; II, 581, 582,654.) but, for the purposes of microcosmic evolution it is a matter of no vastimport.3. The Centres and Kundalini.As stated, it is not possible to impart much about kundalini, or the serpentfire. It might be of value, however, briefly to enumerate what has been said:a. Kundalini lies at the base of the spine, and, in the normal average man, itsmain function is the vitalisation of the body.b . Kundalini makes three at-one-ments during the period of evolution:1. With the radiatory fires of the body or prana at a point between the shoulderblades.2. With the fires of mind at a point at the very top of the spine, in the centreof the back part of the throat.3. With the fire of Spirit at the point where these two united fires of matterand of mind issue from the top of the head.c. Each of the three channels within the spinal column have for specific purposethe blending of these threefold fires. We need to bear in mind that the [184]fires circulate , and that, at the moment of achievement, every triangle in thebody is vivified, every centre is fully functioning, and a threefold path offire can be seen extending the entire length of the backbone.d. When kundalini has blended with the pranic fire, the centres becomethree-dimensional. When it blends with mind or solar fire and the two fires areperfectly united, the centres become fourth-dimensional. When it blends with theelectric fire of pure Spirit after the third Initiation, they take on two moredimensions.e. Kundalini, as it is aroused, steadily increases the vibratory action, notonly of the centres, but of every atom of matter in all the bodies—etheric,astral and mental. This quickening of activity has a dual effect of greatinterest:1. It causes the elimination of all matter that is coarse and unsuitable, andcasts it off in exactly the same way as a rapidly rotating wheel casts off orrejects from its surface.2. It sweeps into its sphere of influence matter that is keyed to its ownvibration, and builds it into its vibratory content. This is but a reflection ofthe action of the Logos in sweeping into differentiation the matter of the solarsystem. Kundalini is likewise the fire or force of matter, and therefore thelife of the third Logos.f. Kundalini has two effects upon the etheric web, as it is called.1. By its gradually increasing action it purifies that etheric form and cleansesit from “dross,” as the Christian expresses it.2. Eventually, after the two fires of matter and the fire of mind have begun toblend (a slow and gradual process), the web itself is destroyed [185] and by thetime the third Initiation is reached, the man should have continuity ofconsciousness. This is so unless for certain work and for certain specific ends,the man consciously and willingly foregoes the burning of the web, a thing whichcan be brought about by the conscious action of the will.4. The Centres and the Senses, Normal and Supernormal .Before at all dealing with the centres and their relationship to the senses, itwill be necessary first of all to point out certain facts of interest inconnection with those senses, ( 79 [text00028.html#Y_FN79] ) and so clear theground for further information.[186] What are the senses? How many are there? And what is their connection withthe indwelling Man, the Thinker, the Divine Manasaputra? These are questions ofvital moment, and in their due comprehension comes the ability wisely to followthe path of knowledge.The senses might be defined as those organs whereby man becomes aware of hissurroundings. We should perhaps express them not so much as organs (for afterall, an organ is a material form, existent for a purpose) but as media wherebythe Thinker comes in contact with his environment. They are the means whereby hemakes investigation on the plane of the gross physical, for instance; the meanswhereby he buys his experience, whereby he discovers that which he requires toknow, whereby he becomes aware, and whereby he expands his consciousness. We aredealing here with the five senses as used by the human being. In the animalthese five senses exist but, as the thinking correlating faculty is lacking, asthe “relation between” the self and the not-self is but little developed, wewill not concern ourselves with them at this juncture. The senses in the animalkingdom are group faculty and demonstrate as racial instinct. The senses in manare his individual asset, and demonstrate:a . As the separate realisation of self-consciousness.b. As ability to assert that individualism.c. As a valuable means to self-conscious evolution.d. As a source of knowledge.e. As the transmuting faculty towards the close of life in the three worlds.As we know, the senses are five in number and in order of development are asfollows:a . Hearing.b . Touch.c . Sight.d. Taste.e. Smell.[187] Each of these five senses has a definite connection with one or otherplane, and has also a correspondence on all planes.Let us first take up each of these senses, point out some interesting facts inconnection with them, and suggest their subplane correspondence.PLANE SENSE 1. Physical Hearing. 2. Astral Touch or feeling. 3. Mental Sight. 4.Buddhic Taste. 5. Atmic Smell.In the two lower planes in the three worlds—the astral and the physical—the fivesubplanes of human endeavour are the five highest. The two lowest subplanes, thesixth and seventh, are what we might express as “below the threshold,” andconcern forms of life beneath the human altogether. We have a corroboratinganalogy in the fact that the two earliest root-races in this round are notdefinitely human, and that it is the third root-race which is really human forthe first time. Counting, therefore, from the bottom upwards it is only thethird subplane on the physical and the astral planes which mark the commencementof human effort, leaving five subplanes to be subdued. On the mental plane thefive lower subplanes have to be subjugated during purely human evolution. Whenthe consciousness is centred on the fifth subplane (counting from below upwards)then the planes of abstraction—from the standpoint of man in the threeworlds—supervene the two subplanes of synthesis, demonstrating through thesynthesis of the five senses. In the evolution of the Heavenly Man we haveexactly the same thing: the five planes of endeavour, the five lower planes ofthe solar system, and the two higher planes of abstraction, the spiritual ormonadic and the divine, or logoic.

The First Sense . . . . . . Hearing.1. Physical hearing.2. Clairaudience.3. Higher clairaudience.4. Comprehension (of four sounds)5. Beatitude.b. The Second Sense . . . . . . Touch or feeling.1. Physical touch.2. Psychometry.3. Planetary psychometry.4. Healing.5. Active service.c. The Third Sense . . . . . . Sight.1. Physical sight.2. Clairvoyance.3. Higher clairvoyance.4. Divine vision.5.

Emotional idealism.3. Spiritual discernment.4. Idealism.5. All knowledge.[190] Let us now proceed to take up each of these senses in detail:a. Hearing . This, very appropriately, is the first sense to be manifested; thefirst aspect of manifestation is that of sound, and necessarily therefore wewould expect sound to be the first thing noticed by man on the physical plane,the plane of densest manifestation, and of the most marked effects of sound,regarding it as a creating factor. Pre-eminently the physical plane is the planeof hearing and hence the sense ascribed to the lowest plane of evolution, and ofeach of the five planes. On this seventh or lowest plane man has to come to fullcognisance of the effect of the Sacred Word as it is in process of soundingforth. As it reverberates throughout the system, it drives matter into itsappointed place, and on the physical plane finds its point of deepestmateriality and of most concrete demonstration. The key for man to discover andturn, concerns itself with the revealing of the mystery of:a. His own sound.b . His brother’s sound.c. His group sound.d. The sound of that one of the Heavenly Men with whom he is connected.e . The sound of the Logos, or the sound of nature; of the solar system, of theGrand Man of the Heavens.Therefore, we note that on the physical plane a man has to find his own note,finding it in spite of the density of the form.a. On the physical plane he finds his own note.b. On the astral plane he finds his brother’s note; through identity of emotionhe comes to the recognition of his brother’s identity. [191]c. On the mental plane he begins to find his group note.d . On the buddhic plane, or the plane of wisdom, he begins to find the note ofhis planetary Logos.e. On the atmic, or spiritual, plane the note logoic begins to sound within hisconsciousness.I am differentiating thus for the sake of clarity. In evolution itself, due tothe parallelism of nature, the distinctions are not so sharply made, and a man’sray, point of development, the work earlier accomplished, his temporarylimitations, and other causes create a seeming confusion, but in the greatscheme as seen from above downwards, the work proceeds as described.Hearing on the astral plane is commonly called clairaudience, and means theability to hear the sounds of the astral plane. It is a faculty thatdemonstrates throughout the entire astral body, and a man hears all over hisvehicle and not only through the specialised organs, the ears, the product ofphysical plane action and reaction. This would necessarily be so, owing to thefluidic nature of the astral body. Man on the physical plane hears at the sametime a certain range of sounds, and only a small and particular gamut ofvibrations impinges upon his ears. There are many of the lesser sounds of naturewhich entirely escape him, while the major group sounds are not differentiatedat all. As evolution proceeds and the inner sense of hearing becomes acute,these other physical plane sounds will likewise swing into his ken, and he willbe acutely conscious of all sounds on the astral, and the physical plane—athing, which if possible now, would result in the shattering of the body. If thenote of nature, for instance, were to strike but once upon the ear of a man (anote made up of the totality of vibrations produced by all dense material forms)his physical body would be completely disrupted. [192] He is not ready yet forsuch a happening; the inner ear is not duly prepared. Only when the threefoldhearing is consummated will completed hearing on the physical plane be likewisepermitted.Hearing on the mental plane is simply an extension of the faculty ofdifferentiating sound. The hearing dealt with on all these planes is the hearingthat has to do with the form, that concerns the vibration of matter, and that isoccupied with the not-self. It has not to do with the psyche, or the telepathiccommunication that proceeds from mind to mind, but with the sound of the form orthat power whereby one separated unit of consciousness is aware of another unitwho is not himself. Bear this carefully in mind. When the extension of hearingbecomes such that it concerns the psyche, then we call it telepathy or thatwordless communication that is the synthesis of hearing on all the three lowerplanes and which is known by the Ego in the causal body on the formless levelsof the mental plane.On the buddhic plane, hearing (now of the synthetic quality called telepathy)demonstrates as complete comprehension, for it has involved two things:1. A knowledge and recognition of individual sound,2. A similar knowledge of group sound,and their complete unification. This causes the most perfect comprehension, andis the secret of the Master’s power.On the atmic plane this perfected hearing is seen as beatitude. Sound, the basisof existence; sound, the method of being; sound, the final unifier; soundtherefore realised as the raison d’être , as the method of evolution, andtherefore as beatitude. ( 80 [text00028.html#Y_FN80] )[193] b. Touch . In taking up the subject of the second sense, that of touch ,we must note that this sense is pre-eminently the sense of very great importancein this, the second, solar system—a system of astral-buddhic consciousness. ( 81[text00028.html#Y_FN81] ) Each of these senses, after having reached a certainpoint, begins to synthesise with the others in such a way that it is almostimpossible to know where one begins and the other ends. Touch is that innaterecognition of contact through the exercise of manas or mind in a threefoldmanner:As recognition.As memory.As anticipation.Each of the five senses, when coupled with manas, develops within the subject aconcept embodying the past, the present and the future. Therefore when a man isvery highly evolved, has transcended time (as known in the three worlds), andcan therefore look at the three lower planes from the standpoint of the EternalNow, he has superseded the senses by full active consciousness. He knows , andneeds not the senses to guide him any longer to knowledge. But in time, and inthe three worlds, each sense on each plane is employed to convey to the Thinkersome aspect of the not-self, and by the aid [194] of mind, the Thinker can thenadjust his relationship thereto.Hearing gives him an idea of relative direction, and enables a man to fix hisplace in the scheme and to locate himself.Touch gives him an idea of relative quantity and enables him to fix his relativevalue as regards other bodies, extraneous to himself.Sight gives him an idea of proportion, and enables him to adjust his movementsto the movements of others.Taste gives him an idea of value, and enables him to fix upon that which to himappears best.Smell gives him an idea of innate quality, and enables him to find that whichappeals to him as of the same quality or essence as himself.In all these definitions it is necessary to bear in mind that the whole objectof the senses is to reveal the not-self, and to enable the Self therefore todifferentiate between the real and the unreal. ( 82 [text00028.html#Y_FN82] )[195] In the evolution of the senses, hearing is the first vague something whichcalls the attention of the apparently blind selfa. To another vibration.b . To something originating outside of itself.c. To the concept of externality. When sound is first contacted theconsciousness for the first time becomes aware of that which is without.But all that is grasped by the dormant consciousness (by means of this one senseof hearing) is the fact of something extraneous to itself, and of the directionin which that something lies. This apprehension, in course of time, calls intobeing another sense, that of touch. The Law of Attraction works, theconsciousness moves slowly outwards towards that which is heard; and whencontact is made with the not-self it is called touch. This touch conveys otherideas to the groping consciousness, ideas of size, of external texture, and ofsurface differences; the concept of the Thinker is thus slowly enlarged. He canhear and feel, but as yet knows not enough to correlate nor name. When hesucceeds in naming, he has made a big stride forward. We might note here,therefore, that the earliest cosmic symbols are applicable to the senses as wellas elsewhere:The point in the centre—consciousness and the not-self at a stage where soundalone is descriptive.The divided circle—consciousness aware of the not-self, through a dualrecognition.[196] Sight follows on this, the third sense, and the one definitely marking thecorrelation of ideas, or the relation between; it parallels the coming of Mind,both in time and function. We have hearing, touch or feeling, and then sight. Inconnection with the correspondence it is to be noted that sight came in with thethird root-race in this round, and that the third race saw also the coming in ofMind. The Self and the not-self were immediately correlated, and co-ordinated.Their close partnership became an accomplished fact, and evolution hastenedforward with renewed impetus.These three major senses (if I might so describe them) are very definitelyallied, each with one of the three Logoi:Hearing —The recognition of the fourfold word, the activity of matter, the thirdLogos.Touch —The recognition of the sevenfold Form Builder, the gathering together offorms, their approximation and interrelation, the second Logos. The Law ofAttraction between the Self and the not-self begins to work.Sight —The recognition of totality, the synthesis of all, the realisation of theOne in Many, the first Logos. The Law of Synthesis, operating between all formswhich the self occupies, and the recognition of the essential unity of allmanifestation by the means of sight.As regards taste and smell , we might call them minor senses, for they areclosely allied to the important sense of touch. They are practically subsidiaryto that sense. This second sense, and its connection with this second solarsystem, should be carefully pondered over. It is predominantly the sense mostclosely connected with the second Logos. This conveys a hint of much value ifduly considered. It is of value to study the extensions of physical plane touchon other planes and to see whither we are led. It is the faculty which enablesus to arrive [197] at the essence by due recognition of the veiling sheath. Itenables the Thinker who fully utilises it to put himself en rapport with theessence of all selves at all stages, and thereby to aid in the due evolution ofthe sheath and actively to serve. A Lord of Compassion is one who (by means oftouch) feels with, fully comprehends, and realises the manner in which to healand correct the inadequacies of the not-self and thus actively to serve the planof evolution. We should study likewise in this connection the value of touch asdemonstrated by the healers of the race (those on the Bodhisattva line) (83[text00028.html#Y_FN83] ) and the effect of the Law of Attraction and Repulsionas thus manipulated by them. Students of etymology will have noted that theorigin of the word touch is somewhat obscure, but probably means to ‘draw withquick motion.’ Herein lies the whole secret of this objective solar system, andherein will be demonstrated the quickening of vibration by means of touch.Inertia, mobility, rhythm, are the qualities manifested by the not-self. Rhythm,balance, and stable vibration are achieved by means of this very faculty oftouch or feeling. Let me illustrate briefly so as to make the problem somewhatclearer. What results in meditation? By dint of strenuous effort and dueattention to rules laid down, the aspirant succeeds in touching matter of aquality rarer than is his usual custom. He contacts his causal body, in time hecontacts the matter of the buddhic plane. By means of this touch his ownvibration is temporarily and briefly quickened. Fundamentally we are broughtback to the subject that we deal with in this treatise. The latent fire ofmatter attracts to itself that fire, latent in other forms. They touch, andrecognition and awareness ensues. The fire of manas burns continuously and isfed by that which is attracted and repulsed. When the two [198] blend, thestimulation is greatly increased and the ability to touch intensified. The Lawof Attraction persists in its work until another fire is attracted and touched,and the threefold merging is completed. Forget not in this connection themystery of the Rod of Initiation. ( 84 [text00028.html#Y_FN84] ) Later when weconsider the subject of the centres and Initiation it must be remembered that weare definitely studying one aspect of this mysterious faculty of touch, thefaculty of the second Logos, wielding the law of Attraction.Let us now finish what may be imparted on the remaining three senses—sight,taste, smell—and then briefly sum up their relationship to the centres, andtheir mutual action and interaction. That will then leave two more points to bedealt with in this first division of the Treatise on Cosmic Fire, and a summingup. We shall then be in a position to take up that portion of the treatise thatdeals with the fire of manas and with the development of the manasaputras, (85[text00028.html#Y_FN85] ) both in their totality and likewise individually. Thistopic is of the most imperative importance as it deals entirely with man, theEgo, the thinker, and shows the cosmic blending of the fires of matter and ofmind, and their utilisation by the indwelling Flame.c. Sight. This sense, as said before, is the paramount correlating sense of thesolar system.Under the Law of Economy man hears. Sound permeates matter and is the basis ofits subsequent heterogeneity.Under the Law of Attraction, man touches and makes contact with that which isbrought to his attention [199] through sound waves of activity. This leads to acondition of mutual repulsion and attraction between the one who apprehends andthat which is apprehended.Having apprehended and then contacted his eyes are opened and he recognises hisplace in the whole order under the Law of Synthesis.Hearing Unity Touch Duality Sight Triplicity.In these three senses the present is summed up for us. The work of evolution isto recognise, utilise, co-ordinate, and dominate the whole till the Self, bymeans of these three, becomes actively aware of every form, of every vibration,and of every pulsation of the not-self; then, through the arranging power ofmind, the objective of the self will be to find the truth, or that centre in thecircle of manifestation which is, for the Self, the centre of equilibrium, andthe one point where the co-ordination is perfected; then the Self can dissociateitself from every veil, every contact, and every sense. This leads in everymanifestation to three types of separation:Involution. The separation of matter, or the one becoming the many. The sensesare developed, and the apparatus is perfected by the Self for the utilisation ofmatter. This is under the Law of Economy.Evolution up to the time of the Probationary Path. The merging of Spirit andmatter, and the utilisation of the senses in a progressing identification of theSelf with all forms from the lowest to those relatively refined. This is underthe Law of Attraction.Evolution on the Path. Again the separation of spirit from matter, itsidentification with the One, and the ultimate rejection of form. The senses thenare synthesised into acquired faculty, and the Self has no [200] further use forthe not-self. It blends with the All-Self. This is under the Law of Synthesis.If this is borne in mind it leads to a realisation that the separation of theSpirit from the material vehicle involves two aspects of the One great All;herein is seen the work of the Creator, the Preserver and the Destroyer.In the final perfection of this third sense of sight, the term used is thewholly inadequate one of realisation . Let the student study carefully thelowest and highest demonstration of the senses as laid down in the tabulationearlier imparted, and note the occult significance of the expressions used inthe summation.Hearing Beatitude. This is realised through the not-self. Touch Service. Thesummation of the work of the Self for the not-self. Sight Realisation.Recognition of the triplicity needed in manifestation, or the reflex action ofthe Self and the not-self. Taste Perfection. Evolution completed through theutilisation of the not-self and its realised adequacy. Smell PerfectedKnowledge. The principle of manas in its discriminating activity, perfecting theinter-relation between the Self and the not-self.This all concerns the perfected, realised Personality.In all these perfections is seen the awareness of the Self, and the gradedprocess of identification, utilisation, manipulation and final rejection of thenot-self by that Self who is now consciously aware. He hears the note of natureand that of his monad; he recognises their identity, utilises their vibration,and passes rapidly through the three stages of Creator, Preserver and Destroyer.[201] He touches or feels the vibration of the form or not-self in all itsvarious grades, recognises his identity in time and space, and for purposes ofexistence or being and by means of the three Laws of Economy, Attraction andSynthesis utilises, blends and eventually dissociates himself. He sees thethreefold evolutionary process and by means of the development of the innervision, sees within the heart of the system macrocosmic and microcosmic, the oneSELF in many forms, and finally identifies himself with that one Self by theconscious rejection of the not-self after its complete subjugation andutilisation.d. Tasting . He tastes then finally and discriminates, for taste is the greatsense that begins to hold sway during the discriminating process that takesplace when the illusory nature of matter is in process of realisation.Discrimination is the educatory process to which the Self subjects itself in theprocess of developing intuition—that faculty whereby the Self recognises its ownessence in and under all forms. Discrimination concerns the duality of nature,the Self and the not-self, and is the means of their differentiation in theprocess of abstraction; the intuition concerns unity and is the capacity of theSelf to contact other selves, and is not a faculty whereby the not-self iscontacted. Hence, its rarity these days owing to the intense individualisationof the Ego, and its identification with the form—necessary identification atthis particular time. As the sense of taste on the higher planes is developed,it leads one to ever finer distinctions till one is finally led through theform, right to the heart of one’s nature.e. Smelling is the faculty of keen perception that eventually brings a man backto the source from whence he came, the archetypal plane, the plane where histrue home is to be found. A perception of difference has been cultivated thathas caused a divine discontent within the [202] heart of the Pilgrim in the farcountry; the prodigal son draws comparisons; he has developed the other foursenses, and he utilises them. Now comes in the faculty of vibratory recognitionof the home vibration , if it might be so expressed. It is the spiritualcounterpart of that sense which in the animal, the pigeon and other birds, leadsthem back unerringly to the familiar spot from whence they originally came. Itis the apprehension of the vibration of the Self, and a swift return by means ofthat instinct to the originating source.The consideration of this subject awakens the realisation of the vastness of theregion of thought concerned—the region of the whole evolutionary development ofthe human being. Yet all that is possible here, as elsewhere, is to indicatelines of thought for careful pondering, and to emphasise certain ideas which mayserve as the foundation thoughts for the future mental activity of the immediategeneration. The following facts must also be borne in mind when considering thematter:a. That the senses have been dealt with in this division of our Treatise onCosmic Fire because they concern the material form. Strictly speaking the fivesenses, as we know them, are the means of contact built up by the Thinker(polarised in his etheric body) and find their expression in the physical formin those nerve centres, brain cells, ganglia and plexus which exoteric sciencerecognises.b. That these senses for all purposes of present manifestation, have their focalpoint on the astral plane and are therefore largely under the stimulating actionof the solar plexus—that great focal point in the centre of the body which isthe stimulating agent for most of the human family at this time.c. That as the higher triangle comes into play and the polarisation steps up tothe higher centres, the senses begin to make themselves felt on the mental leveland [203] man becomes aware on that plane. We have in the human body aninteresting reflection of the transference of the polarisation from thePersonality to the Ego, or into the causal body, in the division that existsbetween the higher and the lower mental planes, and the dividing line of thediaphragm between the higher and the lower portions of the body. Below thediaphragm we have the four lower centres:1. The solar plexus.2. The spleen.3. Organs of generation.4. Base of the spine.Above are the three higher:1. Heart.2. Throat.3. Head.In the microcosm we have the lower quaternary separated from the Triad in asimilar manner, and this analogy will bear pondering upon. By careful thought wecan therefore work out the reflex action of the centres and the senses from thestandpoint of the different planes, remembering that as the centres are awakenedthe process will be threefold:First. The awakening on the physical plane, and the gradually increasingactivity of the centres, until the Probationary Path is reached. This isparalleled by the increasing use of the senses, and their constant utilisationfor the identification of the self and its sheaths.Second. The awakening on the astral plane, and the gradually increasing activityof the centres, until the first Initiation is reached. This is paralleled by thetremendously keen use of the senses for the purposes of discriminating betweenthe Self and the not-self. [204]Third. The awakening upon the mental plane, and the gradually increasingactivity of the centres and the senses. The effect in both cases tends toidentification of the Self with its own essence in all groups and the rejectionof the sheaths and the forms.This development is paralleled on the two higher planes simultaneously as in thelower, and as the astral senses come into perfected activity, the correspondingcentres of force on the buddhic plane begin to function until the vibratoryinterplay between the two is consummated, and the force of the Triad can be feltdefinitely in the Personality via the astral.Again the corresponding vortices on the atmic level come into active vibrationas the mental centres become fourth dimensional, till we have a wonderful fieryactivity demonstrating on all the three planes.From the point of view of fire, ( 86 [text00028.html#Y_FN86] ) leaving the auraand [205] its colors out of temporary consideration, the evolutionarydevelopment marks an equally definite process.a . The vivification of the inner heat of the sheaths, or the tiny point of firelatent in every individual atom of matter. This process proceeds in all threebodies, at first slowly, then more rapidly, and finally simultaneously andsynthetically.b. The bringing into activity from latency of the seven centres on all planes,beginning from the bottom upwards, until the centres (according to ray and type)are interrelated and co-ordinated. There are manifest thirty-five vortices offire in the perfected adept,—all of radiant activity and all interacting.c. The vortices or wheels of lambent flame become interlinked by triangles offire which pass and circulate from one to another, till we have a web of fierylines, uniting centres of living fire, and giving truth to the statement thatthe Sons of Mind are FLAMES.d. These centres reach this condition of perfection as the Spirit or Will aspecttakes ever fuller control. The unifying triangles are produced by the action ofthe fire of mind, while the fire of matter holds the form together in orderedsequence. So the interdependence of matter, mind and Spirit can be seen anddemonstrates to the eye of the clairvoyant as the co-ordination of the threefires.e. In the Heavenly Man and His body, a chain of globes (87[text00028.html#Y_FN87] ) likewise can be seen and we need here to remember[206] very carefully that the seven chains of a scheme are the expression of aplanetary Logos. The Heavenly Men are expressing Themselves through a scheme ofseven chains and the emphasis has been laid unduly, perhaps, upon the densephysical planet in any particular chain. This has caused the fact of the chainimportance to be somewhat overlooked. Each of the seven chains might be lookedupon as picturing the seven centres of one of the Heavenly Men. The idea ofgroups of Egos forming centres in the Heavenly Men is nevertheless correct, butin this connection the reference is to the centres of force on buddhic andmonadic levels. ( 88 [text00028.html#Y_FN88] )[207] In connection with this there is a fundamental point that must never beforgotten: these seven Heavenly Men might be considered as being in physicalincarnation through the medium of a physical planet, and herein lies the mysteryof planetary evolution. Herein lies the mystery of our planet, the mostmysterious of all the planets. Just as the karma of individuals differs, sodiffers the karma of the various Logoi, and the karma of our planetary Logos hasbeen a heavy one, and veiled in the mystery of personality at this time.Again, according as the centres are active or inactive, so the manifestationdiffers likewise, and the study which opens up is of vast and abstruse interestin connection with the solar system.5. The Centres and InitiationWe have dealt briefly with the evolution of the centres, with their function,their organisation and their gradually increasing activity from a point ofcomparative inertia until they are consummated motion. Then they become livingwheels of flame, distinguished by a dual motion of the periphery and the innerrevolving wheels, and by a fourth-dimensional effect, due primarily to thealignment of the inner subtler vortices with the comparatively exoteric ethericcentres. This alignment is brought about eventually at initiation.At the time that initiation is taken, the centres are all active and the lowerfour (which correspond to the Personality) are beginning the process oftranslating the fire into the three higher. The dual revolution in the lowercentres is clearly to be seen and the three higher are commencing to besimilarly active. By the application of the Rod of Initiation at the time of theinitiation ceremony, certain results are achieved in connection with the centreswhich might be enumerated as follows:a. The fire at the base of the spine is definitely directed [208] to whichevercentre is the object of special attention. This varies according to the Ray, orthe specialised work of the initiate.b . The centre has its activity intensified, its rate of evolution increased,and certain of the central spokes of the wheel brought into more activeradiance. These spokes which are also called by some students lotus-petals, havea close connection with the different spirillae in the permanent atoms. Throughtheir stimulation there comes into play one or more of the correspondingspirillae in the permanent atoms on the three lower planes. After the thirdInitiation, a corresponding stimulation takes place in the permanent atoms ofthe Triad, leading to the co-ordination of the buddhic vehicle, and thetransference of the lower polarisation into the higher.c. By the application of the Rod of Initiation the downflow of force from theEgo to the personality is tripled, the direction of that force being dependentupon whether the centres receiving attention are the etheric, or the astral atthe first and second Initiations, or whether the initiate is standing before theLORD OF THE WORLD. In the latter case, his mental centres or their correspondingforce vortices on higher levels, will receive stimulation. When the WorldTeacher initiates at the first and second Initiations, the direction of theTriadal force is turned to the vivification of the heart, and throat centres,and the ability to synthesise the force of the lower centres is greatlyincreased. When the One Initiator applies the Rod of His Power, the downflow isfrom the Monad, and though the throat and heart intensify vibration as aresponse, the main direction of the force is to the seven head centres, andfinally (at liberation) to the radiant head centre above, and synthesising thelesser seven head centres.d. The centres at initiation receive a fresh access of [209] vibratory capacityand of power, and this results, in the exoteric life, as:First. A sensitiveness and refinement of the vehicles which may result, atfirst, in much suffering to the initiate, but which produces a capacity torespond to contacts that far outweighs the incidental pain.Second. A development of psychic faculty that again may lead to temporarydistress, but which eventually causes a recognition of the one Self in allselves, which is the goal of endeavor.Third. A burning away, through a gradual arousing of kundalini, and its correctgeometrical progression through the etheric web. This produces a resultantcontinuity of consciousness which enables the initiate consciously to utilisetime as a factor in the plans of evolution.Fourth. A gradual grasp of the Law of Vibration as an aspect of the basic law ofbuilding; the initiate learns consciously to build, to manipulate thought matterfor the perfecting of the plans of the Logos, to work in mental essence, and toapply the law of mental levels and thereby affect the physical plane. Motionoriginates cosmically on cosmic mental levels, and in the microcosm the sameorder will be seen. There is an occult hint here that will reveal much ifpondered upon. At initiation, at the moment of the application of the Rod, theinitiate consciously realises the meaning of the Law of Attraction in formbuilding, and in the synthesis of the three fires. Upon his ability to retainthat realisation and himself to apply the law, will depend his power andprogress.e. By the application of the Rod, the fire of kundalini is aroused, and itsupward progress directed. The fire at the base of the spine, and the fire ofmind are [210] directed along certain routes, or triangles, by the action of theRod as it moves in a specified manner. There is a definite occult reason, underthe Laws of Electricity, behind the known fact that every initiate, presented tothe Initiator, is accompanied by two of the Masters, who stand one on eitherside of him. The three of them together form a triangle which makes the workpossible.The force of the Rod is twofold, and its power terrific. Apart and alone theinitiate could not receive the voltage from the Rod without serious hurt, but intriangular formation transmission comes safely. The two Masters Who thus sponsorthe initiate, represent two polarities of the electric All; part of Their workis therefore to stand with all applicants for initiation when they come beforethe Great Lord.When the Rods of Initiation are held in the hands of the Initiator in Hisposition of power, and at the stated seasons, they act as transmitters ofelectric force from very high levels,—so high indeed that the “Flaming Diamond”at certain of the final initiations (the sixth and seventh) transmits force, viathe Logos, from outside the system altogether. We need to remember that thismajor Rod is the one used on this planet, but that within the system there areseveral such Rods of Power, and that they are to be found in three grades, if itmay be so expressed.First. The Rod of Initiation used for the first two initiations and wielded bythe Great Lord, the Christ, the World Teacher. It is magnetised by applicationof the “Flaming Diamond”—the magnetisation being repeated when each new worldTeacher takes office. There is a wonderful ceremony performed at the time that anew World Teacher takes up His work. During the ceremony He receives His Rod ofPower—the same Rod as used since the foundation of our planetary Hierarchy—andholds it forth to the Lord of the World, Who touches it [211] with His ownmighty Rod, causing a fresh re-charging of its electric capacity. This ceremonytakes place at Shamballa. ( 89, 90 [text00028.html#Y_FN89] )Second. The Rod of Initiation known as the “Flaming Diamond” and used by SanatKumara, the One Initiator, called in the Bible, the Ancient of Days. This Rodlies hidden “in the East” and holds the fire latent which irradiates the WisdomReligion. This Rod was brought by the Lord of the World when He took form andcame to our planet eighteen million years ago.Once in every world period it is subjected to a similar process as that of thelesser Rod, only this time it is recharged by the direct action of the LogosHimself,—the Logos of the solar system. The location of this Rod is known onlyto the Lord of the World, and to the Chohans of the Rays, and (being thetalisman of this evolution) the Chohan of the second Ray is—under the Lord ofthe World—its main guardian, aided by the deva Lord of the second plane. TheBuddhas of activity are responsible for its custody, and under them the Chohanof the Ray. It is produced only at stated times when specific work has to bedone. It is used not only at the initiating of men, but at certain planetaryfunctions, of which nothing as yet has been given out. It has its place andfunction in certain ceremonies connected with the inner round ( 91[text00028.html#Y_FN91] ) and the triangle formed by the Earth, Mars [212] andMercury. But more about this is not at this time permissible.Third. The Rod of Initiation, wielded by the Logos of the solar system, iscalled among other things, the “Sevenfold Flaming Fire.” It was confided to ourLogos by the Lord of Sirius and sent to our system from that radiant sun. One ofits purposes is for use in emergencies. This great talisman has never yet beenemployed in this particular manner, though twice it was nearly thus used,—oncein Atlantean days, and once in the third year of the late war. This Rod of Poweris used at the initiation of the seven Heavenly Men on cosmic levels. It is usedalso in the initiation of groups, a thing almost incomprehensible to us. It isapplied to the centres of the seven Heavenly Men in the same general way as thelesser Rods are applied to the human centres, and the effects are the same, onlyon a vaster scale. This, needless to say, is a vast and abstruse subject, andconcerns not the sons of men. It is but touched upon, as an enumeration of theRods of Initiation would be incomplete without some reference to it, and itserves to show the wondrous synthesis of the whole, and the place of the systemwithin an even greater scheme. In all things cosmic, perfect law and order arefound, and the ramifications of the plan can be seen on all planes and allsubplanes. This greatest Rod is in the care of the first great group of karmicLords. It might be described as the Rod which carries a voltage of pure fohaticforce from cosmic levels. The two lesser Rods carry differentiated fohaticforce. This logoic Rod of Power is kept within the Sun, and is only re-chargedat the beginning of every one hundred years of Brahma.The reason why the Rods of Power are here discussed is that they have definitelyto do with the centres which are force vortices in matter and which (thoughchannels [213] for spiritual force, or centres wherein the ‘will to be’ findsexpression) demonstrate as activity in matter. They are the centres ofexistence, and just as one cannot, in manifestation, dissociate the two poles ofSpirit and matter, so one cannot, in initiation apply the Rod without bringingabout definite effects between the two. The Rods are charged with Fohat which isfire of matter plus electric fire, hence their effect. The mystery cannot beexplained in greater detail as the secrets of initiation are not transmissible.More has been here imparted on this matter than hitherto, though there are thosewho have heard these things."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION F - THE LAW OF ECONOMY[214] I. Its effect in matter .1. Dissociation of atoms.2. Distribution of atoms.3. Vibratory rhythm.4. Heterogeneity.5. Inherent rotary activity.II. Its subsidiary laws.1. The law of vibration.2. The law of adaptation.3. The law of repulsion.4. The law of friction.I. ITS EFFECT IN MATTERThis law is the law governing the matter aspect of manifestation, and is the lawcharacterising the work of the third Logos, and of the entities who are theembodiment of His will and the agents of His purposes. Each of the great cosmicEntities who take form as the three Logoi, is distinguished by different methodsof activity, which might be described thus:The third Aspect or Brahma aspect of the activities of those Entities who areHis expression, is characterised by that method in the distribution of matterwhich we call the Law of Economy. It is the law governing the scattering of theatoms of matter and their dissociation from one another, wide distribution,vibratory rhythm, [215] heterogeneity and quality and their inherent rotaryaction. This Law of Economy causes matter always to follow the line of leastresistance, and is the basis of the separative action of atomic matter. Itgoverns matter, the opposite pole of spirit.The second Aspect , the building, or Vishnu aspect, is governed by the Law ofAttraction; the activities of the entities who embody this aspect are directedto the attracting of matter to Spirit, and the gradual approximation of the twopoles. It results in cohesion, in the production of congeries of atoms invarious formations, and this attraction is brought about by the attractive powerof Spirit itself. It shows itself in:1. Association,2. Form building,3. Adaptation of form to vibration,4. Relative homogeneity of group unity,5. Cyclic spiralling movement.The line of least resistance is not the law for this aspect. The attractivepower of Spirit in form-building, and in the adaptation of the form to the need,is the secret of the pain and resistance in the world; pain is only caused byresistance, and is a necessary phase in the process of evolution. This law ofattraction is the law governing the Spirit, the opposite pole of matter.The first Aspect , or the will to exist, is governed by the Law of Synthesis,and the activities of the cosmic entities who are its embodiments are governedby the law of enforced unity, and of essential homogeneity. It is the law thateventually comes into play after spirit and matter are blending, and adaptingthemselves each to each; it governs the eventual synthesis of Self with Self,and finally with the All-Self, and also of essence with essence incontra-distinction to the synthesis of matter and Spirit. It demonstrates as:[216]1. Abstraction,2. Spiritual liberation,3. Destruction of form through the withdrawal of Spirit (the Destroyer aspect)4. Absolute homogeneity and absolute essential unity,5. Progressive forward motion.Thus can be seen the wonderful synthesis brought about by the evolutionaryworking of these three cosmic laws,—each of them embodying the mode of work ofcertain cosmic Entities or Existences . The final two will be taken up in theirright place. Now we will touch but briefly upon the law of matter, that ofEconomy.This is the law that lies back of what has been mistakenly called “The Fall” byreligious writers, by which is defined in reality the involutionary process,cosmically considered. It led to a sevenfold differentiation in the matter ofthe system. Just as the Law of Attraction led to the sevenfold psychicdifferentiation of the Sons of Mind, and the Law of Synthesis results in thesevenfold perfection of the same Manasaputras, so we have an interestingconnection betweenThe seven planes, or the seven grades of matter.The seven Heavenly Men, the seven Divine Manasaputras, or the seven types ofwisdom-love.The seven qualities of wisdom, which are produced by the cosmic entities, theKumaras by the aid of knowledge through the medium of matter.This Law of Economy has several subsidiary laws which govern its effects on thedifferent grades of matter. As said before, this is the Law swept into action bythe sounds as uttered by the Logos. The Sacred Word, or the uttered Sound of theCreator, exists in different forms, and though in reality but one Word, hasseveral syllables. The syllables all together form a solar [217] phrase;separated they form certain words of power, producing different effects. ( 92[text00028.html#Y_FN92] )The great WORD that peals through one hundred years of Brahma or persists inreverberation throughout a solar system, is the sacred sound of A U M. Indifferentiation and as heard in time and space, each of those three mysticletters stands for the first letter of a subsidiary phrase, consisting ofvarious sounds. One letter, with a sequence of four sounds, makes up thevibration or note of Brahma, which is the intelligence aspect dominant inmatter. Hence the mystery hidden in [218] the pentagon, in the fifth principleof mind, and in the five planes of human evolution. These five letters whensounded forth on the right note, give the key to the true inwardness of matterand also to its control,—this control being based on the right interpretation ofthe Law of Economy.Another phrase, this time of seven letters, or a letter for each of the sevenHeavenly Men, embodies the sound or note of the Vishnu aspect, the second aspectlogoic, the form-building aspect. By its correct or partial sounding, by itscomplete or incomplete reverberation, are the forms built and adapted. The Lawof Attraction finds expression in the manipulation of matter and its weldinginto form for the use of Spirit.Then a third Word or phrase is added to the other two, completing the entireWord logoic and producing consummation. It is a Word of nine letters, makingtherefore the twenty-one sounds (5 + 7 + 9) of this solar system. The final ninesounds produce spiritual synthesis, and the dissociation of the spirit from theform. We have a correspondence in the nine Initiations, each initiation markinga more perfect union of the Self with the All-Self, and a further liberationfrom the trammels of matter.When the sense of hearing on all planes is perfected (which is brought about bythe Law of Economy rightly understood) these three great Words or phrases willbe known . The Knower will utter them in his own true key, thus blending his ownsound with the entire volume of vibration, and thereby achieving suddenrealisation of his essential identity with Those Who utter the words. As thesound of matter or of Brahma peals forth in his ears on all the planes, he willsee all forms as illusion and will be freed, knowing himself as omnipresent. Asthe sound of Vishnu reverberates within himself, he knows himself as perfectedwisdom, and distinguishes [219] the note of his being (or that of the HeavenlyMan in whose Body he finds place) from the group notes, and knows himself asomniscient. As the note of the first or Mahadeva aspect, follows upon the othertwo, he realises himself as pure Spirit and on the consummation of the chord ismerged in the Self, or the source from which he came. Mind is not, matter isnot, and nought is left but the Self merged in the ocean of the Self. At eachstage of relative attainment, one of the laws comes into sway,—first the law ofmatter, then the law of groups, to be succeeded by the law of Spirit and ofliberation.II. THE SUBSIDIARY LAWSThe subsidiary laws under the Law of Economy are four in number, dealing withthe lower quaternary:1. The Law of Vibration , dealing with the key note or measure of the matter ofeach plane. By knowledge of this law the material of any plane in its sevendivisions can be controlled. 2. The Law of Adaptation , is the law governing therotary movement of any atom on every plane and subplane. 3. The Law of Repulsion, governs that relationship between atoms, which results in their non-attachmentand in their complete freedom from each other; it also keeps them rotating atfixed points from the globe or sphere of opposite polarity. 4. The Law ofFriction, governs the heat aspect of any atom, the radiation of an atom, and theeffect of that radiation on any other atom.Every atom of matter can be studied in four aspects, and is governed by one orother, or all of the four above mentioned laws.a. An atom vibrates to a certain measure.b. It rotates at a certain speed. [220]c. It acts and reacts upon its environing atoms.d . It adds its quota to the general heat of the atomic system, whatever thatmay be.These general rules relating to atomic bodies can be extended not only to theatoms of the physical plane, but to all spheroidal bodies within the system, andincluding the system also, regarding it as a cosmic atom.The tiny atom of the physical plane, a plane itself, a planet, and a solarsystem all evolve under these rules, and all are governed by the Law of Economyin one of its four aspects.It might be added in closing, that this law is one that initiates have to masterbefore They can achieve liberation. They have to learn to manipulate matter, andto work with energy or force in matter under this law; they have to utilisematter and energy in order to achieve the liberation of Spirit, and to bring tofruition the purposes of the Logos in the evolutionary process."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO.

The seven rootraces and subraces?Before taking up the subject of the fire of mind under the schedule alreadyoutlined, it might be of profit if certain facts are here pointed out, and oneor two points clarified. The subject we are undertaking to elucidate is one ofprofound mystery, and is the basis of all that is now seen and known, bothobjectively and subjectively. We have somewhat studied that pole ofmanifestation called matter . The subject we are now entering upon concernsseveral things which might be considered in general terms as Consciousness , andin specified terms as including the following subjects,—hence its fundamentalimportance. [224]a . The science of objectivity.b. The manifestation of the Son through the Sun and its attendant spheres, orthe solar system in its entirety.c. The evolutionary development of consciousness in time and space, therefore,the evolution of spirit and matter.If the above three fundamentals are studied, it will be noted that they are verycomprehensive, and, therefore, from the immensity of the theme, it will not bepossible to do more than attempt to bring a general clarity of conception as tothe broad outline of the process, and as to the gradual development ofconsciousness. For the sake of an intelligent following of this matter, it mightbe wise first to lay down a number of propositions which—(even if already knownand appreciated)—will serve students as the scaffolding on which to erect theintended structure of knowledge. If a student of the Wisdom can grasp the natureof the general theme, he can then more easily and accurately fit the detailedinformation into its appropriate niche. Perhaps the best plan would be toformulate certain questions, and then proceed to answer them,—the answers toembody therefore the propositions that will be laid down. These questions arisenaturally to the student of the Secret Doctrine , when he has reached the pointwhere the big plan is becoming visible to him, but the pile of detailed materialto be built in remains, as yet, inchoate. The questions we might ask and studyare the following:1. What is the relationship of the Son to the Sun?2. What is evolution and how does it proceed?3. Why is this solar system evolving along the lines of duality?4. What is consciousness and what is its place in the present scheme of things?[225]5. Is there a direct analogy between the development of the following factors: asolar system, a planet, a man, and an atom?6. What is the mind aspect and why is the manasic or mental principle of suchimportance? Who are the Manasaputras, or the Sons of Mind?7. Why is the progress of evolution cyclic?8. Why, as yet, do we consider certain knowledge as esoteric, and other aspectsof knowledge as exoteric?9. What is the relationship betweena . The ten planetary schemes?b. The seven sacred planets?c. The seven globes in a chain?d . The seven rounds in a globe?e. The seven root races and the subraces?When we have endeavored to answer in brief and concise fashion these ninequestions, and have grasped, through their replies, something of the purposelying behind the evolution of the consciousness of the Son (with all that isincluded in that expression) we shall be in a position to go more intelligentlyinto a consideration of the plan, and to grasp more accurately the immediatestage ahead to be attained, working from our present standpoint as a basis.We must ever remember that a curious interest and a far-seeing grasp of the planof the Logos is of no importance to a man unless he correlates the present withthat which he believes to lie in the future, unless he ascertains the pointachieved, and realises wherein consists the work immediately to be undertaken inthis gradual process of attaining full consciousness. [226]CHART IVChart of the Pleroma according to Valentinus[Image00008.jpg]First the (Point), the Monad , Bythus (the Deep), the unknown and the unknowableFather. Then the (triangle), Bythus and the first emanated pair or Duad , Nous(Mind) and its syzygy Aletheia (Truth), Then the (Square), the dual Duad,Tetractys or Quaternary , two males ||, the Logos (Word) and Anthrôpos (Man),two females, their syzygies, = Zoê (Life) and Ekklesia (the Church or Assembly),Seven in all . The triangle, the Potentiality of Spirit, the Square thePotentiality of Matter; the vertical straight line the Potency of Spirit, andthe horizontal the Potency of Matter. Next comes the Pentagram, the Pentad , themysterious symbol of the Manasaputras or Sons of Wisdom, which together withtheir syzygies make 10, or the Decad ; and last of all, the Hexalpha orinterlaced Triangles the Hexad which with their syzygies make 12, or the Dodecad. Such are the contents of the Pleroma or Completion, the Ideas in the Divinemind , 28 in all, for Bythus or the Father is not reckoned, as it is the Root ofall. The two small circles within the Pleroma are the syzygy Christos-Pneuma(Christ and the Holy Spirit): these are after -emanations, and, as such, formone aspect, typify the descent of Spirit to inform and evolve Matter, whichessentially proceeds from the same source; and another, the desent orincarnation of the Kumâras or the Higher Egos of Humanity.From “Lucifer” for May 1890-->I. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SON TO THE SUN?This question brings us primarily to a consideration as to Who is the Son, andwhat is His function. Two [227] factors are universally recognised in allsystems that merit the name of philosophy; they are the two factors of spiritand matter, of purusha and prakriti. There is at times a tendency to confoundsuch terms as “life and form,” “consciousness and the vehicle of consciousness”with the terms “Spirit and matter.” They are related, but clarity of view wouldbe facilitated if it were realised that prior to manifestation , or to the birthof a solar system, it is more correct to utilise the words, Spirit and matter.When these two are inter-related during manifestation , and after the cessationof the pralayic interval or interlude between two systems, then the terms, lifeand form, consciousness and its vehicles, are more correct, for during theperiod of abstraction consciousness is not, form is not, and life, demonstratingas an actual principle, is not. There is Spirit-substance but in a state ofquiescence, of utter neutrality, of negativity, and of passivity. Inmanifestation the two are approximated; they interact upon each other; activitysupersedes quiescence; positivity replaces negativity; movement is seen in placeof passivity, and the two primordial factors are no longer neutral to eachother, but attract and repulse, interact and utilise. Then and only then, can wehave form animated by life, and consciousness demonstrated through appropriatevehicles.How can this be expressed? In terms of fire, when the two electric poles arebrought into definite relationship we have demonstrated, along the line ofoccult sight and of occult feeling, both heat and light. This relationship isbrought about and perfected during the evolutionary process. This heat and lightare produced by the union of the two poles, or by the occult marriage of maleand female, of Spirit (father) and matter (mother). In terms of the physical,this union produces the objective solar system, the Son of the Father and theMother. In terms of the subjective, it produces the Sun, as the sum total of[228] the qualities of light and heat. In terms of fire, by the union orat-one-ment of electric fire (Spirit) and fire by friction (energised matter)solar fire is produced. This solar fire will be distinguished above all else byits evolutionary development, and by the gradual intensification of the heat tobe felt, and of the light to be seen.For a clearer comprehension of this abstract matter, we might consider themicrocosm, or man evolving in the three worlds. Man is the product of theapproximation (at present imperfect) of the two poles of Spirit (the Father inHeaven) and of matter (the Mother). The result of this union is anindividualised Son of God, or unit of the divine Self, an exact replica inminiature on the lowest plane of the great Son of God, the All-Self, who is inHimself the totality of all the miniature sons, of all the individualisedSelves, and of each and every unit. The microcosm, expressed in other terms orfrom the subjective point of view, is a miniature sun distinguished by thequalities of heat and light. At present that light is “under the bushel,” ordeeply hidden by a veil of matter, but in due process of evolution it will shineforth to such an extent that the veils will be lost from sight in a blaze ofexceeding glory. At present the microcosmic heat is of small degree, or themagnetic radiation between the microcosmic units is but little felt (in theoccult significance of the term), but as time proceeds, the emanations ofheat,—due to intensification of the inner flame, coupled with the assimilatedradiation of other units—will increase, and become of such proportions that theinteraction between the individualised Selves will result in the merging toperfection of the flame within each one, and a blending of the heat; this willproceed until there is “one flame with countless sparks” within it, until theheat is general and balanced. When this is the case and each Son of God is aperfected Sun, characterised by perfectly expressed light and heat, [229] thenthe entire solar system, the greater Son of God, will be the perfected Sun.The system will then be characterised by a “blaze of refulgent glory,” and by aradiation that will link it up with its cosmic centre, and thus effect theliberation of the Son, and His return to the far distant source from whence theprimal impulse originated. Therefore, bear in mind:First , that the Son is the radiant result of the union of Spirit and Matter,and may be considered as the totality of the solar system, the Sun and the sevensacred planets.Second , that the Son manifests through his qualities of light and heat, as doesthe solar Sun.Third , that the Son is the product of the electrical union of “fire byfriction” and electric fire, and is Himself “solar fire” or the manifestation ofthe other two, hence that which is seen and that which is felt.Finally , that the Son, therefore, is the middle manifestation, and is producedby that which is above, and that which is below, in the occult sense. Therefore,the Son on His own plane (the cosmic mental plane), is the egoic body of theLogos in the same sense as the egoic body of the microcosm is the product of theunion of the Monad, or Spirit, and matter. Just as the body egoic of man (thatwhich is called the causal body) is only in process of formation, and is not yetperfected, so we may predicate the same of the solar system, as it expresses theLife of God. It is in process of perfecting. The Son, manifesting through theSun and its sphere of influence, is yet in a state of gradual development, andnot until each cell within His body is fully alive and vibrating to a uniformmeasure, will He be “full grown” and perfected. Not until His radiation and Hisdisplay of light is perfectly seen and felt, will His place among the heavenlyconstellations (the Son of God in a cosmic sense) be fully achieved.[230] Not until each cell in His body is a sphere of radiant glory—a blaze offire and light, and a source of magnetic radiation or heat, occultly expressed,will the Son in the Heavens “shine forth.” From the cosmic point of view, as weknow, our sun is but of the fourth order, and on the lowest cosmic plane. Whenthe Son has, through the Sun, attained full expression (that is, perfected Hisdisplay of light and heat) then He will shine forth upon another plane, that ofthe cosmic mental. We have the analogy in the microcosm or man. When a man’slight fully shines forth, when his magnetic radiation has reached the stage ofvivid interaction or group activity, then he has attained full self-expression,and has included within his sphere of influence and control the mental plane. Heis then considered a Master. He also is of the fourth order; he is thequaternary. The etheric plane is the centre of his life in the physical sense,just as we are told that the sun and the planets esoterically are considered asexisting in etheric matter. As above, so below, is the occult law. Therefore,the relationship of the Son of the Father, and of the Mother, is to the Sun thesame as man’s relationship to the vehicle through which he functions. It is Hismode of enterprise, His vehicle of expression; it is the form which His lifeanimates for the specific purpose ofa. Gaining experience.b . Making contact.c . Developing full self-knowledge.d . Achieving full mastery or control.e. Attaining “manhood” cosmically. The cosmic Christ must measure up to thestature “of a full grown man,” as it is expressed in the Christian Bible.(Ep.,4:13)f . Expanding His consciousness.[231] All these stages have to be achieved on cosmic levels, in exactly the samesense as the microcosm, on systemic levels, likewise strives for similar ideals.II. WHAT IS EVOLUTION AND HOW DOES IT PROCEED?1. Life Cycles.I do not propose to deal here with the evolutionary process in any other waythan briefly to indicate that the whole method of evolution is simply that ofadjusting the matter aspect to the Spirit aspect, so that the former provesentirely adequate as a body of expression for the latter. The life cycle of theSon is one hundred years of Brahma in the same sense as man has a life cycleconsisting of a certain number of years, dependent upon his karma. During thelife cycle of a man, he expresses what is in him at his particular stage, andgradually develops from the stage of the ante-natal period wherein the Selfovershadows the matter aspect until the period wherein that Higher Self takesfull possession of the prepared form. This stage varies with every individual.From that time on fuller self-consciousness is sought, and the man (ifproceeding normally) expresses himself through the form ever more adequately.Each life of lesser cycle in the great cycle of the Ego or Self, sees thatexpression more complete, brings the form more under control and develops aconscious realisation of the Self until there comes a culminating cycle of livesin which the Self within rapidly dominates, and takes full authority. The formbecomes wholly adequate; the fusion of the two poles of Spirit and matter isfully brought about; and the light (fire) and heat (radiation) is seen and feltsystemically. Then the form is either consciously utilised for specific ends oris vacated, and the man is liberated. Electric fire and fire by friction arefused, and the consequent solar fire blazes forth in radiant glory.Extend this idea from man, an individualised unit of [232] consciousness, to thegreat Heavenly Men, in one of Whose bodies a man forms a cell. The body ofexpression of each Heavenly Man is one of the sacred planets, and They aim atthe same goal as man—the attainment, on Their own levels, of full expression,and the development of Their vehicles of consciousness to a point where theSpirit may blaze forth as light divine, and as heat. This heat radiatesconsciously and with intense magnetic attraction between all the seven systemicgroups, or planetary schemes. Their magnetic field of action will include theplanetary radius of one and all. Carry this thought still further to include theSon, and the entire solar system which He animates; His attempt is to find fullexpression therein, so that eventually and consciously His light may be seen andHis heat, or magnetic radiation, may be felt beyond His immediate sphere ofinfluence, the logoic ring-pass-not. Both the light of the Son and the heat ofthe Son must be felt by the opposite cosmic pole, that constellation which isour system’s magnetic opposite.2. The objective of the units of consciousness.Thus, the thought of union and of fusion underlies the entire scheme ofevolution; Man, the Heavenly Men, and the cosmic Man (the Son of the Father andthe Mother) have toa . Radiate occult heat beyond their own individualised ring-pass-not.b . Occultly blaze forth and demonstrate light or fiery objectivity.c. Expand so as to include that which lies beyond their own immediate spheres.d. Fuse and blend the two fires so as to produce perfectly the central fire,solar fire.e . Blend Spirit and matter so that a body is produced that will adequatelyexpress Spirit.f . Merge the essence within the form, which is occultly [233] qualified duringevolution, with the essence in all form—humanly, in a planetary sense, andcosmically.g . Attain human, systemic and cosmic manhood.h . Achieve mastery on three planes of the solar system, humanly speaking.i . Achieve mastery on five planes of the solar system, when speaking of aHeavenly Man.j. Achieve mastery on three cosmic planes when speaking of the cosmic Christ,the Son, or the Logos manifesting objectively.3. The Manifesting Units of Consciousness . ( 94) [text00028.html#Y_FN94]If these stated aims are carefully considered, it will be seen how each has itsplace within the plan, and how [234] evolution is but a term used to express thegradual development in time and space of the inherent capacity of a human being,of a Heavenly Man, and of the Grand Man of the Heavens. The place and positionof one and all to each other must be borne in mind, for no one can developwithout the other. What, therefore, have we?a. The Son, the Grand Man of the Heavens . He manifests through the Sun and theseven sacred planets, each of whom embodies one of His seven principles, just asHe in His totality embodies one of the principles of a greater cosmic Entity.b. A Heavenly Man . He manifests through a planet, and embodies one of theprinciples of the Son, the Logos. He Himself is likewise developing throughseven principles, which are the source of His essential unity with all otherHeavenly Men. Cosmically considered, the Son is developing the principle of agreater cosmic Being, that principle which we call love-wisdom. That is thefundamental characteristic He has to develop during His life cycle. EachHeavenly Man, therefore, embodies predominantly a subsidiary principle of thefundamental one. In like manner He Himself has six subsidiary principles, as hasthe Son.c. A Human Being, Man. He manifests on the physical [235] plane through form,and has also seven principles; in each life cycle he works at their development.He likewise has His primary coloring, dependent upon the fundamental principleembodied by the Heavenly Man, Who is his originating source. Thus we have:THE LOGOSFather-Spirit . . . . . . . . . . . .Mother-Matter.producingThe Son or the Grand Man of the Heavens,the conscious logoic Egoevolving throughThe Sun and the seven sacred planetseach embodying aCosmic principle, in six differentiationsby method ofa. Expansion, vibratory stimulation, magnetic interaction, or the law ofattraction and repulsion.b. Cyclic progress, rotary repetition, coupled to spiralling ascension, anddevelopinga. The quality of love-wisdom, through the utilization of form by the means ofactive intelligence.b. Full self-consciousness.c. A perfected solar system, or the form, adequate to the needs of theindwelling spirit.Here a similar tabulation may be worked out to demonstrate the similarity of theprocess in the case of a Heavenly Man and a human being. If we ask why tenschemes, and in effect ten planets (seven sacred and three concealed) [236] itis because the seven sacred planets are eventually merged into the three, andfinally the three are blended into the one. This can be traced along the line ofanalogy as we consider the seven Rays. These seven Rays, which in manifestationare diverse, are eventually synthesised. The minor four are blended, we aretold, into the third major ray, and the three major rays are finally merged intothe one synthetic ray, the Love-Wisdom Ray (the Dragon of Wisdom, the occultserpent swallowing its tail) (S. D., I, 704; II, 531) . This has been pointedout by H. P. B. We have, therefore, the three crowning rays, but seven seenduring the evolutionary process. In connection with the Heavenly Men,functioning through the planets, there are, therefore, three planets which mightbe considered as synthesising planets, and four which are blended eventually,until the three have absorbed the essence of the four; finally the one absorbsthe essence of the three, and the work is completed. This process lies manymillennia ahead, during the inevitable period of the gradual obscuration of oursystem. Four of the Heavenly Men find Their magnetic opposites, and fuse andblend. First this takes place between Themselves, the negative and the positiverays merging and fusing, forming then the two from the four. Again the twomerge, producing a united whole, and the one thus produced blends with the majorthird ray, the intelligence aspect,—the ray represented in our planetaryHierarchy by the Mahachohan. So the fusion will proceed until ultimately unityis reached in the system, and the Son has accomplished His purpose. He isperfected love-wisdom; his light shines forth cosmically; His magnetic radiustouches the periphery of His cosmic opposite, and the marriage of the Son iseffected. The two cosmic units merge.If we here naturally ask which is the cosmic unit that is our solar opposite, weshall be told that that question [237] lies hid for the present, though it ishinted at in the Secret Doctrine , and in other sacred books. A hint liesconcealed in the relationship of the Pleiades to our earth, but not until afurther precession of the equinoxes will it be more fully seen what is the exactrelationship involved. (96 [text00028.html#Y_FN96] )III. WHY IS THIS SOLAR SYSTEM EVOLVING ALONG THE LINES OF DUALITY?1. The Problem of Existence.The third question involves one of the most difficult problems in metaphysics,and covers in its consideration the whole perplexing mystery of the reason whythere is objectivity at all.It is one that has been asked under different forms by men of every school ofthought—by religious people who enquire:—”Why did God create at all? Why isexistence forced upon one and all?”; by scientists in their search for theultimate truth and in their endeavor to find out the motivation of all that isseen, and to account for sensuous life; by philosophers in their equallydiligent search for that animating subjectivity that is expressing itselfthrough all the moral and ethical sciences in every civilisation and among everypeople; by the biologist in his persistent application to search for thediscovery of the source of life, and in his strenuous endeavour to account forthe principle of life that is seen ever to evade his investigations; by themathematician, who, dealing with the form side of manifestation in all thegrades of mathematics, decides that God geometrises, that law and rule pervadeuniversally, that the one exists by means of the many, and who yet is unable tosolve the problem as to who that geometrising [238] identity may be. So theproblems persist, and all the many lines of approach (in the endeavour to findthe solution) end in the cul-de-sac of hypothesis, and in the recognition of anultimate something of such an elusive nature, that men are forced seemingly topredicate a source of energy, of life, of intelligence, and to call it bydiverse names according to the trend (religious, scientific or philosophical) oftheir minds. God, the Universal Mind, Energy, Force, the Absolute, theUnknown,—these terms and many others are forced from the lips of those who, bymeans of the form side, seek the Dweller within the form, and cannot find Him asyet. This failure to find Him is due to the limitations of the physical brain,and to the lack of development in the mechanism whereby the spiritual may beknown, and whereby He may, and eventually will, be contacted.The problem of duality is the problem of existence itself, and cannot be solvedby the man who refuses to recognise the possibility of two occult facts:1. That the entire solar system embodies the consciousness of an Entity, whooriginates on planes entirely without the solar ring-pass-not.2. That manifestation is periodical and that the Law of Rebirth is the methodthat evolution takes in dealing with a man, a planetary Logos, and a solarLogos. Hence, the emphasis laid in the Proem of the Secret Doctrine on the threefundamentals, (I, 42-44)a. The Boundless Immutable Principle andb. The periodicity of the Universe.c. The identity of all souls with the Oversoul.When scientists recognise these two facts then their explanations will take adifferent line and the truth, as it is, will begin to illuminate their reason.Few men are yet ready for illumination, which is simply the light of the [239]intuition breaking through the barriers that the rational faculty has erected.The duality of the solar system will eventually be recognised as dependent uponthe following factors:a. Existence itself.b. Time and space.c. The quality of desire or necessity.d. The acquisitive faculty inherent in life itself. This faculty, by the meansof motion, gathers to itself the material whereby it achieves its desire,whereby it fabricates the form through which expression is sought, and wherebyit confines itself within the prison of the sheath in order to gain experience.The supposition is correct that this theory takes for granted a mightyIntelligence who works thus through an ordered plan, and Who consciously takesshape and incarnates in order to carry out specific purposes of His own. Butthis hypothesis is but the rock bottom fact underlying the eastern teaching, andis one that is largely accepted, though diversely expressed and viewed bythinkers of all schools of thought throughout the globe. Even this conception isbut a partial presentation of the real Idea, but owing to the limitations of manat this stage of evolution, it is sufficient as a working basis on which he mayerect his temple of truth.This Entity, Whom we call the solar Logos, is in no sense the same as thepersonal God of the Christian, who is no more nor less than man himself,expanded into a being of awful power, and subject to the virtues and vices ofman himself. The solar Logos is more than man, for He is the sumtotal of all theevolutions within the entire solar system, including the human, which is anevolution standing at a middle point in relation to the other evolutions. On oneside of him are ranged hosts of beings who are more than human, and who, in[240] past kalpas, reached and passed the stage where man now is; on the otherside are hosts of the subhuman evolutions who in future kalpas will achieve thestage of humanity. Man stands midway between the two, and is at the point ofbalance; herein lies his problem. He does not partake wholly of the materialside of evolution, nor is he wholly the expression of the third Logos, theBrahma aspect of the Deity, Who is an expression of pure energy or intelligence,motivating that tenuous something which we call substance. He is not whollySpirit, the expression of the first Logos, the Mahadeva aspect, which is anexpression of pure will or necessitous desire, impelling to manifestation. It isthe fundamental motive itself or the great will to be. Man is a product of theunion of the two; he is the meeting place of matter or active intelligentsubstance, and of Spirit or the basic will. He is the child born of theirmarriage or at-one-ment. He assumes objectivity in order to express that whichis in each of the two opposites, plus the result of their merging in himself.2. Its Nature and Duality.In terms of quality what have we? Active intelligence at one with will or powerproduces that “Son of necessity” (S.D., I,74) (as H. P. B. expresses it) Whoembodies intelligence, will or desire, and their united latent demonstration,love-wisdom.In terms of Fire how might we express an analogous thought? The fire latent inmatter—itself a product of an earlier manifestation of the same cosmic Identity,or the relatively perfected quality worked out by Him in a previous cosmicincarnation—is set in motion again by the desire of that same Identity to circleonce more the wheel of rebirth. That “fire by friction” produces heat andradiation and calls forth a reaction from its [241] opposite “electric fire” orspirit. Here we have the thought of the Ray striking through matter, for theaction of electric fire is ever forward, as earlier suggested. The one Ray“electric fire” drops into matter. This is the systemic marriage of the Fatherand the Mother. The result is the blending of these two fires, and their unitedproduction of that expression of fire which we call “solar fire.” Thus isproduced the Son. Active Intelligence and Will are united and love-wisdom, whenperfected through evolution, will be the outcome.Electric fire or Spirit, united to fire by friction (heat) produces solar fireor light.Hence, when the cosmic Entity takes form, there is added to the activeintelligence which is the product of His earlier incarnation, a further quality,which is inherent and potential, that of love-wisdom. This is the ability tolove that which is objective or the not-self, and ultimately to use with wisdomthe form . Pure will is as yet an abstraction, and will only be brought intofull development in another incarnation of the Logos. Mind or Intelligence isnot an abstraction; it is something that IS. Neither is love-wisdom anabstraction. It is in process of development or bringing into manifestation, andis the aspect of the Son.What is above stated is in no way new, but these thoughts on essential dualityare gathered together, in order to convey to our minds the necessity of viewingthese things from the standpoint of their place in the cosmic scheme, and notfrom the point of view of our own planetary evolution and of man himself.Humanity is that evolution through which the Son aspect is to express itselfmost perfectly in this cosmic incarnation. Man blends the pairs of opposites,and the three fires meet in him. He is the best expression of the manasicprinciple and might be considered, from one very interesting [242] standpoint,the chef-d’oeuvre of Brahma. He is the sheath for the life of God; he is theindividualised consciousness of the Logos, manifesting through the seven divineManasaputras, or Heavenly Men, in Whose bodies each unit of the human familyfinds place. He is the Vishnu aspect in process of development through theintelligence of Brahma, impelled by the will of Mahadeva. Therefore, in apeculiar sense man is very important, as he is the place of at-one-ment for allthe three aspects; nevertheless, he is very unimportant for he is not the apexof the triangle, but simply the middle point, if we view the triangle thus:Spirit-Father.The Son or man.Matter-Mother.The evolution of the Son, or the cosmic incarnation of the Christ, is of immenseimportance in the plans of the Being greater than the solar Logos, HE ABOUT WHOMNAUGHT MAY BE SAID. The animating principles of allied constellations andsystems watch the progress of the evolution of the Son with keenest attention.Just as the planet called the earth is regarded as the turning point or thebattle-ground between Spirit and matter, and is therefore, from that veryconsideration, of great importance, so our solar system holds an analogous placein the cosmic scheme. The cosmic man, the solar Arjuna, is wrestling for Hisindividualised perfected self-consciousness, and for freedom and liberation fromthe form, and from the not-self. So man on this planet battles for similarideals on his tiny scale; so battle in heaven Michael and His Angels, or thedivine Heavenly Men, Whose problem is the same on the higher scale.Duality, and the interplay between the two produces: [243]a . Objectivity, or the manifested Son or Sun.b. Evolution itself.c . The development of quality.d . Time and space.The questions we are now engaged in answering embody certain fundamental aspectsof manifestation, viewed principally from the subjective or psychic angle.IV. WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS? WHAT IS ITS PLACE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS?Consciousness might be defined as the faculty of apprehension, and concernsprimarily the relation of the Self to the not-self, of the Knower to the Known,and of the Thinker to that which is thought about. All these definitions involvethe acceptance of the idea of duality, of that which is objective and of thatwhich lies back of objectivity. (99 [text00028.html#Y_FN99] )Consciousness expresses that which might be regarded as the middle point inmanifestation. It does not involve entirely the pole of Spirit. It is producedby the union of the two poles, and the process of interplay and of adaptationthat necessarily ensues. It might be tabulated as follows, in an effort toclarify by visualisation: [244]First Pole The Point of Union Second Pole First Logos Second Logos Third Logos.Mahadeva Vishnu Brahma. Will Wisdom-Love Active Intelligence. SpiritConsciousness Matter. Father Son Mother. Monad Ego Personality. The Self Therelation between The Not-Self. The Knower Knowledge The Known. Life RealisationForm.One could go on piling up terms, but the above suffices to demonstrate therelationship between the threefold Logos, during manifestation. Emphasis must belaid upon the above fact: The solar system embodies the above logoicrelationship during evolutionary objectivity, and the whole aim of progressivedevelopment is to bring the Son of the Father and the Mother, to a point of fullrealisation, of complete self-consciousness, and to full and active knowledge.This Son is objectively the solar system, inherently will or power, andsubjectively He is love-wisdom. This latter quality is in process of developmentthrough the utilisation of active intelligence.The three manifested Persons of the logoic Triad seek full development by meansof each other. The will to be, of the Mahadeva aspect, seeks, with the aid ofthe intelligence of Brahma, to develop love-wisdom, or the Son aspect, theVishnu aspect. In the microcosmic system, the reflection of the threefold Logos,the man is endeavoring through the three vehicles to attain the same developmenton his own plane. On higher planes the Heavenly Men (through atma-buddhi-manas)aim at a similar progression. These two, the Heavenly Men plus the units inTheir bodies, which are composed of deva and human monads form, in theirtotality, the Grand Heavenly Man. When man achieves, then the Heavenly Menlikewise achieve; when They reach Their full growth and knowledge, [245] and areself-conscious on all planes, then the Son achieves, and the solar system (Hisbody of manifestation and experience) has served its purpose. The Son isliberated. Extend the idea of this threefold development of consciousness to theLogos in a still larger cycle (to that of the three solar systems of which thisis the middle one) and we have repeated on cosmic levels in connection with theLogos, the process of the development of man in the three worlds.THE MACROCOSMThe first solar system embodied the “I am” principle. The second solar system isembodying the “I am that” principle. The third solar system will embody the “Iam that I am” principle.THE MICROCOSMThe first manifestation, the Personality, embodies the “I am” principle.The second manifestation, the Ego, is embodying the “I am that” principle.The third manifestation, the Monad, will embody the “I am that I am” principle.Thus the different factors play their part in the general scheme of things, andall are interrelated, and all are interested parts and members one of the other.V. IS THERE A DIRECT ANALOGY BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM, A PLANET, AMAN AND AN ATOM?If by this question the desire exists to demonstrate exact similarity, theanswer must be: No, the analogy is never exact in detail but only in certainbroad basic correspondences. In all the four factors, there will be foundunchangeable points of resemblance, but in development the stages of growth maynot appear the same in detailed evolution, viewed from the standpoint of a manin the [246] three worlds, handicapped as he is by limited apprehension. Thepoints of resemblance between the four might be summed up as follows, taking theatom on the physical plane as our starting point, and developing the conceptfrom stage to stage:An Atom. (101 [text00028.html#Y_FN101] )a. An atom consists of a spheroidal form containing within itself a nucleus oflife.b. An atom contains within itself differentiated molecules, which in theirtotality form the atom itself. For instance, we are told that the physical atomcontains within its periphery fourteen thousand millions of the archetypalatoms, yet these myriads demonstrate as one.c. An atom is distinguished by activity, and shows forth the qualities of:a . Rotary motion.b. Discriminative power.c. Ability to develop.d. An atom, we are told, contains within itself three major spirals and sevenlesser (102 [text00028.html#Y_FN102] ). which ten are in process [247] ofvitalisation, but have not yet attained full activity. Only four are functioningat this stage, and the fifth is in process of development.e. An atom is governed by the Law of Economy, is coming slowly under the Law ofAttraction, and will eventually come under the Law of Synthesis.f. An atom finds its place within all forms; it is the aggregation of atoms thatproduces form.g. Its responsiveness to outer stimulation:Electrical stimulation, affecting its objective form.Magnetic stimulation, acting upon its subjective life.The united effect of the two stimulations, producing consequent internal growthand development.An atom therefore is distinguished by:1. Its spheroidal shape. Its ring-pass-not is definite and seen.2. Its internal arrangement, which comprises the sphere of influence of anyparticular atom.3. Its life-activity, or the extent to which the life at the centre animates theatom, a relative thing at this stage.4. Its sevenfold inner economy in process of evolution.5. Its eventual synthesis internally from the seven into the three.6. Its group relation.7. Its development of consciousness, or responsiveness.Having predicated the above facts of the atom, we can extend the idea now toman, following the same general outline:A Man.a. A man is spheroidal in form, he can be seen as a circular ring-pass-not, asphere of matter with a nucleus [248] of life at the centre. In predicating thiswe are considering the true man in his fundamental position as the Ego, with hissphere of manifestation, the causal body,—that body which forms the middle pointbetween Spirit and matter.b. A man contains within himself differentiated atoms, which in their totalitymake up the objective form of the man on the planes of his manifestation. Allare animated by his life, by his persistent will-to-be; all vibrate according tothe point reached by the man in evolution. As seen from the higher planes mandemonstrates as a sphere (or spheres) of differentiated matter, vibrating to acertain measure, tinctured by a certain color, and rotating to a fixed key—thekey of his life cycle.c. A man is distinguished by activity on one or more planes in the three worlds,and shows forth the qualities of:1. Rotary motion, or his particular cycling on the wheel of life, around hisegoic pole.2. Discriminative capacity, or the power to choose and gain experience.3. Ability to evolve, to increase vibration and to make contact.d. A man contains within himself three major principles,—will, love-wisdom,active intelligence or adaptability—and their differentiation into the sevenprinciples. These, making the eventual ten of perfected manifestation, are inprocess of vitalisation, but have not yet attained full expression. Only fourprinciples in man are active, and he is in process of developing the fifth, ormanasic principle. Note how perfect is the analogy between man, viewed as thelower quaternary developing the principle of mind, and the atom with its fourspirillae active; and the fifth in process of stimulation.e. A man is governed by the Law of Attraction, is [249] evolved through the Lawof Economy, and is coming under the Law of Synthesis. Economy governs thematerial process with which he is not so much consciously concerned; attractiongoverns his connection with other units or groups, and synthesis is the law ofhis inner Self, of the life within the form.f. Man finds his place within the group form. Egoic groups and the Heavenly Menare formed by the aggregate of human and of deva units.g. His responsiveness to outer stimulation:a . Electrical stimulation, affecting the outer form, or pranic response.b. Magnetic stimulation, acting upon his subjective life. This emanates from hisegoic group, and later from the Heavenly Man, in Whose body he is a cell.c The united effect of these two stimulations, inducing steady growth anddevelopment.A man is distinguished therefore by:1. His spheroidal shape. His ring-pass-not is definite and seen.2. His internal arrangement; his entire sphere of influence is in process ofdevelopment. At present that sphere is limited and his range of activity issmall. As the body egoic is developed, the nucleus of life at the centreincreases its radius of control until the whole is brought under rule andgovernment.3. His life activity or the extent to which at any given time he demonstratesself-consciousness, or controls his threefold lower nature.4. His sevenfold inner economy; the development of his seven principles. [250]5. His eventual internal synthesis under the working of the three laws from theseven into the three and later into the one.6. His group relation.7. His development of consciousness, of responsiveness to contact, involvingtherefore the growth of awareness.A Heavenly Man . (103 [text00028.html#Y_FN103] )a. Each Heavenly Man is likewise to be seen as spheroidal in shape. He has Hisring-pass-not as has the atom and the man. This ring-pass-not comprises theentire planetary scheme; the dense physical globe of any one chain beinganalogous in His case to the physical body of any man, and to the atom on thephysical plane. Each scheme of seven chains is the expression of the life of anEntity, Who occupies it, as does a man his body, for purposes of manifestationand in order to gain experience.[251] b. A Heavenly Man contains within Himself that which corresponds to thecells within the vehicles of expression of a human being. The atoms or cells inHis body are made up of the aggregate of the deva and human units who vibrate toHis key note, and who respond to the measure of His life. All are held togetherand animated by His will to be, and all vibrate according to the point achievedby Him in evolution. From the cosmic standpoint a Heavenly Man can be seen as asphere of wondrous life, which includes within its radius of influence thevibratory capacity of an entire planetary scheme. He vibrates to a certainmeasure, which can be estimated by the activity of the life pulsating at thecentre of the sphere; the entire planetary scheme is tinctured by a certaincolor, is rotating to a fixed key which is the key of His life cycle within thestill greater mahamanvantara or logoic cycle.c. A Heavenly Man is distinguished by His activity on one or other of the planeswhich we call the Triadal, or Atma-Buddhi-Manas, in the same way as a man isdistinguished by his activity on one of the planes in the three worlds,mental-astral-physical. Eventually a man is self-conscious on all three.Eventually a Heavenly Man is fully self-conscious on the higher three. Everyforward movement or increased vitality in the aggregate of men in the threeworlds, is paralleled by an analogous activity on the three higher planes. Theaction and the interaction between the life animating the groups or the HeavenlyMen, and the life animating the atoms or men who form the units in groups isboth mysterious and wonderful. A Heavenly Man on His own planes likewise showsforth the qualities of:Rotary motion, or His particular cycling activity around His life wheel, aplanetary scheme, and thus around His egoic pole. [252]Discriminating capacity, or the power to choose and thereby gain experience.They are the embodiments of manas or the intelligent faculty (hence Their titleof Divine Manasaputras) which comprehends, chooses and discards, thus attainingknowledge and self-consciousness. This manasic faculty They developed in earlierkalpas or solar systems. Their purpose is now to utilise that which is developedto bring about certain specific effects and to attain certain specific goals.Ability to evolve, to increase vibration, to gain knowledge, and to makecontact. This increased vibration is of a gradual and evolutionary order andproceeds from centre to centre as it does in man, and as it does in the case ofthe atomic spirillae. Their aim is to achieve uniformity of contact with eachother, and to merge eventually Their separated identities in the One Identity,retaining simultaneously full self-consciousness or individualisedself-apprehension.d. A Heavenly Man contains within Himself three major principles—will,love-wisdom, intelligence, and their manifestation through the seven principlesso often discussed in our occult literature. These make the ten of His ultimateperfection, for the seven are resolved into the three, and the three into theone.Each Heavenly Man has, of course, His primary coloring or principle as has manand the atom. Man has for his primary coloring or principle that of the HeavenlyMan in Whose body he is a unit. He has also the other two major principles (ashas the Heavenly Man), and their differentiation into the seven as earlier said.The atom has for primary coloring or principle, that of the egoic ray of thehuman being for instance in whose body it finds place. This, of course, is inconnection with the [253] physical atom in a man’s body. This coloring manifestsas the vibration setting the measure of the major three spirillae and the minorseven.Only four principles in the Heavenly Men are as yet manifesting to any extent,though One of Them is rather in advance of the others, and has the fifthprinciple vibrating adequately, while certain others are in process ofperfecting the fourth. The Heavenly Man of our chain is vibrating somewhat tothe fifth principle, or rather is in process of awakening it to life. His fourthvibration or principle in this fourth round or cycle, and on this fourth globe,is awakened, though not functioning as it will in the fifth round. Much of thetrouble present in the planet at this time arises from the coming into activityof the higher or fifth vibration, which will be completed and transcended in thenext or fifth cycle. The analogy, as in man and the atom, again holds good butnot in exact detail.e. A Heavenly Man is governed by the Law of Attraction, has transcended the Lawof Economy, and is rapidly coming under the Law of Synthesis. Note therefore thegradual stepping-up of the control and the fact that:First. The Law of Economy is the primary law of the atom. The Law of Attractionis coming into control of the atom. The Law of Synthesis is but slightly felt bythe life of the atom. It is the law of life.Second. The Law of Attraction is the primary law of man. The Law of Economy is asecondary law for man. It governs the matter of his vehicles. The Law ofSynthesis is steadily beginning to be felt.Third. The Law of Synthesis is the primary law of a Heavenly Man. The Law ofAttraction has full sway. The Law of Economy is transcended.The dense physical body is not a principle for a Heavenly Man, hence the Law ofEconomy is transcended. [254] The Law of Attraction governs the material processof form building. The Law of Synthesis is the law of His Being.f. A Heavenly Man is finding His place within the logoic groups, and is seekingto realise His position among the seven and by realisation to approximate unity.g. His responsiveness to outer stimulation. This viewed from the limited humanstandpoint touches on realms unattainable by man’s intellect as yet. It dealswith:Electrical stimulation, and concerns the response to solar radiation, and toparalleling planetary radiation.Magnetic stimulation, acting upon His subjective life. This radiation emanatesfrom sources outside the system altogether. We might note the following facts:Magnetic stimulation of the physical atom emanates from man on astral levels,and later from buddhic levels.Magnetic stimulation of man emanates from the Heavenly Men on buddhic, and lateron monadic levels.Magnetic stimulation of a Heavenly Man emanates extra-systemically, from thecosmic astral, the united effect of these stimulations inducing steady internaldevelopment.A Heavenly Man is distinguished therefore by:1. His spheroidal shape. His ring-pass-not, during objectivity, is definite andseen.2. His internal arrangement and His sphere of influence, or that activityanimating the planetary chain.3. His spiritual life control at any given period. It is the power whereby Heanimates His sevenfold [255] nature. Note the increase of influence as comparedto man’s threefold radius.4. His eventual ultimate synthesis from the seven into the three and from thenceinto one. This covers the obscuration of the globes, and the blending into unityof the seven principles which each globe is evolving.5. His evolution under Law and consequent development.6. His group relation.7. His development of consciousness and of awareness.Finally, we must extend these ideas to a solar Logos, and see how completely theanalogy persists. The paragraphs dealing with stimulation, magnetic andelectric, inevitably brings us back to the contemplation of fire, the basis andsource of all life.A Solar Logos.a. A solar Logos, the Grand Man of the Heavens, is equally spheroidal in shape.His ring-pass-not comprises the entire circumference of the solar system, andall that is included within the sphere of influence of the Sun. The Sun holds aposition analogous to the nucleus of life at the centre of the atom. This spherecomprises within its periphery the seven planetary chains with the synthesisingthree, making the ten of logoic manifestation. The Sun is the physical body ofthe solar Logos, His body of manifestation, and His life sweeps cycling throughthe seven schemes in the same sense as the life of a planetary Logos sweepsseven times around His scheme of seven chains. Each chain holds a positionanalogous to a globe in a planetary chain. Note the beauty of thecorrespondence, yet withal the lack of detailed analogy. (S.D., I, 136)b. A solar Logos contains within Himself, as the atoms in His body ofmanifestation, all groups of every kind, [256] from the involutionary group-soulto the egoic groups on the mental plane. He has (for the animating centres ofHis body) the seven major groups or the seven Heavenly Men, who ray forth Theirinfluence to all parts of the logoic sphere, and who embody within Themselvesall lesser lives, the lesser groups, human and deva units, cells, atoms andmolecules.Seen from cosmic levels, the sphere of the Logos can be visualised as avibrating ball of fire of supernal glory, containing within its circle ofinfluence, the planetary spheres likewise vibrating balls of fire. The Grand Manof the Heavens vibrates to a steadily increasing measure; the entire system istinctured by a certain color,—the color of the life of the Logos, the One DivineRay; and the system rotates to a certain measure, which is the key of the greatkalpa or solar cycle, and revolves around its central solar pole.c. The solar Logos is distinguished by His activity on all the planes of thesolar system; He is the sumtotal of all manifestation, from the lowest anddensest physical atom up to the most radiant and cosmic ethereal Dhyan Chohan.This sevenfold vibratory measure is the key of the lowest cosmic plane, and itsrate of rhythm can be felt on the cosmic astral, with a faint response on thecosmic mental. Thus the life of the logoic existence on cosmic levels, may beseen paralleling the life of a man in the three worlds, the lowest of thesystemic planes.On His own planes the Logos likewise shows forth:First. Rotary motion. His life as it cycles through a day of Brahma, can be seenspiralling around His greater wheel, the ten schemes of a solar system.Second. Discriminatory capacity. His first act, as we know, was to discriminateor choose the matter he needed for manifestation. That choice was controlled by:[257]Cosmic Karma.Vibratory capacity.Responsive coloring or quality.Numerical factors involved in cosmic mathematics.He is the embodiment of cosmic manas, and through the use of this faculty Heseeks—by means of animated form—to build into His cosmic causal body, aparalleling quality of love-wisdom.Third. Ability to progress, to increase vibration, and to gain fullself-consciousness on cosmic levels.d. The solar Logos contains within Himself the three major principles oraspects, and their differentiation into seven principles. These make the ten ofHis ultimate perfection and are eventually synthesised into the one perfectedprinciple of love-wisdom. This ultimate principle is His primary coloring. Eachprinciple is embodied in one of the schemes, and is being worked out through oneof the Heavenly Men. Only four principles are as yet manifested to any extent,for the evolution of the Logos parallels that of the Heavenly Men.e. The solar Logos is governed by the Law of Synthesis. He holds all insynthetic unity or homogeneity. His subjective life is governed by the Law ofAttraction; His material form is governed by the Law of Economy. He is comingunder another cosmic law as yet incomprehensible to men, which law is butrevealed to the highest initiates.f. The solar Logos is in process of ascertaining His place within the greatersystem in which He holds a place analogous to that of a Heavenly Man in a solarsystem. He seeks first to find the secret of His own existence, and to achievefull Self-Consciousness; secondly to ascertain the position and place of Hispolar opposite; thirdly to [258] merge and blend with that polar opposite. Thisis the cosmic marriage of the Logos.g. A solar Logos is distinguished by His responsiveness to outer stimulation.This concerns itself with:Electrical stimulation or His response to electrical fohatic force emanatingfrom other stellar centres, and controlling largely the action of our system andits movements in space in relation to other constellations.Magnetic stimulation, acting upon His subjective Life, and emanating fromcertain cosmic centres hinted at in the Secret Doctrine . These find theirsource on cosmic buddhic levels.It is their united effect which induces steady development.The solar Logos is distinguished1. By the spheroidicity of His manifesting existence. His solar ring-pass-not isdefinite and seen. This can only be demonstrated as yet by the endeavour toascertain the extent of the subjective control, by the measure of the solarsphere of influence, or the magnetic attraction of the Sun to other lesserbodies which it holds in circular motion around itself.2. By the activity of the life animating the ten schemes.3. By the extent of the control exerted by the Logos at any given period.4. By the ultimate synthesis of the seven schemes into three and thence intoone. This covers the obscuration of the schemes and the unification of the sevenprinciples which they embody.5. By His subjection to the Law of His Being.6. By His group relation.7. By His unfoldment of Consciousness, the time factor [259] being controlled bythe measure of the unfoldment of all the conscious units in His body.Here we have traced very briefly some of the analogies between the four factorsearlier mentioned, and have in a cursory way answered the question. Thesepoints, if dwelt upon, will be found of real assistance in developing the mentalappreciation of the student, and in increasing his apprehension of the beauty ofthe entire solar scheme.VI. WHAT IS THE MIND ASPECT? WHY IS THE MANASIC PRINCIPLE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE?WHO ARE THE MANASAPUTRAS?We are now to touch upon the profoundest mystery of the whole manifested solarsystem—the mystery spoken of by H. P. B. as the mystery of electricity. (S.D.,I, 439,221,107 It is intimately connected with the life of God as demonstratedthrough His seven Centres, the seven Heavenly Men, the Divine Manasaputras. Thisproblem is not soluble as yet exoterically and but little can be revealed to thegeneral public. This is for three reasons:First, the stage reached by man does not permit of his correct apprehension ofthese abstractions.Second, the greater part of the possible explanation is only revealed toinitiates who have passed the third Initiation, and even to them in a carefullyguarded manner.Third, the revelation of the close connection between mind and fohat or energy,or between thought power and electrical phenomena—the effect of fohatic impulseon matter—is fraught with peril, and the missing link (if so it might be termed)in the chain of reasoning from phenomena to its initiatory impulse, can only besafely imparted when the bridge between higher and lower mind, is adequatelyconstructed. When the lower is under the control of the higher, or when thequaternary is merging into the triad, then man can be trusted with the remaining[260] four fundamentals. Three of these fundamentals are laid down for us in theProem of the Secret Doctrine , (I, 42-44) and with the evolving concept ofpsychology, make the revealed three and the dawning fourth. The other three areesoteric and must remain so until each man has for himself worked at hisspiritual development, built the bridge between the higher and the lower mind,prepared the shrine in the temple of Solomon for the Light of God, and turnedhis activities into altruistic helping of the evolutionary plans of the Logos.When these qualities are assuming a foremost place and when man has demonstratedthe thoroughness of his will to serve, then the clue will be put into his handsand he will find the method whereby electrical impulse, demonstrating as heat,light and motion, is controlled and utilised; he will discover the source of theinitial impulse from extra-systemic centres, and discover the basic rhythm.Then, and only then, will he be a truly intelligent co-operator, and (escapingfrom the control of the Law in the three worlds) wield the law himself withinthe lower spheres.1. The Nature of Manifestation.Here are three important questions to be dealt with as one, all bearing on thesame subject, and all concerned with the fact of intelligent objectivity itself.Perhaps if we paraphrased the threefold query, and brought it down tomicrocosmic objectivity, the problem might not appear so complex. We mightexpress it thus:What is the thought aspect of a human being? Why is his mind and mental processof such importance? Who is the Thinker?Man, in essential essence, is the higher triad demonstrating through a graduallyevolving form, the egoic or causal body, and utilising the lower threefoldpersonality [261] as a means to contact the lower three planes. All this has forpurpose the development of perfect self-consciousness. Above the triad standsthe Monad or the Father in Heaven—a point of abstraction to man as he views thesubject from the physical plane. The Monad stands to him in the position of theAbsolute, in the same sense as the undifferentiated Logos stands to thethreefold Trinity, to the three Persons of logoic manifestation. The parallel isexact.1. The Monad.2. The threefold Triad, Atma-Buddhi-Manas, or spiritual will, intuition, andhigher mind.3. The body egoic or the causal body, the shrine for the buddhic principle. Thisbody is to be built by the power of the mind. It is the manifestation of thethree.4. The threefold lower nature, the points of densest objectivity.5. This threefold lower nature is in essence a quaternary—the etheric vehicle,animating life or prana, kama-manas, and lower mind. Manas or the fifthprinciple, forms the link between the lower and the higher. (S.D., I, 107)We have, therefore, our lower four, our higher three, and the relation betweenthem, the principle of mind. Here we have the seven formed by the union of thethree and the four, and another factor, making eight. The ultimate seven will beseen when buddhi and manas are merged. Much has been hinted at in certain of ouroccult books about the eighth sphere. I would suggest that in this linkingfactor of intelligent mind, we have a clue to the mystery. When mind becomesunduly developed and ceases to unite the higher and the lower, it forms a sphereof its own. This is the greatest disaster that can overtake the human unit.[262]Therefore we have:Monad, the microcosmic absolute.Pure Spirit.The one and only.The monadic trinity.First aspect Atma or spiritual will. Second aspect. Buddhi, the Christprinciple. Third aspect Manas, or higher mind.The Son aspect in objectivity.The body egoic or causal body.The lower quaternary.1. The mental body. 3. Prana, or vital energy. 2. The astral or emotional body.( 108 [text00028.html#Y_FN108] ) 4. Etheric bodyThe microcosm reproduces the solar system in miniature. The above deals with theobjective forms, corresponding to the sun and the seven sacred planets. But theexoteric form is paralleled by a psychic development which we call the sevenprinciples. Man develops seven principles, which might be enumerated as follows:MICROCOSMIC PRINCIPLES ( 109 [text00028.html#Y_FN109] )Two higher principles:1. Active intelligence.2. Latent love-wisdom.[263] (The psychic nature of the Monad is twofold.)1. The principle of atma. Spiritual nature. Will.2. The principle of buddhi. Love nature. Wisdom.3. The principle of manas. Intelligence nature, Activity.Note here that the three principles in terms of the Triad with the twosynthesising principles on the plane of the Monad, make five principles and givethe key to H. P. B.’s numbering in certain places. We might express it thus:I. The Absolute The Monad. II. 1. Prakriti Active intelligence. The DivineManasaputra. 2. Purusha Love-Wisdom. The Vishnu aspect.On the plane of objectivity.III 3. Atma The Triad. 4. Buddhi The Triad. 5. Manas The Triad.From the standpoint of evolution we regard the higher two and the highest one asthe correspondence to the Absolute as He manifests in duality. This is prior toobjectivity, which requires the presence of the three. In manifestation we mightregard the principles as follows: [264]First Principle The sphere of manifestation, the monadic egg. Second PrincipleAtma Will. Third Principle Buddhi Pure reason, wisdom. Fourth Principle ManasPure mind, higher mind. Fifth Principle Manas Lower mind. Sixth PrincipleKama-manas Seventh Principle Pure emotion, or feeling.These are the principles for the microcosm viewed as having transcended thephysical bodies altogether, and thus the tabulation deals entirely with thesubjective life, or the development of the psyche or soul.This should be borne carefully in mind else confusion will ensue. In ourenumeration we are here dealing with subjectivity and not with form. We have,therefore, considered:a. Sevenfold objectivity the material forms. b. Sevenfold subjectivity thepsychic evolution. c. Sevenfold spirituality the life of the Entity.We will note also that in the tabulation of the spiritual life of the Monad weconsidered it as fivefold. This was necessarily so in this fivefold evolution,but the remaining two principles might be considered as:6. The life of the Heavenly Man in Whose body the human Monad finds a place.7. The life of the Logos in Whose body the Heavenly Man finds place.It might be useful here to consider another enumeration of the principles of man(110 [text00028.html#Y_FN110] ) as he manifests in the [265] three worlds, theplanes whereon the subjective and the objective are united. What have we there?Let us begin where man begins, with the lowest:7. The etheric body 1. The vital body. 6. Prana 2. Vital force. 5. Kama-manas 3.Desire Mind. 4. Lower mind 4. Concrete mind. 3. Manas 5. Higher or abstractmind. 2. Buddhi 6. Wisdom, Christ force, intuition. 1. Atma 7. Spiritual Will.This is the lowest enumeration for little evolved man at the present time.From the standpoint of the Ego what can be seen?I. The Absolute . . . . . . . Atma. Pure will-to-be.II. The Duad.1. Buddhi . . . . . . . . . Pure reason, wisdom.2. Manas . . . . . . . . . .Pure mind.III. The Triad .3. The causal body.4. Lower mind. [266]5. Kama-manas.6. Prana.7. The etheric body.In these various enumerations of the principles we are dealing with them (as H.P. B. has pointed out they must be dealt with) (S. D., III, 456.) ( 111[text00028.html#Y_FN111] ), from differing standpoints, dependent upon the stagereached and the angle of vision. We have considered them thus in answeringquestion six because we have sought to emphasise and to impress clearly upon ourminds that the three lines of development must be remembered when consideringthe evolution of the Manasaputras.2. The Objective Development.This is sevenfold in evolution and in time, ninefold during obscuration, andtenfold at dissolution.Macrocosmic1. The seven sacred planets of the solar system.2. The two which are hid, which are the synthesising planets.3. The one final synthesising planet—the Sun. Seven added to two added to onemake ten.There are ten centres in the Grand Heavenly Man.A Heavenly Man1. The seven chains of a scheme.2. The two synthesising chains.3. One ultimate chain.[267] There are ten centres in a planetary Logos.Microcosm1. The seven vehicles employed:a . The atmic sheath.b. The buddhic vehicle.c. The causal or egoic body.d. The mental body.e. The astral body.f. The etheric body.g . The dense physical.2. Two synthesising bodies:a. The causal body.b. The physical body.3. One synthesising body:a. The monadic sheath.There are seven centres in the physical vehicle which correspond to thesebodies, with the synthesising centres at the heart and throat; the head is thenthe ultimate synthesiser. This tabulation deals entirely with the form side, andwith the vehicles indwelt by the Logos, the Manasaputras and by Man.3. The Subjective Development.This is also sevenfold:1. Astral pure desire, emotion, feeling. 2. Kama-manas desire-mind. 3. Manaslower concrete mind. 4. Higher manas abstract or pure mind. 5. Buddhi purereason, intuition. 6. Atma pure will, realisation. 7. Monadic Will, love-wisdom,intelligence.This deals with the sevenfold development of inherent love-wisdom by the aid ofmind. This proceeds macrocosmically through the seven Heavenly Men, Who are[268] actively intelligent, inherently love, and are objectively seen throughTheir forms, the planetary schemes. In Their totality They are the Logos, theGrand Man of the Heavens. In the case of a Heavenly Man the development proceedsthrough the seven groups of human entities who form Their psychic centres. Thesegroups are on their own plane developing intelligence, are inherently love, andcan be objectively contacted on the seven chains of a scheme. In the case ofindividual man, the development proceeds through his seven centres, which arethe key to his psychic evolution. A man is also developing intelligence, isinherently love, and is objectively seen through one or other of his bodies.What I seek to emphasise is the fact of the psychic development, and also thatsubjective evolution is the main enterprise of the Logos , of a planetary Logosand of a man. Active intelligent love (the bringing forth from latency of theinherent quality of love by the intelligent application of the mind faculty)will be the result of the evolutionary process. Just as objectivity is dual,life-form, so subjectivity is dual, mind-love, and the blending of the twoproduces consciousness. Spirit alone is unity, and is undivided; the developmentof Spirit (or its assumption of the fruits of evolution) is only to be realisedand brought about when the dual evolution of the form and the psyche isconsummated. Then Spirit garners the fruits of evolution and gathers to itselfthe qualities nurtured during manifestation,—perfect love and perfectintelligence showing forth then as active intelligent love-wisdom.We might, therefore, answer the questions: “What is the Mind aspect and why isit so important?” by saying that the mind aspect is in reality the ability orcapacity of the logoic Existence to think, to act, to build, and to evolve inorder to develop the faculty of active love. When the Logos, Who IS activeintelligence, has run His [269] life-cycle, He will be also love fullymanifested throughout Nature. This can be likewise predicated of a Heavenly Manin His sphere and of a man in his tiny cycle. Thus the importance of manas canbe fully seen. It is the means whereby evolution becomes possible, comprehensionis achieved, and activity is generated and utilised.Let us now consider how this question can be expressed in terms of Fire:Objectively Subjectively 1. The sea of fire 1. Our God is a consuming fireEnergising will 2. The akasha 2. The Light of God Form aspect. 3. The aether 3.The heat of matter Activity aspect. 4. The air 4. The illumination of theintuition. 5. Fire 5. The fire of mind. 6. The astral light 6. The heat of theemotions. 7. Physical plane electricity 7. Kundalini and prana.Spiritually.This is hid in a threefold mystery:1. The mystery of electricity.2. The mystery of the seven constellations.3. The mystery of the ONE ABOVE THE LOGOS.4. The Heavenly Men and Man.The final part of question six is: Who are the Manasaputras?This will be dealt with in greater detail in connection with our planet whentaking up the subject of the coming of the Lords of Flame. It is desirable nowto make certain facts clear which must form the basis of any thought upon thissubject.[270] The Divine Manasaputras, ( 113 [text00028.html#Y_FN113] ) ( 114[text00028.html#Y_FN114] ) Who are known in the Secret Doctrine by diversenames, are the Mind-born Sons of Brahma, the third aspect logoic.They are the seven planetary Logoi, and are the Lords of the Rays, the sevenHeavenly Men. They developed the mind aspect in the first solar system, that inwhich Brahma was paramount, and in Himself embodied objective existence. This Hedid in the same sense as that in which the second aspect (the Vishnu or Dragonof Wisdom aspect) is the sumtotal of existence in this the second system.The cells in Their bodies are made up of the units of the human and devaevolutions in the same manner (only on a higher turn of the spiral) as thebodies of human beings are made up of living organisms, the various animatedcells, or the lesser lives. This is a basic fact in occultism, and therelationship between the cells in the human vehicles, and the cells in thebodies of a Heavenly [271] Man, will be productive of illumination if carefullystudied.Just as a human being has an originating source, the Monad, and a semi-permanentvehicle, the causal body, but manifests through his lower principles (of whichthe dense physical is not one) so a Heavenly Man has an originating source, HisMonad, a semi-permanent body on the monadic levels of the solar system, butmanifests through three lower sheaths, our atmic, buddhic, and manasic levels.He is extraneous to the astral and physical planes just as a human being is tothe physical. Man vitalises the physical vehicle with his force or heat but hedoes not occultly count it as a principle. So the Heavenly Man is extraneous tothe two lower planes of manifestation though He vitalises them with His force.The human being realises his relationship (as a cell in the body) to a HeavenlyMan only when he is developing the consciousness of the Ego on its own plane. Ifit might be so expressed, the groups of causal bodies are the lowest formsthrough which a Heavenly Man manifests, just as the physical body is the lowestthrough which a human being manifests, and this in its etheric connotation.It should be borne in mind that the manifesting Existences embody certainplanes, and have Their points of deepest involution on diverse levels:a. A Man originates on the monadic level, has his main focal point on the fifthlevel, the mental, but is seeking full conscious development on the three lowerplanes, the mental, the astral and the physical.b. A Heavenly Man has His source outside the solar system (as man outside thethree worlds of his endeavor), has His main focal point on the second plane ofthe system, the monadic, and is seeking consciousness on the planes of theTriad,—this in relation to all the cells in His body. He developed consciousnesson the three [272] lower planes of the three worlds during the first solarsystem, again in relation to the cells in His body. Man is repeating Hisendeavor up to the fifth Initiation which will bring him to a stage ofconsciousness achieved by a Heavenly Man in a much earlier mahamanvantara. Inconnection with the initiations this should be carefully borne in mind.c. A solar Logos has His origin on a still higher cosmic level, has His mainfocal point on the cosmic mental plane but is expressing Himself through thethree lower cosmic planes just as man is seeking self-expression in the threeworlds. Therefore, the seven major planes of the solar system are in the samerelation to Him cosmically as the physical plane is to a human being. They formHis etheric and dense bodies. It might be stated that:1. He vitalises them by His life and heat.2. He animates them.3. He is fully conscious through them.4. The etheric is in time His lowest principle, but the dense physical is notcounted. The dense cosmic physical body is composed of matter of the three lowerplanes of the solar system, the mental, the astral and the physical. The buddhicplane is consequently the fourth cosmic ether.d. The Heavenly Men form the seven centres in the body of the Logos. Therefore,They are the spheres of fire which animate His body, and each of Them expressesone form of His force manifestation, according to Their place within the body.e. Human beings, when centred within their groups on causal levels, form one orother of the seven centres in the body of a Heavenly Man.f. The solar Logos forms one centre in the body of a still greater cosmicENTITY. Human beings therefore [273] find their place within one of theforty-nine centres (not groups, for a centre may be made up of many groups,corresponding to the different parts) of the seven Heavenly Men.A Heavenly Man, with His seven centres, forms one centre in the body of thesolar Logos. I would here point out to you the close connection existing betweenthe seven Rishis of the Great Bear and the seven Heavenly Men. The seven Rishisof the Great Bear are to Them what the Monad is to the evolving human unit.VII. WHY IS THE PROGRESS OF EVOLUTION CYCLIC?This question is one which necessarily appals us and makes us wonder.Let us, therefore, deal with it as follows: Certain ideas are involved in thethought of cyclic progression, and these ideas it might pay us well tocontemplate.1. The Idea of Repetition.This repetition involves the following factors:a. Repetition in time: The thought of cyclic activity necessitates periods oftime of differing length—greater or lesser cycles—but (according to theirlength) of uniform degree. A manvantara, or Day of Brahma, is always of acertain length, and so is a mahamanvantara. The cycles wherein an atom of anyplane revolves upon its axis are uniform on its own plane.b. Repetition in fact: This involves the idea of a key measure, or sound of anyparticular group of atoms that go to the composition of any particular form.This grouping of atoms will tend to the make-up of a particular series ofcircumstances and will repeat the measure or sound when an animating factor isbrought to bear upon them. When the vitalising force is contacting at statedperiods a certain set of atoms, it will call forth from them a specific soundwhich will demonstrate objectively as environing circumstances. In other words,[274] the interplay of the Self and the not-self is invariably of a cyclicnature. The same quality in tone will be called forth by the Self as it indwellsthe form, but the key will ascend by gradual degrees. It is similar to theeffect produced in striking the same note in different octaves, beginning at thebase.c. Repetition in space: This concept is involved deep in the greater concept ofkarma, which is really the law that governs the matter of the solar system, andwhich commenced its work in earlier solar systems. We have, therefore, cycles inorder , and repetition in an ever-ascending spiral, under definite law.The thoughts thus conveyed might be expressed likewise as follows:a. The solar system repeating its activity....Repetition in Space.b. A planetary chain repeating its activity....Repetition in Time.c. The constant consecutive reverberation of a plane note, of a subplane note,and of all that is called into objectivity by that note.....Plane Repetition.d . The tendency of atoms to perpetuate their activity, and thus producesimilarity of circumstance, of environment and of vehicle....Form Repetition.When we carry these ideas on to every plane in the solar system, and from thenceto the cosmic planes, we have opened up for ourselves infinitude.2. Repetition of Cyclic Action is Governed by Two Laws:Perhaps it is more accurate to say that it is governed by one law, primarily,and a subsidiary law. This leads [275] to two general types of cycles, and isinvolved in the very nature of the Self and of the not-self. The interplay ofthe two by the aid of mind produces that which we call environment orcircumstance.The general law, which produces cyclic effect, is the Law of Attraction andRepulsion, of which the subsidiary law is the Law of Periodicity, and ofRebirth. Cyclic evolution is entirely the result of the activity of matter, andof the Will or Spirit. It is produced by the interaction of active matter andmoulding Spirit. Every form holds hid a Life. Every life constantly reaches outafter the similar life latent in other forms. When Spirit and matter sound thesame note evolution will cease. When the note sounded by the form is strongerthan that of Spirit, we have attraction between forms. When the note sounded bySpirit is stronger than that of matter and form, we have Spirit repelling form.Here we have the basis for the battlefield of life, and its myriads ofintermediate stages, which might be expressed as follows:a. The period of the domination of the form note is that of involution.b . The period of the repulsion of form by Spirit is that of the battlefield ofthe three worlds.c . The period of the attraction of Spirit and Spirit, and the consequentwithdrawal from form is that of the Path.d. The period of domination of the note of Spirit is that of the higher planesof evolution.To the synchronisation of the notes, or to the lack of synchronisation, may beattributed all that occurs in the world cycles. Thus we have the production ofharmony; first, the basic note of matter, then the note of Spirit graduallyovercoming the lower note and usurping attention [276] till gradually the noteof Spirit overpowers all other notes. Yet it must be borne in mind that it isthe note of the life that holds the form together. The note of the Sun, forinstance, holds in just attraction the circling spheres, the planets. The notessynchronise and harmonise till the stage of adequacy is reached and the periodof abstraction. Cyclic evolution proceeds. A human being, similarly, holds (bymeans of his note) the atoms of the three bodies together, being to them as thecentral sun to the planets. Primarily, nevertheless, it may be posited that theLaw of Attraction is the demonstration of the powers of Spirit, whilst the Lawof Repulsion governs the form. Spirit attracts Spirit throughout the greatercycle. In lesser cycles, Spirit temporarily attracts matter. The tendency ofSpirit is to merge and blend with Spirit. Form repulses form, and thus bringsabout separation. But—during the great cycle of evolution—when the third factorof Mind comes in, and when the point of balance is the goal, the cyclic displayof the interaction between Spirit and form is seen, and the result is theordered cycles of the planets, of a human being, and of an atom. Thus, throughrepetition, is consciousness developed, and responsive faculty induced. Whenthis faculty is of such a nature that it is an inherent part of the Entity’sworking capital, it has to be exercised on every plane, and again cyclic actionis the law, and hence rebirth again and again is the method of exercise. Whenthe innate conscious faculty of every unit of consciousness has becomeco-ordinated as part of the equipment of the Logos on every plane of the solarsystem, then, and only then, will cyclic evolution cease, will rotary movementon every plane of the cosmic physical plane be of such a uniform vibration as toset up action on the next cosmic plane, the astral. [277]3. The Third Idea Involved Is That of the Two Types of Cycles1. Rotation on the axis: This is to be seen whether we are dealing with a minuteatom of substance, with a planet revolving on its axis, with the rotation of thecausal body, or with the rotation of a solar system.a. In relation to the human being, this might be considered as the rotation ofthe various sheaths around the central consciousness during any one incarnation.b. In relation to a Heavenly Man it might be considered as the rotation of aglobe within a chain, or the period of one incarnation.c. In relation to a solar Logos it might be considered as one completerevolution of the Sun in space, with all that is included within thering-pass-not.2. Rotation around an orbit. This is the revolution of a sphere of life, notonly on its axis, but along a spheroidal path or orbit around a central point.a . In connection with man this might be considered as the revolution of thewheel of life, or the passage of an entity through the three lower planes downinto incarnation and back again.b . In connection with a Heavenly Man it might be considered as the cycle whichwe call a round in which the life of the Heavenly Man cycles through all theseven globes.c. In connection with the solar Logos it is the complete revolution of the solarsystem around its cosmic centre.It is to be noted at this point that the ideas dealt with in connection withcyclic evolution cannot be posited apart from the concept of consciousness. Theideas of [278] time, of space, and of activity (from the point of view of theoccultist), can only be conceived as relative to some conscious entity, to someThinker.Time to the occultist is that cycle, greater or lesser, in which some life runssome specific course, in which some particular period begins, continues, andends, in connection with the awareness of some Entity, and is recognised only astime when the participating life has reached a considerable stage of awareness.Time has been defined as a succession of states of consciousness, (115[text00028.html#Y_FN115] ) and it therefore may be studied from the point ofview of[279] a. Logoic consciousness , or the successive states of divine realisationwithin the solar sphere.b. Planetary consciousness, or the consciousness of a Heavenly Man as He cyclessuccessively through the scheme.c. Causal consciousness, or the successive expanding of the intelligentawareness of a human being from life to life.d. Human consciousness, or the awareness of a man on the physical plane, andprogressively on the emotional and the mental planes.e. Animal, vegetable and mineral consciousness which differs from the humanconsciousness in many particulars, and primarily in that it does notco-ordinate, or deduce and recognise separate identity. It resembles humanconsciousness in that it covers the response to successive contacts of the unitsinvolved during their small cycles.f. Atomic consciousness, demonstrating through successive states of repulsionand attraction. In this last definition lies the key to the other states ofconsciousness.An atom revolves upon its axis. In its revolution it comes within the field ofactivity of other atoms. These it either attracts and swings into its own fieldof operation, or it repulses and drives them outside its range of activity,causing separation. One thing to be borne in mind in the concept of mutualattraction is the preservation of identity in cohesion.A human being in objective manifestation likewise revolves upon his axis, oraround his central point, his mainspring of animation; this brings him withinthe range of activity of other men, other human atoms. This similarly eithertends to co-operation or cohesion, or to separation or repulsion. Again it mustbe borne in mind that even in cohesion identity is preserved.[280] A Heavenly Man, through the form of a planetary chain, similarly revolvesupon His axis, and a like phenomenon may be observed. A planet repulses a planetsimilarly charged, for it is a known law that like particles repel each other,but occultly it is a known law that they will eventually attract each other asthe vibration becomes sufficiently strong. A negative planet will be attractedby a positive, and so on through all forms. This is the manifestation of SEX insubstance of every kind, from the tiny atom in the body to the vast planetarychains, and this is the basis of activity. Radiatory activity is simply theinterplay between male and female, and this can be seen in the physical atom ofthe scientist, among men and women, and in the vaster atom of a solar system asit vibrates with its cosmic opposite.We might, therefore, consider time as that process of activity, or thatprogression in development, wherein the indwelling Consciousness is seeking itsopposite, and coming under the Law of Attraction, which leads to atomic, human,planetary, spiritual, solar and cosmic marriage. This idea is comparativelysimple in relation to a human being, and can be seen in daily demonstration inhis contacts with other men; these contacts are governed, for instance, verylargely by his likes and dislikes. All these attractions and repulsions areunder law, and their cause exists in form itself. The emotion of like or ofdislike is nothing else but the realisation by the conscious entity of theswinging into his magnetic radius of an atomic form which he is led, by the verylaw of his own being, to either attract or repulse. Only when the form istranscended, and Spirit seeks out Spirit, will the phenomena of repulsion cease.This will be the inevitable finale at the cessation of solar evolution, and itwill bring about pralaya. The duration of the interplay, the period of thesearch of Spirit for Spirit, and [281] the vibratory process necessitated by theutilisation of the form, this we call Time, whether in connection with a man, aplanetary Logos, or the Deity.Space, again, is included in the idea of consciousness, and its utilisation ofmatter. Space, for the Logos, is literally the form wherein His consciousactivities and purposes are worked out—the solar ring-pass-not. The spacewherein a planetary Logos works out His plans is similarly as much of solarspace as His consciousness is developed enough to use. Man again repeats theprocess and his ring-pass-not is included in the radius of his consciousness,and may be very circumscribed as in the case of the little evolved, or may beinclusive of a portion of planetary space of great extent, and even in the caseof the very highly evolved may begin to touch the periphery of the sphere ofinfluence of the planetary Logos in Whose body he is a cell.Space for the atom (for instance, the atom in the physical body of man) will bethe radius of the form in which is found the greater centre of consciousness ofwhich it is a part and it will be both attracted and repulsed—attracted andbuilt into the form of the greater Life, yet repulsed and thereby prevented frommoving from a certain point within that form.We have here dealt a little with time and space in their relation to a specificcentre of consciousness; we have seen that they are simply forms of ideas toexpress the cyclic activity of an entity . The subject is exceedingly abstruse,due to the low stage of the human intelligence, which is as yet so occupied withthe objective or material side of manifestation that the attraction existingbetween Spirit and Spirit is little more than a concept. When more of the humanfamily have their centre of consciousness in the Ego and hence are busy with thework of repulsing matter, and with the withdrawal of [282] Spirit from form,then only will the transmutative process be comprehended, then only will time(as known in the three worlds) be transcended, and then only will space (asmanifested to man through the three lower planes or the eighteen subplanes) befound to be a barrier. This same statement can be predicated of the seven Logoiand of the solar Logos, extending the idea to other planes, solar and cosmic. Soalso can it be narrowed down to the subhuman, and to the involutionary lives,remembering ever that as the consciousness is more confined and restricted soinertia, lack of response and limitation of radiation will be seen.By a close scrutiny of chart V, it will be apparent wherein lies the problem ofthe Logos, and wherein lies the accuracy of the correspondence between Him andHis reflection Man.First. Both are in objective manifestation on the physical plane.Second. Both are at their point of deepest involution.Third . Both are trammelled by matter, and are developing consciousness (egoicconsciousness) on the physical plane—man on the solar physical, and the Logos onthe cosmic physical plane.Fourth. Man has to bring down into conscious full control, the God within.Through that control he must dominate circumstance, make his environment hisinstrument and manipulate matter. On cosmic levels the Logos does likewise. Bothare far from achievement.Fifth. Both work in, with, and by, electrical force.Sixth . Both come under the laws governing forms and hence both are controlledin time and space by KARMA, which is the Law of forms. It has to do withquality, as force has to do with vibration.Seventh. Both work through forms made up of: [283]a. Three main types of forms: A mental form, one aspect of manifestation; anastral form, a second aspect; and a physical form, the third aspect. The mentalvibration sets the key measure and seeks to utilise and co-ordinate the physicalbody at Will . It deals with or links up the consciousness to the three forms inone direction; it repulses and causes separation in another. The astralvibration deals with the quality, with the attractive measure. It is the psychicelement. The physical is the meeting ground of consciousness with the materialform. This last is the result produced by the union of the key measure and thequality of tone.b. Seven centres of force which hold the three forms in one coherent whole, andcause their vitalisation and their co-ordination. They put the triple unit intocorrelation with their main centre of consciousness on the higher planes,whether that centre is the causal body of man, of a planetary Logos, or of asolar Logos.c. Millions of infinitesimal cells, each embodying a lesser life, each in acondition of constant activity, and each repulsing other cells so as to preserveindividuality or identity, yet each held to each by a central attractive force.Thus we have produced the objective form of a crystal, a vegetable, an animal, aman, a planet, a system.Finally, both work, therefore, in a dual manner and each demonstrates bothattraction and repulsion.Attraction of matter to Spirit and the building of a form for the use of Spiritis the result of electrical energy in the universe, which in each case bringsthe lesser lives or spheres into its range of influence. The magnetic force, thelife of the Logos gathers together His body of manifestation. The magnetic forceof the Heavenly Man, the planetary Logos, gathers out of the solar ring-pass-notthat which He needs for each incarnation.[284] The magnetic force of the Ego gathers, at each rebirth, matter within theparticular sphere or scheme within which the Ego has place. So on down thescale, we find the lesser pursuing its round ever within the greater.Therefore we have (during a period of Attraction and Repulsion, or a life cycle)that which we call Time and Space, and this holds equally true in the life cycleof a Logos or an ant, or a crystal. There are cycles of activity in matter, dueto some energising Will, and then Time and Space are known. There are cycles ofnon-being when Time and Space are not, and the energising Will is withdrawn. Butwe must not forget that this is purely relative, and only to be considered fromthe standpoint of the particular life or entity involved, and the special stageof awareness reached. All must be interpreted in terms of consciousness.The first type of cycle, or the period involved in one entire revolution of asphere around its own centre of consciousness, is to the particular Entityinvolved (be he God or man) a lesser cycle. The second type of cycle or theperiod involved in the complete circling of an orbit, or the revolution of asphere around the centre of which it is an integral part, we can consider as agreater cycle. The third type of cycle has not so much to do with the transitionof the form through a certain location in space but as the cycle which includesboth the greater and the lesser cycles. It has to do with the response of theENTITY, to Whom our solar Logos is but a centre in His Body, to the contactsmade on that centre and on its cosmic opposite. These two centres, for instance,our solar system and its cosmic opposite, in their interaction create a cycleperiod which has a relation to the “ONE WHO IS ABOVE OUR LOGOS.” This is, ofcourse, beyond human conception, but must be included in our enumeration ofcycles if exactitude is to be achieved. [285]VIII. WHY IS KNOWLEDGE BOTH EXOTERIC AND ESOTERIC?( 116 [text00028.html#Y_FN116] )We can now take up the question next in order, which was worded: “Why do weconsider certain aspects of knowledge esoteric and other aspects as exoteric?”The answer to this practically involves the realisation that some knowledgedeals with the subjective side of life, and the other type of knowledge with theobjective side; that one type of knowledge is concerned with energy and force(hence the danger of undue hasty revelation) and another with that which isenergised. Therefore it will be apparent that until the faculty of ascertainingsubjective information is achieved, whole ranges of facts will remain outsidethe scope of the consciousness of the majority.As we have been told, the goal of evolution is the attainment of consciousnesson all planes; owing to the small evolutionary attainment of the race only thephysical plane is as yet in any way brought under conscious control. Theknowledge which deals with that plane, [286] the information which is concernedwith densest objectivity, the sumtotal of facts connected with the five lowersubplanes of the physical plane are (from the occult standpoint) consideredexoteric. During the next two races the other two subplanes will be mastered,and the entire mass of knowledge concerned with physical and etheric matter,with energy, form and experience on the physical plane, will be easily availableto man, and concern only his five physical senses.Information and knowledge of the life evolving through the forms will for aconsiderably longer time be considered esoteric, as also will the apprehensionand comprehension of the matter aspect, and the laws governing energy on theastral and the mental planes. This is stated in connection with average man, therank and file of humanity. Objective or exoteric information is largely thatobtained or ascertained by men in the Hall of Learning by means of the fivesenses, and by experiment. Experiment in due course of time and after manycycles of incarnation is transmuted into experience, and this produceseventually that which we call instinct, or the habitual reaction of some type ofconsciousness to a given set of circumstances, or of environment. These twofactors of the senses and of experimental contact can be seen working out in theanimal and human kingdoms; the difference between the two exists in the abilityof the man consciously to remember, apprehend, anticipate, and utilise thefruits of past experience, and thus influence the present and prepare for thefuture. He employs the physical brain for this purpose. An animal likewise hasan instinctual memory, apprehension, and an embryo anticipation, but (lackingmind) he is unable to adjust them to circumstances in the sense ofprearrangement, and lacks the capacity consciously to utilise, and thus reap,the benefit of past events, and to learn from experience in the manner which aman does. The [287] animal uses the solar plexus in the same way that a man usesthe brain; it is the organ of instinct.All that can be acquired by instinct and by the use of the concrete mindfunctioning through the physical brain can be considered as dealing with thatwhich we call exoteric. It is thus evident how the range of fact will differaccording to:a . The age of the soul.b . Experience developed and used.c . Condition of the brain and the physical body.d . Circumstances and environment.As time progresses and man reaches a fair state of evolution, mind is morerapidly developed, and a new factor comes gradually into play. Little by littlethe intuition, or the transcendental mind, begins to function, and eventuallysupersedes the lower or concrete mind. It then utilises the physical brain as areceiving plate, but at the same time develops certain centres in the head, andthus transfers the zone of its activity from the physical brain to the higherhead centres, existing in etheric matter. For the mass of humanity, this will beeffected during the opening up of the etheric subplanes during the next tworaces. This is paralleled in the animal kingdom by the gradual transference ofthe zone of activity from the solar plexus to the rudimentary brain, and itsgradual development by the aid of manas.As we consider these points, it will become apparent that the esoteric aspectsof knowledge are really those zones of consciousness which are not yetconquered, and brought within the radius of control of the indwelling Entity.The point to be emphasised is that when this is realised the true significanceof the esoteric and the occult will be appreciated, and the endeavor of allKNOWERS will be to draw within the zone of their knowledge other [288] units whoare ready for a similar expansion of consciousness. In this thought lies the keyto the work of the Brotherhood. They attract by Their force into certain fieldsof realisation and endeavor and by that attraction and the response of thosehuman atoms who are ready, the group soul on the upward arc, or a particularcentre of a Heavenly Man, is co-ordinated.In the same way the animal is brought at a certain stage into the zone ofinfluence of the lesser sons of mind—human beings who are the elder brothers ofthe animals, as the Masters of the Wisdom are the Elder Brothers where humanityis concerned. So the interlocking proceeds and the division of responsibility.IX. WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN:a. The ten planetary schemes?b. The seven sacred planets?c. The seven chains in a scheme?d. The seven globes in a chain?e. The seven rounds on a globe?f. The seven root-races and the seven subraces?We have in this question a vast quantity of matter to deal with and it will beimpossible for us to do more than to get a broad and general idea.The subject is so vast and the comprehensiveness of the interrelated points isso great that we shall only attain lucidity if we confine our attention tocertain broad general conceptions, leaving the subsidiary points for moredetailed elucidation at some later period.1. The Inter-related PartsPrimarily I would suggest that we consider this subject only as it concerns aHeavenly Man , that we omit from our immediate calculations the consideration ofthe cellular composition of His body (those separated units of consciousnesswhich we call deva and human [289] beings), and that we view the matter fromwhat is to the human being, the group concept, and not the individual.The entire middle section of this treatise on the Fires has to do with thedevelopment of the consciousness of a Heavenly Man, and the application by Himof the knowledge gained (through the aid of manas or mind) in a previous solarsystem, to the acquisition of wisdom through objectivity, and to thetransmutation of the earlier acquired faculty into applied Love. This is Hiswork in the same sense that the work of the cells within His body is to developthe mind principle. When through experience in the three worlds the human unitshave accomplished this, they can then gain—through the finalinitiations—something of the group concept, or the conscious realisation ofplace, and of energised activity within the ring-pass-not of their particularplanetary Logos. Therefore, we might consider the following points:First: The work of the units who go to the make-up of a particular planetaryLogos. This is of a threefold nature:a. To attain the consciousness of the realised control of their own individualring-pass-not, or of their own sphere of activity. This covers the period ofevolution up to the first Initiation, or their entrance upon the Path, and thusinto the spiritual kingdom. It concerns the awakening of consciousness on thethree lower planes.b. To attain the consciousness of the particular centre in the body of one ofthe planetary Logoi—which centre embodies their group activity. This carriesthem to the fifth Initiation, and covers the period wherein consciousness isawakened on the five planes of evolution.c . To attain to the consciousness of the centre in the Body of the Logos ofwhich any particular planetary [290] Logos is the sumtotal. This carries them tothe seventh Initiation and covers the period of the awakening of consciousnesson the seven planes of the solar system.These expansions are attained by the aid of mind, transmuted in due course oftime into love-wisdom, and entail the conscious control of the entire sevenplanes of the solar system, or of the lowest cosmic plane.Second: The work of the Heavenly Men Who in their totality are the seven centresin the body of the Logos. This work is again threefold:a. To attain to full self-consciousness, or to individual consciousness on thefive planes; to vibrate with conscious activity within Their Own ring-pass-not,a planetary scheme. This covers a period in the scheme of involution, and ofthat period during the evolutionary stage which is comprised within the firstthree rounds up to the entrance upon the fourth round.b. To attain to the consciousness of the solar Logos, within Whose body Theyform the centres. It entails the attainment by a Heavenly Man of a groupconsciousness of a sevenfold nature, or the achievement of accurate vibratoryrelationship with the other Heavenly Men Who form the other centres. It carrieswith it the capacity to have full conscious control on the seven planes of thesolar system, and covers that period of development which is undergone in aplanetary chain during the fourth, fifth, and sixth rounds. It should be bornein mind that a paralleling recognition should here be given to the fact that thesolar Logos holds an analogous position in the body of a cosmic Entity to thatheld by a Heavenly Man in the body of a solar Logos.c. To attain to the consciousness of a greater centre on cosmic levels. Thiscovers the period of the seventh round, and gives to a Heavenly Man (when theserounds are viewed in the light of the Eternal Now, and not from the standpointof time and of space) the consciousness of [291] the cosmic astral, or thesecond lowest plane of the cosmic planes. A great deal of the problem to be seenslowly working out at this time to a solution is due to the fact that thecontrol of the Heavenly Man, Whose body our scheme may be, is as yet butpartial, and His cosmic experience is as yet but imperfect. This necessarilyaffects the cells in His body in the same way that lack of astral control in thecase of a human being, affects his vehicle. It might here be pointed out thatthe evolution of the Heavenly Men is unequal, and that our planetary Logos hasnot the control, for instance, that the Heavenly Man of the Venus chain hasachieved. In each round one subplane of the cosmic astral plane is brought undercontrol, and the consciousness of the Heavenly Man expands to include onesubplane more. The planetary Lord of Venus has dominated and controlled the fivesubplanes and is working on the sixth. Our planetary Logos is engaged in asimilar work on the fourth and fifth. The work, as in all cycles, overlaps andit might be explained thus:He is perfecting the control of the fourth subplane on the cosmic astral plane,and has nearly completed it. He is beginning to work at the control of the fifthsubplane—a control which will be perfected in the fifth round.He is sensing and responding to the vibration of the sixth subplane, but is notas yet fully conscious on that subplane.We have a corresponding reflection to this in the fourth and fifth root-races onthis planet, in which the astral consciousness of the Atlantean cycle is beingperfected, the fifth principle is being developed, and the sixth is beinggradually sensed. This deserves thoughtful consideration.Third: The work of a solar logos is again of a corresponding nature:[292] a. He has to attain to the full consciousness of His entire ring-pass-not,or of the seven planes of the solar system. This covers a period wherein five ofthe Heavenly Men, or five of His centres, and therefore, five schemes, reach astage of accurate response to contact and stimulation.b. He has to attain to the consciousness of the cosmic Logos within Whose bodyHe is a centre. He must find by experience His place within the cosmic group ofwhich He is a part, in much the same way as a planetary Logos pursues a similarcourse. This is achieved when all the Heavenly Men or each of the seven centresare awakened and functioning consciously and freely, with their systemicinter-relation adjusted and controlled by the Law of Action and Reaction. Itbrings within His control not only the seven subplanes of the cosmic physicalplane (our seven major planes) but necessarily also the cosmic astral plane.c. To attain to the consciousness of the centre in the body of the ONE ABOUTWHOM NOUGHT MAY BE SAID. This centre is formed by the sphere of influence of acosmic Logos. In the body of a cosmic Logos, a solar Logos is a centre.We must bear in mind that this enumeration is given from the standpoint of thepresent , and from the angle of vision (relatively limited) of the Heavenly Manof our particular scheme, and that it is therefore circumscribed by His peculiarconditions, which govern the intelligence of the cells in His body; it is givenfrom the point of view of differentiation and not of synthesis. A syntheticabsorption proceeds eventually in connection with all these Entities, and eachundergoes a process, paralleling on His Own level that undergone by theMicrocosm; in the case of the Microcosm the causal body or the body of the Egoacts as the synthesiser of the energy of the Quaternary or lower Self, and thespiritual[293] TABULATION IIEVOLUTION IN THE UNIVERSEEntity Vehicle Centre Space Time The Unknown 7 constellations. cosmic Logos 5cosmic planes. A cosmic Logos 7 solar systems solar Logos 4 cosmic planes. Asolar Logos 7 planetary schemes Heavenly Man 3 cosmic planes. Period of threesolar systems. A Heavenly Man 7 planetary chains Chohans and groups 2 cosmicplanes. Period of one solar system. A Man 7 etheric centrcs a Principle 1 cosmicplane Period of one planetary scheme.[294] or monadic sheath as the synthesiser of the seven principles, making thusthe three, the seven, and the ten.In closing I would point out that the mind must carefully be kept from reducingall these ideas into a rankly materialistic concept. It must be rigidly borne inmind that we are dealing with the subjective life, and not with the objectiveform, and that we are considering, for instance, the synthesis of the principlesor the qualitating energies and not the synthesis of form.Through each etheric centre man is bringing to perfect vibration some oneprinciple or quality through which the subjective life may express itself.Through each chain in a scheme a Heavenly Man is endeavoring to do the same.Through each scheme in a system, a solar Logos is working at the same thing; thegoal is synthetic quality and not primarily the perfection of the form. Theresponse of the energised form to the qualitative life is naturally—under thelaw—equal to the demand, but this is of secondary importance and is not theobject in view.We have seen that the work to be accomplished in all the above cases isnecessarily threefold:First. The development of individual consciousness.Second. The development of group consciousness.Third. The development of God consciousness, of that consciousness in each casewhich represents the highest spiritual Source, and which is recognised as thesame in essence as the God within the individual, whether man or solar Logos.This concept must be meditated upon by all thinkers and its synthesisemphasised. The relation of the cell to the group, of the group to the aggregateof groups, and of them all to the indwelling Entity Who holds them in syntheticcorrelation by means of the Law of Attraction and Repulsion is of vital moment.Two main ideas must always be borne in mind: [295]That the terms “cell, group, or congery of groups” relate entirely to the formof vehicle, and thus to the matter aspect.That the idea of an Entity Who synthesises the groups and is the animating lifeof the cell has to do with the Spirit aspect.These two concepts lead necessarily to a third, that of the development ofconsciousness, which is the gradual expansion of the realisation of theIndweller in the form, the apprehension by the Self of the relation of the formto Itself, and of its slow utilisation and control. This persists until thatRealisation includes the cell, the group, and the totality of groups. Theseideas can be applied to the three grades of consciousness referred to. Asfollows:Man, the lowest type of coherent consciousness (using the word “consciousness”in its true connotation as the “One who knows”) is but a cell, a minute atomwithin a group.A Heavenly Man represents a coherent conscious group.A solar Logos on His Own plane holds an analogous place to that of a HeavenlyMan in a solar system, and from a still higher standpoint to that of a manwithin the solar system. When the place of the solar planes within the cosmicscheme is duly apprehended it will be recognised that on cosmic levels of a highorder the solar Logos is an Intelligence as relatively low in the order ofcosmic consciousness as man is in relation to solar consciousness. He is but acell in the body of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID. His work parallels oncosmic levels the work of man on the solar planes. He has to undergo on thethree lower cosmic planes a process of developing an apprehension of Hisenvironment of the same nature as man in the three worlds. This fact should beremembered by all students [296] of this central division of our subject; aboveall the analogy between the cosmic physical planes and the solar physical planesmust be pondered upon. It holds hid the fourfold mystery:1. The mystery of the Akasha.2. The secret of the fifth round.3. The esoteric significance of Saturn, the third planet.4. The occult nature of cosmic kundalini, or the electrical force of the system.One hint on this fourth point may be given for wise consideration. When theelectrical interplay between the planets is better ascertained (and by this Imean their negative or positive interplay), then it will be revealed which arerelated or connected, and which are nearing the point of balance. I would herepoint out very briefly certain facts, not pausing to elaborate or to elucidate,but simply making various statements which—as the knowledge of manprogresses—will assume their rightful place in the ordered scheme. They willthen be seen as enlightening and revealing the necessary sequence ofdevelopment.2. The Work of the Atomic Units .a. The seven Heavenly Men, considered in relation to the Entity of Whom thesolar Logos is a reflection, are as the seven centres in the physical body of ahuman being. This will be realised as the correspondence between the cosmicphysical plane and the systemic physical plane is studied.b. Three of these centres, thereforeConcern the lower centres of the cosmic Being.Have their analogies on the dense, liquid and gaseous planes.Are at present the object of the attention of cosmic kundalini.[297] c . One of these centres corresponds to the solar plexus and is thesynthesiser of the lower three, thus making a quaternary.d. The centre which is analogous to that at the base of the spine, or thereservoir of kundalini, has a permanence which is not seen in the other twolower centres. The Heavenly Man Who embodies this principle and is the source ofgenerative heat to His Brothers, must be sought for by the aid of the intuition.Concrete Mind will not here avail.e. The three higher centres, or the Heavenly Men Who correspond to the head, theheart and the throat of the solar Logos, have Their etheric analogies on thethree higher etheric levels of the cosmic physical plane, just as the HeavenlyMan Who embodies the logoic solar plexus finds His manifesting source on thefourth etheric.f. This Heavenly Man, with His etheric vortex or wheel of force on the fourthcosmic ether, is in this fourth round, a vital factor in planetary evolution.g. When the Heavenly Man, Who is at present demonstrating through the Earthscheme, has succeeded in vitalising His middle centre, or in directing the forceof planetary kundalini away from the lower centres to the solar plexus centre, anew cycle will be reached, and much of the present distress will be ended. Hiswork is as yet in an embryonic condition, and two and a half more cycles musttranspire before He has accomplished the necessary work. When that is done, theresult in connection with the human units in incarnation will be threefold:Sex stimulation, as now understood, will be showing a tendency to manifest increation, not so much on the physical plane, as on the astral and mental,demonstrating in the creations of art and beauty, and the objective work of thescientists.Crime, as now seen, based largely on the sex emotion, [298] will be a thing ofthe past, and physical plane license, orgy and horror will be reducedseventy-five per cent.The interplay between the three dense physical planets will be perfected and manwill pass at will from one to another.I would here point out the inadvisability of the method whereby the names of theglobes in a chain, just as the names of a chain in a scheme, follow theplanetary nomenclature. This has led to confusion.A clue tending towards the correct understanding lies hid in the words: “Venusis the Earth’s primary.” (S.D., II, 33. I, 323)It is not permissible to say much about this mystery, that “Venus is the Earth’salter ego,” nor is it advisable, but certain ideas may be suggested which—ifbrooded on—may result in a wider grasp of the beauty of nature’s synthesis, andof the wonderful correlation of all that is in process of evolution.Perhaps some idea may be gained if we remember that, in an occult sense, Venusis to the Earth what the higher Self is to man.The coming of the Lords of Flame to the Earth was all under law and not just anaccidental and fortunate happening; it was a planetary matter which finds itscorrespondence in the connection between the mental unit and the manasicpermanent atom. Again, as the antaskarana is built by individual man betweenthese two points, so—again in a planetary sense—is a channel being built bycollective man on this planet to its primary, Venus.In connection with these two planets, it must be remembered that Venus is asacred planet and the Earth is not. This means that certain of the planets areto the Logos what the permanent atoms are to man. They embody principles.Certain planets afford only temporary [299] homes to these principles. Otherspersist throughout the mahamanvantara. Of these Venus is one.Three of the sacred planets, it should be remembered, are the home of the threemajor Rays, of the embodied forms of the three logoic aspects or principles.Other planets are embodiments of the four minor rays. We might consider—from thestandpoint of the present —that Venus, Jupiter and Saturn might be considered asthe vehicles of the three super-principles at this time. Mercury, the Earth andMars are closely allied to these three, but a hidden mystery lies here. Theevolution of the inner round has a close connection with this problem. Perhapssome light may be thrown upon the obscurity of the matter by the realisationthat just as the Logos has (in the non-sacred planets) the correspondence to thepermanent atoms in the human being, so the middle evolution between these two(God and man) is the Heavenly Man, whose body is made up of human and devamonads, and Who has likewise His permanent atoms. Always the three higherprinciples can be distinguished in importance from the four lower.The key is hidden in the fact that between the number of a globe in a chain andits corresponding chain lies a method of communication. The same is truelikewise of the correspondence between a chain of globes and a scheme ofanalogous number. The connection between Venus and the Earth lies hid in number,and it took a moment of mysterious alignment between a globe, its correspondingchain and the scheme of allied number to effect the momentous occurrence knownas the coming of the Lords of Flame. It occurred in the third rootrace in thefourth round. Here we have an analogy between the quaternary and the Triad,carrying the interpretation up to a Heavenly Man. The chain was the fourth chainand the globe, the fourth. The fourth [300] chain in the Venus scheme and thefourth globe in that chain were closely involved in the transaction.h. The progress of development of the Heavenly Men is by no means uniform. Onepoint has not been emphasised hitherto, and that is, that the problem beforeeach of Them is dissimilar, and, therefore, it is not possible for man correctlyto gauge the work done by Them and Their relative point of attainment. It hasbeen said that as Venus is in the fifth round, the Venusian Lord is furtherprogressed than His brothers. This is not altogether so. Just as in thedevelopment of humanity three main lines may be seen with four lesser linesmerging into one of the three main lines, so in connection with the HeavenlyMen, there are three main lines of which the Venusian is not one. The Lord ofVenus holds place in the logoic quaternary, as does the Lord of Earth.The main idea underlying the question we have been endeavoring to answer has todo with the relationship between the schemes, chains, rounds, and races, and itshould be borne in mind that these manifestations bear the same relationship toa Heavenly Man as incarnations do to a human being. This gives the opportunityhere to bring out perhaps a little more clearly the place of cycles in theevolution of all these Entities from a man up to a cosmic Logos, via a HeavenlyMan and a solar Logos. (S.D., I, 258) Just as it is pointed out in the SecretDoctrine that there are greater and lesser cycles in the evolution of a solarsystem, so it can be predicated equally of a Heavenly Man, of a human being, andof an atom. This brings us, therefore, to another statement:i. The cycles in the evolutionary process of all these Entities may be dividedmainly into three groups, though necessarily these groups can be extended intoseptennates and into an infinity of multiples of seven. [301]In connection with a solar Logos the cycles might be called:1. One hundred years of Brahma.2. A year of Brahma.3. A day of Brahma.These periods have been computed by the Hindu students and are the sumtotal oftime as we understand it or the duration of a solar system.In connection with a Heavenly Man we have the corresponding cycles to those ofthe Logos:1. The period of a planetary scheme.2. The period of a planetary chain.3. The period of a planetary round.Within these three divisions, which are the differentiations of the three greatcycles of incarnation of a planetary Logos, are numerous lesser cycles orincarnations but they all fall within one or other of the three main divisions.Such lesser cycles might be easily comprehended if it were pointed out that theymark such periods as:a. The period of manifestation on a globe.b . The period of a root-race.c. The period of a sub-race.d . The period of a branch race.In order to apprehend even cursorily the identity of manifestation of aplanetary Logos in a root-race, for instance, it must be remembered that thesumtotal of human and deva units upon a planet make the body vita l of aplanetary Logos, whilst the sumtotal of lesser lives upon a planet (from thematerial bodies of men or devas down to the other kingdoms of nature) form Hisbody corporeal, and are divisible into two types of such lives:a. Those on the evolutionary arc, such as in the animal kingdom.[302]b. Those on the involutionary arc, such as the totality of all elementalmaterial forms within His sphere of influence. All the involutionary lives, asearlier pointed out, form the vehicles for the spirit of the planet, or theplanetary entity, who is the sumtotal of the elemental essences in process ofinvolution. He holds a position (in relation to a Heavenly Man) analogous tothat held by the different elementals that go to the make-up of man’s threebodies, physical, astral and mental, and he is—like all manifestingbeings—threefold in his nature, but involutionary. Therefore, man and devas(differentiating the devas from the lesser Builders) form the SOUL of a HeavenlyMan. Other lives form his BODY, and it is with body and soul that we areconcerned in these two divisions of our thesis on FIRE. One group manifests thefire of matter, the other group the fire of mind, for the devas are thepersonification of the active universal mind, even though man is consideredmanasic in a different sense. Man bridges in essence; the devas bridge inmatter.In connection with Man the cycles are equally threefold:1. The Monadic cycle, which corresponds in man to the 100 years of Brahma, andto a planetary scheme.2. The Egoic cycle.3. The Personality cycle.In these thoughts on cycles we have opened up a vast range of thought,especially if we link the idea of egoic and personality cycles to the vasterperiods in connection with a planetary Logos. The idea is capable of vastexpansion, and is governed by certain fundamental ideas that must be carefullyconsidered and contemplated.[303] The cycles in a man’s personality manifestation demonstrate in groups offours and sevens, and follow the usual evolutionary sequence, as:a. Differentiation, the involutionary process, or the one becoming the many, thehomogeneous becoming the heterogeneous.b. Balance, or the process of karmic adjustment.c. Synthesis, or spiritualisation, the many again becoming the One.d. Obscuration, or liberation, the end of the evolutionary process, or thefreeing of Spirit from the limitations of matter.By this we must understand that all incarnations on the physical plane are notof equal importance, but some are of more moment than others; some, from thepoint of view of the Ego, are practically negligible, others count; some are tothe evolving human Spirit of importance analogous to the incarnation of aplanetary Logos in a globe, or through a root-race, whilst others are asrelatively unimportant to him as the manifestation of a branch-race is to aHeavenly Man.As yet, owing to the small point of development of the average man, the astralincarnations or cycles count for little, but they are by no means to bediscounted, and are oft relatively of more importance than the physical. In duecourse of time the astral cycles will be better comprehended and their relationto the physical. When it is realised that the physical body is not a principlebut that the kama-manasic principle (or desire-mind principle) is one of themost vital to man then the period or cycle in which a man functions on the fifthsubplane of the astral (the fundamentally kama-manasic plane) will assume itsrightful place. It is so again with the mental cycles and so with the causal.The causal cycles or the egoic cycles, which include all the groups of lesser[304] cycles in the three worlds correspond to a complete round in the cycles ofa Heavenly Man. There are seven such cycles, but the number of lesser cycles(included within the seven) is one of the secrets of Initiation.The egoic cycles proceed in groups of sevens and of threes, and not in groups offours and sevens as do the personality cycles, and the same ratio must bepredicated of the central cycles of a Heavenly Man and of a solar Logos.The monadic cycles proceed in groups of ones and of threes as do the basiccycles of those great Entities of which man is the microcosmic reflection. Ifthe general concept here laid down is studied in relation to the schemes, andother forms of manifestation to each other and, if the microcosm himself isstudied as the clue to the whole, some idea will begin to permeate the mind asto the purpose underlying all these manifestations. It should be borne also inmind that just as the average man in each incarnation achieves three objects:1. The development of consciousness or the awakening of the faculty of awareness,2. The achievement of a certain proportion of permanent faculty, or the definiteincrease of the content of the causal body,3. The making of karma, or the setting in motion (by action), of causes whichnecessitate certain unavoidable effects,so a Heavenly Man at one stage of His evolution does the same. As man progressesand as he enters upon the Probationary Path and the subsequent Path ofInitiation, he succeeds in bringing about some further noticeable developments.1. As before, his consciousness expands, but he begins to work intelligentlyfrom above and does not work blindly on the lower planes. [305]2. The building of the causal body is carried to full completion, and he beginsnext to shatter what he earlier wrought, and to destroy the Temple so carefullyconstructed, finding it too to be a limitation.3. He ceases to make karma in the three worlds, but begins to work it off, or,literally, to “wind up his affairs.”So do the Heavenly Men, for They likewise have a cosmic path to tread, analogousto that trodden by man, as he nears the goal of his endeavor.Again we can with exactitude carry the concept further still, and predicateaction of a similar nature by the solar Logos.The consideration of this question is nearly concluded and it must be apparentthat the relation between the aforementioned manifestations is of a psychicnature (using the word psychic in its true sense, as having reference to thepsyche, or soul, or consciousness) and deals with the gradual expansion ofSoul-Knowledge in a Heavenly Man. A word of warning should here be sounded.Though all these cosmic Beings find in man a reflection of Their Own Nature, yetthe analogy of resemblance must not be pushed to extremity. Man reflects, but hereflects not perfectly; man is evolving, but he is not occupied with the sameproblems in exact detail as are the perfected Manasaputras.Man aims at becoming a Divine Manasaputra, or perfected Son of Mind showingforth all the powers inherent in mind, and thus becoming like unto his monadicsource, a Heavenly Man. A Heavenly Man has developed Manas, and is occupied withthe problem of becoming a Son of Wisdom, not inherently but in fullmanifestation. A solar Logos is both a Divine Manasaputra and likewise a Dragonof Wisdom, and His problem concerns itself [306] with the development of theprinciple of cosmic Will which will make Him what has been called a “Lion ofCosmic Will.”Throughout all these graded manifestations the law holds good, and the lesser isincluded in the greater. Hence the need for the student to preserve with care adue sense of proportion, a discrimination as to time in evolution, and a justappreciation of the place of each unit within its greater sphere. Having soundedthis note of warning we can now proceed with the concluding remarks anent thisfinal question.It has been stated that a mystery lies hid in the 777 incarnations. This figureprovides room for much speculation. (S.D., I, 191) It should be pointed out thatit does not hold the number of a stated cycle of incarnations through which aman must pass, but holds the key to the three major cycles previously mentioned.Primarily this number applies to the planetary Logos of our scheme and not somuch to other schemes. Each Heavenly Man has His number and the number of ourHeavenly Man lies hid in the above three figures, just as 666 and 888 holds themystery hid of two other Heavenly Men. This number 777 is also the number oftransmutation , which is the fundamental work of all the Heavenly Men. The basicwork of man is accumulation and acquisition, or the acquiring of that which mustlater be transmuted. The work of transmutation, or the true cycle of 777commences on the Probationary Path, and is definitely the activity of a HeavenlyMan being realised and responded to by the cells in His Body. Only when His Bodyhas reached a certain vibratory movement can He truly influence the individualcells. This work of transmuting cell activity was begun on this planet duringthe last root-race, and the divine alchemy proceeds. The progress made is as yetbut small, but each transmuted [307] conscious cell increases the speed and theaccuracy of the work. Time alone is needed for the completion of the work. Inconnection with this matter of transmutation comes the legend of thePhilosopher’s Stone, which is literally the application of the Rod ofInitiation, in one sense."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION A - THE NATURE MANAS OR MIND[308] I. Three manifestations of manas.II. Some definitions of manas:1. Manas is the fifth principle.2. Manas is electricity.3. Manas is that which produces cohesion.4. Manas is the key opening the door into the fifth kingdom.5. Manas is the synthetic vibration of five rays.6. Manas is the intelligent will or ordered purpose of an existence.We enter now upon a very important division of our subject, and take up forconsideration the Fire of Mind, cosmically, systemically, and humanlyconsidered. We have dealt with the fire of matter, and studied for a while itspurpose, origin and work. We considered somewhat the factor of Consciousness,and saw that the great work of a solar Logos, with all included manifestinglives, was the development of a conscious control, and a psychic awarenesswithin certain set limits. Having laid down these preliminary foundationthoughts, we need now to block out, for the sake of clarity, the mass ofmaterial that is available on the subject of the manasic fire, which is theanimating principle of consciousness itself. Let us first of all get one broadgeneral outline and then proceed to fill in the details.I. THREE MANIFESTATIONS OF MANAS( 120 [text00028.html#Y_FN120] )1. The fire of mind, cosmically considered. [309]2. The fire of mind viewed systemically.3. The fire of mind in connection with a human being.In other words, what we are endeavoring to do is to study Mind in a solar Logos,a planetary Logos and in the Microcosm. Each of these three main divisions maybe dealt with under four lesser heads which may be expressed as follows:a. The origin of cosmic, systemic and microcosmic mind.b. The place of mind in evolution in all three cases.c. The present stage of development of mind in each of the three groups.d . The future of mind, or of manasic unfoldment.When we have taken up these points, we should have a clearer idea as to thepurpose and place of the fire of the intelligence, and should be able accuratelyto comprehend its correlating synthetic work.Before, however, following up these ideas it might prove of value to us if wesought to define this principle of manas and see what is already understood byit.II. DEFINITIONS OF MANAS OR MIND1. Manas, as we already know, is the fifth principle.Here enter in certain factors and analogies that it would be of profit to us tomention at this juncture.This fifth principle embodies the basic vibration of the fifth plane, eithercosmically or systemically considered. A certain sound of the logoic Word, whenit [310] reaches the mental plane, causes a vibration in the matter of thatplane, arrests its tendency to dissipate, causes it to take spheroidal form, andbuilds it literally into a body which is held in coherent shape by a mighty devaEntity, the Raja Lord of the mental plane. Exactly the same procedure ensued oncosmic levels, when a still mightier sound was uttered by the ONE ABOUT WHOMNAUGHT MAY BE SAID, and the utterance of this caused a vibration on the fifthcosmic plane. Certain great Entities became active, including such relativelyunimportant Beings as our solar Logos and His group.This fifth principle is the distinctive coloring of a particular group of solarLogoi on the causal level of the cosmic mental, and is the animating factor ofTheir Existence, the reason of Their manifesting through various solar systems,and the great Will-to-be that brings Them forth into objectivity.Manas has been defined as mind, or that faculty of logical deduction andreasoning, and of rational activity that distinguishes man from the animals. Yetit is something much more than that for it underlies all manifestation, and thevery shape of an amoeba, and the discriminative faculty of the lowest atom orcell, is actuated by mind of some kind or another. It is only as the place ofthat discriminating cell or atom within its greater sphere is apprehended, andrecognised, that any clear conception will be gained of what that coherentrational inclusive mentality may be.2. Manas is electricity. ( 121 [text00028.html#Y_FN121] )The fire of Mind is fundamentally electricity, shown in its higher workings, andnot considered so much as [311] force in matter. Electricity in the solar systemshows itself in seven major forms, which might be expressed as follows:Electricity on the first plane, the logoic or divine, demonstrates as theWill-to-be, the primary aspect of that force which eventually results inobjectivity. Cosmically considered, it is that initial impulse or vibration,which emanates from the logoic causal body on the cosmic mental plane, and makescontact with the first cosmic etheric, or the solar plane of adi.Electricity on the monadic plane demonstrates as the first manifestation ofform, as that which causes forms to cohere. Matter (electrified by “fire byfriction”) and the electric fire of spirit meet and blend, and form appears.Form is the result of the desire for existence, hence the dynamic fire of Willis transmuted into the burning fire of Desire. I would call attention to thechoice of those two phrases, which might also be expressed under the terms:Dynamic electrical manifestation.Burning electrical manifestation.Here on the second plane, the sea of electrical fire, which distinguished thefirst plane, is transformed into the akasha, or burning etheric matter. It isthe plane of the flaming Sun, just as the first plane is that of the fire mist[312] or the nebulae. This idea will be easier to comprehend if it is borne inmind that we are dealing with the cosmic physical plane .Certain things take place on the second plane which need realisation, even ifalready theoretically conceded:Heat or flaming radiation is first seen.Form is taken, and the spheroidal shape of all existence originates.The first interplay between the polar opposites is felt.Differentiation is first seen, not only in the recognised duality of all things,but in differentiation in motion; two vibrations are recognised.Certain vibratory factors begin to work such as attraction, repulsion,discriminative rejection, coherent assimilation, and the allied manifestation ofrevolving forms, orbital paths and the beginning of that curious downward pullinto matter that results in evolution itself.The primary seven manifestations of logoic existence find expression and thethree, with the four, commence their work.The seven wheels, or etheric centres in the body etheric of that great cosmicEntity, of Whom our solar Logos is a reflection, begin to vibrate and His lifeactivity can be seen.We are at this juncture considering the manifestations of electricity on thedifferent planes of the cosmic physical plane, or on our solar systemic planes.Hence, all that can be seen in manifestation is fundamentally physicalelectricity . We have seen that the primary manifestation is that whichvitalised, tinctured, and pervaded the matter of space, thus embodying—inconnection with logoic manifestation—that which is analogous to the vital heat,activity and radiation of a human being, [313] manifesting on the solar physicalplane. Certain electrical phenomena distinguish a human being, only (as theyhave not been expressed or considered in terms of electricity) the analogy hasbeen lost sight of. These demonstrations might be considered as:First, that coherent VITALITY which holds the entire body revolving around thecentral unit of force. It must here be remembered that the entire manifestationof a solar system consists of the etheric body, and the dense body of a Logos.Second, that radiatory MAGNETISM which distinguishes man, and makes him activein two ways:In relation to the matter of which his vehicles are composed.In relation to the units which form his group.Third , that ACTIVITY on the physical plane which results in due performance ofthe will and desire of the indwelling entity, and which in man is thecorrespondence of the Brahma aspect.These three electrical manifestations—vitality, magnetism, and fohaticimpulse—are to be seen at work in a solar Logos, a Heavenly Man and a humanbeing. They are the objective manifestations of the psychic nature, which (in asolar Logos, for instance) we speak of in terms of quality, and call will,wisdom, activity. Therefore, it should be noted here that the first three planesof the cosmic physical plane—the logoic, monadic, and atmic planes—are of primeimportance and are the basic planes from whence emanate the secondary four; inother words, the first three cosmic ethers embody in a literal sense those threeEntities whom we know as Mahadeva, Vishnu, and Brahma. In a similar sense theseThree find Their densest objectivity in the three physical ethers. The lowerfour manifest during evolution, but are eventually synthesised into the higher[314] three. It should be also remembered that on all the seven subplanes of asolar plane a process, in connection with electrical phenomena in ethericmatter, will parallel all the processes on the major planes. This is easily tobe seen on the mental plane, for instance, in connection with Man.Theoretically, the absorption of all faculty by the causal body, and thediscontinuance of all enforced objectivity in the three worlds at the close ofthe synthesising period is conceded. On the other planes it is not so obvious.On the buddhic plane, the Builders on the evolutionary arc, or a large part ofthe deva evolution, undergo a paralleling synthesis. On the physical plane amysterious synthesis in connection with the “spirit of the Earth” is undergone,and the first three ethers are related to him in a way as yet little understood.We might sum it up thus:First, the balancing of electrical phenomena, or the achievement of synthesis inconnection with Man, transpires on the three higher levels of the mental plane.Second, a similar process in connection with a Heavenly Man transpires on thethree higher subplanes of the monadic plane. Viewed in a larger sense it takesplace on the three major planes—the atmic, buddhic, and manasic—just as in thethree worlds of human evolution—the physical, astral, and mental—thesynthesising process proceeds on the higher of the three involved.Third, in connection with a solar Logos (within the system and not consideringHis cosmic synthesis) the three higher subplanes of the logoic plane see Hisfinal absorption or abstraction, and the three planes of the three Logoi aresimilarly concerned.It should here be carefully borne in mind that we are dealing with electricalmatter, and are therefore concerned with cosmic etheric substance; all matter inthe system is necessarily etheric. We are consequently dealing literally withphysical phenomena on all planes of [315] the system. In time and space we areconcerned with units of different polarity which—during the evolutionaryprocess—seek union, balance, equilibrium or synthesis, and eventually find it.This electrical interplay between two units causes that which we call light, andthereby objectivity. During evolution this demonstrates as heat and magneticinteraction and is the source of all vital growth; at the achievement of thedesired goal, at union, or at-one-ment, two things occur:First, the approximation of the two poles, or their blending, causes a blazingforth, or radiant light.Second, obscuration, or the final disintegration of matter owing to intenseheat.This can be seen in connection with man, a Heavenly Man and a solar Logos, andtheir bodies of objectivity. In man this polarity is achieved, the threedifferent types of electrical phenomena are demonstrated, and the light blazesforth, irradiating the causal body, and lighting up the entire sutratma, orthread (literally the Path) which connects the causal vehicle with the physicalbrain. Then disintegration or destruction ensues; the causal body vanishes in ablaze of electrical fire, and the real “man” or self is abstracted from thethree world-bodies. So will it be seen in the body of a Heavenly Man, aplanetary scheme, and so likewise in the body of the Logos, a solar system.The difficulty in apprehending these thoughts is great, for we are necessarilyhandicapped by lack of adequate terms, but the main ideas only are those I seekto deal with, and the one we are primarily concerned with in this division isthe electrical manifestation of magnetism , just as earlier we dealt cursorilywith the same electrical phenomena, manifesting as the activity of matter.Therefore you have: [316]1. Activity . . . . . . electrical manifestation of matter.2. Magnetism . . . electrical manifestation of form.3. Vitality . . . . . . electrical manifestation of existence.This is literally (as pointed out by H. P. B.) (S.D.,I, 567. II, 258) fire byfriction, solar fire, and electric fire.Fire by friction is electricity animating the atoms of matter, or the substanceof the solar system, and resulting in:The spheroidal form of all manifestation.The innate heat of all spheres.Differentiation of all atoms one from another.Solar fire is electricity animating forms or congeries of atoms, and resultingin:Coherent groups.The radiation from all groups, or the magnetic interaction of these groups.The synthesis of form.Electric fire is electricity demonstrating as vitality or the will-to-be of someEntity, and manifests as:Abstract Being.Darkness.Unity.We have seen that electrical manifestation on the first plane caused initialvibration, and on the second its activity resulted in the archetypal form of allmanifestation from a God to man, and an atom.On the third plane which, is primarily the plane of Brahma, this electricalforce showed itself in intelligent purpose. The will-to-be, and the formdesired, are correlated by intelligent purpose underlying all. This intelligentpurpose, or active will, utilising an instrument, brings us to that mostdifficult of metaphysical problems, the distinction between will and desire. Itis not possible [317] here to handle this delicate subject, save simply to pointout that in both will and desire, intelligence or manas is a fundamental factor,and must be recognised. This permeating principle of manas—colouring as it doesboth the will aspect and the desire aspect—is the cause of much confusion tostudents, and clarity of thought will eventuate only as it is realised:First , that all manifestation emanates, or is electrified, from the cosmicmental plane.Second, that the Universal Mind, or the divine thinker, is the intelligentPrinciple which makes Itself known as the Will-to-be, Desire or Love-of-Being,and that active intelligent purpose which animates the solar system.Third, that Maha-deva, or the Divine Will, Vishnu, the Wisdom aspect, or themanifested “Son of Necessity,” and Brahma or active purpose are the sum-total ofintelligent consciousness, and are (to the manifesting cosmic Entity) what themental body, the desire body, and the physical body are to man, the thinker inthe three worlds, functioning in the causal body. We must not forget that thecausal body contains the three permanent atoms or the three spheres which embodythe principle of intelligence, of desire, and of physical objectivity. Alwaysmust the analogy be held between the threefold Logos and threefold man, anddefiniteness of thought and of concept results when the one likeness betweenthese is pondered on. Man is a unit, functioning as a unit in the causal body.He is a triplicity functioning under the will aspect, or mental body; under thedesire or wisdom aspect, the astral body; and under the activity aspect, thephysical body. He electrifies or vitalises all three bodies or aspects, unifyingthem into one, and bringing about—by means of the Intelligence He is—coherencyof action, simultaneity of purpose, and synthetic endeavour.[318] Finally, therefore, it is apparent that, no matter from what angle westudy, the threefold Logos (or His reflection, the microcosm) through theManasic principle , intelligently reduces matter to form, and utilises that formfor the fulfilment of the will, desire and purpose of the indwelling Existence;this principle can be seen underlying all three aspects.There is no need here to point out the different triplicities which can be builtup on the basic idea of Spirit and Matter, linked by Intelligence. This hasoften been done. I but seek to emphasize that INTELLIGENCE is the main qualityof the Logos; that it shows as will, as desire or wisdom, and as activity; andthat the reason for this is due to the work earlier accomplished by the cosmicEntity, involving cycles which have passed into the dim mist of retrospect, evenfrom the angle of vision of a solar Logos.This developed manasic principle is the intelligent purpose that is bringingabout at-one-ment on each plane of the solar system in connection with thesubplanes. It will eventually bring about the synthesis of all the planes, andthus bring the cosmic physical plane, as a unified whole, under the completecontrol of that cosmic Entity Who is seeking expression through that threefoldmanifestation we call a solar system, or the body logoic.On this third plane that intelligent principle demonstrates as coherentactivity, either systemic, planetary, or monadic, and also as the triplevibration of spirit-matter-intelligence, sounding as the threefold Sacred Word,or electricity manifesting as sound.We have here an interesting sequence or inversion, according to the angle ofvision, involving the planes as we know them:Electricity as vibratory impulse . This causes the aggregation of matter, andits activity within certain bounds, or its awakening to activity within thesolar [319] ring-pass-not. This is the first syllable of the Sacred Word.Electricity as Light , causing spheroidal objectivity. This is the birth of theSon. It covers the enunciation of the second syllable of the Sacred Word. (123[text00028.html#Y_FN123] )Electricity as Sound. Here we have the completed threefold Sacred Word.On the fourth plane this electrical force shows itself as colour . In these fourwe have the fundamental concepts of all manifestation; all four have anelectrical dynamic origin; all are basically a differentiation or effect ofimpulse, emanating from the cosmic mental plane and taking form (withintelligent purpose in view) on the cosmic physical. Man repeats the process onhis tiny scale, dealing only with three planes, and flashing into objectivity onthe solar physical. It will be demonstrated later as science attains more andmore of the truth that1. All physical phenomena as we understand the term have an electrical origin,and an initial vibration on the first sub-plane of the physical plane. [320]2. That Light, physical plane light, has a close connection with, and uses, as amedium, the second ether.3. That sound functions through the third ether.4. That colour in a peculiar sense is allied to the fourth ether.We must note here that in the development of the senses, hearing preceded sight,as sound precedes colour.An interesting analogy may here be noted between the fourth cosmic ether, andthe fourth ether on the physical plane of the solar system. Both are in processof becoming exoteric—one from the standpoint of man in the three worlds, and theother from the standpoint of a Heavenly Man. The fourth ether is even now beinginvestigated by scientists, and much that they predicate concerning ether, theatom, radium, and the ultimate “protyle” has to do with this fourth ether. Itwill eventually be brought under scientific formula, and some of its properties,knowledge concerning its range of influence, and its utilisation will becomeknown unto men. Paralleling this, the buddhic plane, the plane of the Christprinciple, is gradually becoming known to those advanced beings who areindividually able to cognise their place in the body of a Logos of a planetaryscheme. The influence of the buddhic plane, and the electrical force that is itspeculiar characteristic, are beginning to be felt, and its energy is alsobeginning to have a definite effect on the egoic bodies of men; the fourth etherof the physical systemic plane is likewise assuming its rightful place in theminds of men, and the electrical force of that subplane is already being adaptedand utilised by man in the assistance of the mechanical arts, for methods oftransportation, for widespread illumination, and in healing. These fouradaptations of electricity: [321]1. For mechanical uses,2. For transportation,3. For illumination,4. In healing,are but the working out on the physical plane of paralleling utilisation ofbuddhic electrical force.It might here be asked why colour primarily is spoken of as the buddhicmanifestation of electricity. We are employing the word “colour” here in itsoriginal and basic sense as “that which veils.” Colour veils the sevenfolddifferentiation of logoic manifestation and, from the angle of vision of man inthe three worlds, can be seen only in its full significance on the buddhicplane. All fire and electrical display will be seen to embody the seven colours.Again another correspondence between the fourth cosmic ether and the fourthphysical ether lies in the fact that they are both primarily concerned with thework of the great builders, bearing in mind that they build the real body of theLogos in etheric matter; the dense physical vehicle is not so much the result oftheir work as it is the result of the meeting of the seven streams of force orelectricity, which causes that apparent congestion in matter that we call thedense physical planes (the three lower subplanes). This apparent congestion is,after all, but the exceeding electronic activity or energy of the mass ofnegative atoms awaiting the stimulation that will result from the presence of acertain number of positive atoms. This needs to be borne in mind. The work ofevolution is based on two methods and demonstrates as:Involution, wherein the negative electrons of matter preponderate. Thepercentage of these feminine electrons is one of the secrets of initiation andis so vast during the involutionary stage that the rarity of the positive [322]atoms is very noticeable; they are so rare as only to serve to keep the masscoherent.Evolution, wherein, due to the action of manas, these negative atoms becomestimulated and either dissipate back into the central electrical reservoir, ormerge in their opposite pole, and are consequently again lost. This results in:Synthesis.Homogeneity.The rarity instead of the density of matter. The fourth cosmic ether, thebuddhic, is the plane of air, and is also the plane of absorption for the threeworlds. This rarefication of dense matter (as we know it) simply means that atthe close of the evolutionary process it will have been transmuted and bepractically, from our point of view, non-existent; all that will be left will bethe positive atoms, or certain vortices of force which—having absorbed thenegative will demonstrate as electrical phenomena of a form inconceivable to manat his present stage of knowledge. These vortices will be distinguished by:1. Intense vibratory activity.2. The predominance of one certain colour according to the quality of theetheric display, and its source.3. Repulsion to all bodies of similar vibratory rate and polarity. Theirattractive quality at the end of evolution will cease owing to the fact thatnaught remains to be attracted.The vortices in each planetary scheme will be, during evolution, seven. Later,during the period of obscuration, three of the vortices will approximate theirmasculine pole and eventually but one will be left. In man a similar procedurecan be seen in connection with his [323] seven centres during the process ofinitiation. First there are seven, then three absorb the lower four throughelectrical interaction. We are here viewing the subject wholly from the point ofview of our present discussion. Finally, only the head centre is left, for it isthe positive pole to all the others.This question of the electrical polarity of the centres is one of realdifficulty, and little can be communicated on the matter. It may be safelypointed out, however, that the generative organs are the negative pole to thethroat centre as is the solar plexus to the heart. The order of the developmentof the centres, the ray-type and colour, coupled to the fact that during certainstages of the evolutionary process different centres (such as the base of thespine) are positive to all the others, not even excluding the head centre, leadsto the vast complexity of the subject. Likewise certain of the planetary schemesare positive and others negative; three of the schemes are dual, both negativeand positive. The same can be predicated anent a solar system, and, curiouslyenough, anent the planes themselves. For instance, in connection with the earthscheme we have a positive polarity of a temporary nature based on the type ofincarnation our particular Heavenly Man is undergoing on our planet. By this ismeant that there are masculine and feminine incarnations undergone by HeavenlyMen as by men, considering the entire subject from the angle of electricalpolarity and not from sex as understood in connection with the physical body.Venus is negatively polarised, and hence it became possible for a mysteriousabsorption by the Earth of Venusian force. Again in this connection the questionof sex may serve to elucidate. The karmic tie between the two Heavenly Men—onein a positive incarnation and the other in a negative—caused the working out ofan old debt and a planetary alliance. Light flashed forth [324] in Lemurian daysin a number of great groups of the human family when these two opposite polesmade electrical connection. It needed the joint work of the two Heavenly Men,working on buddhic levels (the fourth cosmic ether) to bring about the blazingforth of the light of manas in the causal groups on the fifth cosmic gaseousplane, the mental plane of the solar system. It will be remembered that it wasearlier pointed out that the majority of men function consciously on the fifthsubplane of the three planes in the three worlds. In them the fifth principle isbeginning to function, but not in sufficient force as yet to do more than keepthem in line with the electrical force flowing from the fourth cosmic ether downto the next subplane of the cosmic physical.It must ever be borne in mind that each plane and each subplane which isnumerically allied, is embodying the same type of force, and is consequently ofthe same polarity.Again, the astral plane and the buddhic plane are related, as we already know;the astral is negative in relation to the buddhic plane. When the polarity ofthe different planes is known, when the polarity of the subplanes iscomprehended, and when the interaction between them and the corresponding cosmicplanes is grasped, then will man be free, but not before. When the polarity ofthe ethers to each other and their relationship to the whole is comprehended,human evolution will have run its course. A Master has solved the problem ofelectrical phenomena in the three worlds, hence His freedom. Further, when therelationship of the negative form to the positive Spirit is grasped, and theirjoint connection with the cosmic Entities Who indwell the whole system issomewhat apprehended, group liberation will be achieved.Perhaps in considering this abstruse matter it may [325] help to clarify thepoint of view if it is recollected that man is essentially positive in his ownnature but his vehicles are negative; hence he is the central unit of positiveelectricity that draws and holds to him atoms of an opposite polarity. When hehas merged and blended the two poles, and produced light of a definite magnitudeduring any particular incarnation (which magnitude is settled by the Ego priorto incarnation) then obscuration takes place. The electrical manifestation burnsup and destroys the medium, and the light goes out; what we call physical deathensues, for the electrical current burns up that which had caused objectivity,and that which shone. Let us carry this idea further and realise that theseunits called men (who are positive as regards their own vehicles) are but thenegative cells in the body of a Heavenly Man, and are held within His sphere ofinfluence by the force of His electrical life. Bear in mind again that theHeavenly Men are thus positive as regards the lesser lives, but in Their turnare negative as regards the greater Life that contains Them.Here again is demonstrated the truth of the teaching given by H. P. B.Electric Fire Positive Spirit. Fire by Friction Negative Matter. Solar FireLight The two blended and thus producing the objective blaze.We have thus considered the question of the electrical origin of allmanifestation in connection with the four higher subplanes of the solarsystem—those four planes which are the four cosmic ethers, and therefore formthe body of objectivity of a Heavenly Man in exactly the same sense as the fourphysical ethers of the solar system form the etheric body of a man. I have hererepeated the fact, as its importance has not yet been grasped by the averageoccult student; this fact—when [326] conceded and realised—serves in a wonderfulway to clarify the whole subject of planetary evolution. We have now reached thethree planes wherein man functions, or the gaseous, liquid, and dense subplanesof the cosmic physical.The whole subject of the akasha will be greatly clarified as exoteric sciencedelves into the question of the ethers. As knowledge of the four types of ethersis available, as the vibratory action of these ethers is realised, and as thedetails concerning their composition, utilisation, light-bearing capacity, andthe various angles from which they may be studied become known then parallelingknowledge anent the corresponding four cosmic ethers will be forthcoming. Muchconcerning them may be deduced from the already apprehended facts which relateto the four solar physical ethers.For instance, the fourth ether (which is even now being what we might call“discovered”), is at this stage characterised by certain things. I mightenumerate a few of these facts with exceeding brevity, as follows:a. It is the ether which the violet ray uses as a medium.b. The fourth ether is that whereof the majority of the etheric bodies of menare made.c . The fourth ether is largely the principal sphere of influence of the “devasof the shadows,” or those violet devas which are closely concerned with thephysical evolution of man.d. It is the etheric sphere within which, at a little later date, the human andthe deva evolutions will touch.e . From this fourth etheric sphere the dense physical bodies are created.f. It is the sphere of physical individualisation. Only when the animal to beindividualised was fully conscious on that subplane of the physical plane was itpossible to co-ordinate the corresponding spheres on the astral and mentalplanes and by means of this triple co-ordination to effect the necessary stepswhich enabled the quaternary to succeed in its effort to approximate the Triad.[327]g. This fourth ether in this fourth round and on this fourth chain has to becompletely mastered and controlled by the Human Hierarchy, the fourth creative.Every unit of the human family has to attain this mastery before the end of thisround.h. It is the sphere wherein the initiations of the threshold are undergone, andthe fivefold initiations of the physical plane are entered upon.Much more might be further added to this list, but I have sought only to pointout those which can be easily realised as having a correspondence on the buddhicplane, the fourth cosmic ether. It should be borne in mind that our physicalplane in its subplanes has its analogy likewise to the entire cosmic physicalplane.COSMIC PHYSICAL PLANE1. Adi First cosmic ether. 1. Atomic subplane First ether. 2. Monadic Secondcosmic ether. 2. Sub-atomic Second ether. 3. Atmic Third cosmic ether. 3.Super-etheric Third ether. 4. Buddhic Fourth cosmic ether. 4. Etheric Fourthether. 5. Mental Cosmic liquid. 5. Gaseous. 6. Astral Cosmic liquid. 6. Liquid.7. Physical Cosmic dense. 7. Dense physical.The solar physical plane might also be expressed accurately as follows, workingout the anaIogy to the major planes:SOLAR PHYSICAL PLANEFirst subplane atomic first ether physical adi. Second subplane sub-atomicsecond ether physical anupadaka. Third subplane super-etheric third etherphysical atmic. Fourth subplane etheric fourth ether physical buddhic. Fifthsubplane gaseous physical mental. Sixth subplane liquid physical astral. Seventhsubplane dense physical dense.[328] In both the cosmic and solar physical planes, the plane of buddhi is everthe plane of at-one-ment, or the meeting ground of diversities, and of theirblending—not into a fundamental unity—but into group unity. This is owing to thefact that the buddhic plane is pre-eminently the plane most concerned with theevolution of the Heavenly Men. What I have therefore predicated anent the fourthphysical ether can likewise be extended to the fourth cosmic ether, and find itsanalogy on the buddhic plane. The place, for instance, of violet in the spectrumis of prime importance in connection with the greater cycles, and marks the endof a cycle and the beginning of a new one. The buddhic plane is peculiarly theplane of violet, even though all the colours find their place there; the Lord ofthe Ray of Ceremonial Magic, Who embodies the violet ray or hierarchy, has aspecial relationship to the buddhic plane. It must be borne in mind that eachplanetary Logos works primarily on one of the seven planes; from this we caninfer that His influence finds its line of least resistance on some one plane,even though it be exerted on all planes.Again, extend the second statement anent the etheric composition of the bodiesof men to Those of the Heavenly Men, and it will be found that just as themajority of human etheric bodies are built of matter of the fourth ether, so itmay also be said that four of the Heavenly Men have Their etheric vehiclescomposed of this fourth cosmic ether (buddhic matter).Further, the two great evolutions (human and deva) find their group unity on thebuddhic plane, and portions of both hierarchies blend and merge so as to formthe body of the divine Hermaphrodite. ( 124, 125 [text00028.html#Y_FN124] )Earlier, at certain fixed points, they may temporarily approximate each [329]other. On the buddhic plane definite and permanent alliance may be seen. On thisplane also the “devas of the shadows” who are concerned in the building of theplanetary scheme, pursue their work, and thus parallel the work done in thethree worlds by the lesser builders who work with the etheric body of man. Socan the analogies be worked out, for ever this Law of Resemblance holds good;yet ever must it be remembered that the analogy is of a psychic nature, anddemonstrates in work, activity, and quality, and not in literal identity ofform.As time elapses the work of the Heavenly Men in the cosmic etheric spheres willbe better comprehended, and assisted intelligently by those lesser intelligenceswho—by the study of the physical ethers—will eventually hold the key of thegreater manifestation. Science is the handmaiden of wisdom, and opens the doorto those infinite reaches and to those cosmic expanses, where stand Those vasterIntelligences, Who manipulate the matter of the higher planes, and bend it tothe desired form, causing the vibrations thus set up to be felt at the furthestbounds of the solar ring-pass-not. Automatically then all lesser lives and allthe denser materials are swept and carried into the needed channels and forms.Vibration , or initial activity, light , or activity taking form and animatingform, sound the basis of differentiation and the source of the evolutionaryprocess, and colour the sevenfold differentiation—thus is the work carried on.We have been dealing with these four in connection with a solar Logos, andequally with the work of a Heavenly Man and of Man, of the human monad.Students should also bear in mind another point that is often forgotten, whichis that every plane can be studied and divided in two ways:First. The seven subplanes can be divided into the [330] higher three planes orthe abstract planes, and the lower four or the concrete planes. This division isthe best and most purely metaphysical, for it embodies the entire idea of theSelf, the Not-Self, and the Intelligence, with their synthesis, which producesthe objective universe, whether solar system, planetary scheme, or humanincarnation. In connection with the Logos it is fully discussed andilluminatingly considered in the first volume of the Secret Doctrine , where thework of the Father and the Mother in producing the Son through consciousintelligent co-operation is handled by H. P. B. in a masterly manner.In connection with man the point can be grasped more easily if the causal bodyon the abstract levels of the mental plane is considered in connection with thelower four or concrete levels from whence manifestation emanates.Second. Dividing the seven subplanes into the same higher three but making thefourth plane the plane of meeting or of at-one-ment, and regarding the lowerthree as the planes of endeavour. This division primarily concerns man.Both these divisions will be seen later as existing on every plane in the systemand as having their origin in electrical force which shows itself differently oneach plane but acts on all under three laws: Attraction or Repulsion, Economy,and Synthesis. The lower three planes or subplanes act under the Law of Economyprimarily; the plane of meeting or of union acts under a phase of the Law ofAttraction. Paralleling them, of course, during evolution are their opposites,showing as Dispersion, Repulsion, and Differentiation.The question of the electrical manifestation of the akasha on the seven planeshas therefore to be studied in its three main divisions, then plane by plane orthe sevenfold consideration, and finally as the forty-nine [331] fires.Throughout it must be recollected that the subject is still further complicatedby the factor of time which brings these forty-nine fires at different stagesunder different spheres of influence and under the three laws of the cosmos.Thus the same fire at different periods will show itself forth as constructivelight, or again bring about combustion and eventual obscuration as the result ofburning out.In connection with the manifestation of electricity on the mental, astral andphysical planes . We will not enlarge upon the subject, as it will later bediscussed as fully as may be possible. Suffice it to say that the law holds goodand that what is laid down as fact anent a Heavenly Man on His Own planes isequally true of man on the four lower planes. Thus:A SOLAR LOGOS1. Electrical vibration the plane logoic or adi. 2. Electrical light the planemonadic or anupadaka. 3. Electrical sound the plane of atma. 4. Electricalcolour the plane of buddhi.A HEAVENLY MAN1. Electrical vibration the plane monadic. 2. Electrical light the plane ofatma. 3. Electrical sound the plane of buddhi. 4. Electrical colour the mentalplaneMAN1. Electrical vibration buddhic plane. 2. Electrical light the mental plane. 3.Electrical sound the astral plane. 4. Electrical colour the physical planeWe need to remember here that we were earlier dealing with the Logos, and withthe Heavenly Men as incorporate parts of His body of manifestation. In thetabulation above given we are dealing with each separately, [332] and it shouldbe observed that the manifestation of the groups of causal bodies on the mentalplane is the colour manifestation of a Heavenly Man and His lowest point ofobjectivity. In man his lowest point of objectivity is the fifth subplane of thephysical plane, as the liquid and the dense subplanes are not counted asprinciples any more than the cosmic liquid and dense (the astral and thesystemic physical planes) count with a Heavenly Man.We have seen that manas or mind is the fifth principle, or the basic vibrationof the cosmic mental plane, the fifth plane; it was therefore impulseoriginating from the causal levels of the cosmic mental plane, which drove oursolar Logos into manifestation, in the same way that the force which brings maninto incarnation emanates from his causal body on the mental plane of the solarsystem. We have seen also that manas is that discriminative faculty whichanimates all substance, and which is also the electrical fire of the systemshowing forth as attraction and repulsion, with all that is involved in thosetwo words. In the widest sense of the idea the Laws of Economy and of Synthesisare only divisions of that same cosmic law of which Attraction and Repulsion arealso manifestations. This cosmic law, demonstrating thus in a threefold manner,might (for lack of a better term) be called the Law of Being, and is of a natureso incomprehensible to the finite mind of man that he can only sense itpartially through the aforesaid three branches.3. MANAS IS THAT WHICH PRODUCES COHESIONWe come now to our third definition: The manasic principle is above all elsethat cohesive something which enables an Entity (whether Logos, Heavenly Man, orman) to work:a . Through form, and thus exist. [333]b. By means of progressive development or cyclic evolution.c. On certain planes, that are, for the entity concerned, the battleground oflife, and the field of experience.d. By the method of manifestation, which is a gradual growth from a dim anddistant dawn through an ever increasing splendour of light to a blaze ofeffulgent glory; then through a steadily dimming twilight to final obscuration.Dawn, day, midday, twilight, night—thus is the order for the Logos, for aplanetary Logos, and for man.If the above four points are carefully studied, it will be found that they arefairly comprehensive, and embody the four points that are as yet the only onesavailable for man in this fourth round.Man regards himself as a synthesised aggregate of physical body, emotionalnature, and mentality, yet knows himself as more than these three, andrecognises himself as the utiliser of form, of emotion, and of mentality,holding them all together coherently so that he is a unit. A planetary Logossimilarly does the same, with the difference that manas is not the mediumwhereby he is a coherent whole. Owing to his more advanced stage of development,wisdom is for Him the dominant factor. A solar logos achieves through Will whata planetary Logos does through wisdom or buddhi, and man (on his tiny scale)through manas. Yet, as both planetary Logos and man are but parts of theirgreater whole, the electric fire of will permeates them also, merging with thesolar fire of buddhi, and fanning the fires of matter. In all these distinctionsand differentiations it must be remembered that they do not exist from thelogoic standpoint, but are only to be predicated in relation [334] to the lesserbodies which are included in the solar ring-pass-not.A man is a coherent unit in objective manifestation for very brief periods onthe physical plane simply because as yet he works only through manas and notthrough wisdom. His cycles are consequently soon run, and gone like a flash inthe night. A planetary Logos, Who is perfected manas and works through wisdom,has longer cycles, and from the angle of vision of man endures for aeons; Hislife is the basis of the comparative permanence of the egoic cycles of man. Thecycle of objectivity of a solar Logos persists for the greater mahamanvantara orsolar cycle because it is based on will as well as on wisdom and manas.Therefore, it will be apparent that:a. Manas or intelligence is the basis of the separative manifestation of man.b. Wisdom or buddhi is the basis of the group manifestation of a Heavenly Man.c. Will is the basis of the One Life which synthesises all groups.Therefore again, in studying this Fire of Mind, we must remember that it is thatwhich man is developing and with which he is learning to work, but that it isalso that which a Heavenly Man has developed in an earlier system; it is to Himas automatic in its action as is the subconscious activity of a man’s physicalorgans.4. MANAS IS THE KEY TO THE FIFTH KINGDOM IN NATUREWe might also define manas as the key to the door through which entrance is madeinto the fifth kingdom of nature, the spiritual kingdom. Each of the fivekingdoms is entered by some one key, and in connection the first twokingdoms—the mineral and vegetable—the key or method whereby the life escapesinto the higher kingdom is so inexplicable to man as his present stage [335] ofintelligent apprehension that we will not pause to consider it. In relation tothe animal kingdom it might be said that the key whereby entrance is effectedinto the human kingdom is that of instinct. This instinct, towards the finalstages of the animal’s evolution, and as it becomes more and more detached fromthe group soul, ( 126 [text00028.html#Y_FN126] ) becomes transmuted intomentality, or into that embryo mind which is latent in animal-man, and whichsimply needed the stimulating vibration which emanated from the Earth’s Primaryto be fanned into something definitely human. We must always bear in mind thatthe method of individualisation on this globe was not the one followed onothers, and that many of the present advanced units of humanity individualisednormally, and through the driving force of evolution itself. They found (toexpress it as far as possible in terms of fire), their opposite electrical polethrough the activity of animal instinct, and by the blending of the two a humanbeing was produced,—the union of the three fires in the causal vehicle.Man passes into the fifth kingdom through the transmutation of thediscriminative faculty of mind, which—as in the animal’sindividualisation—brings about at a certain stage a spiritual individualisationwhich is the correspondence on higher levels to what transpired in Lemuriandays. Therefore, we have:Instinct The key from the animal into the human kingdom or from the third intothe fourth kingdom. Manas The key from the human into the spiritual kingdom, orfrom the fourth kingdom into the fifth kingdom.[336] Higher we need not go, for the transmutation of manas proceeds, and muchas yet remains to be done.5. MANAS IS THE SYNTHESIS OF FIVE RAYSOne other definition might be given even though its abstruseness may prove but abewilderment to the student.Manas is the united faculty of four of the Heavenly Men, synthesised through afifth Heavenly Man on the third plane of the system. These five Heavenly Menwere the logoic embodiment in an earlier system and achieved the fullness ofmanasic life. Their synthetic life is that which is primarily understood when wespeak of Brahma, that cosmic Entity Who is the sum-total of logoic activeintelligence. For lack of better terms we call Them the Lords of the four minorRays, Who find Their synthesis through the third Ray of Activity. They have beencalled in an endeavour to express the principles which They embody:1. The Lord of Ceremonial Magic.2. The Lord of Abstract Idealism, or Devotion.3. The Lord of Concrete Science.4. The Lord of Harmony and Art.These four function through the fourth cosmic ether, and have vehicles ofbuddhic matter. They merge into the greater life of the Lord of the third Ray ofAspect on atmic levels, and these four (with the one synthetic Ray), are thetotality of manasic energy. They are the life of the five lower planes. They arethe five Kumaras, and two remain, making the seven Kumaras or Builders of theuniverse; these five have been called the five Mind-born Sons of Brahma. (S. D.,I, 119, 493; II, 111, 112.) Manas, therefore, is the psychic effect of Theirunited group work, and shows forth in different ways according to the unitsinvolved, the forms [337] animated, and the planes concerned. They demonstratepredominantly on the five lower subplanes of each plane, and this factor shouldbe remembered in connection with the major initiations of manas. Nevertheless—asThey are the sumtotal of the third or Brahma aspect—Their main sphere ofinfluence is on the lowest or third division of the manifested universe or onthe mental, astral, and physical planes.I would here suggest a third division of the major planes of the system whichwill hold much of interest for the real student of occultism.First Logos Mahadeva. Will Aspect First plane. Second Logos Vishnu Wisdom AspectSecond, Third, Fourth. Third Logos Brahma Intelligence Fifth, Sixth, Seventh.In these five definitions of manas we have suggested scope for thought and muchhas been hinted at for those who have ears to hear. Many more explanatory wordsmight be spoken but we aim to start students thinking for themselves, and seekto see them defining these ideas in their own words.6. MANAS IS THE INTELLIGENT WILL OR PURPOSE OF AN EXISTENCEManas might finally be defined as the intelligent will and ordered purpose ofevery self-conscious entity. I would urge the student to bear in mind certainbasic facts which will serve to keep his mind clear, and which will enable himto comprehend something of the place which this fire of mind holds in the cosmosand the solar system, and (needless to say), in his life also,—the reflection ofthe other two.He should ever remember that manas is a principle of the Logos, and necessarilytherefore is felt in all those [338] evolutions which are a part of His naturebut is allied especially to the throat and head centres; it is the activeintelligent factor which enables a solar Logos, a planetary Logos or HeavenlyMan, and a human being to:a. Use intelligently a form or vehicle.b. Build faculty into the causal body.c . Reap the benefit of experience.d. Expand the consciousness.e. Make progress towards a specified goal.f . Discriminate between the two poles.g. Choose the direction in which his activity shall trend.h. Perfect the form as well as use it.i. Obtain control of active substance, and turn its forces into desiredchannels.j . Co-ordinate the different grades of matter, and synthesise the utilisedforms till each and all show a unanimous line of action and expresssimultaneously the will of the Indweller.All these ends are the result of the manasic development and perhaps the studentmight apprehend the underlying idea more clearly if it is realised thata. The Spirit employs manas in all that concerns matter, the electricalsubstance, or the active akasha.b. The Spirit employs buddhi in all that relates to the psyche, that relates tothe soul of the world, to the soul of an individual, or to the soul of everyform.c. The Spirit employs will or atma in all that relates to the essence of all, toitself, considering the essence and the Self as pure Spirit as distinguishedfrom spirit-matter.In the first case, the distinctive quality of manas is discrimination whichenables the Spirit to differentiate between: [339]1. The Self and the Not-Self.2. Spirit and Matter.3. The planes and the subplanes.4. The different grades of atomic matter in the system.5. Vibrations, engendered by will, working through love-wisdom, and energisingsubstance.6. All that concerns forms of every kind and in every type of essentialexistence.In the second case, the buddhic principle has for its distinctive quality love,and demonstrates as wisdom working through love and producing:1. Unity between all Selves.2. Group coherence.3. Qualities that are distinctively along the line of what we call love.4. Effective work in connection with evolution, or the fundamentals ofhierarchical work.In the third case the Spirit employs the will aspect or atma (in man), whichhas, for its distinctive feature, that coherent force which keeps the purpose ofthe entity ever in view, working it out through love in substantial form.I have pointed out these distinctions as it serves to bring the scope, andequally the limitations, of the active mental principle somewhat more clearlybefore the student. In the Hall of Ignorance the accumulative side of manas andits ability to store and acquire knowledge and information is being developed. Aman, for instance, acquires facts, and application, and sets up vibrations whichhave to be worked out intelligently. The acquisitive side of this principle isshowing forth. In the Hall of Learning the discriminative side is beingdeveloped, and the man learns not only to choose but to discard, and he beginsto merge the two poles intelligently. In the [340] Hall of Wisdom he discardsalso, and perfectly blends the two poles, thereby producing that objectivesomething we call light. The illuminating side of manas is shown. He becomes anintelligent creator, and by the time he has taken the four major initiations hehas:1. Developed perfectly the Brahma aspect, which—as pointed out—functionsprimarily in the three worlds. It is the active intelligent aspect.2. Achieved the point of development at which a Heavenly Man, the DivineManasaputra, commenced this circle of manifestation we call a solar system.3. Transmuted manas into wisdom or love.4. Synthesised the Rays of Activity or Intelligence and is beginning to mergethis synthesis into the higher one of love-wisdom.To sum it all up in words of fire: The fire of matter has blazed out perfectly,and the vibratory activity of the man has been keyed up to synchronise with thatof a Heavenly Man, thus enabling a man to function consciously, or be vitallyactive on the buddhic plane.The fire of mind has blended with the fire of matter and has stimulated it tosuch an extent that it has brought about the liberation of the entity, man, fromthe three worlds, and has occultly “obscured” his manifestation on the threeplanes in exactly the same way as the manifestation of a Logos “goes out”(occultly) when the fires are sufficiently fierce. As regards the fire ofSpirit, or pure electric fire, this is finally synthesised with the other twoand brings about the escape of the life on to another plane cosmicallyconsidered. [341]A MANa . The blending of the fire of matter and of the fire of mind liberates fromthe three worlds.b. The blending of electric fire with the two other fires brings aboutliberation from the five lower planes, and enables a man to function consciouslyon the cosmic physical plane.A HEAVENLY MANa. The blending of the fire of matter and of mind liberates from the threeplanes of His manifestation.b. The blending of the electric fire in His case brings about escape from theplanetary ring-pass-not and enables Him to function consciously on the cosmicastral plane.A SOLAR LOGOSa. The blending of the fire of matter and of mind liberates Him from the solarring-pass-not, and gives Him the freedom of the cosmic physical, astral and thelower subplanes of the cosmic mental planes.b. The blending of electric fire with the other two enables Him to functionconsciously in His causal body thus paralleling the work of Man in the threeworlds."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION B - MANAS AS A COSMIC, SYSTEMIC AND HUMAN FACTORI.

THE ORIGIN OF MANAS, OR MINDWHAT we are dealing with here (taking these three factors in their order), isthe fire of mind in connection with a solar Logos. It has been earlier pointedout that mind has already been developed in a Heavenly Man, and therefore wemust equally predicate anent a solar Logos that cosmic mind, or the fifthPrinciple, is His prime characteristic, and was perfected by Him in an earliersystem. We might now consider our first subdivision:1. Cosmic Manas.Whence comes this fire? Where originates this vital heat, or vibratory activity,which is predominantly a feature of all conceivable Beings? How far back is itpossible for us to go? Can we conceive of its origin? What is this downpouringfire that animates the darkness of matter?a. The Process of Individualisation . Perhaps it may help somewhat if we hereconsider the question of INDIVIDUALISATION, or the process of intelligentself-realisation [344]CHART V - EVOLUTION OF A SOLAR LOGO[Image00009.jpg][345] which so strikingly differentiates men from the animals. Atindividualisation the two poles are approximated, and at their meeting lightstreams forth, irradiating the cave of matter, and lighting the pathway thatmust be trodden by the Pilgrim on his way back to his source.This irradiation brings about, in connection with man,Self-realisation.Purpose.Separation from all other individualised selves, or spheres.Consciousness, above all.Ability to evolve.Capacity to “shine ever more and more unto the perfect day.”This is equally true of a solar Logos, and of a Heavenly Man.Individualisation is literally the coming together (out of the darkness ofabstraction), of the two factors of Spirit and matter by means of a thirdfactor, the intelligent will, purpose and action of an Entity. By theapproximation of these two poles light is produced, a flame shines forth, asphere of radiant glory is seen which gradually increases the intensity of itslight, its heat and its radiance until capacity is reached, or that which wecall perfection. We should note and distinguish the words light, heat andradiance, which are the distinctive features of all individualised entities fromGods to men.Man is beginning to arrive partially at the secret of this phenomenon throughhis ability to produce through scientific knowledge, that which is calledelectric light and which is used by man for illumination, heat and healing. Asmore anent this matter is discovered by physical plane students, the wholequestion of existence and of creative activity will become clearer.As regards the origin of the fire of mind something [346] more may be learnedthrough studying the various methods of individualisation. In connection withman these methods are three in number as far as we can tell, though theprobability of there being several other methods which are inconceivable toman’s finite comprehension, is quite possible. These methods are:First, the method pursued on the moon-chain (the planetary manifestationprevious to ours), when, through innate force and energy, the conjunction of thethree fires was brought about and the fire of matter contacted the fire ofSpirit through the latent presence of the fiery spark of mind. This spark ofmind, working through the instinct, drove the material form or substance, intosuch activity that it was enabled to reach up to heights where its opposite polecould be contacted. Animal-man aspired; Spirit answered; the vibration of thegerm of mentality had permeated the substance like yeast. Thus was consciousnessawakened. In the previous solar system, in connection with the Heavenly Men,this was the method pursued by Them, and These advanced cosmic Beings enteredinto consciousness and mastered the three lower planes of the cosmicphysical,—the planes which man is endeavouring to master now. Theyindividualised as the result of work accomplished during incomprehensible aeonsof endeavour. ( 128 [text00028.html#Y_FN128] ) The earlier solar system was muchlonger in duration than this one will be, and force in matter was generated bythe progression of the ages. It was the period of the vitalisation of thespirillae in the physical permanent atom of the Logos.In this method of individualisation, the emphasis is laid on the fact that theprinciple of manas is a part of the logoic character, and is part of His verynature. It, therefore, has its origin in His Being or Self; it is [347] part ofthe content of the logoic Causal Body, and therefore permeates all manifestationwhich originates with Him. Hence the accuracy of the statement that cosmic manasoriginates on the cosmic mental plane, and is a portion of the fire thatanimates that plane.Second, in the second solar system, and in connection with the method employedtherein, another point merits attention. This fire of mind has its source in aconstellation until recently unrecognized by exoteric science as having anyrelation of an intimate nature to our solar system, owing to its tremendousdistance away. The sun “Sirius” is the source of logoic manas in the same senseas the Pleiades are connected with the evolution of manas in the seven HeavenlyMen, and Venus was responsible for the coming in of mind in the Earth chain.Each was primary to the other, or was the agent which produced the first flickerof consciousness in the particular groups involved. In every case the method wasthat of a slow evolutionary growth till the consciousness suddenly blazed forthowing to the interposition of force, apparently from an extraneous source,1. The Logos Solar System Sirius 2. Seven Heavenly Men Planetary scheme Pleiades3. Heavenly Man Earth chain VenusThis second method therefore is that which is brought about by the hastening ofthe evolutionary process through influences from outside; these tend to awakenconsciousness, and to bring about the merging of the poles. The first methodtouched upon was that of the earlier solar system. The method we are nowconsidering is the distinctive one of this solar system and will persist tillthe end of the mahamanvantara.That the earlier method was seen in the moon-chain is only evidence of thesteadfastness of the Law of Repetition by which every large cycle includes, inits earlier [348] stages, all the lesser, and repeats the earlier procedure.This is a recognised fact, for instance, in the building of man’s physical body,for the foetus reproduces all earlier stages and forms till the human isachieved; again, as we know, the fourth round reproduces briefly the earlierthree but has its own distinctive quality.b. The Method of Initiation. In this second method the “Rods of Initiation” areused to effect certain results. These rods are of four kinds:1. Cosmic, used by a cosmic Logos in the initiations of a solar Logos, and ofthe three major planetary Logoi.2. Systemic, used by a solar Logos in the initiations of a planetary Logos.3. Planetary, used by a planetary Logos for initiatory purposes, and for thethird, the fourth, and fifth major initiations, with the two higher.4. Hierarchical, used by an occult Hierarchy for minor Initiations, and for thefirst two initiations of manas by the Bodhisattva. ( 129[text00028.html#Y_FN129] )When man individualised in Lemurian days (about eighteen million years ago), itwas the application of the Rod of Initiation to the Logos of our Earth chainwhich brought about the event and touched into activity certain centres in Hisbody with their corresponding groups. This application, bringing aboutconsciousness on some plane, may be regarded as literally the awakening of thelives concerned to participate in intelligent work on the mental plane. Animalman was conscious on the physical, and on the astral planes. By the stimulationeffected by the electric rod this animal man awoke to consciousness on themental. Thus the three bodies were co-ordinated, and the Thinker enabled tofunction in them.[349] All Rods of Initiation cause certain effects:a. Stimulation of the latent fires till they blaze.b. Synthesis of the fires through an occult activity that brings them within theradius of each other.c. Increase of the vibratory activity of some centre, whether in man, a HeavenlyMan, or a solar Logos.d. Expansion of all the bodies, but primarily of the causal,—this also inspeaking of all the three types of Entities.All these results were seen when the Heavenly Man of our scheme took initiationeighteen million years ago. This initiation was brought about—as earlier pointedout—by a peculiar juxtaposition of chains, globes and schemes, and caused such astimulation of all the latent manasic units within His body that a downflow ofpure manas from the planetary manasic permanent atom was possible along the pathof the planetary antaskarana—a channel which exists in the case of the planetaryLogos, and which has not to be built as in the case of man. Along with thisjuxtaposition came a similar alignment with one of the Pleiades, permitting ofmanasic influence from that source.(S.D.,II, 711,725,726) ( 130[text00028.html#Y_FN130] )Third, the third method of individualisation is the one to be followed in thenext solar system, though it will have its faint beginnings in this one. It isnot based on latent activity as in the first case, nor in electrical polarity asin the second, but in a peculiar process of “occult abstraction” (using the word“abstraction” in its basic sense as “the drawing out” of essence). This occultabstraction is brought about by an effort of the will at presentincomprehensible. The first method of individualisation [350] is that of thethird aspect, or latent activity, and follows the line of least resistance underthe Law of Economy; the second method is the purely electrical one, and worksunder the Law of Attraction; whilst the third method lies hidden in dynamic willand is as yet to us impossible and incomprehensible.2. Planetary Manas.We sought in the foregoing, to understand somewhat the origin of manas—whethercosmic, or otherwise—through the consideration of human individualisation andthe method thereof. We saw that individualisation is the conscious apprehensionof the Self of its relation to all that constitutes the Not-Self, and that it isevoked in three ways, of which only two as yet are even dimly comprehensible. Ineach case this awakening of consciousness is preceded by a period of gradualdevelopment, is instantaneous at the moment of Self-Realisation for the firsttime, and is succeeded by another period of gradual evolution. This period ofgradual evolution leads up to another crisis which we call initiation . In onewe have initiation into conscious existence, in the other initiation intospiritual existence or group identification.For a solar Logos individualisation dates back to stages far anterior to thetriplicity of solar systems which constitutes for Him the Eternal Now, but whichfrom man’s point of view embody the past, the present, and the future. Aplanetary Logos individualised in a previous system; a man individualises inthis; the planetary entities, now involutionary, will individualise in the next.a. Consciousness and Existence. From the wider point of view the termsinitiation and individualisation are synonymous; they both express the idea ofan expansion of consciousness, or of entrance into a new kingdom of nature. Thefaculty of acquiring knowledge [351] must be realised as paralleling thedevelopment of the sense of sight, or vision, as earlier pointed out. The fireof mind shone forth and illuminated animal man in Lemurian days, during thatvast cycle wherein sight opened up for him the physical plane. The relationshipbetween sight and mind is a very close one, and must not be lost from sight. Inthe first round, and in the first root-race of this round, hearing was the sensedeveloped. In the second round and the second root-race touch was evolved. Inthe third round and corresponding root-race sight was added to the other two,and the Self which hears, and the Not-self which is touched, or apprehended astangible, are related and connected by sight,—the correspondence to theintelligence that links. Thus is brought about the blending of the three fires,and illumination is present. But through all this evolutionary development theONE Who hears, touches, and sees, persists and interprets according to the stageof the development of the manasic principle within Him. This basic Interpreteris the Entity Who is independent of an existence which ever necessitates a form.His is the life that causes matter to vibrate and He is therefore “fire byfriction”; His is the life of pure Spirit which wills to be, and which utilisesform, and is therefore electrical impulse on the cosmic physical plane or“electric fire”; His is the life that not only animates the atoms andelectrifies them by His Own nature, but likewise knows itself to be one with allyet apart from all,—the thinking, discriminating, Self-realising something thatwe call MIND or Solar Fire. Universal mind or manas permeates all, and isequally that Self-knowing, individualised Entity Whose body contains our solarLogos as well as certain other solar Logoi; Whose fire, heat and radiationembrace certain other solar systems and unify them with our own system so thatone complete vital body forms the manifestation of this mighty cosmic Being.[352] Vortices of force on the cosmic etheric plane form the etheric frameworkof seven solar systems in the same way that the bodies of the seven Heavenly Menare the etheric centres for a solar Logos, and as the seven centres in man(existing in etheric matter), are the animating electrical impulse of his life.To express the origin of manas apart from manifestation through a congery ofsystems, a solar system, or a man is for us impossible. Only as one grasps thefact that each planetary scheme, for instance, serves as the body of a HeavenlyMan Who is the directing Mind in that scheme, and the animating principle ofmanas or the active discriminating faculty which every atom in that schemeevinces; only when it is realised that a solar Logos is similarly the manasicprinciple of those large atoms we call schemes in their totality; only when itis apprehended that a cosmic Logos is again the instigating mind of the stillvaster atoms we call systems; only when it is admitted that man is the animatingdiscriminative faculty of the tiny spheres which form his body of manifestation;and finally, only when all this is meditated upon, and its truth accepted, willthis question of the origin of manas assume a less abstruse character, and thedifficulty of its comprehension be less appalling.Man, the Thinker, the Knower, the manasic principle in the centre of the manyspheres which form his bodies, manipulates electrical force in three departments(the physical, astral and mental bodies) through seven centres which are thefocal points of force, and of its intelligent dispersal throughout his littlesystem to the myriads of lesser atoms, which are the cells in these spheres.A Heavenly Man equally, and in a wider sense, the Thinker and Knower, themanasic or mind principle plus the buddhic or Christ principle, manipulateselectrical force through three principal vehicles or globes in atmic, buddhic,and manasic matter, dispersing it from thence [353] to the myriads of cellswhich correspond to the deva and human units.A solar Logos in a still wider sense is the permeating universal Mind, themanasic principle, plus the buddhic and the will principle, working in threemajor schemes, by means of seven centres of force, and through the myriads ofgroups which are the cells in His body, in the same way as human beings are thecells in the body of a Heavenly Man.The cosmic Logos of our system works similarly through three major systems (ofwhich ours is not one), utilising seven solar systems (of which ours is one),for the distribution of His force and having myriads of sevenfold groups as thecells of His body.b. Will and ordered purpose . Thus all that we can really predicate anent theorigin of manas is that it is the unified will-activity, or the purposefulexpression of the realised Identity of some great Self which colours the lifeand swings into intelligent co-operation all the lesser units included in itssphere of influence. Each of us, in illustration, is the thinking purposefulEntity who acts as the manasic principle, and the spring of action, to all theunits included in our three bodies. Each of us sways them to our will; we act,and by acting, force co-operation as we see fit. The Logos does the same on alarger scale. In this thought lies light on the question of karma, of free-willand of responsibility. Manas is, really WILL working itself out on the physicalplane, and the truth of this will be seen when it is realised that all ourplanes form the cosmic physical plane, whereon an Entity, inconceivably greaterthan our Logos, is working out a set purpose through the Logos, through us,through all Spirit-substance that is included within His sphere of radiatoryactivity.Certain problems of real interest are prone to enter our minds, but they serveonly to develop abstract thought [354] and to expand the consciousness, for theyare as yet insoluble and will remain so. Some of them might be enumerated asfollows:1. Who is the cosmic Entity in Whose scheme our Logos plays his little part?2. What is the nature of the great purpose He is working out?3. Which centre in His body is represented by our solar system?4. What is the nature of the incarnation He is now undergoing?5. What are the ten systems—the three and the seven—of which our solar system isone? Must we look for the major three within the seven, or extraneously?6. What is the coloring or basic quality of this cosmic Entity?7. Is the colouring of the fourth cosmic ether (the buddhic plane), blue, or isit violet to correspond with our fourth physical ether? Why is buddhiexoterically regarded as yellow in color?8. Which are the primary three centres in the body of our solar Logos and whichthe minor four?9. What is the karma of the different schemes?10. What is the over-balancing karma of the Logos Himself as it affects the tenschemes within His system?All these questions, and numbers of others, will arise in the mind of theinterested student, but beyond the formulation of them he may not as yet go,though the fifth round will see the realisation, by men, of the nature of thekarma of the Logos of our chain. Words, as oft we have been told, blind andstultify.In summing up, this quality of manas may be somewhat apprehended if the studentregards it as the intelligent [355] will. the active purpose, and the fixed ideaof some Entity which brings about existence, utilises form, and works outeffects from causes through discrimination in matter, separation into form, andthe driving of all units within His sphere of influence to the fulfilment ofthat set purpose. Man is the originating source of mind as regards the matter ofhis vehicles, and their latent manasic impulse. So again with a Heavenly Man andHis larger sphere of influence, and so with the solar Logos. Each discriminated,and thus formed His ring-pass-not; each has a purpose in view for everyincarnation; each is actively following and intelligently working to effectcertain ends, and thus each is the originator of manas to His scheme; each isthe animating fire of intelligence to his system; each, through this verymanasic principle individualises, expands gradually this self-realisation tillit includes the ring-pass-not of the Entity through Whom the fifth principlecomes to him; and each attains initiation, and eventually escapes from form.3. Human Manas .We are now to consider primarily man and the manasic principle, its developmentin the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human Monads, with special reference toour Earth chain.We have seen that, to all intents and purposes, manas is the active will of anEntity working itself out through all the lesser lives who go to the content ofthe ring-pass-not or sphere of influence of the indwelling Existence.Therefore—as concerning man on this chain—he is but expressing the purpose andthe will in action of the planetary Logos in Whose body he is a cell or lesserlife.Certain mysteries arise consequently for our consideration which are connectedwith the life cycles of the Heavenly Man of our scheme, and particularly inrelation to that special incarnation of His which we call the cycle [356] ofmanifestation on the dense physical globe, the earth. He wears the planetarybody as man wears the robe of the physical body, and by means of this objectiveform He works His purposes out on the physical plane, through the factor of mindachieving certain goals. Incidentally, the cells in His body conform to thatMind which plays upon them, just as man, the intelligent principle ofincarnation on the physical plane, brings into conformity with his purpose theatoms of his body, and stimulates ever more and more the spirillae of thoseatoms by the force of his mind playing upon them.Here comes the opportunity to make clear something that is oft lost sight of inthe general fog surrounding this subject. The human and deva units on the upwardarc, who are the cells in His body, go to the formation of the centres, and notto the remainder of the cellular vital substance of His vehicles . Man has abody made up of matter which is applied to different uses, yet which forms aunit. In this unit there are certain areas of more vital importance than otherareas from the standpoint of energising force. Such an area as the heart may, inthis connection, be considered and compared (as regards force value) with suchan area as the calf of the leg. The entity, man, utilises both, but the heartcentre is of paramount importance. Thus is it also with a Heavenly Man. The twogreat Hierarchies—deva and human—are force centres in the body of a planetaryLogos; the other evolutions of an involutionary nature extant within the scheme,and the remainder of the active substance of the globes, and all containedtherein, go to the content of the remainder of His body.a. Man and the planetary Logos. With the deva evolution at this point we havenought to do. I seek to concentrate attention on man, as he functions on earth.In order to clarify the idea of manas and its relation to a human being it isnecessary to point out certain things [357] in connection with a Heavenly Manwhich must be borne in mind.First, that each Heavenly Man holds the position of a centre in the body of asolar Logos; therefore, the Logos of a scheme will embody some outstandingcharacteristic. The ten schemes are the seven, and the synthesising three—notthe seven and a lower three. The lower centres were vital in the last solarsystem (from the esoteric standpoint), and are not counted in this; they weresynthesised and absorbed during the obscuration process of System I.Secondly, each Heavenly Man is consequently the embodiment of a particular kindof electrical force which flows through His scheme as man’s force flows throughsome one of the etheric centres in his body. Each scheme, as each human centre,willa. Vibrate to some one key.b . Have its own colouring.c. Resemble, when seen from the higher planes, a vast lotus.d . Possess, according to its vibratory capacity, a definite number of petals.e . Be connected in geometrical formation with certain other centres of HeavenlyMen, making systemic triangles. ( 132 [text00028.html#Y_FN132] )f. Be characterised by different stages of activity according to the initiationtowards which the Logos may be working. Thus, at one period one centre orHeavenly Man may be the subject of logoic attention, and of specialisedstimulation, and at another period a totally different scheme may be the objectof vitalisation. For some time the Logos has turned His attention to the EarthScheme and to Saturn , whilst Uranus is receiving [358] stimulation. Much istherefore accentuated, and increased evolutionary development is the consequenceof this divine attention.When these facts are borne in mind it will be seen that the interaction, and thecomplexity, is of vast proportions, and man can do no more than accept the fact,and leave the explanation until his consciousness is of greater scope.Third, one of the mysteries revealed at initiation is that of the logoic centrewhich our scheme represents, and the type of electrical fire which is flowingthrough it. The “Seven Brothers,” or the seven types of fohatic force, expressThemselves through the seven centres, and the One Who is animating our schemestands revealed at the third Initiation. It is by knowledge of the nature andquality of the electrical force of our centre, and by realisation of the placeour centre holds in the body logoic, that the Hierarchy achieves the aims ofevolution. It will be obvious that the Heavenly Man Who stands for the kundalinicentre, for instance, will work differently, and have a different purpose andmethod, from His Brother Who stands for the heart centre in the body logoic, orto the Heavenly Man Who embodies the logoic solar plexus. From this it isapparent that:a. The type of electrical forceb. The vibratory actionc. The purposed. The evolutionary developmente. The dual and triangular interactionof all the Heavenly Men will differ, and so will the evolutions that form thecells in Their Bodies differ likewise. Little has as yet been revealed anent thetypes of evolutions which are to be found in the other schemes of our system.Suffice it to say that in all the schemes, on some [359] globe in the scheme,human beings or self-conscious units, are to be found. Conditions of life,environment and form may differ, but the human Hierarchy works in all schemes.It must also be borne in mind that just as all seven Heavenly Men are found inthe body logoic, and are Themselves under the influence of seven solar Logoi(using the word “influence” in its astrological sense), so in a planetary schemewith its seven globes each is astrologically under the influence of all theseven Heavenly Men. A scheme is but a replica of a system. Each of the HeavenlyMen pours forth His radiation or influence, and stimulates in some way someother centre or globe. To word it otherwise, His magnetism is felt by HisBrothers in a greater or less degree according to the work being undertaken atany one time. At present the Heavenly Men, representing centres at differentstages of stimulation, being not all equally developed and being not as yetpsychically unified, this magnetic interplay is little realised, and the psychicflow from one scheme to another is little utilised or comprehended. As timeelapses this interplay of force will become more evident and the force will beconsciously employed. When men, for instance, knowThe quality of the force flowing through their particular scheme;The purpose and name of the centre they stand within;The centre or Heavenly Man with Whom the Logos of their scheme is allied;Which two schemes form, with their own, a triangle for logoic force at a certainstage of evolutionary development;The secret of the cycles, or the periods of stimulation or obscuration;then will the body logoic begin to achieve its purpose; [360] then will theLogos of our system begin to blend and merge and co-ordinate all His vehicles;then will the force flow through all the centres unimpeded; and then will theglory shine out, and each cell in every body—logoic, planetary, deva and human,blaze forth with perfected glory, vibrate with adjusted accuracy, and a majorcosmic initiation be taken.b. The Logos of our Scheme . The Heavenly Man or planetary Logos of the Earthscheme can be considered in various ways, and as is our custom we will simplytabulate the statements anent Him which, when considered at length by theindividual student, should serve to make the FACT of the essential Personalityof this great Entity, the work that He is endeavouring to accomplish, and therelationship of the human Hierarchy to Him, a greater reality. We must bear inmind in studying this matter that it will not be possible to reveal for generalpublication details as to His specific Identity, His number and His scope ofconscious development. Such mysteries, as earlier pointed out, are reserved forthose who are pledged to keep silent. But some general idea may be conveyedbefore we take up specifically this chain and round.It might be asked wherein all this information is of use, and what purpose itserves in this hour of the world’s need. Apart from the fact that the cyclicgiving out of the truth works under the law, and may not be gain-said, it issuggested for consideration that much advantage will be felt when men in largenumbers conceive of the purpose of specific manifestations, when they realisethat all forms are but the modes of expression of certain Entities or Beings,Who occupy them for cycles of definite duration in order to attain a purpose,and that each life—great or small—serves its own ends, yet subserves the greaterends of the Being in Whose body it is a corporate part. The details of the planmay not be given. [361] The general outline—solar, planetary, andhierarchical—may be suggested, and by the very suggestion, bring order into thethoughts of men as they view the apparent chaos of the moment. Let us notforget, that when order is brought about, and united thought produced on themental plane, then order transpires eventually on the physical plane.The planetary Logos of this scheme is one of the four minor Logoi, or Lords ofthe Rays, and is specially concerned therefore with the development of oneattribute of manas. Each of the four minor Rays is, as we know, eventuallysynthesised, or absorbed into that Ray which is represented on our earth by theMahachohan. He is the Lord of the third major Ray or Aspect, and synthesises thefour. These four Rays with their synthesising Ray make the five rays of Manas orMind. We can consider them as:a. The fivefold Brahma Aspect.b. They were the five Rays of prime importance in the first solar system, andwere the five individualised Heavenly Men, called the Mind-born Sons of Brahma.Through the individualisation of the four in that system the individualisationof the great cosmic Entity we call Brahma was brought about. He individualisedand the four go to the content of His body.c. They are represented on our earth by the five Kumaras Who obeyed the Law, andtook human form, as H. P. B. (S.D., I, 493) hints in several passages in theSecret Doctrine.This scheme is considered as the fourth and the one of the most importance inthe system during this particular cycle for the following reasons:Our solar system , being considered as of the fourth [362] order, and our schemebeing the fourth in order, there is consequently a moment of special opportunityafforded our planetary Logos through the alignment brought about. It eventuatesin the turning of the attention of the logoic kundalini fire towards thiscentre, our scheme, and the subsequent results are in process of working out.Within the scheme the chain that concerns us the most, and which is temporarilyof the most vital importance to the planetary Logos, is the Earth chain, thefourth in order again, thus bringing about another alignment of very gravemoment. This carries with it special opportunity, and permits of the entry offorce from the cosmos itself, or of extra-systemic electrical vitality. Thissuper-stimulation results in what looks to us like cataclysms, and a stupendousshattering of forms, but it is simply the necessary sequence to the vitalisationof the life within the form, and the breaking of the limiting form unable tobear the cosmic action.Again within the chain, the globe at present receiving planetary polarisation,or at present embodying in a special sense the life of the planetary Logos isthe Earth, the fourth in order. This brings about a still further alignment.Add to the above facts the accepted knowledge that this is the fourth round andwe have a fivefold alignment which is of paramount significance to us all,though it had even greater significance and force in the fourth root-race, andbrought about that stupendous psychic event—the opening of the door ofInitiation to the human Hierarchy.These very important facts merit close attention, and the consideration of alloccult students. They hold the key whereby some comprehension of manas and ofplanetary evolution may come about. What have we, therefore, in this specialcyclic alignment? [363]1. A solar system of the fourth order.2. The fourth scheme in the system.3. The fourth chain in the scheme.4. The fourth globe in the chain.5. The fourth round. ( 134) [text00028.html#Y_FN134]All these are found active within the same cycle, and all therefore bring abouta simultaneous alignment which results in the clearing of a channel direct fromthe heart of our scheme through every ring-pass-not to the cosmiccorrespondence, found outside the solar sphere.To the above realisation, we must add yet the further fact that the fourthCreative Hierarchy is the one whose evolution we are considering, and it will beapparent to the most superficial student that in these thoughts lies hidden theclue, not only to man but to the entire cyclic evolution in which he is takingpart.The fourth Creative Hierarchy is essentially the Hierarchy of manas. This is noplay on words, but a statement of deep occult significance. The statement hasbeen made with entire accuracy that five Hierarchies out of the twelve havepassed out and that seven remain. Of these seven, our human Hierarchy is thefourth, making it literally the ninth when counting the entire twelve. In thisconnection it would be well to link up the statements that have been made to theeffect that the five Kumaras or Heavenly Men Who definitely embody the manasicprinciple (or the five Rays over which the systemic correspondence to theMahachohan presides) developed [364] manas in an earlier system; They passed outof the wave of manasic influence as far as their own Nature is concerned.We must remember also that nine is the number of Initiation, or of the majorInitiations of Manas, wherein man becomes a perfect Nine, or literally is thenumber of his Hierarchy. This is from the standpoint of the three systems,though his present systemic number may be four.In occupying ourselves with these various statements anent our scheme and itsRuler we have seen that this particular cycle, or incarnation of His, is one ofgreat importance, not only to Himself but to the entire system. The planetaryLogos of this scheme is primarily occupied with a particular group of units, orwith those Monads who vibrate to His key, are colored by the same colour asHimself, answer to the same number, and are esoterically known by the same Name.One point here needs emphasis: all Monads pass at different times under theinfluence of the different planetary Logoi, and all are found at some time ineach scheme. This does not mean that every human unit passes a period ofincarnation in each scheme. It means that on some one globe in every scheme,human units will be found either prior to physical incarnation, betweendifferent egoic cycles (a totally different thing to periods between physicallives), between different rounds or manvantaras, or between the variousroot-races and subraces. As stated in various occult books, many of the presentadvanced humanity individualised on the moon chain, and only took physicalbodies in the earth chain during the fourth root-race, thus escaping incarnationduring the first three rounds, and the first two races of the fourth round. Inthe interim, they came under the planetary influence of another Logos of ascheme, and were occupied during that immense period of time in fanning themanasic flame, and developing [365] the attributes of manas, so that theAtlantean root-race found them adequately equipped to cope with life conditions.This participation in the life and influence of the different schemes iseffected in four different ways:First, through passing the interim between egoic cycles of physical incarnationon the particular globe of their scheme, which numerically coincides with theparticular other scheme whose influence is desired, either from deliberatechoice or karmically necessitated. Each globe in a chain is occultly linked withthe chain of its own number, and with the scheme of a similar number. Forinstance: Globe 2, Chain 2, and scheme 2 during round 2 are specially linked andvitalised, and are the focal point of peculiar attention on the part of theLogos of that scheme. Similarly (again in illustration) globe 2, chain 2 duringround 2 in any scheme such as the fifth, for instance, are aligned or connectedesoterically with the second scheme. This gives opportunity for the units in thebody of any Logos to come under the influence of another Logos, and within hisvibratory radiation.Second , through a direct transference of the units in incarnation in any scheme(during an interlude) to some globe in another scheme where they are subjectedto the stimulation and vibration peculiar to that scheme. These two methods arethe most usual. This transference will seem mysteriously impossible unless thestudent is careful to realise that it is the transference of the individualisedlives and not the transference of the forms which they occupy. The whole matteris psychic, and based on the unity of the anima mundi. It is only possible atthose periods when two Heavenly Men are mutually finding each other—under theLaw of Attraction—and thus swinging into the magnetic radius of each other.Third, through a conscious passage of the initiate, [366] through initiation,from one scheme to another. This is frequently done, and hints of it have beengiven by different writers and thinkers, though several have confused the globesof their own chain with the scheme of the same number, or have mistaken anotherchain within the scheme for another scheme.Fourth, the fourth method of transference of consciousness, and the bringing ofthe life units under the focal power of a Lord of a Ray, can be brought aboutthrough knowledge of certain mantrams and formulae. On this we may not enlargeas these mantrams are esoteric and the use of them is fraught with much dangerto the uninitiated.The planetary Logos of this scheme is called “the First Kumara,” the OneInitiator, and the statement is made that He came to this planet from Venus,Venus being “the Earth’s primary.” This needs elucidation somewhat, though itmay not be permitted to do more than convey a few hints as to the truth. Thefact is one of the most mysterious in the development of our scheme, and in itlies hidden the secret of this world cycle. It is not easy to convey the truthand words but seem to veil and cloak.Perhaps a hint may be given in pointing out that there is an analogy between thecoming in of the Ego in full sway and its taking hold at certain periods in thelife of a human being. At seven years we are told the Ego “takes hold,” andagain at adolescence; at twenty-one that hold may be made still firmer. Again,as lives are passed, the Ego (in connection with a human being) grips itsvehicles and so sways them to his purpose with more effect and fullness. Thesame procedure can be seen in relation to a Heavenly Man and His body ofmanifestation, a scheme. It must be remembered that every scheme has sevenchains; that each chain has seven globes, making a totality of forty-nineglobes; [367] that each globe is again in turn occupied by the life of the Logosduring what we call seven rounds, making literally three hundred and forty-threeincarnations, or fresh impulses to manifest. We must add to these majormanifestations such lesser ones as those named by us root-races, and subraces,also branch races, and thus we are faced with a complexity that is enough tostagger the average student. The planetary wheel of life turns on its lesserscale the wheel of life of the little pilgrim we call man; as it turns, itsweeps the life of the evolving planetary Logos into ever new forms andexperiences until the fire of Spirit burns up all lesser fires.As earlier pointed out, each Heavenly Man is linked with one of His Brothersunder the Law of Mutual Attraction, which manifests so degradingly as yet uponthe physical plane, through the life of the human unit, imprisoned in physicalform. Psychically the link is of a different nature, and such a link is foundbetween the planetary Logos of the scheme we call Venus, and the Logos of ourscheme. This psychic interaction has its cyclic ebb and flow, as ebbs and flowsall life force. In Lemurian days came a period of close interaction whichbrought about an incarnation on the physical planet of the Logos of our scheme,the Head of the Hierarchy, and the One Initiator. This could not have beeneffected had not the planetary Logos of the Venus scheme been in a position tolink up closely with ours.c. Venus and the Earth Chain. This question of the coming of the Lords of Flameto the planet Earth is deeply involved (as stated above) in the relationshipexisting between the Heavenly Man of the Earth scheme and the Lord of the Venusscheme. Until more detailed information is permitted publication anent these twogreat Entities, little more can be done beyond indicating some probabilities,and pointing out certain factors which students should carefully bear in mind.The statement [368] has been made that (owing to the Venusian scheme being inits fifth round) its humanity is consequently further advanced than ours, andcan help us, and that this help came in Lemurian days. This is an instance of apartial truth and its misinterpretation. The Venusian scheme is—as stated in theSecret Doctrine (I, 187. II, 33-36,626) —in its fifth and last round; itshumanity is very far ahead of ours in certain particulars, but the momentousoccurrence in the third root-race was due to the following causes, and not tothe factor of the greater advancement of a certain group of human beings:First, the Venus Scheme, viewed as a logoic centre, is more active than ours,and therefore its radiatory magnetism is far more widely spread. Its radiationis such that on the buddhic plane it swept within its magnetic radius that chainin our scheme which is composed predominantly of buddhic matter. Then, via thatchain, it magnetised the corresponding globe in our chain, and this resulted ina specific vitalisation in the dense planet itself.Second, just as in the case of man, certain triangles of force are found atdifferent stages of evolution, or (to word it otherwise) different centresbecome geometrically linked, such as thea. Base of the spine,b. Solar plexus,c. Heart;or again,a. Solar Plexus,b. Heartc. Throatso, in the case of a Heavenly Man, or of a solar Logos, a similar event occurs.Such an event transpires in this round in relation to the centre which ourplanetary Logos [369] embodies. It became geometrically linked with two othercentres, of which Venus was one, and logoic Kundalini—circulating withtremendous force through this adjusted Triangle—brought about thatintensification of vibration in the human family which resulted inindividualisation. We might here enumerate the schemes as a basis for ourfurther work:The seven planets, centres, or schemes:1. Vulcan (the sun, exoterically considered).2. Venus.3. Mars.4. Earth.5. Mercury.6. Jupiter.7. Saturn.The three synthesising planets:1. Uranus.2. Neptune.3. Saturn.The One Resolver.The SUN.I would caution you here against attaching any importance to the sequencefollowed in numbering these seven schemes, either in connection with their orderof development or importance, or their position in relation to the centralplanet, the sun, or to each other. Only two are to be considered numericallyaccurate at this stage and in this round, i.e., our Earth, the fourth scheme,and Venus, the second. Venus is either the second or the sixth scheme, accordingto whether the schemes are counted mystically or occultly. Inversely, Jupiterwill be either the second or the sixth, and it must be remembered that: [370]a. The planets Venus and Jupiter are exceedingly closely connected with theEarth, and form eventually an esoteric triangle.b. Saturn is the synthesising scheme for the four planets which embody manaspurely and simply, or is the major resolution of the minor four, and eventuallyfor all the seven.[Image00010.jpg]c. Mercury, the star of the intuition, or of transmuted manas, is, at thisstage, considered as the fifth scheme.Therefore, the Heavenly Men of Venus and Jupiter are magnetically linked withthe Heavenly Man of our scheme. The relationship of the Logos of Jupiter and Hisinfluence will not be realised nor felt until the sixth [371] round is in fullforce, though during the sixth root-race His vibration will be acknowledged andsensed; in the middle of the fifth round the Logos of Mercury will, with theLogos of the Venus scheme, and of our Earth, form a temporary triangle of force.We have here information given that has only been hinted at hitherto but forwhich, in this fifth subrace and in this fourth round, the world is now ready;it holds the solution of the mystery of this round.Third, the statement that the great Kumara or the One Initiator came to thisplanet from Venus is true in so far as it embodies the fact that He came to thisdense planet (the fourth) in the fourth chain from that chain in our schemewhich is called the “Venus” chain, and which is the second chain. He came viathe second globe in our chain; His scarcely felt vibration was sensed (occultly)in the second round, but only in the third root-race of the fourth round didconditions permit of His physical incarnation and of His coming as the Avatar.Very reverently might it be said that the first three rounds and the twosucceeding root-races in this chain correspond to the period prior to birth; andthat His coming in the fourth round with the subsequent awakening of manas inthe human units find their analogy in the awakening of the life principle in theunborn infant at the fourth month.The analogy holds good, for a Heavenly Man at the end of the seventh roundreaches full maturity, but requires the final process of rounding out andperfecting which He attains during the two final periodsa. Of synthesis into the major three schemes.b. Of resolution into the final one;making again—with reverence may it be said—the nine cycles which cover thegestation of a Heavenly Man, and which precede His birth into yet higher worlds.In this lies much food for thought, and much of moment [372] for the profoundstudent. We might couple with these suggestions the recollection that we arespeaking here only of the Logos of our own scheme, and must carefullydifferentiate other cycles for the other Logoi—a thing as yet impossible for us.As this is meditated upon and studied, the wonder and beauty of the plan willbecome apparent.A clue to the idea of the final Avatar is likewise to be seen here. Manytemporary incarnations precede this consummating one, which will be theincarnation wherein the Heavenly Man, in the full beauty of His completed sevencycles, and prior to His merging into His synthesising goal, will demonstrate asthe embodiment of that perfected quality, or logoic aspect, for which Heprimarily stands. As a centre in the body logoic, He will be fully vitalised,and the logoic kundalini will have stimulated, and aroused to perfection Hissystemic Lotus. For a brief period He will shine forth radiant as the Sun in Hisglory; then the kundalinic fire will pass in higher progressive spirals, and Hewill gradually become centred in the corresponding logoic head centre, thehigher triangle or the major three schemes. To illustrate by means of a humanbeing, the microcosm: Man attains a period of high development wherein his heartand throat centre are perfected and vitalised; they become radiant whorls offire, fourth dimensional in action, and allied with each other and with someother centre; they become likewise the object of the attention of humankundalini. This is a period of great activity and magnetic usefulness. It issucceeded by still another, wherein the three head centres are synthesisingtheir seven minor correspondences, and the force of kundalini passes there. Asabove, so below.

Vol. I, pp.259)Solar Septenary Chart - from the middle of the Third Root Race, at the FourthRound to the “Judgement Day” in the middle of the Fifth Round[Image00011.jpg]THE DENSE PHYSICAL PLANETEarth 4th Chain 4th Globe Mars 4th Chain 4th Globe Jupiter 3rd Chain 4th GlobeVulcan 3rd Chain 4th Globe Saturn 3rd Chain 4th globe Venus 5th Chain 5th GlobeMercury 4th Chain 5th GlobeI have especially mentioned these two centres in the microcosm as they areclosely concerned (on a larger scale) with the particular cycles through whichour [374] planetary Logos passes, and because they represent the third andsecond aspects.We need to bear in mind that the stimulation of the centres is of three kinds,and the distinction between the three must be kept clear.First, the vitalisation of the logoic centres, or the pouring through the sevenschemes, during stupendous cycles, of logoic kundalini.Next, the vitalisation of the planetary centres, or the pouring through theseven chains of a scheme, of planetary kundalini.Finally, the vitalisation of the centres of a planetary Logos during someparticular major incarnation, or the pouring through the seven globes of achain, of kundalini.It should be stated here that:A major incarnation is one in which a planetary Logos takes some initiation. Hemay, and does, pass through many incarnations without taking initiation. When Hedoes take initiation, it is interesting to note that He does so during someincarnation in which He takes a vehicle of etheric matter as is the case at thistime.The Logos of our scheme is preparing for initiation and hence the terrific testsand trials, incident to life on our planet during this cycle, are easilyaccounted for.The Logos of our scheme, Sanat Kumara, will take a major initiation in themiddle of the fifth round, but is preparing for a minor one at this time.The Logos of our scheme has been in physical incarnation (having a body ofetheric matter) since the middle of the Lemurian root-race, and will remain withus until what is called “the judgment day” in the next round. At that point inHis career He will have achieved the necessary vitalisation of the particularcentre which is occupying His attention, will have “seen of the travail of HisSoul” in connection with the units of the human [375] Hierarchy who go to thecomposition of this centre, and will drop His present form, will turn Hisattention to another and higher centre, and give of His force to the units of adifferent calibre, from another branch of the human Hierarchy, who respond tothe vibration of that centre.It would be well to enlarge here a little on the connection between Venus andthe Earth, which is hinted at in some of the occult books, and is somewhattouched upon in this. I have stated that the interaction between the two schemesis due largely to their positive and negative polarity, and I pointed out that asimilar relation underlies the relation of the Pleiades and the seven schemes ofour solar system, and also the relation of Sirius and the system itself. This,therefore, sweeps into close interaction three great systems:1. The system of Sirius,2. The system of the Pleiades,3. The system of which our sun is the focal point,making, as we will have noted, a cosmic triangle. Within our system there areseveral such triangles, varying at different stages; according to their relationto each other, the differentiated force of the different schemes can pass fromscheme to scheme, and thus the units of life on the different rays or streams offorce become temporarily intermingled. In all these triangles (cosmic, systemic,planetary, and human) two points of the triangle represent each a differentpolarity, and one point represents the point of equilibrium, of synthesis ormerging. This should be borne in mind in studying both the macrocosmic and themicrocosmic centres, for it accounts for diversity in manifestation, in formsand in quality.A correspondence might here also be pointed out which [376] may serve to conveylight to those who have eyes to see:The Venus scheme, being in the fifth round, had the fifth principle of manasco-ordinated and developed, the minor four manasic aspects had been synthesised,and the buddhic aspect was being provided with a means of expression through themedium of the perfected fifth. Our Heavenly Man, in the fifth round, will haveattained a paralleling point in evolution, and the fifth principle will, asstated, be no longer the object of His attention as regards the human units.Five stages of activity mark the development and utilisation of the mindprinciple; there are three stages of acquisition, and two wherein that which hasbeen acquired is used. This is too intricate a calculation for us to enter intoit here, and it cannot be undertaken except by an initiate, for it involvesability to study the cycles of the earlier solar system, but it might be notedthat (judging from the microcosm on the earth planet) this is just what might beexpected. Man developed manas in this round during the third, fourth and fifthroot-races, and utilises it for the development of the intuition and of thehigher consciousness during the sixth and seventh. During an incarnation by aplanetary Logos in a chain, during one round He demonstrates through His sevencentres or globes manas on three globes, and utilises it for specific purposeson the final two. This is a lesser cycle to that in which we view the sevenchains as His seven centres. These words are chosen with care; I say not“acquires manas”; He but produces that which is inherent. It must be rememberedthat just as the planes of a solar system stand for a different purpose, vibrateto a different key, and serve their own specific ends, so do the globes serve ananalogous function.a . Globe 1, is that of ultimate abstraction, and of origination. It is theinitial globe of manifestation. [377]b . Globe 2, is the first sheath in which a Heavenly Man embodies Himself.c . Globes 3, 4, 5, are those through which He demonstrates the possession ofthe manasic principle.d. Globes 6 and 7, are the ones through which He manifests buddhi, through formsbuilt by means of the manasic principle.This can be equally predicated on a larger scale of a chain.An interesting correspondence of a very occult nature can be worked out by theadvanced student in connection also with the seven schemes. There are two whichmay be considered primarily archetypal, causal, or involving abstraction; threein which manas is manifested, and two in which already buddhi is manasicallydemonstrating. Of these two, Venus is one and thus we have the three and the twowhich make the five schemes of the five Kumaras, Who are Brahma. ( 136)[text00028.html#Y_FN136]Just as Venus is negatively polarised to our Earth scheme, so the seven stars ofthe Pleiades are negatively polarised to our seven schemes.A very pertinent question might here be asked. We might justly enquire (inconnection with the point that Venus is negatively polarised, and also that thePleiades are equally so) why they should be termed negative if they are thedonors and not the receivers, for to be negative is surely to be receptive. Thisis indeed so, but the question arises in our minds, owing to lack ofinformation, and consequent misapprehension. Venus may have had much to do withthe impartation of the stimulation which resulted in great events on Earth viathe Venus chain of our scheme, but our scheme gave, in a mysterious manner, morethan was received , though the [378] gift was not of the same nature. The comingin of the Venusian influence to our chain, and to our planet, with thesubsequent stimulation of certain groups in the fourth Creative Hierarchy, thehuman, caused a paralleling event of even greater magnitude in the Venus scheme.This affected the sixth Hierarchy, one of the deva Hierarchies, dwelling in theVenus scheme. This stimulation emanated via our sixth chain (or the secondaccording to the angle of vision) and affected a corresponding chain in theVenus scheme. The magnitude of the difference may be seen in the fact that inour case one globe alone was affected, whereas the influence of our scheme onthe Venusian was such that an entire chain was stimulated. This was broughtabout through the positive polarity of the Heavenly Man of the Earth scheme.Therefore, enlarging the concept, we can note the fact that our Heavenly Men arethe transmitters, via their seven schemes, to the seven stars of the Pleiades.Our solar system is negatively polarised as regards the sun Sirius, whichinfluences our entire system psychically via the three synthesisingschemes—Uranus, Neptune, Saturn—the latter, Saturn, being the focal point forthe transmission of cosmic manas to the entire seven schemes.4. Manas and the Earth ChainWe have brought our consideration of our first point, the origin of cosmic andsystemic manas, down to certain facts concerning our chain, and have (with theutmost brevity) passed in review the larger aspect of the question. We touchedfirst of all upon the subject of cosmic manas, as it concerned our Logos and theHeavenly Men. Then we considered it more specifically in its relation to theindividual Heavenly Men, and finally brought it down to that which more nearlyconcerns ourselves— [379] manas and the Heavenly Man of our scheme. Havingproceeded thus far, we considered the stimulation of manas in our own chain, andsaw that, in connection with our Earth, it came:Via the Venus chain of our scheme.As the result of a stimulation, originating in the Venus scheme.Because logoic kundalini had vitalised one of the systemic triangles of force,of which (temporarily) Venus and the Earth formed two points of the triangle.This produced the individualisation of those, particularly in the humanHierarchy, who form a particular centre in the body of the planetary Logos.a. The Earth Chain and the Incarnating Monads.We have reached, therefore, a point wherein (having cursorily dealt above withthe origin of cosmic, systemic, and planetary manas), it is now possible for usto come definitely down to the consideration of our Earth chain within the Earthscheme, and see something of the origin of the manasic principle in the presentgroup of incarnating egos , units of the fourth Creative Hierarchy. It isnecessary here for students to remember that only one group in the fourthHierarchy was affected by the coming in of manas in the third root-race, andthat therefore in incarnation on the planet at this time are component parts ofthe two groups: one group, which received the manasic stimulation during thisworld period, and another group which received the stimulation during theprevious chain. The last named group can be seen incarnating in all those whotread the Probationary Path, who are counted as the advanced units of the race,and considered as the notables among men. Owing to the difference between thetwo groups may be traced much of the world unrest. This difference lies in thefollowing [380] factors, which, for purposes of clarity, it might be well toenumerate:The fact that each group forms a different centre in the body of a Heavenly Man.The difference in the method of individualisation.The different rate of vibration of the two centres.The fact, therefore, that in each chain the planetary Logos takes a differentinitiation, affecting different centres; and so bringing into manifestationdifferent lesser entities.Students, when considering these things, need to view the matter from thefollowing angles—some quite possible lines of approach for us, others which weare only capable as yet of dimly anticipating. The occult fact, as stated by theEnglish poet Pope, “The proper study of mankind, is man,” is embodied in theinvestigation of all these vast cycles.The cosmic angle. This involves the study of the place of the solar Logos withinHis greater sphere, the study of extra-systemic psychology and astronomy, andthe consideration of the relation existing between our system and otherconstellations, and of our path in the vast arc of the heavens. It bears on therelation of the various suns with their circulating attendants, and of theplanets with each other; it concerns the study of their individual polarisation,and their interaction with their polar opposites. It will lead the student intoregions of logical speculation, into the study of cosmic electricity, and theuniversal Law of attraction, and is as yet much beyond the comprehension of eventhe most advanced students at this time, and will only become a science (reducedto form and text-book if I might so express it) during the final part of thenext round.The systemic angle. This deals with the place of the Heavenly Men within thebody logoic, Their mutual [381] interplay, and Their rational interdependence,and with the cycles wherein each in turn, or in dual formation, is the recipientof logoic force. It necessitates the study of the solar system as a unit, of theastronomical and orbital relation of the Sun to the planets. The systemictriangles will eventually become a subject of popular speculation, then ofinvestigation, of scientific demonstration, and finally be known to be provedand authenticated fact,—but the time is not yet. The different polarities of theschemes will be studied, and information, that is now imparted only to initiatesof the third Initiation, will eventually become exoteric. In due course of timesystemic information along the lines of:a. The vitalisation of the schemesb . Interaction between two schemesc. The periods of incarnation of a planetary Logos on the physical planed. The initiation of the planetary Logos,will be reduced to law and order. As yet but dim speculations and hints thatappeal only to the spiritual and the intuitive are in any way possible. Theearly part of the next round will see more widespread knowledge and interest inthis matter.The planetary angle . This point of view concerns itself with the history of theindividual scheme, and with the consciousness, and evolution of some particularHeavenly Man. The student in studying along these lines must endeavour to getsome grasp of the scheme as a unit, as a body corporate with its seven centresand forty-nine globes, and with the triangle formed between them. Separatechains are eitherThe object of planetary stimulation,The sphere of the incarnation of a planetary Logos,Emerging into objectivity, [382]Manifesting,Gradually entering into obscurity.This point of view is as yet impossible for the average thinker, for it involvesan expansion of consciousness unattainable by man. Nevertheless the endeavour tocomprehend serves a useful purpose, for it sets a goal for man and enables himto enlarge his present concept.The chain angle. This brings the whole idea more within the range ofpossibility, and has already been indicated to students in Volume II , of theSecret Doctrine. The student is narrowed down to the contemplation of the sevenglobes of the chain of which he is a component, though microscopic, part. He hasfor investigation the globes as seen in time, with their mutual interplay; hehas for study the part each one may be playing in the great cycle of a HeavenlyMan. For instance, in the present Earth chain which concerns us the most nearly,the fourth globe is of paramount interest, inasmuch as it is the physical planevehicle for a Heavenly Man in dense objective incarnation. Yet it must not beforgotten that, though manifesting thus objectively, He embodies in totality thechain and the scheme. The idea may be clarified for the student if it is statedthat:A scheme , in its totality, corresponds to the Monad, or to the monadic auricegg, in connection with a human being and his forty-nine cycles.A chain , ( 137 [text00028.html#Y_FN137] ) in its totality corresponds to thebody egoic of a human being, to the causal body with its seven great [383]cycles mentioned elsewhere in these pages, and hinted at in certain occultbooks.A globe, with its seven races corresponds to a particular series of incarnationsin connection with a man, incarnate or discarnate, for all globes are not onphysical levels.A physical globe, in a chain corresponds to a particular physical incarnation ofa man. The planetary Logos takes physical form in His planet and is its life andworks out His purposes.A root-race, simply is analogous to the “seven parts” (as Shakespeare phrasesit) as played by the midget, man. In a root-race a Heavenly Man is simply livingout His life, working through some experience in the great work of developingbuddhi or corporate action, (for buddhi is the unifying principle of groups)and, in the process of experiencing and developing, He sweeps into His vibratorycapacity all the cells in His body. In the case of a human being the cells inhis body (the material cells) are involutionary lives, animated by the thirdLogos, co-operating with the second Logos. In the case of a planetary Logos, thecells in His body are evolutionary lives (deva and human units) animated by thelife of the second Logos, co-operating with the first Logos, and utilising theactivities of the third Logos for purposes of manifesting.Having pointed out these things, the place the Earth chain and globe play in theevolution of the planetary Logos of the Earth scheme should be clearer to thestudent.The wheel turns, and in its turning sweeps into objectivity one of its sevenglobes, or brings into manifestation on the physical plane that great EntityWhose life animates the whole scheme. It must be borne in mind that just as manis handicapped by his physical body, [384] and finds himself unable to expressthrough it the entire content of his egoicconsciousness, so a Heavenly Man, whentaking to Himself a dense physical vehicle in any particular chain, is alsohandicapped, and is unable to express in perfection on the globe the full beautyof His Life or the splendour of His manifesting Consciousness.It might here be stated in connection with the planetary Logos of our schemethat:a. He is in physical incarnation.b. He is midway through His career upon the cosmic Path of Initiation, andconsequently is to take the fourth Initiation in this chain. Well may thisglobe, therefore, be considered the globe of sorrow and of pain, for through itour planetary Logos is undergoing that which the mystic calls “the Crucifixion.”c. The cells in His body—those cells through which He feels, and senses, andexperiences,—are, in this world period, rent by pain and suffering, for His isthe consciousness at the centre of the Body, and theirs is the capacity tosuffer, so that by means of them He may learn the meaning of systemicdispassion, be dissociated from all forms and material substance, and upon thecross of matter eventually find liberation and the freedom of the Spirit.The same equally can be predicated of a solar Logos with the followinginteresting sequence carefully borne in mind:The solar Logos has for objective nine initiations, the third cosmic Initiationbeing His goal.Our planetary Logos has for objective seven initiations, the second cosmicInitiation being His goal.Man has for objective five initiations, the first cosmic Initiation being hisgoal. [385][Image00012.jpg][386] If we link this up with that earlier imparted concerning initiation andthe sun Sirius, we will have a clue to the triple cosmic Path.b. The Fourth Kingdom and the Hierarchy of the Planet. Certain facts havealready been grasped and realised by the average occult student who has beenpondering this teaching with care. He is aware that the juncture ofSpirit-matter and mind, or manas, was effected during the third root-race, andthat the definitely human family became present upon earth from that date. Heknows that this was brought about by the coming, in bodily Presence, of certaingreat Entities, and he has learned that these Entities came from the Venusianchain, that They achieved the necessary juncture, undertook the government ofthe planet, founded the occult Hierarchy, and that—though some remain with thechain—the remainder have returned to Their originating source. This in many wayssums up the totality of the present knowledge. Let us briefly enlarge upon it,correct certain erroneous interpretations, and ascertain one or two new facts.We might tabulate these as follows:First, it should be borne in mind by the occult student that:a . This advent signalised the taking of a physical vehicle by the planetaryLogos, and was literally the coming of the Avatar.b. That this advent was brought about by a definite systemic alignment whichinvolved:The Venus scheme of the system.The Venus chain of the Earth scheme.The Venus globe of the Earth chain.c. That the planetary Logos did not come from the Venus scheme but from theVenus chain of His own scheme, the Earth scheme. Owing to systemic [387]alignment logoic kundalini could flow through a certain triangle of which twopoints were Venus and the Earth. This caused an acceleration of vibration, andenabled the Heavenly Man of our scheme to take a minor initiation, and to setabout His preparations for a major initiation.Next, it should also be remembered that in considering this matter we must becareful to view it not only as it affects our own globe and its presenthumanity, but from the systemic and cosmic point of view, or from the angle ofits importance to a planetary Logos and a solar Logos. Hence it is a fact thatthis event was not only the result of the taking of a minor initiation by ourEarth Logos, but in the Venus scheme it was signalised by the taking of a majorinitiation by the Venusian planetary Logos on His fifth chain. In connectionwith a solar Logos it followed upon the stimulation of one of His centres andfrom the geometrical progression of the fire through the earlier mentionedTriangle.It has been stated that one hundred and four Kumaras came from Venus to theEarth; literally the figure is one hundred and five, when the synthesising Unit,the Lord of the World Himself, is counted as one. There remain still with Himthe three Buddhas of Activity. I would call attention to the dual significanceof that name, “Buddha of Activity,” bearing out, as it does, the reality of thefact that Entities at Their stage of evolution are active love-wisdom and embodyin Themselves the two aspects. The three Buddhas of activity have acorrespondence to the three persons of the Trinity.These Entities are divided into three groups of thirty-five each, and inThemselves embody the three major centres of the planetary Logos, those threegroups which we know as the “three departments,” for it should be emphasisedthat each department forms a centre: [388]a. The Head centre The Ruling Department b. The Heart centre The TeachingDepartment c. The Throat centre The Mahachohan’s Department. This centresynthesises the lesser four, just as the third Ray synthesises the minor four.These Kumaras (or Their present substitutes) can also be divided into the sevengroups which correspond to the seven Rays, and are in Themselves the life of thecentre for which They stand. Fifteen, therefore, of these Entities (again theten and the five) form a centre in the body of the planetary Logos, and thethree Kumaras about Whom we are told (Who in Themselves are fivefold, making thefifteen) are the entifying Lives of the particular centre which is involved inthe coming Initiation of the Heavenly Man, and to which the human units at thistime, and during this greater cycle, belong.Another fact that should be noted about these great Beings is, that when viewedin Their seven groups, They form:a. Focal points for the force or influence emanating from the other solarcentres or schemes.b. The seven divisions of the occult Hierarchy.They exist, as does the Heavenly Man Himself, in etheric matter, and areliterally great Wheels, or centres of living Fire, manasic and electric fire;They vitalise the body of the Heavenly Man and hold all together as an objectivewhole. They make a planetary triangle within the chain, and each of Themvitalises one globe.It is not permitted at this stage to state, for exoteric publication:Which Ray, or logoic emanation is embodied by our planetary Logos. [389]Which centre in the solar system is called the Earth scheme.Which scheme is our polar opposite, or which Heavenly Man is most closely alliedto ours.Which particular centre in the body of the planetary Logos He is at presentendeavouring to vitalise.These points are, as may be inferred, too dangerous to impart, and thosestudents whose intuition suffices to attain the information will see forthemselves the necessity for silence.c. A Prophecy. We might now, prior to continuing with our subject, name thedifferent chains of the Earth scheme. We must bear carefully in mind the factthat these are simply names, affixed to the chains and globes for the sake ofclarity. As this subject is more widely studied it will inevitably be foundadvisable to call the chains by their numbers, and to drop the names as atpresent used:1. Neptune.2. Venus.3. Saturn.4. Earth.5. Mercury.6. Mars.7. Jupiter.It is necessary here to take the opportunity to sound a note of warning tostudents in connection with the charts which have been inserted in the Treatise.They depict only one cycle in logoic evolution, and cover only the presentgreater period in the working out of which we are engaged. They might be roughlydescribed as embracing that period in the system which began for us in themiddle of the third root-race of this round and continues until the periodcalled “the Judgment” [390] in the coming fifth round. When that time comes ourplanetary Logos will have attained the initiation which is His present goal; thefifth round of the Venusian scheme will be closing, and the Venus scheme willbegin to pass into obscuration, preparatory to transferring her life to thesynthesising planet with which she is connected; Mercury will be reaching theapotheosis of achievement, and with Mars and the Earth, will form a systemictriangle. We are speaking here of schemes and not of chains.We must recognise another triangle within the Earth scheme, of the chains called“the Earth chain,” the Venus chain, and the Mercurian chain, but this triangleentirely concerns the centres of the planetary Logos of our scheme. A systemicformation of great importance in the next round should be pointed out which willbring three schemes:The Earth scheme,Mars,Mercury,into such a position in relation to each other that the following results willeventuate:1. A systemic triangle will be formed.2. Logoic kundalini will circulate freely between these three points.3. A certain great logoic centre will be vitalised and the attention of logoickundalini will pass from the present triangle in process of forming (the Earth,Venus, and a scheme whose name it is advisable to withhold) to the other.4. An entirely new group of human beings will sweep into incarnation in ourEarth scheme. Three fifths of the present humanity, being on the ProbationaryPath, or the Path of Initiation, at that time, will have their centre ofconsciousness definitely on the mental plane [391] whilst two fifths will remainfocussed on the astral. These two fifths will pass into temporary pralaya,preparatory to their transference to another scheme, as the Earth scheme will nolonger provide for them an adequate place of nurture.5. Entities will come in from Mars to the Earth scheme, and will there findtheir necessary field of endeavour.6. Mercurian life will begin to synthesise, and to be transferred to itssynthesising planet. In the case of Mercury this synthesising planet is notSaturn, but one of the other two higher major centres.7. The “Judgment Day” in the fifth round, or the point of attainment of ourHeavenly Man, will see a period of planetary strife on mental Ievels which willcause the present world unrest to seem as nothing. As pointed out earlier, thispresent struggle has been to test the ability of the entities within the presenthuman forms to appreciate their mental forces, and through the power of MIND totranscend feeling, or pain. The struggle in the fifth round will be betweenhigher and lower mind, and the battle ground will be the causal body. ( 138[text00028.html#Y_FN138] ) The [392] struggle now being waged on the planet isbetween a few Egos (or the leaders of the many races who are necessarily inplace and position owing to their egoic polarisation) and many personalities,who are swept into the vortex through group association; it is necessarilyterrific, and forces the destruction of the form. The struggle in the fifthround, being on mental levels, will be between Egos and egoic groups, eachworking consciously, and with intellectual application, to bring about certaingroup results. It will result in the triumph (the ultimate triumph) of Spiritover matter, in the driving out of certain groups as yet unable to shakethemselves free from the trammels of matter, and who prefer captivity to thelife of the Spirit; it will mark the beginning of the obscuration of our scheme,and the gradual passing into pralaya, during the remaining two and a half roundsof our entire seven chains. It is an interesting occult fact that our Earthshould now be in her fifth round, and paralleling the Venusian scheme, but themoon chain of our scheme saw a period of temporary retardation of theevolutionary process of our Heavenly Man; it resulted in a temporary slowingdown of His activities, and caused “lost time,” if such an expression mightreverently be permitted. The Lords of the Dark Face, or the inherent forces ofmatter for a time achieved success, and only the fifth round of our chain willsee their ultimate defeat. The Venusian scheme also had its battleground, butthe planetary Logos of that scheme overcame the antagonistic forces, triumphedover material forms, and was consequently in a position—when the right timecame—to apply the needed stimulation or an [393] increased fiery vibration toour Earth scheme. The fact that outside aid was called in during the thirdroot-race of this chain, and that the evolution of manas brought about theindividualisation, in physical form, of the Avatar, needs to be pondered on. TheDivine Manasaputra, the Lord of the World, took form Himself through the drivingimpulse of manas, inherent in His nature, and in some mysterious way this wasaided by another Heavenly Man of another scheme. His co-operation was required.d. Summation. We have been studying the origin of manas, and we saw first, thatit is the active will, intelligently applied, of an Entity, and then that thisactive intelligent will affects all lesser lives in cyclic evolution within theBody of that particular actively willing Existence. This is true of all Beingsfrom the Logos downwards. Perhaps in summing up it might be expressed thus:The originating source of manasic activity in a solar system is that greatcosmic Entity Who embodies our solar Logos as a centre in His Body along withsix other solar Logoi Who are, in Their totality, His seven centres.The originating source of manasic activity in the planetary schemes is thatcosmic Entity we call the solar Logos. He is the active, directing IntelligenceWho is working with definite purpose through His seven centres.The originating source of the manasic principle in a planetary scheme is thatlesser cosmic Entity Whom we call a planetary Logos. He works through His sevenchains as does the Logos through His seven planetary centres. It is interestinghere to note that when the solar Logos is being manasically impelled to work outsome purpose of His greater Source (THE ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID) Hemay cause a vivification in one or other of His centres according to the purposein view. This occurred in the forming of the triangle of which Earth and Venusare two points, and (affecting [394] the Heavenly Men of these two schemes)stimulated Them to take initiation, and led the planetary Logos of our scheme toform a lesser triangle within His sphere of activity, which triangle eventuatedin His taking a lesser initiation, and in the manasic impregnation of animalman. Thus were swept into objective activity that group of monads who go to thecomposition of a particular centre.Similarly, and microcosmically, a human being is the manasic incentive and theorigin of active, intelligent will to all the cells within his threefoldbody,—astral, mental and physical. His is the directing intelligence, and histhe source of all action and endeavour within his periphery, and, like hisgreater corresponding spheres, a solar Logos and a planetary Logos, he worksthrough seven centres.Thus we have traced the origin of manas as far as it is possible to do at thistime. The mystery of manas is hidden in existence itself, and holds the secretof life and conceals and veils those Entities Whose outstanding quality andcharacteristic it is. To the life of that little entity we call an atom in thephysical body of a man, the Thinker in the causal body, his greater directingintelligence, is as obscure and unknown as the Logos is to the Thinker, Man,himself. The analogy is nevertheless accurate. ( 139 [text00028.html#Y_FN139] )Man’s physical body, for instance, considering it [395] as a corporate wholecomposed of many lesser lives, suffers or prospers as its directing Intelligenceacts with wisdom-love or otherwise. The manasic principle actuates all thatoccurs within the man’s aura, and he suffers, or he makes progress, according tothe application of that principle.So, reverently may the same be said of the body of the solar Logos, a system,and so may it be said of the planetary Logos and His scheme.II. THE POSITION OF MANASManas and Karma.Manas and Karmic purpose1. Manas and Karma.Having seen that manas is the intelligent purpose of some Being, working out inactive objectivity, and having touched upon the inter-relation existing betweencertain of these Entities, it may now be possible to vision—even if somewhatcursorily and dimly—the true position of the manasic principle in all threecases. The whole mystery of this principle is hidden in two fundamentals:The mystery of the resolution of the six-pointed star, into the five-pointedstar. ( 140 [text00028.html#Y_FN140] ) ( 141 [text00028.html#Y_FN141] )The mystery of the Lords of Karma, Who are, in themselves, the sole recipientsof the Mind purposes [396] of that cosmic ENTITY Who enfolds our solar Logoswithin His consciousness.When, therefore, the esoteric side of astrology, and of mystical geometry, hasbeen studied, and alliance has been made between these two sciences, a flood oflight will be thrown upon this matter of the intelligent principle; when theinner workings of the Law of Cause and Effect (the law whereby the Lipika Lordsgovern all Their action) is better comprehended, then—and then only—will thesons of men be able to study with profit the place of manas in the evolutionaryscheme. At the present time it is not possible to do more than point out thedirection of the path which must be trodden before this [397] abstruse mattercan be made clear, and to indicate certain lines of investigation which might(if strenuously and scientifically followed) yield to the student a rich rewardof knowledge. Until the intuition is better developed in the average man, thevery principle of manas itself forms a barrier to its due understanding.2. Manas and karmic purpose.If it is realised by the student that manas and intelligent purpose arepractically synonymous terms, it will be immediately apparent that karma, andthe activities of the Lipika Lords, will be involved in the matter. It will alsobe apparent that only as the lower mind is transmuted into the abstract orhigher mind and from thence into the intuition, will man be able to understandthe significance of manas. We may perhaps ask why this must be so. Surely it isbecause the abstract mind is the agent on cosmic levels whereby the Entityconcerned formulates His plans and purposes. These plans and purposes (conceivedof in the abstract mind) in due course of evolution crystallise into concreteform by means of the concrete mind. What we call the archetypal plane inconnection with the Logos (the plane whereon He forms His ideals, Hisaspirations and His abstract conceptions) is the logoic correspondence to theatomic abstract levels of the mental plane, from whence are initiated theimpulses and purposes of the Spirit in man,—those purposes which eventuallyforce him into an objective form, thus paralleling logoic manifestation. Firstthe abstract concept, then the medium provided for manifestation in form, and,finally, that form itself. Such is the process for Gods and for men, and in itis hidden the mystery of mind and of its place in evolution.For the sake of clarity, let us take the microcosm for momentary study. Itshould be realised by all students that man is Spirit or the Self, workingthrough matter or [398] the Not-Self, by means of the intelligence or manas, andit should also be realised that the statement of this fact (which is equallytrue of a solar Logos, a Heavenly Man, and a human being) involves the admissionof certain deductions based on manifestation itself. One of these deductions isthat by means of this principle of manas form is built. Therefore, the wholesubject of the Builders has to be studied—those entities who are the embodimentof Universal Mind, who are the animating lives within the form, and who are theDivine Manasaputras in their comprehensive totality. In the occult realisationof this lies hid the secret of the close relationship between man and the devaevolution, man being the repository (through the Heavenly Man of Whose body heforms a part) of the purpose of the Logos, and the devas in all their highergrades being the cohesive attractive factor which manipulates matter, and whichmoulds it into shape. The two are partners, indispensable to each other, andwithout the two working in close co-operation this objective solar system wouldimmediately disintegrate, just as man’s dense and etheric bodies disintegratewhen the Spirit withdraws, and the Builders cease their work.Three hierarchies in particular are concerned with objective manifestation inetheric matter, the fourth, or strictly human hierarchy, and the fifth and sixthor the deva hierarchies. The other hierarchies fulfill other purposes connectedwith the life of the Spirit in the higher forms in the cosmic ethers, but inconnection with our present subject these three hierarchies work on the lowerlevels of the cosmic physical plane the subplanes of which we call the mental,astral, and physical planes. When the five and the four are perfectly blended,we shall have achieved the nine of a major initiation, and when the six is addedwe shall have the resolution into one of the groups embodied by a Kumara, as hasbeen hinted earlier. [399] This marks the resolution of the six-pointed starfinally into the five-pointed star; this is a great mystery, and concernsprimarily the Heavenly Man of our scheme, and only incidentally the groupswithin His body of etheric manifestation.It will, therefore, be apparent that if all manifestation is the embodiment inform of a cosmic conception, and the working out of it in concrete shape, manasor intelligence is a basic factor of the process and the means whereby the linkis made between the abstract and the concrete. This is already realised to betrue in connection with man, and it is equally true of cosmic entities. As manprogresses towards the heart of the mystery he awakens to a realisation that theaim of evolution for him is to build consciously the channel between the levelswhich are to him the planes of the abstract or of the ideal, and the concreteones whereon he normally functions. This connecting channel has beeninadequately called, and is literally “THE PATH” itself. He builds it:By means of the manasic principle consciously applied.By the process of transcending the karmic limitations of the three lower planes.Through the method of dominating matter, or the Personality, considering it asthe Not-Self.Through the expansion of his consciousness through graded steps until itincludes the planes he seeks to reach, and thereby demonstrating the truth ofthe statement that in order to tread the Path he must become that Path itself,and the accuracy of the occult truth that the antaskarana is itself butillusion. Ponder on this, for it carries illumination for those who have eyes tosee.In the process of treading that Path and of achieving the goal, man is resolvedinto the five-pointed star, finally into the triangle of Spirit. Between thesetwo stages is [400] a mysterious esoteric stage wherein he is resolved into thefour,—not this time the four of the lower quaternary, but a higher four. Hebecomes part of the consciousness of that occult group hinted at in variousplaces which stands next to the three Logoi, the four great Maharajahs, thedispensers of karma, the repositories of cosmic purpose, who are reflected (butonly reflected) in the logoic Quaternary, or in those four Heavenly Men Whoembody (with their synthesising third) logoic manas. These four with thesynthesising one are in Themselves the sumtotal of manas, the Brahma aspect, orIntelligence in activity. Karma works through manas, and only as the six-pointedstar (or the sumtotal of concrete mind in its various divisions) becomes thefive-pointed star, or the synthesis of the lower into the abstract or higher, isthe transmutation into the three, or the Spiritual Triad, made possible via thefour, or the formless repositories of karmic purpose; thus is liberationachieved, thus is man set free, and the microcosm attains BEING without thenecessity of form-taking. A hint here in connection with the microcosm may help:When the microcosm has transcended the three worlds of matter and has become thefive pointed star, he passes into the consciousness of the Monad, or pureSpirit, via the fourth plane of buddhi. For him the buddhic plane is the planeof karmic correspondence. On it he enters into the sphere of consciousco-operation in the working out of karma for a Heavenly Man, having completelyworked out his personal karma in the lower three spheres. The student whoseintuition suffices can work out the planes which correspond to the buddhicplane, for a Heavenly Man and for a solar Logos. This will only be possible ifthe concept is extended to cosmic levels and beyond the systemic.Through the ideas here imparted it may be possible for the student to think out,for himself, some aspects of the [401] place of manas in cosmic evolution. Itnecessitates a somewhat synthetic viewpoint, and the steady holding of thethought of PURPOSE in all activity, whether cosmic, systemic, planetary, ormicrocosmic. It is the fire of divine impulse permeating all forms and drivingthose forms to certain action and achievement.The fire of matter earlier dealt with is the dynamic fire of motion, which keepsin activity each atom of matter. The fire of mind is the coherent impulse andpurpose, driving the forms (built up of active matter) in a specific direction,and along certain destined paths. It is consequently karmic impulse, originatingcause, and operating will. It is likewise the result or the effect of thisaction in time, and only as the Triad comes into play, via the esoteric four,are the fires of both mind and matter burnt out and the fire of Spirit set free.III. THE PRESENT STAGE OF MANASIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE THREE GROUPSIn the PlanetsIn the SystemOn EarthLiterally, should we paraphrase this sentence, we might express it in the formof an enquiry as to the point attained in the active working out of the purposesof the great Entities involved in cosmic and systemic manifestation; we mightalso enquire if the intelligent will of the cosmic Logos and of the solar Logosand equally (within the system) of the different planetary Logoi, proceededsatisfactorily to a stage where it can be both appreciated and somewhatcomprehended. These thoughts are involved in the consideration of this point,and open up for us much of very real interest. It should here be pointed outthat the manasic principle (whether cosmic, systemic, or human) manifests infive ways, is transmuted into wisdom after its fivefold manifestation, andeventually is resolved into pure will or power. Herein lies the clue; all theobjective display we see around us in connection with the Heavenly Men, and withthe cells of Their bodies, [402] lies hidden in this. Herein may be found themystery of the five Kumaras, Who are awaiting the final resolution, and hereinis secreted the knowledge of divine alchemy, which is based on the fiveelements, and is concerned with their transformation into a primal elementthrough the medium of an intermediate stage.1. In the Planets .Occult students need, in considering these points, to remember very clearly thedistinction between transmutation and the final resolution; between the processof transforming the five elements, esoterically understood, and the finalresolution of the transmuted essences into their synthesis. This has a vitalbearing upon our subject, for resolution is as yet by no means possible, and theprocess of transmutation is only just beginning in the majority of cases. Instudying these subjects we have necessarily to confine ourselves to the HeavenlyMen, for the human units—as cells in Their body—are of course included in allthat is posited about Them, and until it is known which cosmic Logos recognisesour solar Logos as a centre in His body, and which six other systems areaffiliated with ours, it will not be possible to touch upon the systemic stageof manasic development. But in connection with the Heavenly Men certain factsare possible of theoretical comprehension, even though not as yet demonstrableto the scientific mind. We will, as usual, tabulate our premises, and thus keepclearly in mind, and visualised, the points under investigation:First. It might first be said that the third aspect, combined with the second,or Brahma and Vishnu allied, go to the totality of the Divine Manasaputras. Theyare Will utilising matter, or active intelligent substance, in order todemonstrate Love-Wisdom; all this is based on purpose, and has causation as afundamental. This [403] Brahma aspect is fivefold and, with the Vishnu aspect,makes the six, or the pentagon, having Mahadeva or Will in the centre of allmanifestation.Second. This fivefold Brahma aspect or the five Kumaras, are in fullmanifestation, and, with the reflection of the other two aspects, make the sevenof our manifested system.Third. Mercury and Venus are in process of transmutation, and the manasicprinciple in both these schemes, having reached a high stage of development, isbeing transmuted into Love-Wisdom. When three fifths of the units (deva andhuman) that go to the composition of the vehicles of any planetary Logos areentering upon the Path, then the process of transmutation is entered upon. Thefaculty of MIND is then an instrument for creative use, and not the “slayer ofthe real,” and a barrier to the free life of the Spirit.Again, it must be noted that Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Vulcan are as yetdeveloping manas, and the stage achieved in each varies, and is not for exotericpublication. The Heavenly Men of these schemes have not yet succeeded inbringing Their bodies to the stage where transmutation on a large scale ispossible. They are approaching it, and when the necessary three fifths isreached, then They will begin to transmute on a larger scale. The Earth schemehas about one fifth in process of transmutation in one or other of the globes atthis time and Vulcan has very nearly two fifths.We might here point out that though we are concerned primarily with manas in thehuman cells in the body of a planetary Logos, yet we must remember that the devaunits in some schemes preponderate. Although from the standpoint of a humanbeing the devas are in no way considered as coming under the influence of manas,as we understand it, yet from another angle they are manas itself, the activecreative force, the fifth and the sixth [404] Hierarchies in full display. Weshould ponder upon the relationship (a necessarily close relationship) betweenthe fifth deva Hierarchy and the fifth logoic principle, and we should also bearin mind that—viewing the whole matter from the angle of vision of a HeavenlyMan—the devas are a corporate part of His nature, and He is a Manasaputra, acreative Builder, and the fivefold aspect of Brahma. The sumtotal of manas ispure deva essence, and it is only as union is made between this fivefold thirdaspect and the other two aspects that what we understand as MAN—whether HeavenlyMan or human—comes into being. The devas are united with these other two factorsand the result is:a . A solar Logos.b . A Heavenly Man.c . A human being.This is a great mystery and is allied to the mystery of electricity (or offohatic life) which H. P. B. (S.D., I, 107) refers to. The Messengers, theBuilders, the devas, are flaming fire, radiant electric matter, and only in timeand space, only during manifestation and only through the cycles of objectivity,is such an entity as man possible, or can a Heavenly Man come into existence.Outside a solar ring-pass-not, for instance, and as far as our evolution isconcerned, we have radiant electric substance, active, intelligent ether,ensouled by the deva evolution. (143 [text00028.html#Y_FN143] ) These [405] workblindly and under the laws of cosmic electricity. (We must differentiate withcare between cosmic electricity, and the electrical akasha of the system, whichis electrical substance confined and brought under another set of laws throughthe instrumentality of another factor, that of pure Spirit.) Outside thering-pass-not, we have that abstraction which we call pure Spirit. This “pureSpirit,” or abstract, conscious Being, through conscious karma periodicallyseeks to manifest, and wills to work out a purpose under the laws of Its Ownbeing, and is thus impelled by the attractive quality of its opposite pole,intelligent substance, to blend with it. The meeting of these two polarities,and their point of merging, causes that flash in the cosmic universe which wecall a sun, and results in light or objectivity. Within the ring-pass-not,therefore, the electric fire of pure Spirit can only manifest through merging orunion with electrical substance, and is, therefore, during evolution and for themajor portion of the process, limited by it. In fact, little as it is realised,the deva evolution controls for the greater portion of manifestation up to thebeginning of the transmutative process. They build incessantly the confiningform.When the process of transmutation is effected by the five Heavenly Men, then thewhole system is reaching a very high stage of evolution, and with the twoschemes which will be entering into the stage of obscuration, the resolvingprocess will commence. The plan, viewed largely, will be as follows:The four schemes which form the logoic Quaternary [406] will merge into theirsynthesising scheme, that of Saturn, while Venus and Mercury will merge intoUranus and Neptune. No importance need be attached to the sequence of thesenames. The dual fact is all that is necessary to grasp.Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn will, therefore, have absorbed the essence ofmanifestation and (in connection with the solar Logos) they correspond to thethree permanent atoms in the causal body of a man. We say “correspond” for theanalogy is not in detail. Uranus and Neptune are reflections of the logoicastral and mental permanent atoms. Saturn is in fact the correspondence to thelogoic physical permanent atom. This is an occult mystery and must not beseparated from its allied truth in the cosmic scheme.Viewing manas as the vibratory activity of all atoms and narrowing our conceptdown to our own scheme it is interesting to note that some correspondences canbe traced as we study this fifth principle during the present round, the fourth.The manasic principle is the basis of the coming into activity and the mentalrecognition of the following facts in nature.The fifth spirilla within the atom of matter will become active. This fifthspirilla is beginning faintly to vibrate, while the fourth spirilla in thisfourth round is assuming a vibration that will cause the intense vitalisation ofthe vehicles, and eventually bring about the shattering of the form, and thesubsequent escape of the Spirit into a form composed of matter which responds tothe vibration of the fifth spirilla.The fourth ether is coming into recognition, and along with it will come theknowledge of the lives which it embodies. Hence the success of spiritualisticendeavour, for the larger number of the average discarnate entities at thisstage who are willing to make contact with the physical plane are clothed inmatter of this ether. The devas [407] of this ether will also come to be knownbefore the end of this round, and alliance will be made between the fourthCreative Hierarchy of men, and the devas of the fourth ether.The fourth plane, the buddhic, by the aid of manas, will gradually be realised.This will be done as manas is transmuted into wisdom. By a few in this round thefifth principle will be superseded by the principle of buddhi. Right on from nowtill the middle of the next round there will be an overlapping of the four andthe five—manas and the buddhic principle—thus making the nine, or perfected man,the initiate.It might also be remarked that more and more will the control of the fourthKumara be evidenced and felt. On this I cannot enlarge, being only permitted tomake the statement.The consciousness of the mass of the human family will gradually pass on to thefourth subplane of the mental plane, and be more and more controlled by purelyconcrete mind. Unless this is paralleled by a steady influx of egos on to thebuddhic plane in conscious activity, and thus out of the control of manas pureand simple, a very serious condition will have to be handled by the Hierarchy.The work of the four Maharajahs who apportion karma within the ring-pass-notwill reach its culminating point during the fourth round. In the next round, thework of the Lipikas who handle affairs in connection with our system outside thering-pass-not will become more prominent. This is necessarily so, as the LipikaLords dispense the law to those who have merged themselves with their divineprinciple, and are no longer held by the material forms of the three worlds. TheLords of Karma, or the Maharajahs, work with the sons of men in the threeworlds, and through manasic principle. [408]2. In the System.We have now for consideration some further points on the subject of manasicdevelopment within the system and then we can proceed to discuss the future ofmanas, our final subheading.It will be apparent to all of us that the vastness of the subject and theenormous cycles of time involved tend to obscurity and lack of definiteness.Only the high lights stand out, and only broad general concepts, and theimpartation of fundamental facts (to the exclusion of detail) are in any waypossible in this treatise. Certain ideas stand out clearly against thebackground of intricate plans, against the apparent confusion caused by theoverlapping of cycles, both great and lesser, and against accumulation ofchaotic detail. This apparent chaos, and even seeming contradiction, is theresult of our imperfect evolution, the result of our entire lack of perspectiveincident upon our place in the planetary scheme, and the result of the shortnessof our vision. Broad outstanding generalisations are all that we can appreciateat our present state, and they might be summed up as three in number:Position or the place of the system within its greater whole, and the corporatenature of all manifestation. This involves the concept of:A cosmic system, involving lesser systems and holding them together by the powerof a unified life. ( 144 [text00028.html#Y_FN144] )A solar system, a portion of that greater system of manifestation, [409] equallyinvolving lesser forms of objectivity, and holding them likewise unified by thepower of its own life.A planetary scheme, or subdivision of that solar system. This likewise persistsas a unit by itself, yet has no existence apart from other units.Groups or unified bodies within the scheme. These are again individualised, yetat the same time are a part of the greater whole.Congeries or aggregations of cells, the subdivisions of groups. These must besimilarly interpreted.The cells, or the individualised units, within the groups. Each of these is aconscious entity, yet each has no existence apart from its groups.Each of these divisions is characterised by:An ensouling life, which—as far as we are concerned, emanates from the ONE ABOUTWHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID, Who ensouls the seven solar systems, down through theLord of a solar system, through the cosmic Entities we call the Heavenly Men,and the solar Entities ensouling groups and through that peculiar centralmanifestation we call a human being to the little cell within the body of thathuman being, and the atom which is the basic material whereof all forms in allthe kingdoms of nature are made.Intelligent activity, or the display of purpose or manas, the fifth principle inevery type of manifestation. This, as earlier pointed out, is the intelligentplan of the Entity concerned working out in time and space.Power to evolve or progress. This is literally the distinctive ability of theensouling life within the form to progress intelligently from lower to higherforms of manifestation. This is above all the peculiar and perfected attributeof the fifth principle.Capacity to cohere . This is the ability of all intelligent, active Lives duringevolution to conform to the Law of Attraction and Repulsion, and thus form aconscious, intelligent part of a greater life. It is literally [410] thetransmutation of manas into wisdom. Though all that IS exists in form yet littleis as yet brought under the intelligent control of the entity within the form.Only the Heavenly Men and Their superior embracing lives are consciously andintelligently working through and dominating the form, for only They, as yet,are perfected manas. Beneath them come many grades of consciousness. Man isgradually achieving that conscious control over matter in the three worlds whichhis divine Prototypes, the Heavenly Men, have already achieved. They areattaining a similar control on higher levels. Below man come many lives who areblind and unconscious of the congery or subdivision of which they form part.Thus can be seen, in general outline, the place of manas at the present stage.Relation. Another outstanding feature that is the result of our studies is thatof relation. The realisation of this in future years will lead to the study ofthe different polarities of the different spheres (from a planetary scheme to anatom) within the solar ring-pass-not, and of the relation existing between:a . A scheme and the totality of schemes.b . Scheme and scheme.c. Chain and chain.d . Globe and globe.e. Group and group.f. Subdivision and subdivision.g. Unit and unit. ( 145 [text00028.html#Y_FN145] )h. Cell and cell.The interrelation of all these factors and their profound interdependence is oneof the most important points for us to grasp; though this whole relation isgoverned by the law of Attraction and Repulsion, and [411] therefore comes moreunder what we call the second aspect, yet self consciousness itself is theresult of the manasic principle, and the close co-operation between these twofactors of mind and love-wisdom, or the two laws of Attraction and Synthesis,must ever be carefully remembered.Limitation. This is a prima factor to be borne in mind in considering a cosmos,a system, a scheme, a chain, or any form of limiting sphere down through themall to the physical atom of the scientist. It presupposes:a . Capacity beyond that manifested.b . Duality, or that which is limited and the limiting substance.c. Purpose, for in an ordered scheme of existence, the limitation persists justas long as it is required in order to attain certain ends. It is succeeded by“abstraction” occultly understood, and in its literal sense.When these three factors:Position,Relation,Limitation,are studied within the system, the close connection of all the groups within thewhole will be evidenced, and the need of each part for all other parts will bebrought out.As regards cosmic position, relation and limitation, little can be said, as e’ento the Heavenly Men Themselves the matter is obscure. That this is necessarilyso must be apparent when Their place in the scheme of things is realised andTheir relative unimportance is considered. Therefore, we can do no more thanaccept the fact of the inconceivable magnitude of that EXISTENCE which ismanifesting through seven solar systems, and the extension of this concept ofBeing to [412] embrace the entire vault of the Heavens. It is interesting tobear in mind in this connection that all that is seen, being objective forms orBeings in manifestation through certain spheres of light, may not be all thatIS, but that there may lie back of everything visible a vast realm or realms ofExistences. The very brain of man reels in contemplation of such a concept. Yetjust as there are tens of millions of human beings out of objectivemanifestation, or discarnate, on the subtler planes of the solar system, sothere may be cosmic entities, in rank equal to the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BESAID, Who are in a similar sense discarnate, and found in realms subtler thanthat of the manifestation of light.3. On the Earth.a. The five Kumaras. We might now consider briefly the subject of the fiveKumaras, Who are the sum total of manas on the Earth. I have stated that theLord of the World, the first Kumara, is the planetary Logos of our scheme inphysical incarnation, but nowhere has the impression been conveyed that thethree Kumaras, associated with Him, are three other planetary Logoi. This is inno way the case. These three, called the “Buddhas of Activity,” are but thevicegerents upon our planet of those three planetary Logoi, Who, with ourplanetary Logos, make the sum total of the logoic Quaternary. Associated withthem are the three esoteric Kumaras, mentioned in the Secret Doctrine , (I, 493)Who represent the three other Logoi, and so make focal points for all the logoicforces within our chain. In each chain such representatives are found, six focalpoints embraced by the seventh, the planetary Logos of the scheme, Who holdsthem all within His aura.[413] Their work is threefold:First . They are the centres in the body of the planetary Logos. Each chaincorresponds to one centre, and the globes are but the lesser wheels within anyparticular centre. The life of the Logos in this incarnation on the Earth isflowing through three centres and beginning to stimulate a fourth, hence fourglobes are involved and the three Kumaras (so called for lack of a better term)are vitally intelligently active; three are in abeyance and one is beginning tofunction. The globes correspond to the chains. This fourth Kumara is as yetpractically unrealised, but as hinted at earlier His day is about to dawn.Second. They act as transmitters of a particular type of force to those unitswho go to the content of any particular centre. They are, in fact, the agentsfor the Lords of the Rays to the Monads of any ray in incarnation in anyparticular chain and on any particular globe.Third. They are the agents for:a . The Lord of a Ray as stated above.b . The four Maharajahs.c . The planetary Logos of Their own scheme.d. The great Deva of the Earth planet.They work with the law; They are the cognizers of the intelligent purpose of theplanetary Logos, and know His plans; They are the vital activity of the planet,and in a subtle sense they are not only the Ray representatives but likewise thelink between the chain and the scheme.It might here be stated that the relative failure that was the fate of the Moonchain in our scheme has greatly handicapped Their work, and made it imperativefor Them to employ drastic measures in order to offset that failure. Herein liesanother clue to the world turmoil.[414] b. The Moon chain. It might be of interest here, if, before passing on toother matters, we took up the very difficult subject of the moon chain andanswer certain pertinent questions that may have arisen in the minds ofstudents.The enumeration of the chains and of the schemes as given in the two charts isentirely for the present , and covers a period comparatively recent, carryingforward the history of evolution to the middle of the next round in our chain.Had we been given the charts embracing pre-Lemurian days, and extending back adistance into the (humanly speaking) unfathomable past, we would have seen themoon chain portrayed with the Neptune chain omitted. In the chart as given twochains are apparently lacking, the moon chain and the Uranus chain. The reasonsare abstruse, but something may be hinted at as follows:The Moon chain with the Earth chain formed two units, or two polarities,negative and positive. The point of merging was reached, and the Earth chainabsorbed or synthesised the moon chain in the same sense as certain of theschemes will merge until only three will apparently be left. Therefore the Earthchain is essentially dual in its nature, being the sumtotal of a male and afemale chain. This is a mystery impossible to elucidate further, but it is dealtwith in certain occult books, and hinted at by H. P. B. (S.D., I, Section IX,176-200)In due course of time another merging in the scheme will eventuate and thenUranus (the chain of that name in our scheme) will flash into objectivity.Forget not that the schemes manifest as seven, as ten, as three from the angleof the Eternal Now, or—from the point of view of a Heavenly Man—themanifestation may be written as (3|7) In time and space the order might bestated to be 7-3-10, and at certain stages 10-7-3. As [415] the opposites mergethe ten become the seven and the three, and it is during this process thatentire chains and globes, and eventually schemes, will apparently vanish fromobjectivity, and drop out of sight. They will be simply absorbed. During thetwofold process of evolution, it might be numerically expressed as:During involution the sequence is seen as three, then seven and finally ten.During evolution the sequence is ten, then seven and finally three.The involutionary process is over practically and the evolutionary isapproximately midway through. This will be marked by the disappearance orabsorption of certain chains as they find their polar opposites, and asimultaneous appearance of the more subtle chains or globes as the manasicprinciple enables man to see them. The moon chain is in process ofdisappearance, and only a decaying body is left; the life of the second and thefirst Logos has been withdrawn from it, and only the latent life of matteritself remains. Simultaneously Neptune arose over the horizon, and took itsplace as one of the seven manifesting chains of the planetary Logos. We are heredealing with the Neptune chain of the earth scheme.The Moon chain has in itself a curious occult history, not yet to be disclosed.This differentiates it from the other chains in the scheme and even from anyother chain in any scheme. An analogous situation or correspondence will befound in another planetary scheme within the solar system. All this is hidden inthe history of one of the solar systems which is united to ours within a cosmicring-pass-not. Hence the impossibility of yet enlarging upon it. Each HeavenlyMan of a scheme is a focal point for the force and power and vibratory life ofseven stupendous ENTITIES in exactly the same sense [416] as the seven centresin a human being are the focal points for the influence of a correspondingheavenly Prototype. Our Heavenly Man, therefore, is esoterically allied to oneof the seven solar systems, and in this mysterious alliance is hidden themystery of the moon chain.Certain brief hints may be given for the due consideration of students:The Moon chain was a chain wherein a systemic failure was to be seen.It is connected with the lower principles, which H.P.B. has stated are nowsuperseded.The sexual misery of this planet finds its origin in the moon failure.The progress of evolution on the moon was abruptly disturbed and arrested by thetimely interference of the solar Logos. The secret of the suffering in the Earthchain, which makes it merit the name of the Sphere of Suffering, and the mysteryof the long and painful watch kept by the SILENT WATCHER, ( 148[text00028.html#Y_FN148] ) has its origin in the events which brought the moonchain to a terrific culmination. Conditions of agony and of distress such as arefound on our planet are found in no such degree in any other scheme. [417]The misuse of the vibratory power of a certain centre, and the perversion, ordistortion of force to certain erroneous ends, not along the line of evolution,account for much of the moon mystery.Certain results, such as the finding of its polar opposite, were hastened undulyon the moon chain, and the consequence was an uneven development and aretardation of the evolution of a certain number of deva and human groups.The origin of the feud between the Lords of the Dark Face and the Brotherhood ofLight, which found scope for activity in Atlantean days, and during the presentroot race, can be traced back to the moon chain.We have here all that it is possible to give out at this time, and much that hashitherto not been permitted publication. It is necessary again to emphasise theneed of attaching no importance to the names of the chains and globes, and thenecessity of a numerical enumeration; at the same time should the student decideto number the chains, and globes, he must carefully bear in mind that thesequence of numbers has no reference or relation to place or time, nor tosequence of appearance, or order of manifestation.IV. THE FUTURE OF MANASIt is only intended to handle this immense subject primarily in its relation toMAN, leaving the student to work out for himself much of what might be said, andto expand the concept from the unit to the group, and from the group to thetotality of groups within the solar system. We will only touch upon thedevelopment of the mind in man and hint at some probable developments; we shallendeavour to show that manas, as it evolves, leads to certain distinctcharacteristics, which [418] distinguish it from other developments which may beseen. The subject therefore will be discussed under the following subheadings:1. The characteristics of manas.2. Probable developments of the human mind.3. Manas in the final rounds.In studying all these points the emphasis is, of course, to be laid upon thefuture, and I enlarge not upon that which is already developed.1. Characteristics of manas.The main characteristics of manas might be summed up under three heads:a. Discrimination.b. Ordered activity.c. Adaptability.Let us study these a little and note wherein in days and cycles to come theywill be seen working out.a. Discrimination. This is necessarily almost the statement of a platitude. Allstudents recognise the discriminative quality of manas and its selectivecapacity; all recognise the faculty in man which enables him to distinguishintelligently between the Self and the Not-Self. What we are apt to forget isthat this faculty persists on all planes, and is threefold in manifestation:First. Discrimination between the I-consciousness, and that which is cognised inthe external world. This is the ability to distinguish between oneself and allother forms extant. It is universally developed and has reached a fairly highstage of evolution.Second. Discrimination between the Ego and the Personality. This narrows theconcept down to the sphere of a man’s own consciousness, and enables him todifferentiate between his subjective self or soul, and the bodies which holdthat soul enshrined. This is not [419] by any means so universally developed.Most men do not as yet distinguish with accuracy between themselves as theTHINKER, persistent in time and space, and the vehicle through which they think,which is ephemeral and transient. The real recognition of this essentialduality, and the scientific appreciation of it is to be seen in the mystics, theadvanced thinkers of the race, the conscious aspirants, and those nearing thePortal of Initiation.Third . Discrimination between soul and Spirit, or the realisation by the manthat not only can he say, “I am” ; not only can he realise that “I am That” ;but that he can advance to a still further realisation, and say, “I am That Iam.”In all these expansions and appreciations the discriminative faculty of manas isutilised.Therefore, we can see for ourselves the future development, and whereto it willlead mankind. Man now knows himself as a separated unit of consciousness; he NOWdistinguishes between himself and all other materialised selves; he now realiseshimself as distinct from every other functioning sphere of matter from thematerialised Logos to the cell in his own physical body, and the cell in allbodies on the physical plane. This separative instinct, this distinguishingself-centredness has been the nursery wherein the infant, man, has segregatedhimself until he is of full strength, and able to take his share in the work ofhis group. Only the voluntary merging of interest and of aim is of value, andonly that is seen in man as he nears the final part of the path of evolution. Itis incident upon an earlier stage of intense self-assertion and intenseself-realisation. This stage is with us now; it marks all manifestation, and isthe basis of the preservation of identity. It distinguishes: [420]The Logos and all forms within His body.The planetary Logoi and all forms within Their bodies.Man and all forms within his body.That which must be emphasised is the little realised concept that this assertionof “I am” distinguishes not only man, but is the mantric word which preservesthe integrity of all groups likewise. When man can say “I am That” he isbeginning to sense his oneness with his group. When groups make a similarassertion they are beginning to realise their identity with all other groups.When a planetary Logos echoes the words “I am That” He is approaching the hourof synthesis, or of absorption. When a solar Logos utters the words, a year ofBrahma will be drawing to a close, and the hour of conscious merging with Hisgreater group will be approaching. Broadly (in relation to man) it might bestated that:“I am” refers to the personality consciousness on three lower planes, or to allthat is considered as inferior to the causal body. It concerns a man’srealisation of his place upon the globe within a chain.“I am That” refers to his egoic consciousness, and to the planes of the Triad.It concerns a man’s realisation of his place within the chain , and hisrelationship to the group of which he forms a part.“I am That I am” refers to a man’s monadic consciousness, and his relationshipto the planes of abstraction. It concerns his realisation of his position in thescheme .When the initiate can say “I am That I am,” then he has merged himself with hisdivine essence, and is freed from form. The first occult assertion marks hisemancipation from the three lower kingdoms, and his conscious [421] functioningin the three worlds. This occurred at individualisation through theinstrumentality of manas. The second occult assertion marks the gradualemancipation of man from the lower three kingdoms, and his complete freeing fromlower form domination at the fifth initiation. At the final assertion, theinitiate not only distinguishes between the Self, and all other forms ofmanifestation; he not only distinguishes between his own identity and the soul,as well as matter in form, but he can discriminate between the three—Spirit,Soul, and Matter—and with this realisation he is entirely liberated frommanifestation for this greater cycle. This inherent discriminative faculty ofmanas, displayed on ever higher spirals leads a manInto matter and form,Through all forms of matter on all planes andFinally brings about his eventual abstraction from all forms and matter, plusthe aggregate of transmuted knowledge which the evolutionary process hasprocured for him.b. Ordered activity. Here comes in the concept of intelligent purpose, pursuinga fixed and settled plan, and working out a preconceived ideal in time andspace. The Microcosm comes into incarnation through impulse based on intelligentpurpose originating in his case on the mental plane—the plane of the manasicprinciple. An interesting point might here be indicated. The fifth plane, themental, may be considered on a large scale as holding, in the case of a HeavenlyMan, a position symbolically analogous to that held by the causal bodies of theunits on His Ray. Some causal bodies are on the third and some on the secondsubplanes, and the intricacy is excessive and various, producing geometricalforms allied somewhat to those portrayed upon the charts. All is orderedactivity of the units (each pursuing [422] his own self-centred purpose andfollowing the inclination of the lower self, whose slogan is “I am”). This willgradually give place to the ordered activity of the groups in which the unitsrecognise the oneness of their self-interest, and therefore intelligently,actively, and with conscious purpose work for the good of the body corporate.The vibration which occultly accompanies the sounding of the words “I am That”by the units on the physical plane is only very faintly beginning to make itselffelt. Units here and there are sounding it forth by their lives, and are thuspassing on the vibration, and setting it in motion against the cruder, coarserone of “I am.”The time for the sounding of the final mantric phrase by ordered active groupslies ahead in the sixth and seventh rounds, and will not reach its fullvibration in this solar system at all. “I am That” will peal forth fullyconsummated in this system of duality, for the third initiation sees theinitiate comprehending its mantric force. Nevertheless, initiates of the sixthand seventh Initiations will not preponderate in this system. After the fifthround and the passing into temporary obscuration of two fifths of the humanfamily, the remaining units will achieve an approximate standing as follows:One fifth will mantrically sound the words “I am That I am. “Two fifths will achieve the fifth Initiation and will know themselves as “I amThat.” They will also be cultivating response to the higher note.One fifth and a half will attain the third Initiation, and will know themselvesas “I am That” in full consciousness.The remaining units will be those who are treading the Path, and beginning toknow themselves as the group.[423] In reference to what has been said anent the second characteristic ofmanas, a very interesting development may be looked for during the comingcentury. This is the intensification of business organisation, and the bringing(under law and order), of the entire life of:Families and groups of families,Cities and groups of cities,Nations and groups of nations,until the human race in every department of its exoteric life will conform torule,—this voluntarily, and with manasic realisation of group need. The wholetrend of mental effort during the next subraces will be towards the synthesis ofendeavour, thus ensuring the good of the corporate body involved. Manyinteresting events will occur and many experiments will necessarily be made(some to prove successful and some failures), before manas, or purposeful,ordered, intelligent activity, will control in the life of the peoples of thisworld. It is not possible to enter into this in greater detail, as the subjectis too vast.Let us now take the third attribute of manas and its future demonstration.c. Adaptability. This is, as we know, the prime attribute ascribed to the thirdRay, or the Brahma aspect. Therefore, fundamentally it may be considered as theattribute of intelligence which adapts the matter aspect to the Spirit aspect,and is a characteristic inherent in matter itself. It works under the two lawsof Economy, and of Attraction and Repulsion; the work of the Mahachohan beingprimarily along this line. Consequently the four lesser Rays of Attribute whichare synthesised into the third Ray of Aspect, Adaptability, or ActiveIntelligence, are fundamentally concerned, and the future of manas is thereforeinvolved in the growing influence of these four Rays: [424]1. Harmony, Beauty, Art or Unity.2. Concrete Science or Knowledge.3. Abstract Idealism.4. Ceremonial Magic.2. Development of the Human Mind.When the future results brought about by the four types of force mentioned aboveare somewhat realised, and their relationship to the adaptation of matter toSpirit (through the building into form), is studied, much of profoundsignificance will be sensed by the student. In the foretelling of mentaldevelopments along these four lines and the prophesying of definite achievement,indications may be given of the path which concrete science may follow. Let us,therefore, take these four types of force, or these four planetary influences,and study them separately, bearing ever in mind that:a . Each of them has swung into power during earlier world cycles.b. One of them, being the influence of our own planetary Logos, is ever presentwith us, and is the major influence or vibration on the planet.c. Certain of them are passing out of power at this present time, and others arecoming in.d. During the remainder of this round and the entire fifth round these four raysof attribute will circulate into and out of power ceaselessly; towards the endof the fifth round the third Ray of Aspect will predominate, having begun itswork of synthesising and its influence will be paralleled in the sixth round bythe gradually growing power of the second Ray of Aspect,—the two types ofinfluence overlapping. In the seventh round, the power of the second Ray willpredominate and the influence of the third will weaken. The first Ray will makeitself felt. The first Ray, that of [425] Mahadeva ( 149[text00028.html#Y_FN149] ) or the Destroyer, will set its second great impulseupon our planetary evolution by the obscuration of two fifths of the humanfamily. The impress to be set by the first Ray upon our human family on thisglobe might be considered as threefold:First. At human individualisation in the middle of the third rootrace. This wasproduced by a vast destruction of the forms we call animal-man. This point hasseldom been brought out in teaching. The advent of the Lords of the Flame, theelectrical storm which ushered in the period of man, was distinguished bydisaster, chaos, and the destruction of many in the third kingdom of nature. Thespark of mind was implanted and the strength of its vibration, and the immediateeffect of its presence caused the death of the animal form, thus producing theimmediate possibility of the newly vitalised causal bodies vibrating to suchpurpose that new physical vehicles were taken. That was the Will aspectmanifesting in the fourth round in connection with the human family.Second. In the fifth round, at the so-called Judgment. This will bring about theapparent destruction of two-fifths of the human family, and the translation ofthe indwelling units of consciousness to other spheres, more [426] suited totheir stage of evolution. This event will be regarded at the time as acatastrophe, but the Knowers will see and know, and three fifths of the humanfamily will understand the reason.Third. At the final reabsorption of the perfected monads into their emanatingsource in the seventh round. This will be marked by obscuration and thedestruction of the form. Suffering will be practically nil, as the human unitsinvolved will have reached a stage where they can consciously co-operate in theprocess of abstraction. It is evident therefore that as regards the human family(the manasaputras in incarnation), the fourth, fifth, and seventh rounds holdhid the key to the first aspect. For the devas it is the first, second andsixth. For the involutionary entity, whom we call the “spirit of the planet” itis simply the third.The third Ray holds sway all the time, for the second Ray only came into powerin the second round. It holds sway simultaneously with the second Ray until theend of the age, when it begins gradually to obscure as the first Ray swings intoinfluence again. Remember, nevertheless, that all three are at all timespresent. It is simply a question of degree and of cyclic evolution.We might now take the four minor Rays, which, with the third, make the sumtotalof manas, and see wherein their influence may be expected. The subject is sostupendous that we cannot possibly do more than touch upon certain points, norcan we enlarge along the line of the mechanistic development of forms to utilisethe force. This is all hidden in the science of electricity, and as exotericscience discovers how:To utilise the power in the air, or to reduce electrical phenomena to the usesof man;To build forms, and create machines to contain and distribute the electricalforces of the atmosphere; [427]To harness the activity of matter, and to drive it towards certain ends;To employ the electrical force in the air to vitalise, rebuild, and heal thephysical body;then the phenomena of the Rays, working in cycles, will be comprehended, andvast opportunities will be seized by man to bring about specific ends duringspecific cycles.a. Ray effects. The Ray of Harmony, Beauty and Art, or the second manasic aspect(adaptability being the third) will work out in the following ways:In the development of the intuition by the means of the knowledge of soundvibration, and the higher mathematics. This is being already touched uponexoterically.Music, as a means to be employed in building and destroying, will be recognised,and the laws of levitation and of rhythmic movement in all forms, from an atomto a solar system, will be studied. The manipulation of matter of all kinds bythe means of sound will be practised on the two lower planes, and when thesynthesis of the four rays into the third is in process of accomplishment, thena similar knowledge will be displayed on the mental plane.The laws of fire will be gradually permitted exoteric publication; there aretwenty-seven occult laws which are only revealed after initiation at this stageof evolution. In them are summed up the basic laws of color and of music andrhythm. When music produces warmth or stimulation, and when pictures, forinstance, glow or reveal the subjective within the objective, then will thisfourth Ray of Harmony be coming to fruition.Let us keep the numbering of the Rays clearly in mind.The numbers preceding the names have to do with the sevenfold manifestation, andthe numbers succeeding the names concern the fivefold manifestation of Brahma.[428]1. Will or Power. Rays of Aspect: 2. Love or Wisdom. 3. Adaptability or activeintelligence 1. 4. Harmony, Beauty or Art 2. 5. Concrete Knowledge or Science 3.Rays of Attribute: 6. Abstract Idealism 4. 7. Ceremonial Magic 5.We must now continue with our consideration of the four types of force,emanating from certain great Entities, and the future results that may beexpected from their effect upon man, remembering ever that these four influences(with their synthesis, the third Ray of Aspect) sum up, in themselves, the fifthlogoic principle of manas. They are, literally, the radiatory effects of theDivine Manasaputras. We are concerned primarily with the results to be broughtabout in the units in Their bodies.The coming into power of this fourth Ray at any time (and such an advent may belooked for towards the close of this lesser cycle, which ended in 1924) willproduce a corresponding activity in connection with the fourth subplane in eachplane, beginning with the fourth physical ether; this will result in thefollowing effects:First, physical plane scientists will be able to speak with authority anent thefourth ether, even though they may not recognise it as the lowest of the fouretheric grades of substance: its sphere of influence and its utilisation will becomprehended, and “force” as a factor in matter, or the electrical manifestationof energy within definite limits, will be as well understood as is hydrogen atthis time. Indications of this can already be seen in the discovery of radium,and the study of radioactive substances and of electronic demonstration. Thisknowledge will revolutionise the life of man; it will put into his hands thatwhich occultists call “power of the fourth order” (on the physical plane). Itwill enable him to [429] utilise electrical energy for the regulation of hiseveryday life in a way as yet incomprehensible; it will produce new methods ofilluminating, and of heating the world at a small cost and with practically noinitial outlay. The fact of the existence of the etheric body will beestablished, and the healing of the dense physical body, via the etheric body,by force utilisation and solar radiation, will take the place of the presentmethods. Healing will then fall practically into two departments:1. Vitalisation, by means of:a. Electricity.b . Solar and planetary radiation.2. Definite curative processes, through the occult knowledge of:a. The force centres.b . The work of the devas of the fourth ether.Transportation on sea and land will be largely superseded by the utilisation ofair routes and the transit of large bodies through the air, by means of theinstantaneous use of the force or energy inherent in the ether itself, will takethe place of the present methods.Religious students will study the side of manifestation we call the “life side”just as the scientist studies that called “matter,” and both will come to arealisation of the close relation existing between the two, and thus the old gapand the ancient warfare between science and religion will be in temporaryabeyance. Definite methods of demonstrating the fact that life persists afterthe death of the physical body will be followed, and the etheric web will berecognised as a factor in the case. The connection between the different planeswill be sought, and the analogy between the fourth etheric subplane and thefourth or buddhic plane (the fourth cosmic ether) will be studied, for it willbe realised that the life of those Entities, Whom we recognise as the planetaryLogoi, pours [430] through our scheme from the fourth cosmic plane, the cosmicbuddhic, and thus in a very special sense through all lesser correspondences.The alignment will be as follows:a. The fourth cosmic plane, the cosmic buddhic.b. The fourth cosmic ether, the fourth plane of the system, the buddhic.c. The fourth etheric subplane of our physical plane.There is thus a line of least resistance from the planes of the cosmos,producing a special activity in connection with the Heavenly Men, demonstratingon Their Own plane, and sequentially in connection with the units in Theirbodies on lower levels. Lines of force, extending from our schemeextra-systemically, will be a recognised fact, and will be interpreted byscientists in terms of electrical phenomena, and by the religious man in termsof life,—the life force of certain Entities.Philosophic students will endeavour simultaneously to link these two schools ofthought, and to demonstrate the factor of the intelligent adaptation of theelectrical phenomena which we call matter,—of that energised active material wecall substance,—to the life purpose of a cosmic Being. In these three lines ofthought, therefore,—scientific, religious, and philosophic,—we have thebeginning of the conscious building, or construction of the antaskarana of thatgroup which we call the fifth rootrace.On the fourth subplane of the astral plane, a similar activity will be noted asin process. The inflowing force will cause an astral stimulation in the bodiesof many of the human family who are still on that subplane, and will bring aboutan awakening of the desire for harmony in a new manner. This will work outrelatively well in the sixth subrace. It should be remembered that numbers ofthe old Atlanteans (fourth rootrace men) will respond to [431] the stimulationand will find their way into incarnation at that time, for the four and the sixare always closely allied. We have another suggestive analogy in the fact thatthe devas of the fourth ether will be soon swinging into recognised utility andthat in the sixth subrace the deva evolution will be exceedingly prominent. Thefourth plane is the plane of at-one-ment for certain deva and human units, andcertain groups (the fourth Creative Hierarchy and the sixth Deva Hierarchy) havea pronounced karma to work out together. One can now see the supreme importanceof the human Hierarchy, the fourth in this sequence of planes and ideas.Second Cosmic Plane Seven Cosmic Logoi. Fourth Cosmic Plane Seven Rishis of theGreat Bear. Second Solar Plane Seven Heavenly Men. Fourth Solar Plane Sevencentres of the seven Heavenly Men in the fourth cosmic ether. Fourth subplane ofthe solar physical Seven centres of the human unit in ether of the fourth order.The beauty of the interlocking system will be apparent, even though it may notbe so immediately understandable wherein lies the relation between thesecomplexities of entities. We must ever remember that we are considering theforce or life-energy of these entities as it pours into, and works throughdefinite, material, substantial forms.On the fourth subplane of the mental plane there will be, in the immediatefuture, a period of intensified evolution for the units of the fifth rootrace,prior to their passing out of and into another race, globe, chain, or scheme. Wehave on the fourth subplane of the fifth plane the centre of interest for thepresent race and the day of its opportunity. Here can be seen the awakening ofthe higher consciousness, and the first ripple of perception of, and vibratoryresponse to, the causal body. In this [432] connection, we must ever rememberthat the periphery of the causal body encloses the permanent atoms. It is theplane of testing, of the major initiations of the Threshold; it is thebattleground in man, and from this plane he must secure the right to enter thePath, and procure that control over his lower bodies which will make him amaster, and not a slave.Thus one could progress the idea and fill many books with suggestions as to thatwhich may be expected during the next few centuries but it does not serve anyuseful purpose to enlarge further. I might, in summing up these ideas, point outthat the immediate future achievement consists in the utilisation of force andof electrical energy for the more harmonious adjustment of the life of man.One or two more suggestions might be made anent the influence of this fourth Rayof mind, and primarily it might be pointed out that more time has been given tothe consideration of this Ray than will be possible with most of the others onaccount of its holding a place of such importance in this fourth chain of theearth scheme, and on the fourth globe, our earthly planet. Each planetary Logospours forth His influence in different rounds, planes, chains, globes, races,and subraces according to their numerical relationship to the scheme of which Heis the vitalising Life. Temporarily, and as the cycle progresses, these formsbecome receptive and negative, and are thus responsive to the positive influenceof the planetary Logos.One further point I would make, and as it is of an esoteric and occult nature,it can be but hinted at. At the fourth Initiation, the force of the Logos of thefourth Ray is a vital factor in the initiation. It is through the application ofthe Rod of Initiation that His Life energy is applied to the initiate, or theelectrical force that emanates from Him is geometrically circulated throughcertain [433] centres, producing the necessitated stimulation. At the fifthInitiation similarly the force of the third Logos may be felt, and at the sixththat of the second Logos, while at the seventh the dynamic fire of the firstLogos circulates through the body of the Chohan.It might be tabulated thus:1. The magical force of the seventh Logos is felt at the first Initiation.2. The aggressive fire of the sixth Logos is felt at the second Initiation.3. The illuminating light of the fifth Logos is felt at the third Initiation.4. The harmonising life of the fourth Logos is felt at the fourth Initiation.5. The blending power of the third Logos is felt at the fifth Initiation.6. The unifying heat of the second Logos is felt at the sixth Initiation.7. The dynamic electricity of the first Logos is felt at the seventh Initiation.Let us now pass on to the brief consideration of the future influence of thethird manasic ray of “Concrete Knowledge or Science.” As I have elsewherepointed out this ray concerns itself with the building of form, with theutilisation of matter, with the embodying of ideas, or of entities, whethercosmic, systemic, lunar, or subhuman. The planetary Logos of this fifth systemicRay holds a peculiar position in the scheme of things. He is the embodiment ofthe fifth logoic principle of manas. His is the synthesising scheme for the fiveschemes of the five Kumaras Who are Brahma, when viewed as the sum total of thethird logoic aspect, though He is not the synthesising factor for the sevenschemes which are the sum total of logoic manifestation considered as the unionof the second and third aspects. This is a point of prime importance to bear inmind. His is the influence that leads to the scientific adaptation of matter toform, [434] and His is the life that unifies ever the three and the five. Let ussee if, by illustration, we can make this idea more simple. He is, as we know,the embodiment of the fifth principle. His influence, therefore, may ever befelt in His numerical correspondences, for He is the Lord of the fifth Ray inthe system, and Ruler of the third Manasic Ray when considering only the thirdaspect. At individualisation, or at the coming into incarnation of theself-conscious units, the fifth principle linked the higher three and the lowerfour. This took place in the third rootrace and produced a form wherein dweltSpirit on the third subplane of the fifth plane. All these analogies will bearpondering upon and the numerical relationship is not by chance. His was thepower that acted via certain schemes, chains, and globes, and produced resultsin the cells and groups of cells in the body of our particular planetary Logos.This is given by way of elucidation, and by way of indicating the relativeimportance of the influence of a planetary Logos upon another planetary Logosduring different stages of evolution.This influence has waxed and waned since that time, dying down during the fourthrootrace, and waxing steadily greater during this fifth or Aryan. The planetaryLogos Whose influence it is has not yet reached the zenith of His power, in thisrace. For a period immediately ahead His electrical energising force will pouron to our planet, and will bring about fresh discoveries anent matter and form,and fresh revelations concerning energy in matter.During the coming subraces His cycle will begin to pass out, and the influenceof His Brother, the fourth Logos of Harmony, will reach its zenith for thisround. During the fifth round the power or electrical radiation of the fifthLogos will again be strongly felt, for it is His round, and just as He waslargely responsible for the manasic stimulation of animal man in the thirdrootrace, so in [435] the fifth round will he be instrumental in causing thatgreat separation which we call the “Judgment.” Remember in this connection thatthese Logoi—when pouring Their influence through a scheme or otherseptenary—work through Their numerical correspondence in the chains and globes.In the fifth round, for instance, the fifth chain (a centre in the body of theHeavenly Man) will be the recipient of this fifth type of force and willtransmit and circulate it to the other chains via their fifth globe. Until therace has further evolved the mystery lies securely hid, and the inability of manto find out the enumeration of the schemes, chains, and globes, or to discoverwhether they are counted from within outwards, or vice versa, conceals thatwhich must be hid.The influence of this fifth Logos will be felt very considerably now on thefifth subplane of all the planes, specially in the three worlds of humanendeavour, and as we are here dealing with man we can count from what iserroneously termed “the bottom up.” Therefore, the mental unit of men in thisfifth subrace will receive increased stimulation, enabling man to vibrate on thefifth subplane which literally is the third subplane on the abstract level ofthe mental plane, on which the causal body is found. The fifth spirilla will,consequently, become active and the electrical force, or the fohatic current,will pour through it, and enable those men who are at the right stage to utilisethis force in order to take the first initiation.As this fifth influence becomes more and more felt, its effects will be seen onthe astral plane in an intelligent conscious control which will be based not somuch on the desire for harmony as on a desire for a scientific, intelligentmanipulation of astral matter. When this is the case, the higher psychism willbegin to make itself felt. On the physical plane a great deal of interestingelectrical phenomena will be seen, and the opportunity of the [436] Manu toseparate races, to segregate types, and to submerge and detach continents willbe great. This is the ray of separative force, and its place, as a factor in theerection and destruction of forms, is very interesting.It may be asked wherein this can all be interpreted in terms of fire, and thusthe integrity of the thought-form of this book be preserved. Whenever the wordsinfluence, radiation, or the power of a ray, are used, we are dealinginferentially with electrical phenomena, or with energy of some kind. Thisenergy, or electrical manifestation, this “mystery of electricity” to which H.P. B. refers, (S.D., I, 107) is the foundation of all manifestations, and liesback of all evolution. It produces light in ever-growing brilliancy; it buildsand moulds the form to the need of the indwelling Entity; it brings aboutcoherence and group activity; it is the warmth that causes all growth, and thatfosters not only the manifestations of the vegetable and animal kingdoms butinduces interaction between the human units, and lies behind all humanrelationships. It is magnetism, radiation, attraction and repulsion, life,death, and all things; it is conscious purpose and essential will in objectivemanifestation, and he who has solved what lies back of electrical phenomena hassolved not only the secret of his own Being, but knows his place within hisgreater sphere, a planetary Logos, is conscious of the Identity of that cosmicExistence we call a solar Logos, and realises somewhat the place of our systemand its electrical relationship with the seven constellations.We have now to deal with the influence of a force that is waning and passing outof dominance, that of the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism. It will not bepossible to predicate much anent it, beyond pointing out certain general ideaswhich may be of value in the contemplation of Ray cycles in general.[437] These Ray influences work through their focal points in all cases(macrocosmic and microcosmic) and these are the etheric centres. The centres, inthe case of all Beings, are ever seven in number, and are composed of deva andhuman units in group activity, or of force vortices which contain in latency,and hold in ordered activity, cells with the potentiality of humanmanifestation. Forget not the occult truism that all forms of existence pass atone stage of their career through the human kingdom.Cosmic, or extra-systemic rays, impinge upon or circulate via centres found onthe second cosmic ether, but which, at the present stage of objectivity, becomesystemically visible in the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic.One permanent cosmic Ray is the ray of our Logos Himself, and the subrays ofthis ray permeate His entire system. Six other cosmic Rays, animating othersystems, influence ours, finding their reflections in the subrays of our logoicRay. To these six cosmic influences our Heavenly Men respond. They absorb theinfluence, being centres in the body logoic, pass it through Their schemes,circulate it through Their own centres (chains), and transmit it on to otherschemes, coloring it with Their Own peculiar shade and qualifying it by Theirown peculiar tone or note. The whole system of ray influence, or radiatorywarmth, considered both physically and psychically, is one of an intricatecirculation and interaction. The radiation or vibration passes in ordered cyclesfrom its originating source, the One Ray, or systemic Logos, to the differentcentres in His body. Viewed from the physical standpoint this ray force is theenergising factor in matter. Viewed from the psychical point of view it is thequalitative faculty. From scheme to scheme, from chain to chain, and from globeto globe, this force or quality passes and circulates, both adding, and at thesame time abstracting, and returns to its focal point with two noticeabledifferences: [438]a. The radiatory heat is intensified.b. The qualitative character or colour is increased.The effect on the form side is equally noticeable, and the warmth or quality ofa Ray not only affects the psyche of a man, a planetary Logos, and a solarLogos, but has a definite effect on material substance itself.Ray influences work equally on the deva and human Hierarchies, as they functionin a planetary or logoic body. Clarity of thought might eventuate if we everbear in mind that all forms are dual, both in evolution and in essential nature.They are the product of the work of the Builders (deva forces) and of activeintelligence (the human units) and the two are indivisible in the DivineHermaphrodite, or Heavenly Man. They are stimulated in both aspects of theirBeing by the ray influence.Let us now tabulate these ideas somewhat:Entity Force Centres Psychical Manifestation Physical Manifestation 1. SolarLogos Heavenly Men . Deva Builders A solar system They energise and are activelife They work in matter and hold the life. 2. Planetary Logos Human group unitsDeva Builders A Scheme. 3. A Man Seven etheric centres Elemental buildersBodies.Each of these divisions can be studied separately and in due course of time(when it may be safe to transmit information more freely anent the devas) itwill be seen that a deva Lord of a plane, for instance, works through forcecentres, manifests objectively through the colour which is His psychicaldisplay, and ensouls the matter of [439] a plane just as a Heavenly Man ensoulsHis scheme. The idea can be extended likewise to chains, globes, races, androunds. Duality always will be seen,—human and deva manifestation forming thesumtotal, and always will energy and quality progress in parallel lines.As the ray influence passes away from a race or a planet, a scheme or a solarsystem, it must not be supposed that it is completely abrogated; it has simplypassed beyond the periphery of whatever ring-pass-not it was energising, and theforce of its influence is being focussed elsewhere. The original recipientbecomes a channel, or transmitting agent, and not so much an absorber orcontainer. Words again are handicapping us, and proving their inadequacy toexpress an idea. What the student should recognise is that during a cycle of rayinfluence, the object of its immediate attention receives and absorbs it, andtransmutes it according to its need, and not so much therefore is available fortransmission. When the cycle is drawing to a close more and more of the rayinfluence or magnetism will be felt elsewhere, until practically all of it willbe passed on unabsorbed.This is what is beginning to happen in relation to this sixth Ray of Devotion.Egos who are on that particular Ray will take form elsewhere on other globes,and in other chains, and not so much on our planet. The vibrations of that Raywill quiet down as far as we are concerned, and find increased activityelsewhere. To phrase it otherwise, our planet and all thereon will becomepositive and non-receptive, and will temporarily repulse this particular type offorce. A psychical manifestation of this can be seen in the dying down of whatis called Christian enthusiasm. This Ray, on which the Chohan Jesus may befound, will no longer pour its force to the same extent into the form He built,and it will necessarily slowly but surely disintegrate, having served itspurpose [440] for close on two thousand years. Later again the same force willbe felt returning, and a new form will be found slowly coming into being, butalong more adequate lines.It will consequently be apparent how the knowledge of these cycles, and of theforce manifestation or obscuration of a Ray will eventually lead to a workingwith the Law, and to an intelligent co-operation with the plan of evolution. Itmight here be stated that the seven Kumaras (the four exoteric and the threeesoteric) cooperate with this Law, and work exoterically, or esotericallyaccording to the Ray in power, with the exception of the first Kumara, the Logosof our scheme, Who—being the synthesizing point for all—remains ever inobjective activity.It is this Ray activity which governs the obscuration or manifestation of asystem, and a scheme with all that is included in these manifestations. Hencethe emphasis laid in all occult books on the study of cycles, and on thedifferentiation of the one hundred years of Brahma into its component parts. Inthis knowledge lies hid the mystery of Being itself, of electrical force, and offohatic synthesis.I will make no more comments on the future effects of the Ray which is passinginto temporary obscuration as far as we are concerned. We shall later take up atgreater length than has been possible with the other Rays, the subject of theseventh type of force now coming into power, and which is therefore a vitalfactor in the immediate evolution of man.The fifth principle of manas is at this time beginning to demonstrate mainlythrough the seventh type of force (or the fifth when considering only the Brahmaaspect of manifestation). It will be immediately apparent, therefore, that thisincoming Ray is peculiarly situated at this time, and that its influence will bemanifested under very favorable conditions. It is pouring its force out upon the[441] seventh plane, the physical, during the fifth rootrace and the fifthsubrace, and consequently the opportunity is great. In all that has been saidanent the Rays it will be apparent that from the present standpoint two areparamountly concerned with the evolution of man: the fourth Ray of Harmony,which is the dominant ray of the greater cycle which includes the fourth roundand globe, and the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Magic , which is one of theforemost influences concerned in all objective manifestations. These two Rays,or the force of these two planetary Logoi, are largely instrumental in bringingabout coherency in our chain, the fourth of the fourth scheme, and on ourphysical globe, the Earth. The fourth and the seventh interact, one actingtemporarily as a negative force and the other as a positive.The fifth Kumara, the Lord of the seventh Ray (for it is necessary to keep inmind His dual position as one of the points of the five-pointed Star of Brahma,and as one of the Triangles in the sevenfold logoic body) has a unique positionas the “Ruler of the Building Devas” of the physical plane, the devas of theethers, in cooperation with their Deva Lord. He guides and directs theproduction of the form by means of certain occult words. He works, therefore,through the etheric body of all forms and it is through His inflowing force thatwe may look for that increased stimulation of the matter of the etheric brainwhich will make the physical brain receptive to the higher revealing truth, andwill put into the hands of scientists the secrets of the fourth and thirdethers. The development of the matter of the brain parallels the stage ofdevelopment of its atomic correspondence, and in the vitalisation of the fifthspirilla and the consequent reflex action of the seventh, we may look to see themind of man assume proportions, and attain achievement, as yet unthought andundreamt.[442] We might consider the effect of this incoming force along three lines:First. The type of force, or the logoic quality, with its function and aim.Second. Its work in relation to:a. The animal kingdom.b. The human kingdom.c. The deva kingdom.Third. The results to be looked for during the coming centuries.The type of force, or the nature of the Heavenly Man of the seventh Ray, isfundamentally constructive. It will be necessary here to touch somewhat upon Hischaracter and His place in the logoic scheme, calling attention to the need ofrefraining from personalisation and externalisation. The Heavenly Man of thescheme in which the Ray of Ceremonial Magic is embodied is one of the maintransmitters of radiation from the Sun to the system and has a close connectionwith logoic kundalini. Herein lies a hint. The Raja-Lord of the etheric levelsof the physical plane works in close alliance with Him and this will be apparentif we bear in mind that the Lord of a plane is its embodied activity. He is theenergising force that expresses itself as a unified Identity in the matter of aplane, and we might therefore get some idea of the coherency of Their mutualwork if we bear in mind thatThe Raja-Lord of a plane is the sum total of the substance of that plane.The planetary Logos Who is most closely connected with any particular plane isits quality and colouring.By the united action and work of these two Entities all is accomplished,—theLord of the Builders constructing [443] the forms which the Lord of Lifeutilises to develop consciousness within.The force or vibration of any Ray might be summed up as:a. The intelligent purpose of an Entity, a planetary Logos.b. His life energy working in, through, and upon His body of manifestation.c. His magnetic radiation as it affects (though in lesser degree) His Brothersin manifestation.d. His peculiar colouring or quality, His main psychological aspect,demonstrating through His own activities within His own scheme.e. The effect of the same as it influences His Brothers within the bodycorporate of the solar Logos.f. His life force as it radiates beyond His own periphery as active energy andstimulating activity—being literally one of the aspects of Fohat. The activityaspect of a Heavenly Man is as much an aspect of Fohat as Brahma is the sumtotalof Fohat. The Heavenly Men are, by virtue of physical manifestation, Fohat andHis Brothers.When this is borne in mind it will be seen that each of the planetary Logoi,equally with a solar Logos, and with Their reflections, human beings,demonstrate through the aspects.In their totality all these are the expression of the incarnating Logos; in theone case His fohatic energy builds the kingdoms of nature, giving them Body; inthe other He gives them their psychical value, and finally through them all Hedemonstrates as Existence or Being.Similar tables can be worked out for a Heavenly Man and a human being, layingthe emphasis always upon the development of the middle or psychic aspect.

SumtotalElectric Fire, the One Life. Mahadeva. SpiritWith these thoughts in mind it should be possible to [445] see more clearly whatthe coming in of a Ray, such as the present one, or its passing out, mayinvolve. In the particular case under discussion, we have the coming in of a Raythat is intimately connected with the plane of manifestation, the physicalplane, which is (within the greater cycle) responsible for man’s very existence,and the source of his future hope.This seventh Ray (fifth) ever manifests in a period of transition from onekingdom to another, and this holds hid the mystery of the particular form ofservice of its planetary Logos. He governs the processes of:TransmutationIncarnationTransference.In these three words His life-work is summed up; in these three words isembodied the nature of this great Entity, Who presides over the processes ofblending and merging and adaptation; Who, through His knowledge of cosmic Sound,guides the life forces of certain solar and lunar entities from form to form,and is the link between the soul awaiting incarnation, and its body ofmanifestation. This is equally true whether we are considering the incarnationof a man, of a group, of an idea, or of all entities of lesser grade to thesolar Being Who manifests through a globe, or the regent of the globe under theplanetary Logos. All entities of higher rank than this great evolutionary Beingcome into incarnation through the linking work of an extra-systemic Being. Inall periods of the transference of the life fromSystem to system,Scheme to scheme,Chain to chain,this cosmic Deity pours forth His power and influence. In all periods of lessertransition of the life from [446]Globe to globe,Plane to plane,Kingdom of nature to another kingdom,the Lord of the seventh Ray plays a similar part.Herein lies the reason for His inflowing force at this time, for a profoundmovement is in order of accomplishment, and a transference is in progress whichcalls for His particular type of energy. A transference is being effected ofcertain groups of human and deva Monads out of the human kingdom into the fifthor spiritual kingdom. During His cycle of close on two thousand five hundredyears, a specific number of men will pass on to the Path of Initiation, and takeat least the first Initiation, thus transferring their centres of consciousnessout of the purely human into the early stages of the spiritual.During this same cycle, a transference of units from out of the animal kingdominto the human will proceed in the fifth chain and from thence on to anotherchain, thus producing a period of even greater activity than on our own globe.Similarly I may point out (even though it is not possible to give more than ahint) that the force of the cosmic Transferrer is being called into activity bythe transference during this cycle of a special group of highly advanced unitsof the human and deva kingdoms (members of the occult Hierarchy) to anotherscheme altogether. Certain units also—from among the Lipika Lords—are takingadvantage of this cosmic influence to transfer their activity to another system,giving place to others Who will work out the karma of the new age. The power ofthese agencies permeates the entire globe and extends throughout the chains andschemes which lie in the line of its path. It will fundamentally affect thevegetable kingdom, obscuring old types and bringing in new; it will work in themineral kingdom and give a new impetus to the chemical processes, causingincidentally [447] a setting loose of radioactive units, and a consequentaccretion of knowledge by the scientist. In the elemental kingdoms and the groupsouls found therein, it produces facility in the transference of atoms.So far-reaching are the effects of this Ray, both on the deva and human units intheir different kingdoms that entirely new environments will evolve for theutilisation of the new types and entirely new characteristics will be foundemerging in the race of men.We have somewhat considered the type of force which expresses itself by means ofthe seventh Ray and have seen that it is the great transmuting, and transferringagent of the Logos. We have seen that it has a powerful effect both on deva andhuman units; we have found that the prime function of the Logos of the seventhRay is beyond all else, that of adaptation, or the moulding of the form and therendering of it suitable to the needs of any particular Entity. In all theconstructive work of form-building, certain factors enter in which must here beenumerated as they concern vitally this particular Heavenly Man, and theparticular plane, the physical, on which we undergo experience. These are:First. The will or the one-pointed purpose of some entity.Second. The material through which the life proposes to manifest. This material,as we know, is found within the ring-pass-not in seven grades, and in forty-ninesubgrades.Third. The Builders who are the vehicle for the divine purpose, and who mouldmatter upon a particular plan. These Builders evolve the forms out of their ownnature and substance.Fourth. A plan by which the work is carried out and which is imparted to theBuilders, being latent in their consciousness. They evolve the form of the GrandHeavenly Man, of the Heavenly Men, of the human units, [448] and of all formsfrom within outwards, and produce the self-identified Existences as a motherbuilds and produces a conscious Son out of the matter of her own body, carryingcertain racial earmarks yet independent, self-conscious, self-willed andthreefold in manifestation. The fact of the identity of the deva evolution withthe essence they manipulate must ever be borne in mind.Finally. Certain Words or Mantric Sounds, ( 151 [text00028.html#Y_FN151] )which—[449] uttered by a greater Life—can ever drive the lesser lives to thefulfillment of constructive purpose.These Words are uttered byA solar Logos. The threefold Word gives rise to a sevenfold vibration.A Heavenly Man, Who—through utterance—sweeps into evolutionary objectivity Hisscheme and all that is therein.The Monad, whose threefold word gives rise to a sevenfold vibration.The Ego, who—through sonorous utterance—produces a human being in the threeworlds.The analogy existing between these four should be carefully noted.Certain Words belong to the different aspects, and the Words of the first aspectset in vibration the matter that evolves through the seven cycles of solarsystems. Their relation to the Words of the present solar system is analogous tothe primordial substance which lies back of our present creation. The Words ofthe second aspect concern us closely, but the Words of Brahma are at the presentstage more closely connected with our work upon the physical plane. These Words,where the three worlds are concerned, very largely fall into a group ofmantrams, hidden in the consciousness of the Lords of the fifth and seventhRays; by their intelligent utterance the third aspect (the Brahma or manasicaspect) is brought into contact with the first aspect and produces that which wecall the “Conscious Son” or Sun. Upon the mental plane they are sounded by theLord of the fifth Ray, causing a vibration not only in what we might call “thelower levels” but producing response on the first or archetypal [450] plane andon the cosmic mental plane likewise. On the physical plane the words, uttered bythe seventh Logos, produce the following results:First. The anchoring of the permanent atoms within their group soul, or theunion of matter and consciousness.Second . The guidance of the stream of life into any particular kingdom, or theblending of form and consciousness.Third. The transference of the conscious, sentient life from form to form, fromgroup to group, from kingdom to kingdom within the hierarchies.In connection with the human kingdom, the fifth Ray had to function or pourforth its influence in order to produce self-consciousness within the consciousform.It will consequently be seen that the utterance of sound along the line of forceby the trained adept can both utilize deva activity to effect certain results inconnection with the form side of manifestation, and can drive the life within todefinite action. Hence the extreme danger—as has been frequently pointed out—ofthe knowledge of these mantrams and the need to safeguard them from interferenceand misuse. Power over form and over force lies always ready in the hand ofthose who have done three things:First. Developed the consciousness of the group in which they themselves findplace.Second. Learned the secret of the notes and tones to which that group responds.Third. Apprehended certain set words and phrases and the due method of chantingand intonation.They cannot bring about results outside the periphery of the group whoseconsciousness is theirs. For instance, an adept can work with forms and forcewithin [451] the ring-pass-not of his own planetary Logos within the threeworlds, within the ring-pass-not of the polar opposite of his Logos, or withinthe ring-pass-not of three planetary Logoi who form a systemic triangle. Hecannot exhibit this power in the higher planes nor within the spheres of thesynthesising and neutral schemes. After the sixth Initiation his power extendsto the two planes beyond the three worlds, the buddhic and the atmic, and withinthe spheres of the entire Brahma aspect as we visualise it as the totality ofthe schemes of the five Kumaras who are Brahma. At the seventh Initiation he haspower on all the seven planes and within the entire number of schemes; all theSacred Words are then his and he can work in matter of all grades, sound allnotes, and control all types of force. He stands ready then to guide the life toregions outside the solar sphere of influence. But on the physical plane heworks primarily with the Words of the seventh Logos, which fall naturally intofive groups:1. Mantrams which deal with etheric matter, and control the devas of the ethers.2. Mantrams which deal with dense physical matter and control the sub-humanevolution through certain groups of devas.3. Words specifically connected with the human Hierarchy, and which are verycarefully guarded from the knowledge of man himself.4. Words concerning the deva evolution which control, and bring different groupsof devas into the line of the will of the utterer. These are in many ways themost dangerous and all knowledge of them is withheld from men below the rank ofinitiates of the third order.5. Words which affect the life side of manifestation and which drive it into, orout of, form.[452] There is a sixth group intimately connected with electrical manifestation,which is beginning to work out in the formula of scientists, and students ofradio-activity and electrical phenomena, but fortunately for themselves theyremain formulas on paper and are not as yet embodied in sound.In dealing very briefly with the question of mantrams, it is to be recognisedthat “The time is not yet” for their general publication. No purpose would beimmediately served by the impartation of mantric forms. Inevitably the time willcome when they will be known, but at this time no one would be benefited by theknowledge of them for the following reasons:Knowledge of things occult does not suffice for their wise utilisation.The development of the intuition by means of aspiration, endeavour, failure, andrenewed effort ending in success is of far more profit to the Ego than the quickresults brought about by the use of sound.The “Words” are used for the manipulation of matter and its bending into formalong the line of evolution. Until the inner faculty of clairvoyance is somewhatdeveloped, this knowledge of mantrams remains practically useless and may beeven a menace. When a man can see a need for correction and for adjustment in abrother’s vehicle, and can awaken in his brother a desire to adjust that whichis amiss, wise assistance can be given by the one who sees and sounds. Thinkthis out, for it holds the key to the reason for the safeguarding of the words.Selflessness, sight, and sincerity of purpose must all three exist before thesounds can be imparted. Selflessness and sincerity are sometimes found but theoccult use of the inner vision is still rare.We must keep closely in mind (as we take up this matter of the incoming Ray andthe effects to be looked for from its influence) that we are only consideringthe mind [453] aspect in the three evolutions. I do not purpose to say muchanent human development as much has been already hinted at in the precedingpages, and a hint suffices for the true student, but it may be possible to statein broad outline the coming developments and to tabulate the results to beexpected. Suggestions only are possible.Development of etheric vision universally. This will be due to two causes:First, the scientific recognition of the existence of the etheric levels,thereby freeing people from the onus of adverse public opinion, and enablingthem to reveal what they have individually long realised. Etheric vision iscomparatively common even now. But comment concerning it is rare, owing to thefear of criticism.Secondly, the increased activity of the devas of the ethers, which throws thematter of the etheric levels into more active vibration, with consequent reflexaction on the eye of man.Increased mental activity and the spread of education (of the concrete mentalkind) everywhere. This will result in:Increased competition between units and between groups.The organization of business on lines hitherto undreamt of.The foundation of groups and aggregations of groups whose sole purpose will beto synthesise all the lines of human endeavour, and thus bring about unificationof effort, and economy of force in the scientific, business, philosophic,educational, and religious worlds.The foundation of schools of medicine along new lines, whose purpose will be tostudy the etheric body, its relation to the dense physical body, and itsfunction [454] as the receiver, storer, and transmitter of the vital fluids ofthe system.The foundation of the new church, which will be no longer along devotional andidealistic lines but which will be an outgrowth of the old idealism,demonstrating through mental forms. It will have for its basis the scientificrecognition of the unseen world and its due appreciation and apprehension bymeans of accurate scientific ceremonial. This ceremonial of the universalchurch—being founded on the mental unity of all peoples—will not be ceremonialas it is now understood, as it will be the guarded, guided, scientificutilisation of sound and color to bring about certain desired ends, such asThe aligning of the Ego,The influencing of groups,The making of contact with the Occult Hierarchy,The co-operation with the devas in order to further the constructive ends ofevolution,and many other objects which will grow out of the scientific comprehension ofthe constitution of man, the nature of vibration or radioactivity, and thedemonstrated reality of the hitherto metaphysical hypothesis and religious dogmaof the unseen world of thought and of spiritual existence.Increased facility in approaching the Path. This will be based on the fact thatso many of the then existent humanity will have personal knowledge of the rulingpowers and forces, will perhaps be on the Probationary Path, or will beinitiates of the first degree. Thus the present scepticism will becomenon-existent. The dangers then will be along other lines—those incident to thevery influence of this ray itself: the dangers of crystallisation into form sothat the true spiritual devotee may become rare, and the scientific aspirantwill take his place.[455] The true occultist is a scientist and a devotee , and where these two arenot merged, we have the mystic and the man in danger of black magic, beinggoverned by the intellect and not by selflessness; there are dangers incidentalso upon contact with the deva evolution and the knowledge of the powers andforces made available through their agency.The coming into incarnation of numbers of old magicians and occultists, and therapid growth therefore of recognised psychic powers among the people. Thispsychism, being tinged with mentality and not being of a purely astral quality,will be even more dangerous than in Atlantean days, for back of it will be somedegree of will, conscious purpose, and intellectual apprehension, and unlessthis is paralleled by the growth of spiritual realisation, and by the steadygrip of the Ego upon the lower personality, a period of real danger may ensue.Hence the need of pointing out and of realising the menace, so that the truth ofthe inner life and the need of serving the race as an essential to advancementmay be proclaimed far and wide.Paralleling the incoming of this large band of seventh Ray magicians (somelinked to the Brotherhood and some to the purely manasic groups) is the proposedadvent of certain members of the Hierarchy (initiates below the fourthInitiation) and of certain disciples and probationers, all on this Ray and alltrue psychics, who hope through their endeavours to offset the vibrations, andward off the menace incident to the advent of the other group. The arranging ofthis and the preparing of the way for them in the different countries, speciallyin Europe and North America, is occupying the attention at this time of theMaster R— and the Master H—. ( 152 [text00028.html#Y_FN152] )A group of scientists will come into incarnation on the [456] physical planeduring the next seventy-five years who will be the medium for the revelation ofthe next three truths concerning electrical phenomena. A formula of truthconcerning this aspect of manifestation was prepared by initiates on the fifthRay at the close of the last century, being part of the usual attempt of theHierarchy to promote evolutionary development at the close of every cycle of onehundred years. Certain parts (two fifths) of that formula have worked outthrough the achievements of such men as Edison and those who participate in histype of endeavour, and through the work of those who have dealt with the subjectof radium and radioactivity. Three more parts of the same formula have still tocome, and will embody all that it is possible or safe for man to know anent thephysical plane manifestation of electricity during the fifth subrace.All that we have here considered covers the time till the coming in of the newsubrace. This race will summarise and carry to a temporary conclusion themanasic effort of the fifth rootrace of mental growth, and will cause results ofstupendous import. During the sixth subrace, the emphasis will not be so much onthe development of mind, as it will be on the utilisation of the concrete mind,and its acquired faculty, for the development of the powers of abstract thought.Perhaps too much importance has been attached to the statement of some occultwriters that the sixth subrace will be intuitive. The intuition will beawakening, and will be more prominent than now, but the outstandingcharacteristic will be the ability of the units of the sixth subrace to think inabstract terms, and to use the abstract mind. Their function will be to perfect(as far as may be in this round) [457] the group antaskarana, ( 153[text00028.html#Y_FN153] ) or the link between the mental and the buddhic. Thisbridge will be of a usable nature during the sixth rootrace in which theintuition will show real and general signs of existing. In this rootrace, unitsonly show signs here and there of real intuition, having built the necessarybridge in their individual selves. In the sixth rootrace small groups will beintuitive.It is needless to say more here anent the influence of the seventh Ray upon thesons of men. More later may be available but enough has been suggested to formthe basis of useful speculation.b. Animals and human beings and the Rays. We will now take up two points andstudy the effect of the incoming force on the human and animal kingdoms. Thesepoints are of profound interest to the occult student for two reasons. The topicwe have now to consider is the effect of the incoming seventh Ray during thecoming centuries upon the animal kingdom and the deva evolution. The profundityof the interest lies in the fact that in the one case we are dealing with theevolution immediately behind the human and from which man is not as yet whollyemancipated, and in the other we are concerning ourselves with a parallelingevolution, and one that is of vast importance in the scheme of things. Let ustake up first this seventh Ray and its effect upon the animal kingdom.Practically little is known to man concerning this kingdom of nature, save whatscience has vouchsafed anent the physical organisms, and a few occult statementswhich have been given out at various times; the development of the animalconsciousness and its immediate future is as yet but little understood.The most important of the occult facts concerning this [458] third kingdom asthey relate to our present subject, may be enumerated as follows:1. The animal kingdom holds the same relation to the human kingdom as the densephysical body does to the seven principles and still finds its connecting linkwith man through the close correspondence between their bodies of objectivity.2. The animal kingdom is the third of the kingdoms and is (from the esotericpoint of view and as regards its relation to mankind) the mother aspect, priorto the overshadowing by the Holy Spirit, the manas aspect. Think out thisresemblance, and trace the analogy between the cosmic mother, the systemicmother, and the same mother aspect as seen in the animal kingdom as a basis forthe evolution of man.Each of the kingdoms of nature acts as the mother to the succeeding one in theevolutionary process. Any group, which may be under consideration, should in duecourse of evolution give birth to offspring, who will—in themselves—embody someideal, and who receive their objective forms on some plane from the earliergroup. From the third kingdom springs the fourth, and from this fourth willemerge the fifth, each receivinga. Germ protection,b. Form,c . Gradual development,d . Nourishment,until in each case the human child, or the Christ child, is brought to thebirth. This is a very occult truth, and though the facts have been recognisedand taught anent the fourth and fifth kingdoms, the work and place of the animalhas not received its due recognition.3. During the third rootrace, animal individualisation took place, and theself-conscious unit, called Man, came into being. I have somewhat dealt with thequestion of [459] individualisation elsewhere and seek not here to enlarge uponit. I would only point out a correspondence that holds hid the key to themystery of individualisation.In this chain, individualisation took place during the third rootrace and in thefourth round, speaking in this connection of a round through a chain of globes,and not the life force of a planetary Logos circulating through the seven chainsin a scheme. It is of peculiar interest at this time that we are in the fourthround in a chain as well as in the fourth round as regards the scheme of sevenchains. It has led to evolutionary possibilities of great import. On the moonchain individualisation took place during the fifth race of the third round, andin the next chain to ours on the evolutionary arc individualisation will takeplace during the sixth race of the second round,—in each case this refers to aplanetary round through a chain of globes.4. In the fourth rootrace the “door” (as it is called) between the two kingdomsbecame closed, and no more of the animal kingdom passed into the human. Theircycle temporarily ended and—to express it in terms of fire or of electricalphenomena—the animal kingdom and the human became positive to each other, andrepulsion instead of attraction supervened. All this was brought about by theswinging into power of a profoundly long cycle of the fifth Ray. This wasnecessitated by the need of man to develop along the manasic line, and resultedin a period of repulsion of the animal units, leaving their consciousness to bestimulated on astral lines.Owing to this repulsion, we have one reason (and one of the least fundamental)for the destructive war and the long cycle of cruelty that has been wagedbetween man and the animals. It can be evidenced in the terror of man inconnection with wild animals of the jungles and the deserts, and in the terribletoll of life that such animals have exacted during the centuries. This must not[460] be forgotten. For thousands of years, wild animals have—specially beforethe coming in of firearms—destroyed the defenseless, and during those years, hadstatistics been taken, the numbers of human beings killed would reach astupendous figure. Now, in this age, the balancing is taking place and in theslaughter of animals equilibrium is being reached. I do not refer to the wantoncruelties practised under the name of science, nor to certain practices whichtake place under religious guise in different lands. The source of theseenormities must be sought for elsewhere. It is hidden in the karma of thatBeing, Who for a period—during the moon chain—held office as the Entity Who isthe informing evolutionary Life of the animal kingdom. This is a point of viewneeding careful pondering. Each of the kingdoms of nature is the expression of aLife or Being; man, for instance, being the expression of one or other of theHeavenly Men; the sumtotal of humanity (the fourth Hierarchy) being found, withthe deva evolution, as the centres of the solar Logos. The animal kingdomlikewise is the expression of the life of a Being Who is a part of the body ofthe Logos or of the planetary Logos, but not a centre of conscious energy. (Acorrespondence is found in the human body, which has its seven centres of forceor energy, but also other organs upon which objective manifestation depends inlesser degree.) Such an Entity finds expression through the animal kingdom, ofwhich He is the informing Soul, and He has definite place in the planetary orlogoic body. This is a hint which has hitherto not been exoteric and is to becommended to the consideration of students. I would add that some of thetragedies underlying existence at this time are karmically incident upontemporarily faulty relations between an entity who dominated at one period ofthe third or moon-chain, and the one holding analogous position in this thefourth or earth chain. This latter is the sumtotal of the [461] lowest humanprinciple, if we count the dense physical or animal body of man as a principle.In their lack of agreement lies the clue to the cruelties practised on animalsby man.We have enumerated six occult statements anent the animal kingdom, the thirdkingdom of nature. They related to the past, and we will now add one furtherstatement to them and then proceed to consider the present and to foretellcertain eventualities that may be looked for in the future.As we have seen, during the third rootrace, opportunity for the animal kingdomoccurred and many individualised. In the fourth rootrace this cycle ofopportunity ceased temporarily, and something happened which is analogous towhat will occur in the fifth rootrace in connection with man, at the so-called“Judgment Day.” In Atlantean days the lives which composed the third kingdom ofnature were divided into two groups:A number of these lives were “passed,” and the tide of life sweeps through them,permitting of their incarnating in animal form on earth, and their gradualevolution.The remainder were rejected, and as a group they became temporarily quiescent,and will not manifest in physical form until the next round.In the fifth round, a corresponding division will take place in the fourthkingdom, and the lives in that kingdom will be subjected to an analogous test;some will be passed and will continue their evolution on this planet, whileothers will be rejected, and will go into temporary pralaya.After the rejection in the fourth rootrace of three-fourths of the animal units,the remaining triads (or one-fourth) proceeded on their way holding the promiseof opportunity for all in time, and the guarantee of their [462] own attainmentin the next round. Just as the human Monads, who are passed in the fifth round,will enter into the fifth kingdom, or respond to its vibration before the climaxof the seventh, so the animal monads (if I may employ such a term) who werepassed in this round will achieve individualisation during the fifth and enterthe fourth kingdom. This will be brought about by the strong manasic impulsewhich will characterise the whole cycle of the fifth round, and will thus beeffected normally and as the result of due evolutionary growth. An electricalstimulation of the nature of the occurrence in Lemurian days will not berequired.Since the great division in the fourth rootrace, the animal kingdom has beenprimarily occupied with the stimulation and development of kama. This is thebasis of the endeavour being made by the Brotherhood by the aid of man to fanthe emotional instinct (or the embryo love aspect) through the segregating ofthe domestic animals, and the consequent play made upon the third spirilla inthe animal atoms by human magnetism or radiatory energy. The sumtotal of thedomestic animals—the animal units brought into closest connection with man—formthe heart centre in the body of that great Entity Who is the life of the animalkingdom. From the heart flow all the influences which will eventually permeatethe entire body. These units are those which will be finally separated from thegroup soul at the reopening of the door into the human kingdom in the nextround.Let us now consider the immediate present, and the advent of this seventh ray ofceremonial magic. The effect upon the animal kingdom of the force of this raywill be far less than upon the human, for it is not yet ready to respond to thevibration of this planetary Logos, and will not be until the sixth round whenHis influence will bring about great events. Nevertheless, certain effects mighthere be noticed.[463] Owing to the increased activity of the deva evolution, and specially ofthe devas of the ethers, the lesser builders will be stimulated to build, withgreater facility, bodies of a more responsive nature, and the etheric bodies ofboth men and animals and also their responsiveness to force or prana will bemore adequate. During the sixth subrace, disease as we know it in both kingdomswill be materially lessened owing to the pranic response of the etheric bodies.This will likewise bring about changes in the dense physical body and the bodiesof both men and animals will be smaller, more refined, more finely attuned tovibration, and consequently more fitted to express essential purpose.Owing to the recognition by man of the value of mantrams, and his gradualcomprehension of the true ceremonial of evolution, coupled with the use of soundand colour, the animal kingdom will be better understood, and better trained,considered and utilised. Indications of this already can be seen; for instance,in all our current magazines at this time, stories which deal with thepsychology of animals, and with their mental attitude to man, are constantlyappearing, and by the means of these and through the force of the incoming Ray,man may (if he cares to do so) come to a much wider sympathy with his brothersof less degree. Thus by the turning by man of his thought force upon theanimals, stimulation of their latent mentality will ensue, leading in due courseof time to the crisis in the next round. More attention should be paid by occultstudents to the effect of the consciousness of one group upon another group, andthe advancement of the lesser, by the means of the stimulating power of thegreater, should be studied. The following facts should be realised:a . The powerful vibration of the Lords of the three Rays, and of Theirradiation, stimulates the four Heavenly [464] Men and develops Theirapprehension, enabling Them to expand Their consciousness.b. The consciousness of the Heavenly Men stimulates all the units in Theirbodies, but causes specialised response from those who are actively andintelligently working at the development of group consciousness. The vibration,for instance, of a planetary Logos has a peculiar effect upon all those who areinitiates, adepts and chohans, and brings their three major spirillae to thenecessitated vibration. This work is begun when the sixth spirilla (in the minorgroup of seven) is active.c. The consciousness of man is stimulated and developed when—at a certainstage—he can respond to the vibration of members of the Occult Hierarchy, and isthus nearing the portal into the fifth kingdom. This coincides with thevibratory activity of the fifth spirilla.d. In like manner, the less evolved units of the race, who are scarcely morethan animals, are brought to the necessary stage of vibration by the play upontheir mental bodies of the combined vibrations of men, whose fourth spirilla isfunctioning adequately. In these last two cases we are dealing with thespirillae of the mental permanent atom. In the other two we are dealing withoccult mysteries, bound up in the vivification of solar and not human permanentatoms.e . The fourth Creative Hierarchy, viewed as a unit functioning on this planet(and leaving out of consideration its manifestation in other schemes) works in amagnetic manner, and in a stimulative capacity upon the animal kingdom, theforce of its vibration pouring on to the astral bodies of the animals, andproducing response. This awakens to a more effective apprehension all the unitsof the animal kingdom. Hence it can be seen how close is the interplay, and theinterdependence, and how closely united all these greater and lesser lives arewith each other. Growth and development in one part of the [465] body logoicproduces a corresponding advance in the whole. No man, for instance, can makedefinite and specialised progress without his brother benefiting,—thisbenefiting taking the form of:The increase of the total consciousness of the group.The stimulation of units in the group.The group magnetism producing increased healing or blending effects upon alliedgroups.In this thought lies, for the servant of the Master, incentive to effort; no manwho strives for mastery, who struggles to attain, and who aims at expansion ofconsciousness but is having some effect—in ever widening spirals—upon all whomhe contacts, devas, men, and animals. That he knows it not, and that he may betotally unaware of the subtle stimulating emanation which proceeds from him maybe true, but nevertheless the law works.The third effect of the coming in of this ray is one that may at first repel—itwill cause a great destruction in the animal kingdom. During the next fewhundred years many of the old animal forms will die out and become extinct. Tosupply the wants of man, through disease, and through causes latent in theanimal kingdom itself, much destruction will be brought about. It must ever beborne in mind that a building force is likewise a destroying one, and new formsfor the animal evolution are, at this time, one of the recognized needs. Theimmense slaughter in America is part of the working out of the plan. The innerlife or fire which animates the animal groups, and which is the life expressionof an Entity, will, under this seventh influence, blaze up and burn out the old,and permit the escape of the life, to newer and better forms.Our subject for immediate consideration concerns the [466] deva evolution , andthe effect of the incoming ray upon them.The first point to be noted is that this influence at this time affectsprimarily the devas of the physical plane, the devas of the ethers, or of theshadows, as they are sometimes called, and not, to the same extent, the devas ofthe astral or mental planes. Every Ray affects in more or less degree the planeor subplane which is its numerical correspondence; the student should bear thisin mind, and should therefore recollect that for all purposes of investigationat this time the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Magic will have a powerful influence:On the seventh or physical plane, regarding it as a unit.On the seventh subplane or the lowest subplane on the physical, the astral andthe mental planes.On the seventh or lowest human principle: prana in the etheric body.On all Monads in incarnation who are seventh Ray Monads.On a peculiar group of devas who are the agents, or “mediates” between magicians(either white or black) and the elemental forces. This group is occultly knownas “The Mediatory Seventh,” and is divided into two divisions:a . Those working with evolutionary forces.b. Those working with involutionary forces.One group is the agent of constructive purpose, and the other of destructive.More need not be submitted anent this group as they are not easily contacted,fortunately for man, and can as yet only be reached by a particular group ritualaccurately performed,—a thing as yet practically unknown. The Masons eventuallywill be one of the chief agents of contact, and as men are as yet not ready forsuch power as this will put into their hands, [467] true masonry will developbut slowly. Nevertheless, under the magnetic force of this seventh Ray, thegrowth of masonry is inevitably sure.This Ray of Ceremonial Magic will consequently have a very profound effect uponthe physical plane, for not only is this plane coming under its cyclic force butat all times its planetary Logos has a special effect upon it; the Raja-Lord ofthis plane is what is occultly termed the “Reflection in the Water of Chaos” ofthe planetary Logos. Hence in the matter of this plane (which is the body of theRaja-Lord) certain very definite events are occurring which—though invisible tothe ordinary man—are apparent to the eye of the spiritual man or adept.The matter of the plane becomes receptive to positive force for the feminine ordeva aspect, being negative, becomes responsive to the positive energy of theHeavenly Man. This energy, finding the line of least resistance, pours into thesubstance of the plane, or the substantial body of the Deva Lords. Owing to thereceptive condition of this body it follows certain lines and producesdefinitely constructive results.Constructive results transpire in the negative etheric matter of the plane andon the four higher subplanes. On the lower three a contrary effect is produced,and the energy of the Heavenly Man will lead to the destruction of form,preparatory to the building work. The building ever originates on, and proceedsfrom, etheric levels. Cataclysms of a world wide nature will occur during thenext one thousand years; continents will be shaken; lands will be raised andsubmerged, culminating in the profound material disaster which will overtake theworld towards the close of the fourth branch race of the sixth subrace. Thiswill usher in the infant sixth rootrace.The devas of the ethers, with which we are most concerned, [468] will beaffected in several ways, and the results upon the other evolutions will befar-reaching. We must remember always that the devas are the qualities andattributes of matter, the active builders, who work consciously or unconsciouslyupon the plane. Here I would point out that all the devas of the higher levelsof the mental plane, for instance, and of the systemic planes from there on tothe centre (the divine plane, the plane of the Logos, sometimes called Adi)co-operate consciously, and are of high rank in the system, and of positionequal to all the ranks and grades of the Hierarchy from a first degree initiateup to, but not including, the Lord of the World Himself. Below these higherlevels, where the concrete is touched, we have lesser grades of devas who workunconsciously, with the following exceptions, who are conscious forces andentities and of high position:a. The Raja-lord of a plane.b. Seven devas who work under Him, and are the entities who inform the matter ofthe seven subplanes.c . Fourteen representatives of the Rays, Who cycle into and out of power,according to the Ray, waxing or waning.d . Four devas who are the plane representatives of the four Maharajahs (theLords of Karma) and are the focal points for karmic influence in connection withman. The four Maharajahs are the dispensers of karma to the Heavenly Men, andthus to the cells, centres, and organs of His body necessarily; but the wholesystem works through graded representatives; the same laws govern these agentsof plane karma as govern the systemic and cosmic, and during plane manifestationthey are, for instance, the only unit in form [469] permitted to pass beyond theplane ring-pass-not. All other units in manifestation on a plane have to discardthe vehicle through which they function before they can pass on to subtlerlevels.c. Types of Karma . We might here enumerate the different types of KARMA, eventhough we have not the time to enlarge upon the subject. A book by itself ofvast proportions could not contain all that might be said. We should bear inmind that KARMA is imposed upon the ensouling entity through the medium ofmatter or of substance itself (which is coloured by it) and that this matter orsubstance is intelligent material composed of deva essence .Cosmic Karma —Imposed upon the solar Logos from outside of the system.Systemic Karma —The working out by the Logos of effects set in motion inprevious Kalpas, and which influence His present type of Body.Planetary Karma —The individual karma of a Heavenly Man, which is just asdifferent from that of another Heavenly Man, as is the karma of the differentmembers of the human family.The Karma of a chain , which is bound up in the life experience of that entitywho ensouls a chain, and is a centre in the body of a Heavenly Man, in the samesense as a Heavenly Man within His scheme is a centre in the body of the solarLogos.Globe Karma —The individual destiny of the entity who is a centre in the body ofthe ensouling Life of a chain.These five existences above enumerated, who are worked upon by karma, are allcosmic and solar Lords of Light, Who achieved intelligence, and passed throughthe human kingdom many kalpas ago.Plane Karma —This is inextricably mixed up with the [470] karma of the planetaryLogos and of the Raja-Lord, and is dependent upon the interplay between thesetwo opposite poles,—the masculine and feminine aspect of the DivineHermaphrodite.The Karma of a subplane , or the destiny of certain lesser entities who manifestthrough these planes.In these two types of karma, we have what one might term the “Karma of theHierarchies” as it has been brought about since the manifesting of the solarsystem. It is the result of the past of this system, and not so much the workingout of effects originating in previous solar systems.The Karma of the kingdoms of nature as we know them on our planet:a. The mineral kingdom.b. The vegetable kingdom.c. The animal kingdom.This is necessarily the karma of the different lunar Lords who ensoul thesekingdoms, and who are working out their purposes through them. We must note thatwe have touched therefore upon cosmic, solar, and lunar karma. In the latter ishid the great mystery of the Moon, and her place in the planetary scheme.The Karma of the Human Hierarchy ( 154 [text00028.html#Y_FN154] ) ( 155[text00028.html#Y_FN155] ) ( 156 [text00028.html#Y_FN156] ) in its seven groups,and of the individual Monads. This in itself is a vast and intricate subjectand—during the particular cycle of the Earth globe—can be divided into: [471]a. World karma. (The seven root-races.)b. Racial karma, or the destiny and purpose of each root-race.c. Subrace karma, for each subrace has its own destiny to work out.d . National karma.e. Family karma.f. Individual karma.All these different types of karma are intermingled and bound up in a mannerinconceivable and inextricable [472] to man; even the adepts cannot untangle themystery beyond that of the groups affiliated with them, while the Chohans of thehigher degrees work with the karma of the larger groups (which are theaggregates of the lesser groups).All the lesser grades of devas, “The Army of the Voice,” on each plane, thelesser builders and elementals in their myriads, work unconsciously, beingguided and directed by words and sound. In this way vibrations are set up in theessence of the planes by the conscious Builders.There is not much to be added at this point anent the deva evolution; much thatmight be imparted is perforce withheld owing to the danger arising fromsuperficial knowledge, unaccompanied by wisdom and the inner vision. There arethree more points to add to the four already given, concerning primarily therelationship of the devas to man in the future, and their closer approximationto him through the incoming type of force. This approximation, thoughinevitable, will not have for the human hierarchy results entirely beneficent,and before the true method of contact is comprehended, and the consequentassociation wisely utilised, much suffering will eventuate and much bitterexperience will be undergone. When it is remembered that the devas are, in theirtotality, the mother aspect, the great builders of form, and the nourishers ofthat which is as yet unable to guard itself, any return of man to a closerdependence upon the devas is as if a full grown man returned to the care of hismother, offering up his self-reliance in exchange for material benefit. Thedevas are the mother of the form, but the self-conscious unit, MAN, shouldrealize his independence of the form, and should follow the path ofSelf-expression. This should be pondered on, for in days to come (when unitshere and there contact the devas, and inevitably pay the penalty) it may behelpful [473] if the reason is understood, and man realises his necessaryseparation from these Essences in the three worlds . Approach between the twolines of evolution becomes possible on the plane of buddhi, but then it is anapproach of two essences, and not an approach of the concrete to the essence.Man, while functioning in material, substantial forms in the three worlds, maynot trespass across the separating line between the two evolutions. Only on theplanes of solar fire or on the cosmic etheric levels may contact be permitted;on the planes of the cosmic dense physical plane (our mental, astral andphysical planes) disaster only results from contact. I have dwelt on this point,for the danger is real, and near at hand.The deva evolution will, through this seventh Ray force have much to do with thetransmission of prana to units of the three higher kingdoms of nature, and thiseasier transmission (from the etheric levels of the physical plane) willparallel a correspondingly easier transmission of spiritual or psychical forcefrom the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane. The results of this pranictransmission will be more healthy physical bodies among the sons of men. Thisneed not be looked for at this time, and will only begin to be noticeable aboutthree hundred years hence, when the incoming seventh Ray Egos will benumerically strong enough to be recognised as the prevailing type for a certainperiod. Their physical bodies, owing to their being built for seventh Ray forcewill respond more readily than the others, though first Ray egos and fifth RayEgos will benefit enormously from this influence. The etheric devas will buildduring a peculiarly favourable period, and the physical bodies then constructedwill be distinguished by:a. Resilience,b. Enormous physical magnetism, [474]c. Ability to reject false magnetism,d. Capacity to absorb solar rays,e. Great strength and resistance,f. A delicacy and refinement in appearance as yet unknown.The etheric levels of the plane will be full of an increased activity, andslowly but surely, as the decades slip away, man will become conscious of theselevels, and aware of their inhabitants. The immediate effect of this greateretheric energy will be that a numerically larger number of people will possessetheric vision, and will be able normally and naturally to live consciously onetheric levels. The majority of men only function consciously on the three lowerlevels of the physical—the gaseous, the liquid, and the dense—and the ethericlevels are as sealed to them as are the astral. In the coming centuries, man’snormal habitat will be the entire physical plane up to, though not including,the second subplane. The fourth and third etheric levels will be as familiar tohim as the usual physical landscape to which he is now accustomed.The centre of attention of medical and scientific students will be focussed onthe etheric body, and the dependence of the physical body upon the etheric bodywill be recognised. This will change the attitude of the medical profession, andmagnetic healing and vibratory stimulation will supersede the present methods ofsurgery and drug assimilation. Man’s vision being then normally etheric, willhave the effect of forcing him to recognise that which is now called the “unseenworld,” or the superphysical. Men in their etheric bodies will be noted, andcommunicated with, and the devas and elementals of the ethers will be studiedand recognised. When this is so, then the true use of ceremonial ritual as aprotection and safeguard to man will assume its right place.[475] The work of the devas in connection with the animal and the vegetablekingdoms will be likewise recognised, and much that is now possible throughignorance will become impossible and obsolete. The time will come, when theattitude of man to the animal kingdom will be revolutionised, and the slaughter,ill-treatment, and that form of cruelty called “sport,” will be done away with.A mysterious change in the attitude of men and women to the sex question,marriage and the work of procreation will result from the development of ethericvision, and the consequent recognition of the devas. This change will be basedon the realisation of the true nature of matter, or of the mother aspect, and ofthe effect of the Sun upon substance. The unity of life will be a known andscientific fact, and life in matter will no longer be a theory but a fundamentalof science. This cannot be enlarged upon here.3. Manas in the Final Rounds.a. The transmutative process. Transmutation is a subject that from the earliestages has occupied the attention of students, scientists and alchemists. Thepower to change, through the application of heat, is of course universallyrecognised, but the key to the mystery, or the secret of the systemic formula isadvisedly guarded from all searchers, and is only gradually revealed after thesecond Initiation. The subject is so tremendous that it is only possible toindicate in broad general outlines how it may be approached. The mind of thepublic turns naturally to the transmutation of metals into gold with the aim inview of the alleviation of poverty. The mind of the scientist seeks theuniversal solvent which will reduce matter to its primordial substance, releaseenergy, and thus reveal the processes of evolution, and enable the seeker tobuild for himself (from the primordial base) the desired forms. The mind of thealchemist [476] searches for the Philosopher’s Stone, that effective transmutingagent which will bring about revelation, and the power to impose the will of thechemist upon the elemental forces, which work in, by, and through matter. Thereligious man, especially the Christian, recognises the psychic quality of thistransmutative power, and frequently speaks in the sacred books, of the soulbeing tried or tested seven times in the fire. All these students andinvestigators are recognising one great truth from their own constricted angle,and the whole lies not with one or another, but in the aggregate.In defining transmutation as it is occultly understood, we might express itthus: Transmutation is the passage across from one state of being to anotherthrough the agency of fire . The due comprehension of this is based on certainpostulates, mainly four in number. These postulates must be expressed in termsof the Old Commentary, which is so worded that it reveals to those who have eyesto see, but remains enigmatic to those who are not ready, or who would misusethe knowledge gained for selfish ends. The phrases are as follows:I. He who transfers the Father’s life to the lower three seeketh the agency offire, hid in the heart of Mother. He worketh with the Agnichaitans, that hide,that burn, and thus produce the needed moisture.II. He who transfers the life from out the lower three into the ready fourthseeketh the agency of fire hid in the heart of Brahma. He worketh with theforces of the Agnishvattas, that emanate, that blend, and thus produce theneeded warmth.III. He who transfers the life into the gathering fifth seeketh the agency offire hid in the heart of Vishnu. He worketh with the forces of the Agnisuryans,that blaze, that liberate the essence, and thus produce the needed radiance.IV. First moisture, slow and all enveloping; then heat with ever-growing warmthand fierce intensity; then force that presses, drives and concentrates. Thus isradiance [477] produced; thus the exudation; thus mutation; thus change of form.Finally liberation, escape of the volatile essence, and the gathering of theresidue back to primordial stuff.He who ponders these formulas and who meditates upon the method and suggestedprocess will receive a general idea of the evolutionary process of transmutationwhich will be of more value to him than the formulas whereby the devas transmutethe various minerals.Transmutation concerns the life of the atom, and is hidden in a knowledge of thelaws governing radioactivity. It is interesting to note how in the scientificexpression ‘radioactivity,’ we have the eastern conception of Vishnu-Brahma, orthe Rays of Light vibrating through matter. Hence the usually acceptedinterpretation of the term ‘atom’ must be extended from that of the atom ofchemistry to include:a. All atoms or spheres upon the physical plane.b . All atoms or spheres upon the astral and mental planes.c. The human being in physical incarnation.d. The causal body of man on its own plane.e. All planes as entified spheres.f. All planets, chains and globes within the solar system.g. All monads on their own plane, whether human monads or Heavenly Men.h. The solar Ring-Pass-Not, the aggregate of all lesser atoms.In all these atoms, stupendous or minute, microcosmic or macrocosmic, thecentral life corresponds to the positive charge of electrical force predicatedby science, whether it is the life of a cosmic Entity such as a solar Logos, orthe tiny elemental life within a physical atom. The lesser atoms which revolveround their positive centre, and which are at present termed electrons byscience, are the negative aspect, and this is true not only of the atom on thephysical plane, but of the human atoms, held to their central attractive point,a Heavenly Man, or the [478] atomic forms which in their aggregate form therecognised solar system. All forms are built up in an analogous manner and theonly difference consists—as the text-books teach—in the arrangement and thenumber of the electrons. ( 157) [text00028.html#Y_FN157] The electron itselfwill eventually be found to be an elemental, tiny life.The second point I seek to make now is: Radiation is transmutation in process ofaccomplishment. Transmutation being the liberation of the essence in order thatit may seek a new centre, the process may be recognised as radioactivitytechnically understood and applied to all atomic bodies without exception.That science has but recently become aware of radium (an example of the processof transmutation) is but the fault of science. As this is more comprehended itwill be found that all radiations, such as magnetism or psychic exhalation, arebut the transmuting process proceeding on a large scale. The point to be graspedhere is that the transmuting process, when effective, is superficially theresult of outside factors. Basically it is the result of the inner positivenucleus of force or life reaching such a terrific rate of vibration, that iteventually scatters the electrons or negative points which compose its sphere ofinfluence, and scatters them to such a distance that the Law of Repulsiondominates. They are then no more attracted to their original centre but seekanother. The atomic sphere, if I might so express it, dissipates, the electronscome under the Law of Repulsion, and the central essence escapes and seeks a newsphere, occultly understood.We must remember always that all within the solar system is dual, and is initself both negative and positive: positive as regards its own form, butnegative as regards its greater sphere. Every atom therefore is [479] bothpositive and negative,—it is an electron as well as an atom.Therefore, the process of transmutation is dual and necessitates a preliminarystage of application of external factors, a fanning and care and development ofthe inner positive nucleus, a period of incubation or of the systematic feedingof the inner flame, and an increase of voltage. There is next a secondary stagewherein the external factors do not count so much, and wherein the inner centreof energy in the atom may be left to do its own work. These factors may beapplied equally to all atoms; to the mineral atoms which have occupied theattention of alchemists so much, to the atom, called man who pursues the samegeneral procedure being governed by the same laws; and to all greater atoms,such as a Heavenly Man or a solar Logos.The process might be tabulated as follows:1. The life takes primitive form.2. The form is subjected to outer heat.3. Heat, playing on the form, produces exudation and the factor of moisturesupervenes.4. Moisture and heat perform their function in unison.5. Elemental lives tend all lesser lives.6. The devas co-operate under rule, order and sound.7. The internal heat of the atom increases.8. The heat of the atom mounts rapidly and surpasses the external heat of itsenvironing.9. The atom radiates.10. The spheroidal wall of the atom is eventually broken down.11. The electrons or negative units seek a new centre.12. The central life escapes to merge with its polar opposite becoming itselfnegative and seeking the positive.13. This is occultly obscuration, the going-out of the light temporarily, untilit again emerges and blazes forth.More detailed elucidation will not be possible here nor advisable:It will be apparent, therefore, that it should be possible, [480] from thestandpoint of each kingdom of nature, to aid the transmuting process of alllesser atoms. This is so, even though it is not recognised; it is only when thehuman kingdom is reached that it is possible for an entity consciously andintelligently to do two things:First: aid in the transmutation of his own positive atomic centre from the humaninto the spiritual.Second: assist at the transmutationa. From the lower mineral forms into the higher forms.b. From the mineral forms into the vegetable.c. From vegetable forms into the animal forms.d. From animal forms into the human or consciously and definitely to bring aboutindividualisation.That it is not done as yet is due to the danger of imparting the necessaryknowledge. The adepts understand the transmuting process in the three worlds,and in the four kingdoms of nature, which make them a temporary esoteric threeand exoteric four.Man will eventually work with the three kingdoms but, only when brotherhood is apractice and not a concept.Three points must now be considered in this connection:Conscious manipulation of the fires.Devas and transmutation.Sound and colour in transmutation.It is necessary here to point out, as I have done in other matters underconsideration, that only certain facts can be imparted, whilst the detailed workconcerning process may not be dealt with owing to the inability of the race asyet to act altruistically. Much misapprehension crept in, owing to this verything, in the early days of hierarchical effort to give out some of the Wisdomfundamentals in book form, and this is bravely dealt [481] with by H. P. B. (158 [text00028.html#Y_FN158] ) ( 159 [text00028.html#Y_FN159] ) The danger stillpersists, and greatly handicaps the efforts of Those, Who—working on the innerside—feel that the thoughts of men should be lifted from the study of the waysof physical existence to broader concepts, wider vision, and syntheticcomprehension. Indication only is possible; it is not permissible here to giveout the transmutative formulas, or the mantrams that manipulate the matter ofspace. Only the way can be pointed to those who are ready, or who are recovering[482] old knowledge (gained through approach to the Path, or latent throughexperience undergone in Atlantean days) and the landmarks indicated holdsufficient guidance to enable them to penetrate deeper into the arcana ofknowledge. The danger consists in the very fact that the whole matter oftransmutation concerns the material form, and deva substance. Man, being not yetmaster even of the substance of his own sheaths, nor in vibratory control of histhird aspect, incurs risk when he concentrates his attention on the Not-Self. Itcan only be safely done when the magician knows five things:1. The nature of the atom.2. The keynote of the planes.3. The method of working from the egoic level through conscious control,knowledge of the protective sounds and formulas, and pure altruistic endeavour.4. The interaction of the three fires, the lunar words, the solar words, andlater a cosmic word.5. The secret of electrical vibration, which is only realised in an elementaryway when a man knows the keynote of his own planetary Logos.All this knowledge as it concerns the three worlds is in the hands of theMasters of the Wisdom, and enables Them to work along the lines of energy orforce, and not with what is usually understood when the word ‘substance’ isused. They work with electrical energy, concerning Themselves with positiveelectricity, or with the energy of the positive nucleus of force within theatom, whether it is the atom of chemistry, for instance, or the human atom. Theydeal with the soul of things . The black magician works with the negativeaspect, with the electrons, if I might so term it, with the sheath, and not withthe soul. This distinction must be clearly borne in mind. It holds the clue tothe non-interference of the [483] whole Brotherhood in material matters andaffairs, and Their concentration upon the force aspect, upon the centres ofenergy. They reach the whole through the agency of the few centres in a form.With this preamble we will now take up the consideration of theConscious Manipulation of the FiresIt will now be apparent that the whole process of transmutation, as we can dealwith it at present, concerns itself with the two fires which reached a highstage of perfection in a past solar system:a. The fire of an atom in its twofold aspect—internal and radiatory.b. The fires of mind.It is with these that transmutation concerns itself from the human standpoint,and the third fire of Spirit is not at this stage to be considered.This conscious manipulation of the fires is the prerogative of man when he hasreached a certain point in his evolution; the unconscious realisation of thishas led naturally to the attempts of the alchemist to transmute in the mineralkingdom. A few of the older students right through the ages have comprehendedthe vastness of the endeavour of which the transmutation of the baser metalsinto gold was but preliminary and a symbol, a pictorial, allegorical, concretestep. The whole subject of transmutation is covered by the work of the Hierarchyin all its three departments on this planet, and we might get some idea of thematters involved if we studied this vast hierarchical standpoint, gettingthereby a concept of the work done in aiding the evolutionary process. It is thework of transferring the life from one stage of atomic existence to another, andit involves three distinct steps, which can be seen and traced by means of thehigher clairvoyance, and from the higher planes. These steps or stages are:[484]The fiery stage —the blending, fusing, burning period, through which all atomspass during the disintegration of form.The solvent stage , in which the form is dissipated and substance is held insolution, the atom being resolved into its essential duality.The volatile stage , which concerns primarily the essential quality of the atom,and the escape of this essence, later to take a new form.Radioactivity, pralayic solution, and essential volatility might express thethought. In every transmuting process without exception these three steps arefollowed. Occultly expressed in the old Commentary they are thus stated:“The fiery lives burn within the bosom of Mother.“The fiery centre extends to the periphery of the circle and dissipationsupervenes and pralayic peace.“The Son returns to the bosom of Father, and Mother rests quiescent.”The Masters, in concert with the great Devas, concern Themselves with thistransmutative process, and each department might be considered as dealing withone of the three stages:The Mahachohan’s department in its five divisions deals with the burning of thefiery lives.The Manu’s department concerns itself with the form or the ring-pass-not whichencloses the burning lives.The Bodhisattva’s department deals with the return of the Son to the bosom ofthe Father.Within the department of the Mahachohan, a secondary division along these livesmight be outlined:The seventh and fifth Rays are occupied with the return of the Son to the Fatherand are largely centred in pouring forth energising power when it becomesnecessary to transfer the life of the Son from an old form into a new, from onekingdom of nature to another on the Path of Return. [485]The third and sixth Rays deal with the burning of the fiery lives.The fourth blends the two fires within the atomic form.It will be seen from a close study of these subdivisions, how close is theco-operation between the different groups, and how inter-related are theiractivities. The work of the Hierarchy can be interpreted always in terms ofalchemy, and Their activities deal with a threefold transmutation. This work iscarried on by Them consciously, and supervenes upon Their own emancipation.A Master transmutes in the three worlds and principally concerns Himself withthe process upon the eighteen subplanes, the great field of human evolution, andwith the passage of the life throughout the dense physical body of the Logos.The Chohans of the sixth Initiation work in the fourth and fifth ethers of thelogoic etheric body (the buddhic and atmic planes), and deal with the passage ofthe life of Spirit from form to form in those worlds, having in view thetransmutation of units in the spiritual kingdom into the monadic. Those on stillhigher levels—the Buddhas and their Confrères of the first and third Rays —dealwith the passage of the life into the sub-atomic, and atomic planes of thecosmic physical. What has been said applies to all hierarchical efforts in allschemes and on all globes, for the unity of effort is universal. In every case,conscious self-induced control, or authority, precedes ability to transmute.Initiates learn to transmute and superintend the passage of the life out of theanimal kingdom into the human after the third Initiation, and during the earlierstages of initiation, formulas that control the lesser devas, and which produceresults in the merging of the second and third kingdoms are communicated; theywork under safeguards and supervision.Advanced intellectual man should be able to co-operate in the synthesis of thework, and deal with the transmutation [486] of the metals, as the ratio of theirintellectual development to that of the mineral elements, and builders whom theywould control, is the same as in the above mentioned cases and grades ofconsciousness, but owing to the disastrous developments in Atlantean days, andthe consequent stultification of spiritual evolution for a time until karma hasbeen adjusted, the art has been lost; or rather, the knowledge has beensafeguarded until a period is reached in the racial progress wherein thephysical body is pure enough to withstand the forces contacted, and to emergefrom the process of chemical transmutation enriched, not only in knowledge andexperience, but strengthened in its own inner fibre.As time proceeds, man will gradually do four things:1. Recover past knowledge and powers developed in Atlantean days.2. Produce bodies resistant to the fire elementals of the lower kind which workin the mineral kingdom.3. Comprehend the inner meaning of radioactivity, or the setting loose of thepower inherent in all elements and all atoms of chemistry, and in all trueminerals.4. Reduce the formulas of the coming chemists and scientists to SOUND, and notsimply formulate through experiment on paper. In this last statement lies (forthose who can perceive) the most illuminating hint that it has been possible asyet to impart on this matter.It may seem that I have not communicated much information anent this consciousmanipulation of the fires. That lies in the inability of the student to read theesoteric background of the above communicated statements. Conscioustransmutation is possible only when a man has transmuted the elements in his ownvehicles; then only can he be trusted with the secrets of divine alchemy. [487]When through the latent internal fires of the matter of his own sheaths he hastransmuted the chemical and mineral atoms of those sheaths, then can hesafely—through affinity of substance—aid the work of mineral transmutation ofthe first order. Only when (through the radiatory fires of the sheaths) he hastransmuted the correspondence to the vegetable kingdom within his own organismcan he alchemically do work of the second order. Only when the fires of mind inhimself dominate, can he work with the transmutative processes of the thirdorder, or with the transference of life into the animal forms. Only when theSelf within, or the Ego in the causal body, is in control of his threefoldpersonality can he occultly be permitted to be an alchemist of the fourth order,and work in connection with the transmutation of the animal monad into the humankingdom, with all the vast knowledge that is included in that idea. Much liesahead to be accomplished, but in the appreciation of the magnitude of the taskneed be no place for discouragement, for in the wise outlining of the future, inthe cautious promulgation of knowledge concerning the necessitated stages, willcome strenuous effort and aim on the part of many aspirants, and theevolutionary bringing in of those who can achieve.The problem of speaking clearly on this subject of transmutation is a very realone, owing to the vastness of the subject and the fact that in the transmutationprocess the magician or alchemist works with deva essence through the control ofthe lesser Builders in co-operation with the greater Devas. In order, therefore,to bring about clarity of thought and definiteness of conjecture in thisrespect, I desire primarily to lay down certain postulates which must becarefully borne in mind when considering this question of transmutation. Theyare five in number and concern specifically the field wherein the transmutingprocess is carried on. The student must [488] recollect at this juncture thedistinction that is made between the work of the black and the white magician.It might be helpful here before proceeding further to look at these distinctionsas far as they concern the matter in hand:First. The white Brother deals with positive electrical energy. The dark Brotherdeals with the negative electrical energy.Second. The white Brother occupies himself with the soul of things. The blackMagician centres his attention upon the form.Third. The white Magician develops the inherent energy of the sphere concerned(whether human, animal, vegetable or mineral) and produces results through theself-induced activities of the central life, subhuman, human or super-human. Theblack Magician attains results through the agency of force external to thesphere involved, and produces transmutation through the agency of resolvents (ifso I might term it) or through the method of the reduction of the form, ratherthan through radiation, as does the white Magician.These differences of method need to be carefully considered and their reactionvisualised in connection with different elements, atoms, and forms. To return toour statement of our five postulates anent the transmutation of substance, theresolution of the life, or the transference of energy into different forms.THE FIVE POSTULATESPostulate I. All matter is living matter, or is the vital substance of devaentities. For instance, a plane, and forms built of that particular planesubstance, is the material form or sheath of a great deva, who is the essenceback of manifestation and the soul of the plane. [489]Postulate II . All forms, vibrating to any keynote, are fabricated by thebuilding devas out of the matter of their own bodies. Hence they are called thegreat Mother aspect, for they produce the form out of their own substance.Postulate III . The devas are the life which produces form-cohesion. They arethe third and second aspects blended, and might be considered as the life of allforms that are subhuman. A magician, therefore, who transmutes in the mineralkingdom works practically with deva essence in its earliest form on the upwardarc of evolution, and has to remember three things:a. The effect of the backward pull of the involutionary lives which lie back ofthe mineral, or, in effect, its heredity.b . The sevenfold nature of the peculiar group of devas which constitute itsbeing in an occult sense.c. The next transition stage ahead into the vegetable kingdom, or the occulteffect of the second kingdom on the first.Postulate IV. All deva essences and builders on the physical plane arepeculiarly dangerous to man, for they work on the etheric levels and are—as Ihave earlier pointed out—the transmitters of prana, or the vital, animatingsubstance, and hence they set loose upon the ignorant and the unwary, fieryessence which burns and destroys.Postulate V. The devas do not work as individualised conscious units throughself-initiating purposes as does a man, a Heavenly Man or a solar Logos (viewedas Egos) but they work in groups subject to:a . Inherent impulse, or latent active intelligence.b . Orders issued by the greater Builders.c . Ritual, or compulsion induced through colour and sound.[490] When these facts are remembered and considered, some comprehension of theplace the devas play in transmutation may be achieved. The position that fireoccupies in the process is of peculiar interest here, for it brings out clearlythe difference of method between the two schools.In the transmutative process as carried on by the Brotherhood, the inner firewhich animates the atom, form or man is stimulated, fanned and strengthened tillit (through its own internal potency) burns up its sheaths, and escapes byradiation from within its ring-pass-not. This is seen in an interesting way asoccurring during the process of the final initiations when the causal body isdestroyed by fire. The fire within burns up all else and the electric fireescapes. The true alchemist therefore in days to come will in every case seek tostimulate the radioactivity of the element or atom with which he is working andwill centre his attention upon the positive nucleus. By increasing itsvibration, its activity, or its positivity, he will bring about the desired end.The Masters do this in connection with the human spirit and do not concernThemselves at all with his ‘deva’ aspect. The same basic rule will be found toapply in the case of a mineral as well as of a man.The process as carried on by the Dark Brotherhood is the reverse of this. Theycentre the attention upon the form, and seek to shatter and break that form, orthe combination of atoms, in order to permit the central electric life toescape. They bring about this result through external agencies and by availingthemselves of the destructive nature of the substance (deva essence) itself.They burn and destroy the material sheath, seeking to imprison the escapingvolatile essence as the form disintegrates. This hinders the evolutionary planin the case of the life involved, delays the consummation, interferes with theordered progress of development, and puts all [491] the factors involved in abad position. The life (or entity) concerned receives a setback, the devas workdestructively, and without participation in the purpose of the plan, and themagician is in danger, under the Law of Karma, and through the materialising ofhis own substance by affinity with the third aspect. Black magic of this naturecreeps into all religions along this very line of the destruction of the formthrough outer agency, and not through the liberation of the life through innerdevelopment and preparedness. It produces the evils of Hatha Yoga in India andsimilar methods as practised in certain religious and occult orders in theOccident also. Both work with matter on some plane in the three worlds, and doevil that good may come; both control the devas, and attempt to produce specificends by manipulation of the matter of the form. The Hierarchy works with thesoul within the form and produces results that are intelligent, self-induced andpermanent. Wherever attention is centred on the form and not on the Spirit, thetendency is to deva worship, deva contact and black magic, for the form is madeof deva substance on all planes.This must be considered well in connection with every form for it holds the keyto many mysteries.We have seen how in this question of the transference of the life from form toform, the work proceeds under rule and order, and is effected through theco-operation of the devas in the first instance, and the application of externalagents to the atom or form involved, and in the second place (involving the mostimportant and lengthy stage of the procedure) through the subsequent reactionwithin the atom itself, which produces an intensification of the positiveburning centre, and the consequent escape (through radioactivity) of thevolatile essence.At all the different stages, the fire elementals perform their part, aided bythe fire devas who are the controlling [492] agents. This is so on all theplanes which primarily concern us in the three worlds—different groups of devascoming into action according to the nature of the form concerned, and the planeon which the transmutation is to take place. Electric fire passes from atom toatom according to law, and “fire by friction” responds, being the latent fire ofthe atom, or its negative aspect; the process is carried on through the mediumof solar fire, and herein lies the secret of transmutation and its mostmysterious angle. Fire by friction, the negative electricity of substance, hasbeen for some time the subject of the attention of exoteric science, andinvestigation of the nature of positive electricity has become possible throughthe discovery of radium.Keely, as H. P. B. hinted, (S.D., I, 172, 607-611) had gone far along this path,and knew even more than he gave out, and others have approached, or areapproaching, the same objective. The next step ahead for science lies in thisdirection, and should concern the potential force of the atom itself, and itsharnessing for the use of man. This will let loose upon earth a stupendousamount of energy. Nevertheless, it is only when the third factor iscomprehended, and science admits the agency of mental fire as embodied incertain groups of devas, that the force of energy that is triple, and yet one inthe three worlds, will become available for the helping of man. This lies as yetfar ahead, and will only become possible towards the end of this round; andthese potent forces will not be fully utilised, nor fully known till the middleof the next round. At that time, much energy will become available through theremoval of all that obstructs. This is effected, in relation to man, at theJudgment separation, but it will produce results in the other kingdoms of naturealso. A portion of the animal kingdom will enter into a temporary obscuration,thus releasing energy for [493] the use of the remaining percentage, andproducing results such as are hinted at by the prophet of Israel (Bible, Isiah11:6) when he speaks of “the wolf lying down with the lamb”; his comment “alittle child shall lead them” is largely the esoteric enunciation of the factthat three fifths of the human family will stand upon the Path, ‘a little child’being the name applied to probationers and disciples. In the vegetable andmineral kingdoms a corresponding demonstration will ensue, but of such a natureas to be too obscure for our comprehension.The central factor of solar fire in the work of transmutation will come to beunderstood through the study of the fire devas and elementals, who are fire, andwho are, in themselves (essentially and through active magnetic radiation), theexternal heat or vibration which produces:The force which plays upon the spheroidal wall of the atom.The response within the atom which produces radiation or the escape of volatileessence.Speaking cosmically, and regarding the solar system as itself a cosmic atom, wewould consider that:The abstractions or entities who indwell the form are “electric fire.”The material substance which is enclosed within the ring-pass-not viewing it asa homogeneous whole, is “fire by friction.”The fire devas from the cosmic mental plane (of whom Agni and Indra are theembodiers along with one whose name is not to be given) are the externalagencies who carry on cosmic transmutation.This triple statement can be applied to a scheme, a chain, or a globe also,remembering ever that in connection [494] with man the fire which is his thirdaspect emanates from the systemic mental.We have dealt in broad and general manner with this question of electricity andhave seen that fire essence or substance is resolved through internal activityand external heat in such a manner that the electric fire at the centre of theatom is liberated and seeks a new form. This is the aim of the transmutativeprocess and the fact that hitherto alchemists working in the mineral kingdomhave failed to achieve their objective has been due to three things:First. Inability to contact the central electric spark. This is due to ignoranceof certain of the laws of electricity, and above all, ignorance of the setformula which covers the range of the electrical influence of that spark.Second . Inability to create the necessary channel or “path” along which theescaping life may travel into its new form. Many have succeeded in breaking theform so that the life has escaped but they have not known how to harness orguide it and all their labour has consequently been lost.Third. Inability to control the fire elementals who are the external fire whichaffects that central spark through the medium of its environment. This inabilityis especially distinctive of the alchemists of the fifth root race who have beenpractically incapable of this control, having lost the Words, the formulas, andthe sounds. This is the consequence of undue success in Atlantean days, when thealchemists of the time, through colour and sound so entirely controlled theelementals that they utilised them for their own selfish ends and along lines ofendeavours outside their legitimate province. This knowledge of formulas andsounds can be comparatively [495] easily acquired when man has developed theinner spiritual ear. When this is the case, the transmutative processes of thegrosser kind (such as are involved in the manufacture of pure gold) willinterest him not at all and only those subtler forms of activity which areconnected with the transference of life from graded form to form will occupy hisattention.The following facts might also be pointed out:First. That every kingdom of nature has its note or tone, and the mantricsounds, which concern any transmutative process within that kingdom, will havethat note as the key or base note.Second. That the note of the mineral kingdom is the basic note of substanceitself, and it is largely the sounding of the note combinations, based on thiskey, which produces the great world cataclysms, wrought through volcanic action.Every volcano is sounding forth this note, and, for those who can see, the soundand colour (occultly understood) of a volcano are a truly marvellous thing.Every gradation of that note is to be found in the mineral kingdom which isitself divided into three main kingdoms:a . The baser metals, such as lead and iron, with all allied minerals.b . The standard metals, such as gold and silver, which play such a vital partin the life of the race, and are the mineral manifestation of the second aspect.c . The crystals and precious stones, the first aspect as it works out in themineral kingdom—the consummation of the work of the mineral devas, and theproduct of their untiring efforts.When scientists fully appreciate what it is which causes the difference betweenthe sapphire and the ruby, they will have found out what constitutes one of thestages [496] of the transmutative process, and this they cannot do until thefourth ether is controlled, and its secret discovered. As time progresses, thetransmutation, for instance, of coal into diamonds, of lead into silver, or ofcertain metals into gold, will hold no appeal for man, for it will be recognisedthat the outcome of such action would cause deterioration of the standard, andresult in poverty instead of the acquirement of riches; man will eventually cometo the realisation that in atomic energy, harnessed to his need, or in theinducing of increased radioactivity, lies for him the path to prosperity andriches. He will, therefore concentrate his attention on this higher form of lifetransference anda . Through knowledge of the devas,b . Through external pressure and vibration,c. Through internal stimulation,d. Through colour applied in stimulation and vitalisation,e. Through mantric soundshe will find the secret of atomic energy, latent in the mineral kingdom, andwill bend that inconceivable power and force to the solution of the problems ofexistence. Only when atomic energy is better understood and the nature of thefourth ether somewhat comprehended, shall we see that control of the air whichlies inevitably ahead.Third. By the discovery of the note of the vegetable kingdom, by its conjunctionwith other of nature’s notes, and by its due sounding forth in different keysand combinations will come the possibility to produce marvellous results withinthat kingdom, and to stimulate the activities of those devas who work withflowers, fruits, trees and herbs.Every root race has its own particular style of vegetation, or certain basicforms and designs which can be traced in all countries where the race locates.These [497] results are brought about by the interaction between the basic noteof the vegetable kingdom itself, and the note of the race of men who areevolving simultaneously. The union of these two notes is that which producesdistinctive vegetation, though it should be remembered that when the human notedominates too strongly it is apt to drive out the life of the forms of thissecond kingdom. The devas who work in this kingdom are a special group, and havea closer and more peculiar relation to it than have the builders or devas in anyother kingdom. The transmutative process is effected more easily in thevegetable kingdom than in any other owing to this very factor, and also to theincentive given to this second kingdom and its evolutionary process by thecoming of the Lords of the Flame from the second or Venus globe—pre-eminentlythe globe with which this kingdom has a mysterious connection. If I mightexpress it in other words: the cosmic Entity, Who is the life of the secondglobe and its informing principle, has a close connection with the solar EntityWho is the informing life of the entire vegetable kingdom. This analogy can beworked out in connection with the other kingdoms, globes and other forms andaccounts somewhat for the fact that this fourth (S. D., I, 107.) ( 163[text00028.html#Y_FN163] ) globe is above everything else the globe of humanevolution in this scheme; it gives also the clue to the mystery of the Presenceof the great Kumara Himself upon earth. These thoughts merit close attention.[498] The note of the human kingdom, sounded in quadruple intensity on thisglobe, has produced portentous happenings, and I would suggest to all occultinvestigators the close study and scrutiny of the following manifestations intime and space:1. The fourth Creative Hierarchy The human. 2. The fourth scheme Our earthscheme. 3. The fourth chain The earth chain. 4. The fourth globe Our planet. 5.The fourth kingdom The human. 6. The fourth round The first strictly humanround. 7. The four Kumaras Embodiers of humanity. 8. The fourth plane Thebuddhic, the human goal. 9. The fourth ether The physical correspondence of thebuddhic plane.One fundamental sound is responded to by all these varied factors; it is thenote that is the cause of their existence and the basis of their being. Thisnote, if sought for and found, will bring into close alliance all of thesefactors till they are blended into a great occult unity; it will bring likewiseinto co-operation the band of devas who are the essences of the fourth humanprinciple.b. Synthesis . We have seen that during the coming races and subraces certainvery definite development may be looked for in connection with manasicunfoldment; and it is worth while to note particularly that as far as theevolution of manas in this round is concerned its highest efflorescence may belooked for during the next five hundred years. The coming in of the two finalroot races marks the point of synthesis, and the gradual utilisation of thatwhich has been manasically achieved; this will be brought about by a developmentof abstract thought, and of intuitive recognition. In other words, manas has(during the past three root races) been principally applied to the understandingof objective existence, to the adaptation of the Dweller in the form to his[499] environment on the physical plane. From now on the trend of activity willbe towards the understanding of the subjective side of manifestation, andtowards the comprehension of the psyche of the individual life, divine,planetary, or human. In the next round, all the previous stages will berecapitulated, and manas will demonstrate in ways inconceivable as yet to thehalf awakened consciousness of man. In that round three-fifths of the humanfamily will be fully aware, functioning with uninterrupted continuity ofrecollection on the physical, astral, and lower mental planes. The emphasis ofmanasic evolution will be laid upon the achievement of causal consciousness, andupon the scientific construction of the bridge which should unite the causalvehicle and the permanent manasic atom on the abstract levels.During the sixth and seventh rounds we shall again have the synthesising processat work in a manner analogous to that which lies ahead in the sixth and seventhroot races of this round.To express the whole matter in larger terms: The Heavenly Man will be achievingthe consciousness of his causal body on cosmic levels, with a consequentreaction, repolarisation and alignment of His body of manifestation. Under thelaw this will work out as demonstrated quality, and ordered intelligent purposein every kingdom of nature, and will produce unifying results within thosekingdoms of a kind inexplicable to man at his present stage of manasicdevelopment. We need not, therefore, give further time to the consideration ofthem, for the mental concept of man could not measure up to the magnitude of thetheme.In summing up what I have written anent this matter of the discriminativefaculty, the intelligent activity, the adaptability nature, and thetransmutative power of manas, I would like to point out that so far-reaching arethese developments that every department of nature, macrocosmic [500] andmicrocosmic, will show forth these aspects, and show them forth in a ninefoldmanner before the consummation is achieved, and man has found his course.Let us, therefore, look for a brief moment at the microcosmic manifestation,leaving the student as far as he is able to work out analogous ideas in relationto the Heavenly Man and the solar Logos:Manasic characteristics and the planesI. On the Physical Plane : Here this quality demonstrates as:a . The selective power of the atoms of the body.b . The adaptability of the physical form to its environment and to itscircumstances.c. The ordered purpose of the informing Life, as it affects the physical formand atoms.d. The transmutative power, inherent in man though as yet unrecognised by him,which has brought him to his present stage of physical existence from that ofanimal man. It concerns also the transference of the life on to manasic levels.II. On the Astral Plane:a. The discriminative power of man to choose between the pairs of opposites.b. His adaptability to emotional conditions, and his power to attain eventualequilibrium.c . The power of man, through conscious purpose, to clear his astral body offoreign matter, and to ensure its translucence.d . The transmutative inherent power which transmutes, or transfers the lifeinto buddhic forms eventually.III. On the Mental Plane:a. In the selective power of man to choose the form through which to manifest.[501]b . His adaptability to mental currents and vibration, and his utilisation ofthem to control the lower forms.c. The working out of purpose through the medium of the two lower vehicles.Impulse emanates from the mental plane.d . The transmutative power which transforms the entire lower threefold man intoa new form, the causal body. This process of transmutation is carried on throughthe entire series of incarnations.IV. On the Abstract Levels of the Mental Plane.a. The ability of the Ego to discriminate as to time and space in the threeworlds.b. Egoic adaptation of matter and circumstance of time and environment to thespecific need under the Law of Karma.c. The ‘Intelligent Purpose’ which lies back of all physical objectivity, andwhich is seen working out in every life.d. The transmutation or transference into the Triad of the life of the Ego as itfunctions in the causal body. This results in dissociation from manifestation inthe three worlds. To effect this transmutation (which is a point at timesoverlooked) the Thinker in the causal vehicle has to do three things:1. Build and equip the causal body.2. Bring about conscious connection or control of the threefold lower naturethrough the agency of the permanent atoms.3. Bridge the interlude between the causal body on its own level, and themanasic permanent atom. [502]V. On Buddhic Levels:a. Discriminative power here demonstrates as ability to distinguish between theabstract and the concrete, and to arrive at conclusions apart from the ordinaryapparatus—the mental body and the physical brain.b. Adaptability to Hierarchical enterprise shown by the Initiate or Master, andHis receptivity to life impulses and spiritual currents emanating from theplanetary Logos of His Ray—a thing at this stage impossible of consciousrealisation.c . In the ordered purpose which guides the choice by a Master of one of theseven Paths of endeavour. Thus choice is based on KNOWLEDGE and not on desire.d . In the conscious transmutation He undertakes in the work of evolution, andin the gradual transference of His own life, and the life of His group, into themonadic aspect which is reflected in the buddhic.VI. On Atmic Levels:a. In the selective work of the adept as it relates to planetary manifestation,and the discriminative power which guides all action relating to His own planet,and the two others associated with the Earth, as a systemic triangle.b. The adaptation of groups (deva and human) to certain types of influence, andvibration, which emanate extra-systemically, and which from high cosmic levelsplay upon groups, fostering certain attributes for which we have, as yet, noterminology.c . The synthesising work of the Brahma aspect as it works out in the blendingof the four minor rays into the third major. [503]d. The transmutation which results in planetary obscuration in connection withfive of the Heavenly Men and which—as in the previous work of synthesis—concernsmicrocosmic evolution and is participated in by man. I would call attention toan interesting point: as more and more of the Monads are resolved back intotheir source it produces a gradual obscuration of the particular Heavenly Man inWhose body they are the cells. Though this may look to human vision as extendingover a profoundly long period, from the point of view of universal or groupconsciousness it is occurring NOW. For instance, such an event as theobscuration of the manifestation of the Logos of our Earth scheme is already inprocess and began in Lemurian days.VII. As regards monadic discrimination, adaptability, purpose and transmutativepower it is needless to enlarge.All these ideas and concepts are of value only in so far as they produce withinthe Thinker a more intelligent appreciation of the grandeur of the divine plan,an appropriation of the energy and force which is his by right of participationin the processes of manifestation, and a wise co-operation in the furtherance ofthe evolutionary plan as it affects him individually and his groups."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION C - THE EGOIC RAY AND SOLAR FIRE[504] I.

THE NATURE OF THE EGOIC OR CAUSAL BODYThe subject of the egoic Ray and its relation to the second fire is one of vitalimport to three types of people: Those who are interested in the truepsychology, or in the evolution of the psyche; those who are on or nearing thePath, and hence are coming more and more into touch with their own Ego; thosewho work with the souls of men, the servers of the race.The reason for this is because in the due comprehension of this subject, that ofthe Ego functioning in the causal body, comes the ability to work scientificallywith the problem of one’s own evolution, and to do good work in aiding theevolution of one’s brother.1. Egoic manifestation is produced through the medium of two fires.Let us therefore consider somewhat the subject of the egoic Ray and the causalbody, viewing it from the standpoint of the microcosm, and leaving the studentto work out for himself the analogies where the Logos is concerned, conjuringhim to bear in mind that the analogy must ever be drawn with due emphasis uponthe fact that all that the human unit can comprehend is the manifestation of thesolar Logos in a physical body.In all manifestation, as we well know, we have duality producing triplicity.Spirit meets and contacts matter; the result of that contact is the birth of theSon, or the Ego, the consciousness aspect. The egoic manifestation is thereforethe middle aspect, the place of at-one-ment, [506] and (after due evolutionarycycles) the place of balance, or of equilibrium. It should be noted that theanalogy between the Logos and man is not accurate, for man has to undergo thewhole process within the solar periphery, whilst the Logos (within thatperiphery) goes through the stage analogous to that which the man undergoes whenhis astral sheath clothes itself with etheric matter and he takes physicalincarnation, which was touched upon when considering the subject of “Fire byfriction.” It will consequently be apparent that, in considering themanifestation of the Ego, we are dealing with the point of central emphasis inman’s threefold manifestation. We are concerning ourselves with that division ofhis nature which concerns the process of making him the perfect six-pointed starduring the preliminary stage (the threefold personality and the threefold Triadmerged and blended and perfectly produced through the intermediate point thecausal body) and which, when the physical body is eliminated, makes him thefive-pointed star or perfected manasaputra.To state the whole in terms of fire: The causal body is produced by means of thepositive life, or fire, of the Spirit (electric fire) meeting the negative fireof matter, or “fire by friction”; this causes the blazing forth of solar fire.This central blaze inevitably in due course burns up the third fire, or absorbsits essence, and is itself eventually blended with the fire of Spirit and passesout of objective display.I seek here to deal with the subject of the causal body in two differentways—one along the old lines and the other strictly along the lines of occultelectrical phenomena.2. Egoic manifestation is produced at individualisation .The causal body is that sheath of mental substance which is formed at the momentof individualisation by [507] the contact of the two fires. The force or energythat pours through from the higher planes (the breath of the Monad, if you careso to term it) produces a vacuum, or something analogous to a bubble in koilon,and the sheath of the causal body—the ring-pass-not of the central Life isformed. Within this sheath are to be found three atoms, which have been termedthe mental unit, the astral permanent atom and the physical permanent atom; theycorrespond individually to the seventh principle of each of the three persons ofthe microcosmic triad, a reflection (in the three worlds of the microcosm) ofthe three Persons of the logoic Trinity. H. P. B. hints at this in connectionwith the Logos when she speaks of the visible sun being the seventh principle ofthe Brahma aspect, the physical permanent atom of the Logos. (S.D., III, 143 &I, 574)II. THE NATURE OF THE PERMANENT ATOMS1. The purpose of the permanent atoms.The three permanent atoms are in themselves centres of force, or those aspectsof the personality which hold hid the fires of substance, or of objectivity; itcannot be too strongly pointed out at this juncture that, in considering thethreefold man in the three worlds, we are dealing with substance which (inconnection with logoic manifestation) is considered the dense physical.Surrounding these three atoms is the causal sheath, answering the followingpurposes:It separates one unit of egoic consciousness from another unit of consciousness,yet is itself part of the gaseous body (the fifth cosmic physical subplane) inthe physical body of the planetary Logos, Who is the central life of anyparticular group of Monads. This fact has been little appreciated, and meritscareful consideration. [508] It holds hid spiritual potentialities in itsinherent ability to respond to the higher vibration; from the moment ofindividualisation till it is discarded at initiation, the life within steadilydevelops these potentialities, and produces certain definite results by theutilisation of the three permanent atoms. It gradually vivifies and awakens themuntil, on the three planes, the central life has an adequate point of contactwhich can originate the necessitated vibration in the matter of the plane.The permanent atoms on each plane serve a fourfold purpose as regards thecentral or egoic life:They are the distributors of a certain type of force.They are the conservers of faculty or ability to respond to a particularvibration.They are the assimilators of experience and the transmuters of that experienceinto quality. This is the direct result of the work of the egoic Ray as it playsupon the atom.They hold hid the memory of the unit of consciousness. When fully vibrant theyare the raison d’être for the continuity of the consciousness of the manfunctioning in the causal body. This distinction must be carefully made.We must always remember in studying these difficult matters that we are dealingwith the logoic dense physical body and that:The mental unit is found in logoic gaseous matter.The astral permanent atom in logoic liquid matter.The physical permanent atom in dense physical substance.And they therefore have their place in matter of the three lowest subplanes ofthe physical body of the Logos. Consequently when in the process of evolution,and through initiation, man achieves the consciousness of the Spiritual Triad,and transfers his polarisation into the three triadal [509] permanent atoms, heis simply able to function consciously in the etheric body of his particularplanetary Logos. Work out the analogy in the microcosmic development and notehow in order to function consciously in his individual etheric body a man has toburn through what has been called the etheric web, and study how the fires ofinitiation produce something analogous in the planetary etheric body, andeventually in the cosmic etheric. As each unit of consciousness, throughself-induced effort, achieves the goal and crosses the ‘burning-ground,’ amicroscopic portion of the etheric web of the planetary etheric body is consumedby fire; this results in a definite gain for that great Entity, the planetaryLogos, through the relatively unimportant liberation of the force of one cell inHis body. When all the units or cells in His body have achieved, He too is setfree from dense manifestation and physically dies . This stage is succeeded bythe comparatively brief one of etheric existence (covering the period ofplanetary obscuration), and then He is liberated from incarnation altogether.Viewing this process from the standpoint of the Logos, the Brahma aspect passesout, or the life withdraws from the physical permanent atom, leaving laterstages on cosmic levels, with which we need not concern ourselves. These coverthe withdrawal of the logoic life from out of the other two aspects. In a solarsystem, which is a physical incarnation of the Logos, the Brahma aspect isapparently the most important, it being the medium of expression, yet it is thesubjective aspect, or the life-desire of the Logos which is fundamentally ofmoment; this concerns His endeavour on high levels, and on cosmic planes beyondthe ken of the highest Chohan.It might be of value here if I pointed out that the Egoic Ray of the human unit( 167 [text00028.html#Y_FN167] ) with which we are concerning [510] ourselves,manifests as regards each ray just as does the logoic manifestation. Each of theseven Rays, viewed in connection with the causal bodies of men, demonstrates asa unity on the first subplane, as a triplicity on the second and as seven on thethird, forming there the forty-nine groups which most concern evolving man.According to the angle of vision, this numbering of groups may be increased orlessened, but for purposes of studying the aspects of mind, the aboveenumeration suffices. In the course of his many septenary lives, and as thecyclic sevens pass over him, man passes under the influence of the sevensub-rays of his own Ray. Then he begins to synthesise and merge the seven intothe major three sub-rays, returning thus to unity on his own egoic Ray.First . The septenary status governs the time from individualisation till heenters upon the Path.Second . The threefold status governs the time up till the third Initiation.Third. He achieves the unity of his Ray by the fifth Initiation, and is thenconsciously a part of the body of the Heavenly Man.The same idea can be worked out in connection with the awakening of the lifeforces within the permanent atoms, viewing each atom as the seventh principle ineach of the three aspects of the personality.2. Their Place In the Egoic Body.a. The importance of the astral permanent atom. There is one fact to be graspedin connection with the place of the permanent atom within the causal peripheryand its evolution, that needs to be emphasised with care, and that is that theastral permanent atom in this solar system is the recipient of a great flow offorce or energy, and receives more stimulation and energising than any of theothers, and this for the following reasons: [511]First. The centre of polarisation for the fourth, or human kingdom, is in theastral consciousness viewing this kingdom as a unity in expression. From theastral, and through the desire nature, the majority of men inevitably direct andcontrol the physical vehicle. The astral body is in the direct line of force viathe buddhic from monadic levels, 2-4-6.Second. The goal set before humanity is that of becoming Masters of the Wisdom,or conscious units in the Body of the Dragon of Wisdom or of Love. This a manachieves when he can function consciously in the buddhic vehicle, or when theastral permanent atom is superseded by the buddhic permanent atom.Third. The next reason is that the second aspect of the Logos (that of love orthe manifestation of the love nature of the Logos through the medium of the Son)is the one demonstrated in this system. This system is:a . A Son of Necessity, or of desireb. Vibrant to the key of the cosmic Ray of Lovec. The form through which this ray of cosmic Love (shown in the inter-relationbetween the Self and the Not-Self, or through duality) is expressing itselfd . Governed by the cosmic Law of Attraction. The monads of love are thedominating quality. (I choose this word ‘quality’ specifically.)Fourth . The centre in the cosmic body of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NOUGHT MAY BE SAIDof which our solar Logos is the embodied force is the heart centre . Here wehave one of the clues to the mystery of electricity. The sacred planets, withcertain allied etheric spheres within the ring-pass-not, are parts of that heartcentre, and are ‘petals in the Lotus,’ or in the heart centre of that greatunknown Existence Who stands to the solar Logos as He in His turn stands to theHeavenly [512] Men Who are His centres, and specially as He stands to theparticular Heavenly Man Who is the embodied force of the logoic Heart centre.Therefore, it will be apparent to the careful student that the entire force andenergy of the system and its life quality will be that which we call (havingperforce to use handicapping, misleading words) LOVE. This will account for thefact that the force that plays through that cosmic heart centre will be theparamount force found in the manifestation of a solar Logos, and of a HeavenlyMan; it will likewise produce its microcosmic analogy, and reflective reactions;hence the relative importance of the astral permanent atom within the causalperiphery. It is in the direct line of active force emanating from the cosmicexistence, and passing to it in ever lessening degree, via the solar Logos inHis system of love, and the planetary Logos within a scheme, the Dragon ofWisdom-Love.This force when rightly directed and properly controlled is the greattransmuting agency, which eventually will make of the human unit a Master of theWisdom, a Lord of Love, a Dragon of Wisdom in lesser degree.Finally: this solar system, the objective physical manifestation of the Logos,is interpenetrated by His astral body, as is the case with the humanmanifestation. As the Logos is polarised in His cosmic astral sheath and has notyet attained cosmic mental polarisation His force or desire nature is the mainincentive for the subjective Life and lives that underlie the form.If the student will ponder with care these five facts, he will get a clue to theproblems of existence as realised around us, to the causes of the heat of thesolar system, to the method of the cosmic Law of Attraction and Repulsion, whichgoverns all atomic forms, and to the question of SEX which is apparent in everykingdom of nature. They give the clue also to the constitution of the DivineHermaphrodite.[513] Therefore, it is necessary to bear in mind the relative importance of thepermanent atom of the second aspect of the personality within the causalperiphery, and to remember that the force which flows through that atom andwhich is the animating force of the astral body is following the lines of leastresistance and really might be considered as bearing upon his physicalmanifestation in a manner twice as strong as that reaching him through the othertwo. The Logos expresses Himself now through the Divine Ray, His second aspect,and this Ray is the sumtotal of the radiation of the Lords of Wisdom, theHeavenly Men, the Dragons Who are Unity and Who are Love. Through Them thisforce flows, and They in turn clothe Themselves with form, or as H. P. B.expresses it ‘The primordial Ray becomes the vahan for the Divine Ray.’ ( 168[text00028.html#Y_FN168] ) Their life animates every atom of substance whenbuilt into form, and Their life is the sumtotal of Logoic magnetism, or thegreat desire nature of the Logos going out after the Not-Self, producing thecosmic Marriage; it is the logoic demonstration of the sex appeal, His searchfor His polar opposite, and their mystic union.This process is repeated by the microcosm following the line of his being, andthis brings him likewise into incarnation, or into mystic union with form.b. The atomic triangle. The causal sheath is to the clairvoyant therefore asphere of vibrant living substance; within it can be seen three fiery points. Atthe heart of the sphere is a central blaze of light, emitting [514] rays; theserays are given as seven in number, and play upon these points or circles(analogous to the electrons in the atoms of science) and at this stage producemost effect upon the astral permanent atom. The physical permanent atom has aposition relatively close to the positive centre, and the force plays throughit, and passes on to the astral permanent atom in the form of five rays ofparti-coloured light which blend with the intensely vivid hue of the astralpermanent atom, and increase its intensity until the blaze is so excessive thatit appears to the onlooker as if the two points blended, or the two electronsmerged, and (in merging) produce such an intensity of light that they are seenas dissolving. The mental unit, having a position within the causal bodyanalogous to the planet furthermost from the sun, becomes vibrant likewise, andthe two other points (considered now as one) begin to interact with the mentalunit, and a similar process is set up and is pursued until these twopoints—circulating around their positive centre—also approach each other, blend,merge, and dissolve. The centre of positive life gathers or synthesises thethree points, and thus the three fires of the personality repeat on their tinyscale the microcosmic procedure as seen in the synthesis of electric fire, solarfire, and fire by friction, and only a blazing unit is left. This blazing unit,through the combined heat of its being, burns up the causal body, and escapesback on to the planes of abstraction. Thus man is the Path itself, and also thepilgrim upon the Path; thus does he burn, but is also the burning-ground.The analogy holds true in the case of the microcosm viewed from monadic levelsin his manifestation as Monad, Ego and Personality, and thus the process iscarried on as it concerns a Heavenly Man, and likewise a solar Logos. Should thebrain suffice to hold the concept, thus [515] is the process also on cosmiclevels for such high existences as the seven Rishis of the Great Bear, and thatstill greater Being, the ONE ABOUT WHOM NOUGHT MAY BE SAID.3. The Spirillae and the Egoic Ray.We will take up now the subject of the spirillae within the permanent atom, andsee in what manner they are affected by the egoic ray, remembering always thatwe are considering them as:First . The interior economy of the life germ on the three planes which concernman in the three worlds; second, as the seventh principle in each of the threesheaths; and third, as the positive nucleus of force which holds together thematter of the three sheaths.Let us therefore study two things:The composition of the permanent atom.The difference between the mental unit and the astral and physical permanentatoms.To do this with clarity, and so bring some kind of definite concept into beingfrom the dark regions of abstraction, let us tabulate:a. The composition of the permanent atom : The permanent atom of the astral andphysical planes is a sphere of physical or astral substance, composed of atomicmatter, and characterised by the following qualities:Responsiveness . This is its inherent power to respond to the vibration of someone of the Heavenly Men, as it is transmitted via the deva, or Brahma aspect, ofHis threefold nature. The permanent atom finds its place within the sphere ofinfluence of one or other of the great devas who are the Raja-Lords of a plane.Form Building Power . These devas sound forth two syllables of the threefoldmicrocosmic word and are each (on their own plane) the coherent agency whichgathers [516] substance into form, and attracts matter for purposes ofobjectivity. The astral sound produces the microcosmic ‘Son of Necessity,’ andwhen it reverberates on the physical plane produces physical incarnation, andthe sudden appearance on etheric levels of the seven centres. The building ofthe dense physical is the result of consequent automatic action in deva essence,for it must ever be borne in mind that man is essentially (as regards thephysical plane) an etheric being, and his dense physical body is esotericallyregarded as ‘below the threshold’ and is not considered a principle.Relative Permanency. In the seventh principle of all manifesting entities isstored up and developed capacity, acquired ability, and the atomic memory, or inother words the heredity of the Thinker, viewing him from the physicalstandpoint or from the emotional. There is no permanence whatever in thesheaths; they are built into temporary forms, and dissolved when the Thinker hasexhausted their possibilities, but the seventh principle of each sheath gathersto itself the achieved qualities and stores them up—under the Law of Karma—towork out again and to demonstrate as the plane impulse at each fresh cycle ofmanifestation. This permanency is itself likewise only a relative one, and asthe inner fire within the atom burns more brightly, as the external fires of theego or solar fire beat upon it with ever increasing intensity, the atom in duetime is consumed, and the inner blaze becomes so great that it destroys itsencompassing wall.Heat. Herein lies the distinction between the permanent atoms on all planes, andthe atomic matter of which they form a part. It is not easy to make thisdistinction clear, nor is it desirable at this time; the true facts of the caseare one of the guarded secrets of initiation, but the distinction between thepermanent atom, and atomic matter, may be somewhat comprehended if we state:[517]The permanent atom is one that has been appropriated by one of the lives thatform the centres in the body of a solar Lord, whilst atomic matter per se goesto the formation of other parts of His great body of light.A permanent atom is one which has come under the attractive power of the secondaspect, whilst atomic matter itself is vitalised by the life of the thirdaspect.A permanent atom follows the line of the least resistance of force, and ispassing out of the control of the Deva Lord and coming under the control ofpositive life. This concerns the evolution of consciousness in substance.A permanent atom comes under the direct control of the lower of the three groupsof Lipika Lords, and is the agency through which They work in the imposition ofkarma upon the particular entity who may be utilising it. They work directlywith the permanent atoms of men, and produce results through the agency of formuntil they have exhausted the vibratory capacity of any particular atom; whenthis is the case the atom passes into the stage of obscuration, as does theseventh principle of any sheath. It comes under the influence of the firstaspect, manifesting as the Destroyer.Remember that in these affirmations we are concerning ourselves with themicrocosm, and with the permanent atoms which are related to him; as regards thesolar Logos manifesting in the system, we are concerned with but one permanentatom, and this is His physical permanent atom. It is thus true that within thepermanent physical atom of the solar Logos lies hid the ability to respondconsciously to the vibration of all the planes, lies hid the secret of thekarmic purpose of His incarnation, [518] and lies concealed the mystery of Hisfunctional activity; but we cannot penetrate the secret as yet of His threelower permanent atoms as they function as a unity within His causal vehicle.Until we can do this it is useless for us to conjecture as to His fundamentalBeing.The difference between them: The mental unit is in a unique and peculiarposition as regards man, the Thinker in the causal body. This point will bediscussed shortly, suffice it to say here that its mystery lies hid in thenature of the Heavenly Men Themselves. The following correspondence holds thekey to this mystery, but it can only be indicated, leaving it to the student towork out the truth for himself. On the three planes of logoic manifestation—thehighest three—we have the three aspects manifesting; on the buddhic plane, thefourth cosmic ether, we have the logoic etheric centres demonstrating, or thoseforce vortices which animate the three lower planes of the dense physicalmanifestation. In connection with the Heavenly Men we have a secondarymanifestation, and on the buddhic plane we have Their third aspect found,leaving for Their paramount manifestation of force, the cosmic gaseous plane, orthe manasic plane; They are essentially the divine Thinkers, the Manasaputras.In connection, therefore, with the Microcosm, viewing him as part of a centre inthe body of a Heavenly Man, we have a lesser descent within the gaseous or firemanifestation of a solar Lord. This concerns the three higher subplanes of whatmight be considered as the manifestation of Man’s three higher aspects in mentalmatter, whilst on the fourth subplane we have the mental centres of man withinthe periphery of his mental body, of which the mental unit is the unifyingfactor. This is—as has been earlier said—a deep mystery, and one that can be nofurther amplified.b. The Planes and Fiery Energy. It seems desirable [519] that we should herediscuss the analogies on each plane, (169 [text00028.html#Y_FN169] ) with theseven sub-planes, reminding the student that we are speaking of the planes asthe field of evolution of a solar Logos, and not only as a field for thedevelopment of man. In the solar system we have:First, the three higher planes, which have been rightly called the planes of thethree aspects; second, the seventh logoic principle is on the first plane, andwe can consider it as the impulse in physical matter which produced His body ofobjectivity.On the second plane are found the seven Heavenly Men, Who are His principalcentres of force. There are others, but we are not here concerned with Them.These latter have achieved a certain specific goal, and are the [520] embodimentof centres which are now quiescent or out of manifestation, the logoic kundalinihaving turned its attention elsewhere. Under another enumeration they make theten of the esoteric life, and can also be enumerated as twelve, thus forming thetwelve-petalled Lotus, or the heart centre in the Body of the ONE ABOUT WHOMNOUGHT MAY BE SAID.On the fourth cosmic ether the buddhic plane, are found the etheric centres ofthe Logos. There are to be found the esoteric planets and the Sun, viewed as thecentre of the buddhic principles, and from thence the Logos animates His densephysical manifestation.Finally, on the three lower planes we have His gaseous, liquid, and dense bodiesor sheaths, forming in themselves a unity in one peculiar sense; they are asmuch a coherent whole as the three higher planes form a unified tripleexpression of the three persons of the Trinity.We have a similar analogy in the subplanes of each plane in the system, and thiswill become ever more apparent as man achieves a greater clarity of vision, andcan consciously ascertain for himself the truth about the subjective life. Letus briefly take these planes and study the life or force manifestation on each,laying the emphasis upon the lower four, and not so much upon the planes whichdo not concern man so closely.The Logoic Plane. The first, the second, and the third subplanes of the firstcosmic ether respond specifically to the vibration of one of the three aspects,or to those cosmic Entities Whose influence reaches the matter of the planesfrom without the system altogether. On the fourth subplane comes a primaryblending of the three fiery Lives, producing archetypally that forcemanifestation of electricity which eventually causes the blazing forth of theSons of Light on the next plane. In this electrical connotation we have thethree higher planes ever embodying the threefold Spirit aspect, the lower [521]three embodying the threefold substance aspect, and then a plane of at-one-mentwhereon an approximation is made which, on the path of return, marks the momentof achievement, and the point of triumph. This is succeeded by obscuration.Hence on every plane in the solar system we have a fourth plane whereon thestruggle for perfect illumination, and subsequent liberation takes place, thebattle ground, the Kurukshetra. Though for man the fourth plane, the buddhic, isthe place of triumph, and the goal of his endeavour, for the Heavenly Man it isthe battle-ground, while for the solar Logos it is the burning-ground.This differentiation of the subplanes of the systemic planes into a higherthree, a lower three, and a central plane of harmony is only so from thestandpoint of electrical phenomena, and not from the standpoint of either pureSpirit, or pure substance, viewed apart from each other. It concerns the mysteryof electricity, and the production of light. The three higher planes concern thecentral Forces or Lives, the three lower concern the lesser Forces or Lives. Wemust bear this carefully in mind, remembering that to the occultist there is nosuch thing as substance, but only Force in varying degrees, only Energy ofdifferentiated quality, only Lives emanating from different sources, eachdistinctive and apart, and only Consciousness producing intelligent effectthrough the medium of space.I would point out that the Lord Agni shows forth His fiery life on the atomicsubplane of each plane; He shows forth as solar fire on the second, third andfourth, and as ‘fire by friction’ on the fifth, sixth and seventh. From thepoint of view of the microcosm, the Spark in the Flame, man demonstrates aselectric fire on the second plane, or the second cosmic ether; as solar fire onthe third, fourth and the three higher subplanes of the fifth [522] plane, andas fire by friction on the lower subplanes of the fifth, on the sixth, andseventh planes.c. The Planes and the Three Fires. On every plane we have, relatively speaking:a . Electric fire demonstrating as the prime condition on the higher three.b. Fire by friction as the most significant factor on the lower three.c . Solar fire, showing forth as the blaze produced by union on the centralplane.In the solar system this is to be seen in connection with a Heavenly Man on thebuddhic plane, where They blaze forth through Their etheric centres. Inconnection with man on the mental plane, we have a similar condition: the threehigher subplanes concern the Spirit aspect in the causal body, the three lowersubplanes concern primarily the mental sheath, or fire by friction; the fourthsubplane is that on which the force centres of the mental body are to be found.So it is on the physical plane for man—his etheric centres being located inmatter of the fourth ether.Each of the three Persons of the Trinity manifests equally as does a man, asSpirit, Soul or Ego, and Substance. In connection with Brahma, we have theSpirit aspect animating the three higher subplanes of every plane, or the firstfire aspect. His soul aspect is found on the fourth subplane of each planewhereon are situated the etheric centres of all manifested entities. Hissubstance aspect is primarily contacted on the three lower subplanes. Hence wehave the forty-nine fires of matter, or the seven fires of each plane, the unionof the higher three and the lower three producing that blaze which we call thewheels of fire or the centres on the fourth subplane of each plane.In connection with the second aspect there is a similar [523] condition. Solarfire blazes forth in its electrical aspect on the second plane, and demonstratesthus also on the third and fourth planes, but finds its central demonstration onmanasic levels, shining through the causal vehicles of the egoic groups. Onlytwo and a half planes then remain through which the fire by friction aspect maymanifest, eighteen subplanes in all which concern the third aspect of the secondPerson of the logoic Trinity.For man, the microcosm, a similar differentiation is possible; His Monad can bestudied in its threefold essence on its own plane, his egoic aspect likewise,and the Brahma aspect of the Ego is found within the permanent atoms. Studentsshould therefore study with care:1. The Planes . The manifestation of Brahma, the third or substance aspect, andshould apply to this Entity the same triple constitution as is apparent in theother two. The planes of electric fire, the planes of his lower nature, and thepoint of blazing forth or conflagration for him (the etheric centres) must becarefully studied. Brahma is the positive life of matter; He is the revelationof substance and the blaze that can be seen.2. Vibration. The manifestation of the second aspect. These vibrations ofconsciousness are the major three words which are the sumtotal of egoic life,the minor three which govern the third aspect of the Ego, and the chord ofat-one-ment which is that which is sounding forth now.The three aspects of Spirit as they are seen can only be expressed in terms ofthe other two in this solar system, and of their nature extra-systemicallynought can profitably be said at this stage of cognition.The above thoughts upon the planes, and the ninefold nature of all that is, takeone into regions as yet almost beyond the grasp of man; yet only when thesubstance [524] aspect is studied by the scientist in its triple nature willtruth be approximated, and the true nature of electrical phenomena becomprehended; then and only then will electricity be harnessed and utilised byman as a unity, and not just in one of its aspects as at present; the negativeelectricity of the planet is all that is as yet contacted for commercialpurposes. It must be remembered that this term is used in the sense of negativein relation to solar electricity. When man has found out how to contact andutilise positive solar electricity in combination with negative planetaryelectricity, we shall have a very dangerous condition brought about, and one ofthe factors which will eventually manifest in the destruction of the fifth rootrace by fire. At that great cataclysm—as the Bible says “the Heavens will meltwith fervent heat.” (Bible. II Peter, 3:10.) This will be seen in a stillgreater degree in the next round, and will cause that destruction by fire of theforms of the men who have failed, which will liberate the lives on a stupendousscale, and thus temporarily ‘purify’ the Earth from elements which would tend tohinder the evolutionary process. As the cycles pass away, the balancing of thesefiery currents will be gradually brought about, and will result in a planetarycondition of harmony, and of esoteric equality, which will provide idealenvironment for harmonious man.Only when the soul aspect is studied by the psychologist in its threefoldessential nature will the mystery of consciousness become apparent, and thenature of the three magnetic groups, in their various subdivisions with theirconsequent effectual radiation become a factor in the public life. This concernsitself with the definite development of the psyche under law, with thescientific expansion of the consciousness, and will eventually bring aboutconditions wherein the work, preliminary to the first initiation, will be purelyexoteric, and no longer[525] part of an esoteric process. In due course of time,it will be found that the self-induced efforts whereby a man consciouslyprepares his centres for the application of the Rod of Initiation at the firstInitiation, will be the subject of books, and of lectures, and form part of theordinary thought of the masses. This again will eventuate in a cleavage betweenthe two groups in the middle of the fifth round. It must be remembered that thiscleavage will be part of a natural process, and not a drastic ruling, imposedupon an unwilling people. The KNOWERS and the students of the Knowledge—actuatedby group consciousness, and working consciously—will separate themselves ingroup formation from those who know not, and from those who care not. Thiscleavage will be self-induced, and a natural outgrowth of the group life; itwill in itself be of a temporary nature for the fundamental aim in view will bethe bringing about of an eventual closer merging; it will mark primarily theline of demarcation between the lower four Rays of consciousness, and the higherthree. It is also a mystery hid in the relationship between the four exotericKumaras, (S.D., I, 116, 493; II, 112, 149) and the esoteric three, and from thepoint of view of man separates those who are developing the consciousness of theTriad from those who as yet are living the life of the Quaternary. It concernsthose who respond to the solar Lords, distinguishing them from those whorecognise as yet only the control of the lunar Lords. In terms of Fire: thosewho warm themselves by means of fire by friction and respond not to the heat ofsolar fire remain within the cavern, thus living in the dark; whilst those whosebeing is irradiated by the Sun of Wisdom, and who bask in the rays of solar heatdwell in the light, and enjoy an ever increasing freedom, and vital existence.The true significance of the three aspects of Spirit is only becoming apparentto the initiate of high degree, [526] and cannot be expressed in words, norcomprehended by man before he has passed out of the human kingdom into thespiritual. Therefore, it is needless for us to pause here to consider it atgreater length.We might sum up the matter in terms of the Old Commentary from which source H.P. B. quoted so often:“The Blessed Ones hide Their threefold nature, but reveal Their triple essenceby means of the three great groups of atoms. Three are the atoms, and threefoldthe radiation. The inner core of fire hides itself and is known only throughradiation and that which radiates. Only after the blaze dies out and the heat isno longer felt can the fire be known.”We can now resume our consideration of the mystery of the mental unit, and notewherein it differs from the other permanent atoms; we might then brieflysummarise a mass of esoteric information anent the permanent atoms, which willsuffice for many years to come as the basis of investigation for occultstudents. The permanent atoms, and their internal economy, will remain a mysteryfor a long time, and only a few general indications can here be given.The fundamental difference between the mental unit and the other two atomsconsists in the fact that it contains only four spirillae instead of seven. Thisis brought about by the very facts of evolution itself, for the mental unit isthe first aspect of the personality triad, or of man functioning, in the humankingdom on the three lower planes. At his transference into the spiritualkingdom, these three aspects—the mental body, the astral body, and the physicalbody—are synthesised into the higher by a dual process:1. His polarisation shifts from out of the lower three atoms into the Triadalatoms.2. The force which these atoms generate and embody is merged and blended intothe higher force points.[527] A permanent atom is the positive nucleus or germ substance to the sheathwherein it is found. It is that which is the basis of form-building, and it isliterally a vibrant point of force, emanating from the second aspect of theMonad, which aggregates to itself, and subsequently builds into form, thenegative or third aspect. But it must here be remembered that this second aspectis itself dual, and that in considering the permanent atoms we are dealing withthe feminine aspect of the second Person. The spirillae therefore are butstreams of force, or second aspect vitality which circulates geometricallywithin the circumscribing wall of substance, composed of third aspect force orsubstance. What has been said of objectivity, or of the cosmic atom can beequally well predicated of the permanent atom of man the microcosm:“The primordial ray is the vehicle of the divine Ray.” (S.D., I, 108) Negativeforce forms a receptacle for positive force. Atoms are but force centres, andthe centres as we know of them are but aggregates of force points which havereached a specific point in evolution, and are responding to the first greataspect in some degree, or to electric fire.This sentence, is one to be seriously pondered, for it holds hid muchinformation for the student, and when duly comprehended will result in the lightof knowledge being shed upon the problems of manifestation. It concerns thesecret of the position of the different kingdoms of nature within the logoicbody, and their place and part, for all depends upon the type of force whichanimates, upon the interplay of that force in substance, upon the dual, triple,or united aspect of force, and upon its septenary demonstration inform-building.Every atom is a focal point of force, the force of substance itself, the life orvitality of the third aspect, the [528] life of that cosmic Entity Who is to theLogos the negative aspect of electricity.Every form ( 173 [text00028.html#Y_FN173] ) and aggregate of atoms, is simply aforce centre produced by the action of positive force and its interaction withnegative energy. It is the vitality of the second aspect working in conjunctionwith the third, and producing—in time and space—that illusion or maya whichtemporarily blazes forth, and attracts attention, creating the impression thatmatter is a concrete something. There is no such thing as concretion in reality;[529] there is only force of different kinds, and the effect produced onconsciousness by their interplay.Back of all forms and of all substances (as yet but little contacted andrealised) lies a third type of force, which utilises these two other factors toproduce eventual harmony, and which is itself on its own plane the sumtotal ofthe second. It can be called:a. The one synthesising Life.b . Electric fire.c. The point of equilibrium.d. Unity or harmony.e . Pure Spirit.f. Dynamic Will.g . Existence.It is a Force, working through a dual manifestation of differentiated force,through the energy of matter, the coherency of forms, through force centres, andforce points. It is FOHAT in triple demonstration, of which the final or thirdis as yet unknown and inconceivable.This brings me to the consideration of the fact earlier stated that the mentalunit possesses but four of the streams of force. Each of the streams of force inthe permanent atoms vibrates to the note of a particular subplane, and serves asthe medium for the vitalisation of the matter of the subplane, which is builtinto any particular body around a permanent atom. It is the force of theHeavenly Man as it animates the cells of His form, and holds them as a coherentunity. Here it must be remembered that, from the point of view of the microcosm,the aspect of pure Spirit or of Electric Fire remains in this solar system as anabstraction. A man can attain group consciousness; he can vibrate to the note ofthe Heavenly Man in Whose body he is a cell; he can demonstrate in relativeperfection fire by friction and solar fire, but it remains for a latermahamanvantara to reveal [530] the true nature of Spirit. Therefore in man,functioning in the human family, this fact is apparent and the correspondence tobe seen. Until he passes out of the three worlds, and until he becomes a Masterof the Wisdom, he has this truth concealed in these three aspects. The mental isnot a septenary permanent atom, but only responds to four types of force, andnot to the entire range of vibrations. Herein lies a reason for tolerance. Untila man is coming consciously under the control of the Ego and is beginning tosense the vibration of the manasic permanent atom, it is useless to expect himto respond to certain ideals, or to grasp certain aspects of truth. The mentalunit suffices for his need, and no bridge exists between it and the manasicpermanent atom.Two and a half planes are concerned with the evolution of man, per se, in thefourth kingdom, and he only begins to transcend them as he nears the Path andtreads it. From the standpoint of average man in physical incarnation, the egoicconsciousness, within the causal periphery, is as abstract as is the Logosviewed as the Dweller within the system. These two and a half planes are ofpeculiar interest to the Logos, as they embody:That which, for Him, lies below the threshold of consciousness.Those centres from which logoic kundalini is turning.That which is not considered a principle.That which is gradually passing into obscuration.It is impossible to enlarge further upon this mystery.4. Summary.Before proceeding further, however, it might be well to sum up some of the factsanent the spirillae and the atom, and then we can take up the subject of thecausal body and man, the individual. [531]1. The four lower spirillae are definitely under the influence of thepersonality Ray.2. The fifth and sixth spirillae are more specifically under the egoic Ray,whatever that Ray may be.3. The fifth spirilla has a peculiar value inasmuch as it synthesises the lowerfour. It is the third when counting the streams of spiral force from thestandpoint of the atomic pole. It vibrates to five types of force.4. The spirillae are literally ten in number, three major and seven minor. Butfrom the unity point of view, they are the four and the major three, theremaining lesser three being counted as one with their major, inasmuch as theyare direct reflections.5. The permanent atoms are not heart-shaped as portrayed in certain books. Acertain number of atoms are of that type but they are not the permanent atomswhich are more definitely spheroidal and are slightly flattened at the top,where the correspondence to the polar depression may be found, and equallyflattened at the under surface.6. The arrangement of the spirillae within the permanent atoms varies on eachplane and the ones most frequently described are those of the physical plane.The arrangement of these tiny force vortices and their internal economy on eachplane is one of the secrets of initiation and may not be revealed. One hint onlymay be given to guide the student: The astral permanent atom has its internalstreams of force arranged so that the spirals do approach quite closely theconformation of a heart, though the pointed end is eliminated. The buddhicpermanent atom has its spirillae arranged so as to form approximately a figureeight with a central stream bisecting the double spiral.7. The closer the approach to reality the simpler will be found the arrangementof the spirilla. These streams of force show a septenary arrangement in the[532] lower three permanent atoms of man, while the higher three contain butthree spirillae—the major three.8. It should be noted that there are but six permanent atoms connected withhuman evolution, while a Heavenly Man has but five, and even then only one inthe solar system. (The mystery of a planet and its central life has not yet beenrevealed. It is connected with another manifestation of which as yet nought isknown.)9. It should be remembered that we are dealing with a physical incarnation ofthese great Entities and that Their permanent atoms, with the exception of thephysical, are extra-systemic.10. The causal body of the Heavenly Men is upon the third subplane of the cosmicmental plane, while that of the solar Logos and those of the three Persons ofthe logoic Trinity are upon the first subplane.11. The permanent atoms of men are upon the atomic subplane of each plane, withthe one exception of the mental unit. Those of the animal groups are upon thesecond subplane; those of the vegetable groups are upon the third subplane;those of the mineral groups are upon the fourth subplane. There is, therefore, aclose analogy between these focal points of force of the group—human orotherwise—and a chain, a globe, and a round, and in their due application comesenlightenment. The sumtotal of the permanent atoms of any particular kingdomform the streams of force or spirillae in the greater atoms of solar entities orof lunar entities, while the sumtotal of the permanent atoms of man in thespiritual kingdom (the three triadal atoms, atma-buddhi-manas) form the spiralstreams of force within certain centres.12. As the permanent atoms become radioactive in due course of evolution, theresult within the centre is a marked increase of vibration.13. The permanent atoms concern solar entities when they are found on or abovethe higher mental. They [533] concern lunar entities on the lower mental, theastral and the physical planes.14. It should be noted that in this solar system the following entities manifestthrough:I. One permanent atom . . . the physical .1. A solar Logos.2. The three major Rays, or Lords of Aspect.3. The seven Heavenly Men.4. The forty-nine Regents of the planetary chains.II. Two permanent atoms . . . the physical and the astral .1. The seven Lords of the globes in every chain.2. The forty-nine Root Manus.3. The seventy-seven Embodiers of form—a group of solar Lords Who are concernedwith form building, working primarily on the first ray.4. Certain of the Avatars, Who are selected by the Logos to carry a certain typeof force at stated intervals and thus further the evolution of the psyche.III. Three permanent atoms . . . physical, astral, and mental.1. The Lords of the third Kingdom, the animal. They are seven Entities whosebodies are made up of animal souls just as the Heavenly Men embody for man theBuddhic principle, so these lords embody for the animal kingdom the manasicprinciple, which is the goal of the evolutionary process for them.2. Certain great entities who embody a whole range of existences upon five ofthe planets, of which the earth is not one, but who in due course of time willcome to be recognised as having a powerful effect upon man on the earth, via thethree Buddhas of Activity. A hint as to this esoteric influence comes to man inthe close connection existing between the Earth and Mercury. As yet it is notpossible to enlarge further.3. The entities who are the sumtotal of those group souls who contain definitepermanent triads. Nine triads constitute the body of one of these entities.1V. Through four permanent atoms . . . physical, astral, mental and buddhic.1. Eight groups of solar Entities Who form the subjective life of the sevencentres in the body of Brahma, viewing Him as a separate cosmic Entity, [534]dissociated from His two brothers. They are the seven Sons of Fohat, with theeighth Son included, and They are the final differentiation of the forty-ninefires, prior to Their union with the fire of Eros. Thus is it expressed by H. P.B. (S.D.,I, 139,144)2. That Entity Who works through the FORM of a planetary occult Hierarchy, usingit as His body of manifestation, and regarding it as the centre through whichHis force can flow. It should be remembered that all such groups on every planetform a vehicle for the life of a great Individual Who gives to that Hierarchyits distinctive colouring and its unique keynote.3. A number of solar Deities Who are the radiators of solar magnetism, and thelife of form.4. A peculiar group of Beings connected with a certain constellation and thelesser Dragon, who have their habitat on Neptune and work with the sixthprinciple in the solar system. They take physical form, animated by purifieddesire, controlled by mind, and are the dispensers of love-wisdom by means ofcertain of the “Halls of Wisdom” on the various planets. The words “Halls ofWisdom” in their esoteric significance describe a stage of consciousness not alocation.V. Through five permanent atoms . . . physical, astral, mental, buddhic andatmic .1. The Lords of certain subplanes who work under the Raja-Lord of a plane andwho are themselves vibration and activity.2. The lesser Heavenly Men on the buddhic level, Who reflect Their higherprototypes on the second plane of the system.3. The entities who are the sum-total of group consciousness on egoic levels,remembering that these groups are differentiated and are formed of aggregates ofseven, until there are formed forty-nine groups of seven egoic vehicles formingone group which is the body of this lesser solar Deity. There is a multiplicityof these groups of forty-nine. This has been somewhat stated before when it hasbeen [535] announced that a Master with His particular band of disciples andinitiates form a group or force centre. These groups have their permanent atomsas do all lives seeking objective expression.4. The entities who are the sumtotal of the vegetable kingdom in its diversityof manifestation in different globes, chains and schemes.VI. Through six permanent atoms . . . physical, astral, two mental, buddhic andatmic.MAN.All that is here stated is an enlargement of the data given about the “Army ofthe Voice,” (S.D., I, 121) and an endeavour to show that many diverse lives (allembodying lesser lives, or embodied in greater ones themselves) are to be foundwithin the various schemes. We have dealt only with those likewise which aresuperhuman or human, with those who have been or are MEN. We have not dealt withthe subhuman, or with the lunar lords or lesser pitris, for their day is notyet, and they progress as the tide of evolution progresses, unconsciously andnot self-consciously. We have dealt with these entities and their permanentatoms in connection with their manifestation in a solar system, and have notcarried it beyond the solar ring-pass-not. All the permanent atoms concernphysical matter and manifestation. The highest permanent atom of man, the atmic,is, after all, an atom of the third cosmic ether, and this should be ponderedupon and studied. We have considered these various personalities (and the word‘personality’ is chosen deliberately, for what are They but personalities, orBeings, in physical incarnation?) from the standpoint of Their lowest forcepoint first. We have discussed the permanent atom as a point of contact with theforce of a plane, of a planet, of a chain, of a scheme, or of a system. Thisshould ever be borne in mind.It is to be recognised that much that is written above [536] may seemincomprehensible, but when scientists come to understand and regulate force ,that which is written here will become plainer; it will be seen that we havedealt with the positive force in all negative forms above, and including thehuman kingdom.III. THE EGOIC LOTUS( 176 [text00028.html#Y_FN176] )We must now deal with the subject of the causal body on its own plane from thepoint of view of FIRE. We have studied it briefly from the more ordinary angle,and in materialistic terms, considering it as a vehicle of rarefied substance,containing within itself the seventh principle of each of the two lower sheathsof the microcosm, and the mental unit. This latter is that which embodies thefirst aspect in manifestation, and which is analogous to the first logoicaspect—one that in this solar system does not come to full demonstration.I would like to point out here that in studying the solar system as the physicalmanifestation of a solar Logos, we are investigating:a. The physical permanent atom of a solar Logos as contained within the logoiccausal body on its own plane.b. The seven types of force, or the seven logoic spirillae within that permanentatom. This, if realised, [537] gives a new outlook upon the subject of planevibration.c. The close correspondence between the planes and the seven spirillae in thepermanent atom of a solar Logos.We have touched upon these spirillae and their function very briefly, and cannow approach the question of the egoic Ray and the fire of mind from thesubjective point of view, or in terms of fire.1. Centres or Wheels of Energy.a. Centres of force. We shall again reach the clarity of vision desirable if westudy the subject of monadic development from the angle of vision of the humanunit. It has been taught in many occult text books that man has seven centres offorce (or ten, according to some calculations); that three of these centres areparamount, and eventually synthesise the other four, or absorb their force orenergy. This produces their eventual obscuration, or their passing out ofmanifestation; they occultly ‘die.’ This is paralleled in the logoic centres,the planetary schemes, which also in due course of time pass into obscuration,and transmit their energy to the major three schemes. The three main centres inthe Microcosm are the Head, the Heart and the Throat.1. The Head centre The Monad Will Spirit. 2. The Heart centre The Ego LoveConsciousness. 3. The Throat centre The Personality Activity Matter.It will, therefore, be apparent that just as in man these centres are related tothe threefold spiritual man in his total development, so the three types ofcentres—microcosmic or macrocosmic—come gradually more and more under thevitalising power of one of the three aspects of the Logos. These centres arerecognised also as focal points of active force, manifesting to the vision [538]of the clairvoyant as fiery wheels or the flaming petals of a lotus.b. The causal body . . . monadic heart centre. In studying the egoic body itshould be remembered that the causal body is the correspondence in the monadicmanifestation to the heart centre . It is a flaming wheel of fire within themonadic auric egg, which embraces the five planes of monadic manifestation; itis also seen as the twelve-petalled Lotus. Of these twelve petals, the innermostthree are unrevealed, or are embryonic, and hence the causal body is frequentlyconsidered as a nine-petalled Lotus, or as a wheel of fire with only nine spokesor whorls. This is essentially true as regards the evolutionary process, butwhen a man has succeeded in awakening or unfolding the nine petals, or inarousing the fire of the nine spokes or whorls (which is practically consummatedat the three major Initiations) the inner three are revealed. They respond tothe monadic vibration, to the aspect of pure Spirit; it is the stimulation orrevelation of these inner petals, by the One Initiator at the third and fourthInitiations which brings about the final conflagration and the blazing up of thecausal body with the subsequent liberation of the central positive Life or Fire.2. The Twelve-Petalled Egoic LotusSolar Fire is dual. It is the fire of matter or substance and the fire of mindblended. This makes man the six-pointed Star of Light, for each of these firesis triple. The fire of mind is also in essence dual, bringing in anothertriplicity, thus making the nine. When a man has awakened the nine fires, andhas unfolded the nine petals, and when he has received the stimulus which isimparted at initiation, through being brought into conscious contact with theelectric spark of his own particular Heavenly Man, they all blend and merge. The[539] inner three which complete the twelve, and which are concerned with thefinal, and essentially spiritual stages, of his evolution, are really relatedmore intimately to the evolution of the Heavenly Man, and are connected with thestimulus which He receives Himself in contacting the logoic electric spark, orthe pure Spirit aspect of the Logos.It should here be noted that this ninefold development is hinted at in theSecret Doctrine in the various places where H. P. B. deals with the Kumaras (S.D., II, 257.) or the Heavenly Men, of Whom the microcosm is a reflection. Shecalls Them the Lords of Knowledge, the Lords of Love and the Lords of Sacrifice.Each of Them is a nine-petalled Lotus in the logoic body. They are the flamingWheels, and in Their various names, as found in the Secret Doctrine , may bediscovered the clue to the mystery. Let us realise this clearly, nevertheless,as regards the microcosm, and later extend the idea to the Heavenly Men. Let uspicture the nine-petalled egoic lotus, the heart centre in the monadicconsciousness, unfolding each of its petals in groups of three upon the threesubplanes of the higher mental. Their unfoldment is worked out through theevolutionary process, undergone on the three planes in the three worlds, orwithin the three Halls of Ignorance, of Learning, and of Wisdom.a. First Group of Petals—Knowledge Petals:1. The Petal of Knowledge for the physical plane. Through the breaking of theLaw and the ensuing suffering the price of ignorance is paid and knowledge isachieved. This unfoldment is brought about through physical plane experience.2. The Petal of Love for the physical plane. Unfolds through physicalrelationships, and the gradual growth of love from love of self to love ofothers. [540]3. The Petal of Sacrifice for the physical plane. This unfoldment is broughtabout through the driving force of circumstances, and not of free will. It isthe offering up of the physical body upon the altar of desire—low desire tobegin with, but aspiration towards the end, though still desire. As man in theearly stages of his evolution is polarised on the physical, much of this isundergone unconsciously and without any realisation of what is beingconsummated, but the result in the causal body is seen in a twofold increase ofheat or of activity:The physical permanent atom becomes radioactive or a radiant point of fire.The lower three petals become vibrant and begin to unfold until fully developed.b. Second Group of Petals—Love Petals:1. The Petal of Knowledge, for the astral plane; unfoldment is brought about bythe conscious balancing of the pairs of opposites, and the gradual utilisationof the Law of Attraction and Repulsion. The man passes out of the Hall ofIgnorance where, from the egoic point of view, he works blindly and begins toappreciate the effects of his physical plane life; by a realisation of hisessential duality he begins to comprehend causes.2. The Petal of Love for the astral plane; unfoldment is brought about throughthe process of gradually transmuting the love of the subjective nature or of theSelf within. This has a dual effect and works through on to the physical planein many lives of turmoil, of endeavour and of failure as a man strives to turnhis attention to the love of the Real.3. The Petal of Sacrifice for the astral plane; unfoldment is brought about bythe attitude of man as he [541] consciously endeavours to give up his owndesires for the sake of his group. His motive is still somewhat a blind one, andstill coloured by the desire for a return of that which he gives and for lovefrom those he seeks to serve, but it is of a much higher order than the blindsacrifice to which a man is driven by circumstances as is the case in theearlier unfoldment. As this threefold enlightenment or unfoldment proceeds,again a dual result is seen:The astral permanent atom comes into full activity and radiance, as regards fiveof its spirillae, and the two atoms of the physical and the astral planes areequally vibrant.The three petals of the central ring of the egoic lotus come also into fullunfoldment, and the heart centre of the Monad is seen as a wheel of fire withsix of its spokes in full display of energy and rapidly rotating.c. Third Group of Petals—Sacrifice Petals:1. The Petal of Knowledge for the mental plane; its unfoldment marks the periodwherein the man consciously utilizes all that he has gained or is gaining underthe law for the definite benefit of humanity.Each of the groups of petals is distinguished by a predominant colouring;Knowledge , on the physical plane, with the colouring of the other twosubsidiary; Love , on the astral plane, with the light of sacrifice weaker intone than the other two, which practically show forth in equal brilliancy. Onthe mental plane, the light of sacrifice comes to its full display, and all thatis seen is coloured by that light.2. The Petal of Love on the mental plane is unfolded [542] through the conscioussteady application of all the powers of the soul to the service of humanity withno thought of return nor any desire for reward for the immense sacrificeinvolved.3. The Petal of Sacrifice for the mental plane: demonstrates as the predominantbias of the soul as seen in a series of many lives spent by the initiate priorto his final emancipation. He becomes in his sphere the “Great Sacrifice.”This stage can be seen objectively to the eye of the clairvoyant as dual ineffect:a. The mental unit becomes a radiant point of light; its four spirillae transmitforce with intense rapidity.b. The three higher petals unfold, and the nine-petalled lotus is seenperfected.The causal body is then (expressed in terms of fire) a blazing centre of heat,radiating to its group warmth and vitality. Within the periphery of the egoicwheel can be seen the nine spokes rotating with intense rapidity and—after thethird Initiation—becoming fourth dimensional, or the wheels “turn upon”themselves. (Bible. Ezekiel, 1:15:21) In the midst forming a certain geometricaltriangle (differing according to the ray of the Monad) can be seen three pointsof fire, or the permanent atoms and the mental unit, in all their glory; at thecentre can be seen a central blaze of glory growing in intensity as the threeinner petals respond to the stimulation. When the fire of matter, of “fire byfriction,” becomes sufficiently intense; when the fire of mind of solar fire(which vitalises the nine petals) becomes equally fierce, and when the electricspark at the innermost centre blazes out and can be seen, the [543 ] entirecausal body becomes radioactive. Then the fires of substance (the vitality ofthe permanent atoms) escape from the atomic spheres, and add their quota to thegreat sphere in which they are contained; the fire of mind blends with itsemanating source, and the central life escapes. This is the great liberation.The man, in terms of human endeavour, has achieved his goal. He has passedthrough the three Halls and in each has transferred that which he gained thereinto the content of his consciousness; he has in ordered sequence developed andopened the petals of the lotus—first opening the lower three, which involves aprocess covering a vast period of time. Then the second series of petals areopened, during a period of time covering his participation intelligently inworld affairs until he enters the spiritual kingdom at the first Initiation; anda final and briefer period wherein the three higher or inner ring of petals aredeveloped and opened.In closing what may be said on this subject of the egoic Ray and fire of mind, Iwould request the student to bear the following points in mind:First. That the order of the development of the petals and the stimulation ofthe fires depends upon the Ray of the Monad, and the subray upon which thecausal body finds itself. This thought would bear expansion, and would prove afruitful source of study to the occult investigator.Second. That this unfoldment proceeds slowly in the early stages, and onlyproceeds with rapidity as the man himself works at it with conscious effort.The Ego takes no active interest in the development until the second petal inthe second series is beginning to open. Before that time, the work proceedsunder the [544] law of its being and through the inherent life of the secondLogos which is the life of the petals of the lotus. The life of the first Logos,working through the SELF (who dwells in a form built by the life or energy ofthe second Logos out of force-substance animated by the life of the third Logos)only responds to opportunity when the above mentioned stage is reached.Finally: The ceremony of initiation is only undergone when the causal body is ina condition to respond to the Will aspect of the Heavenly Man (the first aspect)and to do this through the glad co-operation of the fully conscious self.More on this is not now possible, but enough has here been indicated to open upvarious lines of study. These, if followed, will lead the student to much ofpractical value and application.3. Summary.Our next subject concerns itself with the elementals of the mental plane, withthe thought forms they animate, and with the consideration of them as forcecentres, capable of producing results—constructive, if rightly directed;destructive, if left blindly to follow their own course. Before taking up thismatter, however, I want to gather together some threads of thought in connectionwith the matter just dealt with. If we have carefully followed the data givenabout the egoic manifestation on its own plane, and the fires of the causalbody, we shall have noted the close resemblance between that egoic body, viewedas a force centre, and certain aspects of logoic manifestation.The causal body has been seen as a wheel of fire, containing within itsperiphery three focal points of energy, the permanent atoms. They are analogous,as earlier pointed out, to the seventh principle of each of the threeaspects—will or power, love-wisdom, and active intelligence. [545] Each of thesefocal points has its own internal economy, as seen in the spirillae, which areessentially streams of force, responding to stimulation and vibration, arousedwithin and without their limiting ring-pass-not. The internal life of thepermanent atom, and that which animates and produces its activity, is the lifeof the third aspect; the force playing upon it and through it is the life of thesecond aspect. As evolution proceeds the intensity of the life forces fromwithin and those which affect it from without, grows gradually stronger andstronger, and the light of the permanent atoms increases, the petals of thelotus unfold, and the spokes of the radiatory fire come into action. Bear inmind here, that the permanent atoms are concerned with the substance aspect ofExistence or Becoming, while the petals of the lotus, or the fiery spokes of thewheel, deal specifically with the psychical aspect, or the development ofconsciousness; the central nucleus, or the three inner petals, embodies theaspect of pure Spirit.All three lines of evolution are proceeding simultaneously, and have a reflexaction the one upon the other; it is this which produces the consequentperfection of unfoldment. It is neither possible nor desirable to follow eachline of this threefold evolution separately, nor to consider them as dissociatedfrom each other. The interplay is too accurate, and the mutual stimulation tooimportant to be neglected by the student of egoic evolution.It is, as stated elsewhere, through the permanent atoms that the Ego comes enrapport with his objective world; he works upon and through his environmentsuccessfully or blindly just in so far as he can energise his permanent atoms,and bring the spirillae out of latency into potency. This only becomes possibleas he unfolds the petals of the lotus. It must be remembered that the threelower petals when fully unfolded affect, through [546] their vitality, the threemajor spirillae in the physical permanent atom. As the second ring of petalsgradually opens, the astral permanent atom undergoes a similar process, leadingup to the full arousing of the spirillae within the mental unit.Here I would point out that there is a slight difference in the case of themental unit, for the four spirillae of the mental unit are aroused to fullactivity when the knowledge petal of the final three opens. The opening of theremaining two reveal the glowing threefold flower which lies at the centre ofegoic manifestation.It would be wise to sound a note of warning here in connection with thisquestion of egoic unfoldment. What has been said here has been but theformulation of the general plan of egoic unfoldment as interpreted in terms ofconsciousness or of fire. In studying the subject with due personal application,the student should bear in mind the following facts:First, that according to the Ray of the Monad, so will the petals unfold. Forinstance, if the Ray of the Monad is the second Ray, the knowledge petal will bethe first to open, but the second petal of love will almost parallel itsdevelopment, being for that particular type of Ego the line of easiestunfoldment; the knowledge petal will be for it the most difficult to open.Second, that the effects of one circle of petals opening will be felt within thenext circle at an early stage and will cause a vibratory response, hence thegreater rapidity of the later stages of unfoldment as compared with the first.Third, that there exist many cases of uneven or unequal unfoldment. Quitefrequently people are found with perhaps two petals unfolded in the first circleand one still in latency, while a petal within the central or second ring may bein full development. This is the explanation frequently of the power in servicealong [547] certain lines displayed by some, coupled with a comparatively lowstage of development or of consciousness (egoically speaking). This is due tovarying causes, such as the karma of the Monad itself on its high plane and thestrength of the monadic grip upon the ego; many lives given to a particular lineof action, resulting in the setting up of a strong vibration—one so strong thatit renders the development of response to subsidiary vibrations difficult ofattainment; certain peculiar conditions hidden in the evolution of anyparticular Lord of a Ray, and the effect of that condition upon a particulargroup of cells; the group karma of a collection or congery of causal bodies, andtheir mutual interplay. Every egoic unit or monadic force centre has a definiteeffect upon the group or community of Egos in which it may have a place, and asthe interaction proceeds results are sometimes produced of a temporarilyunexpected nature.These points should be carefully borne in mind by the student of egoicevolution. This whole subject is of interest in that it is the next step aheadfor the students of occult psychology. Much will be eventually ascertained whichwill throw new light upon the possibility of work upon the physical plane forman. The whole secret of success in any endeavour or enterprise is primarilybased on two things:First, the ability of the Ego to work through the personality, using it simplyas the medium of expression.Second, the karma of the egoic group as it becomes more apparent on the physicalplane. Hitherto, much has been said and taught about individual karma. Groupkarma in the future will slowly assume its rightful place in the thought ofstudents, and this will lead to more intelligent co-operation, to a moresympathetic understanding of group responsibilities, and to a more adequatesolution of group problems.[548] The study of occult psychology involves a true conception of the nature ofthe Ego, or the arousing of the Ego to full activity in manifestation; it willnecessitate the sound formulation of the laws of egoic unfoldment, of themethods whereby, petal by petal, the lotus may be brought to perfection, and ofthe triple nature of its evolution; it will bring about an eventual apprehensionof the true meaning of force, and of energy in its dual aspect—internalvibration and external radiation; it will produce the centering of the attentionof all advanced students upon the centres—in this case not the physical centreson etheric levels but upon the psychical centres, such as the Ego in the causalbody and egoic groups. This will produce later a better comprehension of theeffect of one consciousness upon another consciousness on the physical plane,and this knowledge will be scientifically utilised to produce specific resultsin group evolution, and thus some of the world problems will find solution.Finally, the laws of fire will be studied, the nature of heat, of radiation andof flame will be occultly investigated, and the action of one fire upon anotherfire, the result of radiation from one conscious sphere to another will berealised; the method of arousing consciousness on the different planes by actionupon the fires of the causal body and their stimulation will be graduallyrevealed.The whole question is slowly, very slowly, coming to the fore in human thought(even though this is little realised) through the study of vocational education,business efficiency, and the place of the human unit in any trade or enterprise.Men are being spoken of and considered in terms of potential force factors, andthis is a step in the right direction.Approaching the same question from the personality standpoint and not the egoic,the time is fast approaching when the emphasis will be laid in education upon[549] how best the young can be taught to contact their own ego or higherenergy; how best they can be led to appropriate the knowledge and ability oftheir higher self for use on the physical plane; how best they can ascertaintheir group formation, and thus work along with their group, and in unison withthe total energy of that group; how best their threefold lower self—physical,astral, and mental—can be brought into direct alignment with their higher centreof force, and thus draw down a continuous supply of energy for the strengtheningof their three vehicles, and their wise manipulation; how best the variousspirillae can be awakened and the energy within their own cells released foraction. All this will be a thing of gradual evolution, but I have here outlinedthe trend of the future study, as in the formulation of possibility lies itseventual realisation. Such a process must necessarily be slow. The powers of theego are stupendous and if released now through the agency of an unreadypersonality would lead to dire disaster. But the time will come, and in themeantime a due apprehension of inherent capacity will profit all who have theintuition to recognise the goal."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION D - THOUGHT ELEMENTALS AND FIRE ELEMENTALSI.

THOUGHT FORMS1. Their Function.It will be noted that in studying this matter we have not started with thatwhich is most apparent, the exoteric form in mental matter, but with the innerlife or Idea within the form and with the Laws that govern the creative [552]aspect. This function of every thought form is threefold:To respond to vibrationTo provide a body for an ideaTo carry out specific purpose.Let us first study the logoic thought form and then turn our attention to thethought forms fabricated by the Thinker from the systemic mental planes and inmental matter. We have to note that, in the case of the Logos, all upon which wehave to base our conclusions are His physical manifestation, and His quality,psychic nature, aroma, emanation or magnetism, as we see it working out throughthe form. Hence we are very much handicapped.a. Response to Vibration. It is always recognised in occult circles that thewhole object of human evolution is to enable the Thinker to respond to everycontact fully and consciously, and thus to utilise his material sheath, orsheaths, as adequate transmitter of such contact. The most easily studied humanthought-form is the one the Ego creates through which to function. He builds hissheaths by the power of thought, and the dense physical body is the best sheaththat—at any particular stage of evolution—he can at the time manufacture. Thesame can be predicated of the solar Logos. He builds by the power of thought abody which can respond to that group of vibrations which are concerned with thecosmic physical plane (the only one we can study). It is not yet adequate, anddoes not fully express the logoic Thinker.The vibrations to which the systemic thought-form must respond are many innumber, but for our purposes might be enumerated as mainly seven:1. The vibrations of the cosmic physical plane, viewing it as all the matter ofthat plane which exists [553] outside the logoic ring-pass-not. It concerns thepranic and akashic fluids and currents.2. The vibrations of the cosmic astral plane as they affect the physical form ofdivine manifestation. This involves cosmically the action upon our solar Logosof the emotional quality of other cosmic entities, and concerns the magneticeffect upon Him of their psychic emanation. This, in view of the fact that Hisdense physical body is not a principle, is of a more potent nature than thefirst set of vibrations, as is the case also in man’s evolution.3. Vibrations from that which, within the logoic consciousness, is recognised asthe logoic Higher Self, or His emanating source. This brings the solar systemwithin the vibratory radius of certain constellations which have a position ofprofound importance in the general evolution of the system.4. Vibrations from Sirius via the cosmic mental plane.5. Vibrations from the seven Rishis of the Great Bear, and primarily from thosetwo Who are the Prototypes of the Lords of the seventh and fifth Rays. This is amost important point, and finds its microcosmic correspondence in the placewhich the seventh Ray has in the building of a thoughtform, and the use of thefifth Ray in the work of concretion. All magicians who work with matter and whoare occupied with form-building (either consciously or unconsciously) call inthese two types of force or energy.6. Certain very remote vibrations, as yet no more appreciable in the logoic Bodythan is monadic influence in that of average man, from the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHTMAY BE SAID, that cosmic [554] Existence Who is expressing Himself through sevencentres of force, of which our solar system is one.7. A series of vibrations which will become more potent as our Logos nears thatperiod which is occultly called “Divine Maturity,” which emanate from thatconstellation in the Heavens which embodies His polar opposite. This is a deepmystery and concerns the cosmic marriage of the Logos.It will be apparent, therefore, how little can as yet be predicated anent thefuture of the solar system until the vibrations of the sixth and seventh orderbecome more powerful, and their effects can consequently be studied more easily.It is not possible here to do more than indicate the seven types of vibrationsto which our solar Logos (functioning in a material body) will in due course oftime consciously, and fully, respond. He responds to vibrations of the first,second, third and fourth order quite fully at this time, but as yet (thoughresponding) cannot fully, and consciously, utilise these types of energy. Thevibration of the fifth order is recognised by Him, particularly in three of Hiscentres, but is not as yet fully under His control. The other two are sensed,and felt, but so remotely as to be almost outside the range of Hisconsciousness.In carrying out these ideas in connection with man and the thought forms whichhe fabricates (such as his material sheaths), the correspondence can be workedout within the system, and from the point of view of the planetary schemes inwhich man has his place. The work of man as he builds in mental thought matterand constructs forms extraneous to himself, we shall deal with later.The methods whereby vibratory response is brought about might be enumerated asfollows: [555]Through the factor of time in evolution.Through extra-systemic stimulation and intensive training, whether for a Logosor a man.Through the process of Initiation, and the application of the Rods ofInitiation.The factor of evolution is recognised and studied by many schools of thought,esoteric or exoteric. The extrasystemic stimulation involves a large number offactors, but the main two to be remembered are that this stimulation will beapplied:Through the group to the unit.Through a more evolved “Kingdom of Nature” to a less evolved.As regards the third factor of Initiation, it must be borne in mind that we arehere considering only the great initiations, and not the numerous expansions ofconsciousness which can be traced through all kingdoms and all manifestations.In connection with what we have considered above, anent the primary function ofa thought-form (the power to respond to vibration) I would emphasise thenecessity of remembering that that response must be made by the inner embodiedIdea, and that it will then through a complex reflex action, bring aboutresponse from the material sheath which veils it. Vibration is the result ofsubjective impulse, and makes its appeal to the subjective consciousness throughimpact upon whatever may be understood as substance; this impact is transmitteddirect to the inner life, and in due turn is retransmitted to substance in theform of recognition or realisation. An analogous process may be studied in thenerve reactions of the physical frame, and their alliance with the brainconsciousness.As will be seen in the three worlds of man’s emprise, man will work as a Creatorand will follow a similar procedure. [556] His thought forms will be constructedof mental matter, chosen specifically because it vibrates to the same type ofvibration as the Idea seeking embodiment, and these forms will persist—as doesthe logoic thought form, the solar system—for just as long as the factor ofWill, or dynamic vitality, continues to hold it together.This brings us to our next point:b. To Provide a Body for an Idea . In this statement we have latent the basicprinciple of incarnation, and of activity, even of existence itself. It involvesthe expansion of our idea to include the cosmic mental plane as we consider theLogos, and as the creative faculty of man is studied we are taken to the mentalplane of the solar system. One fundamental thought must here be given and.pondered upon: This creative impulse, this tendency towards the concretion ofthe abstract, this inherent ability to “take form” has its fullest expression asyet in physical matter. The “raison d’être” is that—for man—all substances withwhich he creates, all forms which he builds, and all processes of concretionwhich he carries on, are created, built and carried on within the physical bodyof the Logos. Herein can be found the reason for the emphasis laid in nature onthe sex aspect, and on that of physical reproduction; it can be seen in all thekingdoms of nature, with the exception of the first and fifth. This is a mostsignificant point and the exceptions should be studied in their widestconnotation, for they contain the basic mystery of sex on the involutionarypath, and on the evolutionary. In them we have the two extremes. It will havebeen noted that as the idea that the solar system is the physical vehicle of theLogos and His body of manifestation is grasped, many problems become elucidated,and two points especially will gradually be apprehended by the student, if hemeditates and studies:First. That in due course of time, as the Logos [557] achieves liberation fromthe trammels of physical matter, the whole objective system will come to beregarded as an idea or concept, clothed in a veil or sheath of subtler matterthan the physical, and the logoic body will be viewed as the product of will anddesire, and physical matter in any of its grades will not enter into itscomposition; it will simply be a desire body. This will bring about a conditionof affairs inconceivable to us, and only to be somewhat apprehended by the manwho can function upon the systemic buddhic plane the fourth cosmic ether. Bearin mind here that our astral plane is but the sixth subplane of the cosmicphysical plane and that this provides us with no real grounds from which toreason concerning the cosmic astral plane. Only when the astral plane is a calmreceiver of buddhic impulse, or a liquid reflector of that plane (which will notbe till the close of the mahamanvantara) shall we be able to formulate any ideasanent the cosmic astral plane.Second. That the entire sex aspect of manifestation, as we understand it in thedifferent kingdoms of nature, is an expression of the energy of the Logos, as itflows through and stimulates that centre in His body which corresponds to thegenerative organs. All the creative functions of the vegetable, animal, andhuman family, viewing them as a whole, are as yet purely physical, and based onlower desire. The desire of the Logos for physical incarnation is as yet thedominant note. Later His desire for that will be less and will become transmutedinto desire for creation on mental levels only. This is what brings theDestroyer aspect into activity, leading to eventual obscuration, and thephysical “death” of the solar system. Indication that this aspect is coming intopower will be seen when two great events transpire: [558]a. The ability of man consciously to create on mental levels, and the consequenttransmutation of his lower sex impulses into higher.b . The mental vitalisation of another large section of the animal kingdom.When these two things can be seen working out in any round, it will beindicative of a decided mental polarisation of the Logos; we can only becomecognisant of this by studying His body of manifestation in its component parts.What is here predicated anent the logoic thought form can be equally well statedabout that of a Heavenly Man, and a planetary scheme. As His cosmic polarisationbecomes more mental, and as His cosmic desire nature becomes transmuted, theforce that plays through His centres will correspondingly be seen to vary indirection; He will withdraw force from certain of His lower centres and globes;He will cease to be interested in physical incarnation, and He will eventuallywithdraw within Himself. His thought-form will show a gradual diminution ofvitality; the dense physical globe will die and pass out of objectivity, andother globes will temporarily hold His life, though not for long. In due courseof time the entire scheme will be obscured, and He will function only in Hiscosmic astral body.Such is the case too with a chain and its informing Life, viewing a chain assimply a centre in the body of the planetary Logos, yet having its own centralfactor. This can be seen in the Moon in a most interesting way. The desire ofits Occupant was no longer for physical manifestation; He therefore withdrew Hislife. All that is left is the devitalised shell; the two other aspects have goneand only the third aspect, the inherent life of matter itself, remains graduallyto dissipate also as the centuries elapse. In connection with man, a similarcondition [559] is seen in the gradual disintegration of the physical body afterdeath; the two other aspects are removed, and the form decays.As these fundamental facts are grasped, and man begins to appreciate hisposition as Creator, the entire aspect of the sex question will also change; andemphasis will be laid upon the laws of mental creation, on the formulation ofthought-forms in a scientific manner, and the dense physical aspect of creationwill be in abeyance. When this is so, then will man be coming into his divineright, and the human kingdom be fulfilling its legitimate function. The sexaspect—as at present expressing itself—and the whole process of reproduction isone which man shares with the animal kingdom, and is based upon his animalinstincts, and his dense physical nature, which is not a principle. When he istotally emancipated from the animal kingdom, and the third and fourth kingdomsstand distinct from each other, then the sex nature, and the organs ofreproduction will be viewed by the average man in a very different manner thanat present. Creation will eventually be the result of thought impulses and notdesire impulses ; the process will be then (once the initial impulse on themental plane has been given), as normal, as safe, and as unconscious as the actof breathing is now. When this is so (and the time is a long way ahead),physical reproduction will still continue, but the physical form will be spokenof in terms of concretion and of energy, and the emphasis will be laid upon thatwhich is to be embodied. This stage will be entered upon when the functions ofthe etheric body are scientifically grasped and understood and the laws ofcreative thought are a matter of public knowledge and discussion; it willcoincide with a period wherein the animal kingdom will again be under manasicimpression, and individualisation will again be permitted.[560] It will be generally recognised at that time that Spirit-matter are twoaspects of the one Unity, and the present terminology of Spirit, and materialsubstance, will have given place to the broader concept of negative and positiveenergy as the two aspects of the One Energy. All phenomena will then beexpressed in force terms, and the sex question—or the union of the male andfemale, the negative and the positive, on the physical plane—will be redeemedand purified.An embodied idea, therefore, is literally a positive impulse, emanating frommental levels, and clothing itself in a veil of negative substance. These twofactors in turn will be regarded as emanations from a still greater forcecentre, which is expressing purpose through them both.A thought form, as constructed by man, is the union of a positive emanation anda negative. These two are the emanations of a Unity, the coherent Thinker.c. To Carry Out Specific Purpose. We touch here upon the most vital element inthe building of thoughtforms. In our first point we touched upon the aspect ofconsciousness, or “response to sensation, or feeling,” and thus brought into ourstudy of the building process the second aspect logoic, that of the Ego, or therealisation of essential duality. In our second point the more objective aspectwas somewhat elaborated, and the tangible form dealt with, thus bringing in thethird logoic aspect, that of intelligent substance, or that through whichconsciousness seeks expression. Now the will or purpose aspect is to beconsidered, bringing therefore the first aspect logoic, or the “will-to-be” tothe fore. When this third point is meditated upon with care, it will be noted(as might be expected) that it includes the other two, and synthesises them.Certain factors must be borne in mind as we consider these words “specificpurpose.” By their tabulation [561] we shall endeavour to make as clear as maybe, this very complex matter. The ideas involved are:The Factor of Identity. Specific purpose is the practical application of thewill, or intent, of a conscious intelligent Existence as it shows itself in:a. Its sourceb. Its missionc. Its methodd. Its objective.All these will vary according to the nature of the emanating Identity. Allthought forms—logoic, planetary, and human—(for no other entities of lessergrade work as mental creators), emanate from a mind, are built for the purposeof carrying out some active work, demonstrate under set rules and laws, and havea definite goal, or expected consummation.The Factor of Time. Specific purpose in the solar system is the gradualevolution of a definite plan originating in the Mind of the Logos, and slowly,and cyclically, achieving consummation. Three vast periods of time are consumedin the process:The period of construction, wherein the form is built.The period of utilisation, wherein the form is occupied, vitalised by a centralLife, and employed.The period of dissolution, wherein the form is devitalised, destroyed anddissipated.In the first stage, that which concerns the tangible, that which deals withobjectivity, is the more emphasised, and of supreme importance. In the secondstage, the life within the form, or the subjective consciousness, comesgradually to the fore, and the quality , or the psyche of the thought-form,becomes apparent. In the final stage, the thought form (having performed itsmission), separates into its basic duality, and will or energy (which lies, as aunity, back of duality), ceases in intent. [562] The objective life (spirituallife where cosmic thought-forms are concerned; manasic life when solarthought-forms are constructed; and elemental life where human thought-forms arebuilt) withdraws and the form dissipates.In all these cases it will be apparent that only in the study of the developmentof the quality of the thought-form will its inherent purpose be revealed; onlyas its emanative processes are comprehended will the nature of its missionbecome recognisable. This is true fundamentally of all forms. Where therelatively unimportant forms—such as those constructed by man at this time—areconcerned, this can easily be discovered, and to the trained clairvoyant eachform reveals:By its colour,By its vibration,By its direction,By its keynote,the nature of the inner life, the quality of its vibration and the nature of itsgoal. In the summation of all these points will the purpose reveal itself.The Factor of Karma. Every thought-form comes under the law of Karma through theeffect it produces. At this stage in the history of the system—that vasttransitional stage between dense physical life and existence in the logoicetheric body—it is not easy for us to differentiate between those thought formswhich are effects and those which are causes. It should be remembered here thatonly cosmic and solar lords formulate thoughts . The lunar Lords and all lesserintelligences do not do so. Therefore, the two above mentioned groups come underkarmic law. They only are self-conscious, and therefore responsible. Whereself-consciousness is not, there is no responsibility. Hence animals are notheld to be responsible, and though they [563] suffer on the physical plane andin their physical vehicles, on the subtler planes they are freed from karma, forthey have neither memory nor anticipation; they lack the correlating faculty andas the spark of mind is missing, they are held free from the law of retribution,except where the physical body is concerned. The reason for the suffering in theanimal kingdom is hidden in the mystery of the sin of the mindless, ( 180[text00028.html#Y_FN180] ) and in that terrible period spoken of in the SecretDoctrine , which resulted in abortions and distortions of all kinds. Had thisperiod not occurred, and this particular type of “miscarriage of purpose” nottaken place, we should not have had the fearful karmic relationship which nowexists between the third and the fourth kingdom.The effect of the life and persistence of a thought-form, if maleficent anddestructive, works out as “evil karma” if beneficent it works as “good karma” inthe group in which the emanator has a place. This is what is meant by therebeing no karma attached to the working out of a good and altruistic deed.The Factor of the Lesser Builders . Here a most interesting factor comes in uponwhich we shall enlarge later, when considering the elementals. The specificpurpose of a thought-form is connected very closely with the type of devaessence of which it is constructed, and (in connection with man on the mentalplane), with the type of elemental which he can control, and send forth as theoccupier, or vitalising agency of the thoughtform. Roughly speaking, a solarLogos works only through the greater Builders, the Manasaputras in Their [564]various grades on the two higher planes of the solar system. He works throughThem, and sends Them forth upon the mission of constructing, and vitalising thesystemic thought-form, with a specific purpose in view. The planetary Logoi workprimarily through the Builders of the next three planes (atma-buddhi-manas), whoconstruct and control the work of the planetary schemes. Men work through thebuilders of the lower mental planes, and the astral plane, for the humanthought-forms are kama-manasic; the physical plane builders are sweptautomatically into action by the force of the currents, and energies set up insubtler matter, by the great Builders.The inserted tabulation [below] may make this clear.If the table is carefully studied, it will be seen that the fivefold earlierenumeration concerns the most important kingdoms in nature, whilst the final twoare peculiarly interesting in that the mineral kingdom can in no sense beconsidered a principle, but simply the densest point of concretion of theabstract, and that the vegetable kingdom has a peculiar place in the economy ofthe system as the transmitter of the vital pranic fluid; the vegetable kingdomis definitely a bridge between the conscious and the unconscious. Here I amusing these words in their broadest and most general sense. Though it is knownthat the mineral kingdom has a consciousness of its own, yet sensation is moredistinctly recognisable in the second kingdom, and the distinction between theconsciousness of the mineral and that of the animal is so vast that theirrespective consciousnesses are basically unlike. Between these stands thevegetable kingdom, approximating more generally the animal consciousness thanthe mineral, and having a most esoteric relationship to the deva evolution.[565]TABULATION IVTHE BUILDING ENTITIESQuality Entity Centre Personality Kingdom 1.

Dense Mineral None First UnityAll these kingdoms of nature are “forms of thought”; all have body, vitality,quality and purpose, and all are [566] sent out by a greater life than their ownupon a specific mission; they are sent forth by those who are self-conscious andare a blend of mind, spirit and objective form. Only the self-conscious cancreate, and only they are capable of purpose, of co-ordination, of direction andcontrol.Even though it may seem that much has been left unsaid, yet in due considerationof the above four points in connection with “purpose” in a thought-form, muchcan be worked out by the student himself.In extending these ideas to a solar Logos, many questions of interest arisewhich are profitable only in so far as they expand the concept, and widen thehorizon of the Thinker. The logoic purpose is not yet comprehensible to man; itdoes not profit him to meditate thereon, yet in the formulation of ideas, andtheir apprehension by thinkers may come the gradual dawning of a day ofrecognition, and a subsequent co-operation with that divine purpose. Let us,therefore, formulate some of these questions, leaving the future to reveal theanswer:1. What may be the purpose of the present incarnation of the solar Logos?2. What is the purpose which may perhaps be working out in our own planetaryscheme and what is the basic plan of our planetary Logos?3. Wherein does it differ from other planetary schemes?4. What is the purpose lying back of the relation existing between our Earth andVenus?5. Is the purpose of the animal kingdom, as a whole, in any way to beascertained?6. What is the purpose back of the present root-race evolution? Can we realiseit?7. What is the purpose behind the differing national forms?[567] Let us next bring the whole idea down to a more practical basis, andformulate questions along the following lines:1. In what type of matter do I usually formulate thoughts?2. What is the psychic quality of my thought-forms?3. With what specific purpose do I use mental matter?4. Do I work in mental matter consciously or unconsciously?5. Do I vitalise my thought-forms with a high or a low order of entity?6. Do I study the laws of construction?7. Do I realise the power of the will to vitalise?8. Do I destroy thought-forms when they have accomplished their purpose by aconscious act of the will?9. Do I make forms which bring karmic effects, or do I build those which go tothe good of the group?Many such thoughts will arise, and in the study of thought man learns the lawsof being.2. The Laws of Thought.There are three great laws, that we might term the fundamental laws of thecosmos, of that greater system (recognised by all astronomers), of which we forma part, and seven laws inherent in the solar system. These seven we mightconsider secondary laws, though, from the standpoint of humanity, they appear asmajor ones.a. Three Cosmic Laws. The first of the cosmic laws is the Law of Synthesis. Itis almost impossible for those of us who have not the buddhic faculty in any waydeveloped, to comprehend the scope of this law. It is the law that demonstratesthe fact that all things—abstract and concrete—exist as one; it is the lawgoverning the thought form of that One of the cosmic Logoi [568] in Whoseconsciousness both our system, and our greater centre, have a part. It is a unitof His thought, a thought form in its entirety, a concrete whole, and not thedifferentiated process that we feel our evolving system to be. It is thesumtotal, the centre and the periphery, and the circle of manifestation regardedas a unit.The second law is the Law of Attraction and Repulsion . Fundamentally, the lawdescribes the compelling force of attraction that holds our solar system to theSirian; that holds our planets revolving around our central unit, the sun; thatholds the lesser systems of atomic and molecular matter circulating around acentre in the planet; and that holds the matter of all physical plane bodies,and that of the subtle bodies co-ordinated around their microcosmic centre.The third law is the Law of Economy, and is the law which adjusts all thatconcerns the material and spiritual evolution of the cosmos to the best possibleadvantage and with the least expenditure of force. It makes perfect each atom oftime, and each eternal period, and carries all onward, and upward, and through ,with the least possible effort, with the proper adjustment of equilibrium, andwith the necessary rate of rhythm. Unevenness of rhythm is really an illusion oftime, and does not exist in the cosmic centre. We need to ponder on this, for itholds the secret of peace, and we need to grasp the significance of that wordthrough , for it describes the next racial expansion of consciousness, and hasan occult meaning.In the nomenclature of these laws much is lost, for it is well nigh impossibleto resolve abstractions into the terms of speech, and not lose the inner sensein the process. In these laws we again have the threefold idea demonstrated, andthe correspondence, as might be expected, holds good. [569]The Law of Synthesis The Will Aspect 1st Aspect. The Law of Attraction The LoveAspect 2nd Aspect. The Law of Economy The Activity Aspect 3rd Aspect.b. Seven Systemic Laws .—Subsidiary to the three major laws, we find the sevenlaws of our solar system. Again we find the law of analogy elucidating, and thethree becoming the seven as elsewhere in the logoic scheme. In each of theseseven laws we find an interesting correlation with the seven planes. They are:1. The Law of Vibration, the basis of manifestation, starting on the firstplane. This is the atomic law of the system, in the same sense that on each ofour planes the first subplane is the atomic plane.2. The law of Cohesion. On the second plane cohesion is first apparent. It isthe first molecular plane of the system, and is the home of the Monad. Divinecoherency is demonstrated.3. The Law of Disintegration . On the third plane comes the final casting-off,the ultimate shedding of the sheaths, of the fivefold superman. A Chohan of thesixth Initiation discards all the sheaths beneath the monadic vehicle, from theatmic to the physical.4. The Law of Magnetic Control holds sway paramountly on the buddhic plane, andin the development of the control of this law lies hid the control of thepersonality by the Monad via the egoic body.5. The Law of Fixation demonstrates principally on the mental plane and has aclose connection with manas, the fifth principle. The mind controls andstabilises, and cohereney is the result.6. The Law of Love is the law of the astral plane. It aims at the transmutationof the desire nature, and links it up with the greater magnetism of the loveaspect on the buddhic plane.7. The Law of Sacrifice and Death is the controlling factor on the physicalplane. The destruction of the form, in order that the evolving life mayprogress, is one of the fundamental methods in evolution.The Intermediate Law of Karma .—There is also an intermediate law, which is thesynthetic law of the system [570] of Sirius. This law is called by the genericterm, the Law of Karma, and really predicates the effect the Sirian system hason our solar system. Each of the two systems, as regards its internal economy,is independent in time and space, or (in other words), in manifestation. We havepractically no effect on our parent system, the reflex action is so slight as tobe negligible, but very definite effects are felt in our system through causesarising in Sirius. These causes, when experienced as effects, are called by usthe Law of Karma, and at the beginning they started systemic Karma which, oncein effect, constitutes that which is called Karma in our occult and orientalliterature.The Lipika Lords of our system, the systemic Lords of Karma, are under the ruleof a greater corresponding Lord on Sirius.We have therefore:1. The three cosmic laws of Synthesis, Attraction and Economy.2. The Sirian law of Karma.3. The seven laws of the solar system.As we have been told, our seven major vibrations are the vibrations of thelowest cosmic plane; there is our habitat. Our Logos Himself, the heart of Hissystem, is on the cosmic astral plane; he is polarised there. Just as the unitsof the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human, are evolving through the use ofphysical bodies, but are polarised at this time in their astral vehicles, so wehave seen that the objective solar system forms the physical body of the Logos,though His polarity is in His astral body. It is significant that in thisgreater manvantara, the Logos is to take the fourth cosmic Initiation. A hintwhich may enlighten lies in the correspondence which exists between thisstatement and the [571] fourth root-race development, and this, the fourth orastral round. ( 181 [text00028.html#Y_FN181] )The system of the Sirian Logos is on the cosmic mental plane, and in a subtleway, incomprehensible to us, our Logos, with His system, forms a part of a stillgreater Logos. This does not involve loss of identity, though the matter is tooabstruse to express more adequately. It is in this analogy that the basic ideacan be found of all teaching given out about the Grand Heavenly Man. The wholeconception of these laws is bound up in this idea. We have the three laws of thecosmic higher planes, holding in a synthesis of beauty the greater and thelesser system. Next we have the great law of Sirius, the Law of Karma, on thethird subplane of the cosmic mental plane, which law really controls our Logos,and His actions, in the same way as the ego—in due course of evolution—controlsthe human personality.We need to remember that, under the Law of Correspondences, we shall have arelationship in the Cosmos, similar to that existing in the microcosm betweenthe ego and the personality. The suggestion holds much that we might considerwith benefit. We must not, however, carry the analogy too far; as we have notyet evolved to where we have planetary consciousness, still less systemic, howcan we really expect even to conceive of the A B C of cosmic truth? Just broadhints, wide conceptions, and generalities, are as yet possible. Of one thing wecan be sure, and that is that identity ever remains.Let me explain by illustration:Each one of us, in due process of evolution, forms part of one of the HeavenlyMen, Who Themselves form the [572] seven centres in that greater Heavenly Man,the Logos. Yet, though we are merged with the whole, we do not lose ouridentity, but forever remain separated units of consciousness, though one withall that lives or is. In like manner our Logos loses not His identity, eventhough He forms part of the Consciousness of the Logos of Sirius. In His turn,the Sirian Logos forms one of the seven Grand Heavenly Men, who are the centresin the body of ONE OF WHOM NOUGHT MAY BE SAID.The Laws and the Planes .—We might, while studying the seven laws of the solarsystem, take them plane by plane, showing certain things—three in all:1. We might study their effect as they demonstrate on the path of involution.2. As they manifest on the path of evolution, or return.3. We might also touch on the laws as they affect the human and deva organismsthat evolve by means of them.As we do this, we shall gradually get a broad general idea of how this system ofours (the thought-form of the Logos), was gradually built up, how it iscontrolled and held together, and how numerous and intricate are theinterrelations. Certain fundamental hypotheses are assumed, which must form thebackground for all we would say. We must assume first that a Builder, or someCreative Mind, is working to bring about an ordered production, and is seekingto manifest through a demonstrable objective. The objective universe is but theproduct of some subjective mind. Next we must posit that the material for thebuilding of this universe lay ready to the hand of the Builder, and that thismaterial itself is the fruit of some previous system, all that is left of somepast consummated product. Given, therefore, the Builder and the material, wemust next accede [573] to the proposition that this Builder proceeds with Hisbuilding under some definite laws that guide His choice of material, thatcontrol the form that He erects, and that indicate to Him the process to befollowed in the consummating of His idea. We must not forget that three greatsymbols stand, in the mind of the Logos, for each of His three systems, that thewhole exists for Him as a concrete thought-form, for He is learning tomanipulate the matter of the cosmic mental plane on concrete levels, in the sameway that man is working on the laws of thought, and on the building ofthought-forms.It is impossible to do more than sense the symbols of the systems past andpresent. Perhaps if we could visualise a swastika of ten arms revolving at rightangles, of a radiant green colour, all the ten arms emanating from a centralblazing sun, we might have some idea of the thought-form that formed the basisof System I, the activity system. The basic thought-form for the second systemembodies the green swastika of the first manifestation, and adds to itconcentric and interlaced circles in blue, in groups of three, linked by onelarge circle. Both symbols are, of course, in the higher dimensions. The symbolfor the next system is unknown. After grasping and conceding these three basicideas, we can now proceed to the working out of the laws of the system on theseven planes, remembering always that these seven laws hold good on thenumerically corresponding subplane on each plane. Let me briefly illustrate:The fourth law, Magnetic Control, for instance, holds sway on the fourthsubplane of each plane, in the fourth round, and in the fourth root-racespecially. We shall then have the correspondence as follows: [574]4th Law Magnetic Control. 4th Ray Harmony or beauty. 4th Plane The buddhic. 4thSubplane Buddhic Magnetic Control. 4th Round Dense Physical Magnetism,controlling sex manifestation on the physical plane, and inspired by astraldesire, the reflection of the buddhic. 4th Root-Race The Atlantean, in which theabove qualities specially demonstrated.1. The Law of Vibration. —This is the law of the first plane, and it governs allthe atomic subplanes of each plane. It marks the beginning of the work of theLogos, the first setting in motion of mulaprakriti. On each plane the vibrationof the atomic subplane sets in motion the matter of that plane. It is the keymeasure. We might sum up the significance of this law in the words, “light” or“fire.” It is the law of fire; it governs the transmutation of differentiatedcolours back to their synthesis. It controls the breaking up of the One into theseven, and then the reabsorption back into the One. It is really the basic lawof evolution, which necessitates involution. It is analogous to the firstmovement the Logos made to express Himself through this solar system. He utteredthe Sound, a threefold Sound, one sound for each of His three systems, andstarted a ripple on the ocean of space. The Sound grows in volume as timeprogresses, and when it has reached its full volume, when it is fully completed,it forms one of the notes in the major cosmic chord. Each note has six subtones,which, with the first, make the seven; the Law of Vibration, therefore,comprises eighteen lesser vibrations and three major, making the twenty-one ofour three systems. Two multiplied by nine (2x9), makes the necessary eighteen,which is the key number of our love system. Twenty-seven holds hid the mysteryof the third system.On the path of involution, the seven great Breaths or Sounds drove to the atomicsubplane of each plane, and [575] there the basic vibration repeated in its ownlittle world the method of logoic vibration, giving rise itself to sixsubsidiary breaths. We get the same correspondence here as we did in the matterof the Rays, for we shall find that the lines of vibration are 1-2-4-6.Logically this would be so, for involution is negative, receptive, andcorresponds to the feminine pole, just as the abstract rays were 2-4-6. Thistruth requires meditation, and an attempt to think abstractly; it is linked tothe fact that the whole second system is receptive and feminine; it concerns theevolution of consciousness of the psyche.On the path of evolution this law controls the positive aspect of the process.All is rhythm and movement, and when all that evolves on each plane attains thevibration of the atomic subplane, then the goal is reached. When, therefore, wehave achieved the first main vibrations, and have perfected vehicles for allevolutions (not merely the human), of fivefold atomic subplane matter, then wehave completed the round of evolution for this system. In the coming system weshall add the next two vibrations that complete the scale, and our Logos willthen have completed His building.The fourth Creative Hierarchy, that of the human Monads, has to learn to vibratepositively, but the devas proceed along the line of least resistance; theyremain negative, taking the line of acquiescence, of falling in with the law.Only the human Monads, and only in the three worlds, follow the positive line,and by resistance, struggle, battle and strife learn the lesson of divineacquiescence. Yet, owing to the increase of friction through that very struggle,they progress with a relatively greater rapidity than the devas. They have needto do this, for they have lost ground to make up.The Law of Vibration is the law of progress, of movement and of rotation. On theseventh or lowest plane, the vibration is slow, clogged and lethargic from the[576] standpoint of the first, and it is in learning to vibrate or to rotatemore rapidly, that we mount the path of return. It involves, thereforenecessarily, the building in of finer matter into the vehicles, both deva andhuman. In this second system, on the five planes of human evolution, we have thefive vehicles—physical, astral, mental, buddhic and atmic—which have all to bepurified, rarefied, intensified and refined. In the two lowest, the physical andthe astral, only matter of the five higher subplanes, of their respectiveplanes, is to be found, for the two lowest subplanes are too low for deva orhuman bodies; they were dominated in the first system. The mental body is thefirst in which we find matter of all the subplanes. The aim of evolution for usis love dominated by intelligence—or intelligence dominated by love, for theinteraction will be complete. The human race came into the chain at a pointwhere it naturally took bodies of the fifth astral and physical subplanes, andwe can see here an analogy to the coming into the fourth root-race of the moreadvanced Egos.2. The Law of Cohesion. —This is one of the branch laws of the cosmic Law ofAttraction. It is interesting to notice how this law demonstrates in thisLove-System in a threefold manner:On the plane of the Monad, as the law of cohesion, the law of birth, if we mightuse that term, resulting in the appearance of the Monads in their seven groups.Love the source, and the Monad of love, the result.On the plane of buddhi , as the law of magnetic control. It shows itself as thelove-wisdom aspect, irradiating the ego, and eventually gathering to itself theessence of all experience, garnered, via the Ego, through the personality lives,and controlled throughout from the plane of buddhi. Magnetism, and the capacityto show love, are occultly synonymous.On the astral plane , as love demonstrating through the [577] personality. Allbranches of the law of attraction, demonstrating in this system, show themselvesas a force that ingathers, that tends to coherence, that results in adhesion,and leads to absorption. All these terms are needed to give a general idea ofthe basic quality of this law.This law is one of the most important of the systemic laws, if it is permissibleto differentiate at all; we might term it the law of coalescence.On the path of involution it controls the primal gathering together of molecularmatter, beneath the atomic subplane. It is the basis of the attractive qualitythat sets in motion the molecules and draws them into the needed aggregations.It is the measure of the subplanes. The atomic subplane sets the rate ofvibration; the Law of Cohesion might be said to fix the colouring of each plane.It is the same thing in other words. We need always to remember in discussingthese abstract fundamentals that words but dim the meaning, and serve but assuggestions and not as elucidations.In manifestation the cosmic Law of Attraction controls all these subsidiarylaws, just as the Law of Synthesis governs pralaya and obscuration, and the lawof Economy deals with the general working out, along the line of leastresistance, of the logoic scheme. During manifestation we have most to do withthe Law of Attraction, and it will be found, on study, that each subsidiary lawis but a differentiation of that law.This second law of the system governs specially the second plane, and the secondsubplane on each plane. It might be interesting to work this out and trace theunderlying correspondence, bearing in mind always that all that can be done isto point out certain things, and indicate lines of thought that may lead, ifpursued, to illumination.Ray Two and Law Two are closely allied, and it is [578] interesting to realisethat it is on the second subplane of the monadic plane that the majority of theMonads have their habitat; there are a few Monads of power or will on the atomicsubplane, but their numbers are not many, and they simply form a nucleus inevolutionary preparation for System III, the power system. The majority of theMonads are on the second subplane and they are the Monads of love; on the thirdsubplane can be found quite a number of the Monads of activity, but numericallynot as many as the Monads of love. They are the failures of System I.There is a direct channel, as we know, between the atomic subplane on eachplane. This is more or less true of each subplane and its corresponding highersubplane numerically, and there is, therefore, a direct and quite expansivechannel between the second subplane on all planes, enabling the Monads of loveto link up with peculiar facility with all their vehicles when composed ofsecond subplane matter. After initiation, the causal body is found on the secondsubplane of the mental plane, and monadic control then commences.The Monads of love return (after life in the three worlds and the attainment ofthe goal) to their originating second subplane, that being also the goal for themonads of activity who have to develop the love aspect. In the five worlds ofhuman evolution both groups of Monads have to control atomic and molecularmatter as well and this is done by the utilisation to the full (as full as maybe possible in this second system), of the will or power aspect.The “Kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,” or byWill or power. It is not Will, as we shall know it in the final system but it isWill as known in this system, and it has to be utilised to the uttermost by theevolving Monad in his struggle to control each atomic subplane. The Monads ofpower have [579] a much greater struggle, and hence the fact so often apparentthat people on what we term the power Ray, have so often a hard time, and are sofrequently unlovable. They have to build in on all the six planes the loveaspect, which is not prominent in their development.A hint has been given us as to the approximate figures governing the Monads:35 Thousand million Monads of love20 Thousand million Monads of activity5 Thousand million Monads of powermaking a total of sixty thousand million human Monads. The Monads of power,though in manifestation, are as yet very rare in incarnation. They came in, inlarge numbers, at the close of the moon chain, and will come in again in fullnumerical strength in the last two rounds of the present chain.We might now briefly trace the correspondence in the second round and the secondroot-race, showing how the Law of Cohesion was specially active at theseperiods. A condition of nebulosity of a pronouncedly volatile condition, markedthe first round and race. Movement, and the accompaniment of heat, is theirdistinguishing quality, much as in System I, but in the second round, and alsoin the second race, a definite cohesion is noticeable, and form is more clearlyrecognisable in outline. Cohesion is also plainly to be seen as thedistinguishing feature of our present system, the second. It is the aim of allthings to unite; approximation, unification, a simultaneous attraction betweentwo or more is ever to be seen as a governing principle, whether we look at thesex problem, or whether it demonstrates in business organisation, in scientificdevelopment, in manufacture, or in politics. Well might we say that theAt-one-ment of the many separated is the keynote of our system.One more suggestion may be given: On the path of [580] involution this lawgoverns the gathering together and the segregation of matter; on theevolutionary path it controls the building of forms. It has been stated that thematter of the lowest subplane forms the basis of a new plane; therefore we haveon the atomic subplane a point where merging takes place, which makes it a planeof synthesis, just as in the same way the first or logoic plane is the plane ofsynthesis for this system. There takes place the merging of evolution into aninconceivably higher state.3. The Law of Disintegration .—This is the law that governs the destruction ofthe form in order that the indwelling life may shine forth in fullness. It isanother aspect of the Law of Cohesion—the reverse side (if one might so expressit), and is just as much a part of the divine plan as that of attraction. It isone of the laws that ends with the solar system, for the great laws ofattraction, cohesion and love last on into that which is to come. The Law ofDisintegration has its correspondence in cosmic law, but it is almostincomprehensible to us. The Law of Economy holds the key to this law. When theMonad has circled through all disintegrating forms, and has achieved the sixthInitiation, it is resolved into its primal monadic source, and the five lessersheaths are destroyed. Later on the Monads themselves are synthesised, notdisintegrated. This law controls only from the third plane, and ceases action inthis particular fashion when the third plane is transcended.This law is one of the most difficult for the race to understand. Some of itsworkings (those on the path of evolution), can be seen and somewhatcomprehended, but on the path of involution, or of construction, the working outof the law is not so apparent to the superficial observer.On the path of involution it controls the process of the [581] breaking up ofgroup souls; it governs the periods when the permanent triads are transferredfrom one form to another; it works through the great world cataclysms, and weneed to remember that it governs, not only the physical plane catastrophes (aswe erroneously term them), but the corresponding cataclysms on the astral plane,and the lower levels of the mental plane. It governs physical plane disruptions,especially those affecting the mineral world; it controls the disintegration, onthe astral plane, of thought-forms; it dissolves the astral vehicle when leftbehind, and the mental likewise. The dissipation of the etheric double is theresult of its working.Again we can correlate this law with that of Attraction, for the two interactupon each other. This law breaks up the forms, and the Law of Attraction drawsback to primal sources the material of those forms, prior to rebuilding themanew.On the path of evolution the effects of this law are well known, not only in thedestruction of the discarded vehicles touched upon above, but in the breaking upof the forms in which great ideals are embodied,—the forms of political control,the forms in which nature itself evolves, apart from those in which individualconsciousness manifests, the great religious thought-forms, the philanthropicconcepts and all the forms which science, art, and religion take at any oneparticular time. All eventually break under the working of this law.Its workings are more apparent to the average human mind in its manifestationsat this time on the physical plane. We can trace the connection between theatmic and the physical plane (demonstrating on the lower plane as the law ofsacrifice and death), but its effect can be seen on all the five planes as well.It is the law that destroys the final sheath that separates the perfected Jiva.It has not yet been fully brought out [582] (for the law of correspondences hasbeen little studied, nor is it readily apparent) that on the third subplane ofeach plane this law works in a special manner, causing a very definitebreaking-up of something that is tending to separation. Like all that works inthe system, the process is slow; the work of disintegration begins on the thirdsubplane, and is finished on the second, when the Law of Disintegration comesunder the influence of the Law of Cohesion, the disintegration having effectedthat which makes cohesion possible. We can see an illustration of this on themental plane. The causal body of the average man is on the third subplane, andas a man becomes fit for the merging into the Triad, that causal body has to bediscarded and done away with. Under the Law of Sacrifice and Death, thedisintegration is begun on the third level and is consummated on the second,when the man merges with the Triad, preparatory to the final merging with theMonad.Another illustration of the same thing can be found on the physical plane. Whena man has reached the point where he can sense and see the fourth ether, he isready for the burning away of the etheric web, which has its location midwaybetween the third and second subplane matter which composes his physical body.When this disintegration is effected, the man merges with his astral vehicle,establishing a consequent continuity of consciousness. This correspondence, andthis disintegration, can be traced on each plane, till finally on the atmiclevel on its third subplane comes the final disintegration, which results in amerging with the monadic consciousness.The third Ray, that of adaptability or activity, has a close connection withthis law. It is through activity (or the adaptation of matter to need), that theform comes into being; through activity it is employed, and through that veryadaptation it becomes a perfect form, [583] and at the moment of perfectionloses its usefulness; it crystallises, breaks, and the evolving life escapes tofind for itself new forms of greater capacity and adequacy. It is so in the lifeof the reincarnating Ego; it is so in the rounds and races of humanity; it is soin the solar system; it is so in all cosmic processes.In the third chain, the moon chain, we have an interesting related fact. On themoon chain the point of attainment for the individual was the arhat or fourthInitiation,—the initiation which marks the final breaking with the three worlds,and the disintegration of the egoic body.At the end of the third root-race came the first of the great cataclysms thatbroke the race form, and inaugurated a new one, for it was the first definitelyhuman race as we now know it. The analogy will be found to hold good no matterfrom what angle the subject may be studied. In the third subrace acorrespondence can be traced, though it is not yet apparent to the circumscribedvision which characterises most of us. Close proximity to an effect often veilsa cause.4. The law of Magnetic Control ( 182 [text00028.html#Y_FN182] )—This law is thebasic law controlling the Spiritual Triad. Through this law, the force ofevolution drives the Ego to progress through the cycle of reincarnation back tounion with his kind. Through separation he finds himself, and then—driven by theindwelling buddhic or Christ principle—transcends himself, and finds himselfagain in all selves. This law holds the evolving lower self in a coherent form.It controls the Ego in the causal body, in the same way that the Logos controlsthe Monad on the second plane. It is the law of the buddhic plane; the [584]Master is one Who can function on the buddhic levels, and Who has magneticcontrol in the three worlds. The lower is always controlled from above, and theeffect the buddhic levels have on the three lower is paramount, though that isscarcely yet conceded by our thinkers. It is the Law of Love, in the threeworlds, that holds all together, and that draws all upward. It is thedemonstration, in the Triad, of the Law of Attraction.On the path of involution this law works with the permanent atoms in the causalbody. It is the buddhic principle, and its relation with the lower permanentatom of the Triad is the mainspring of the life of the Ego. On the path ofdescent it has much to do with the placing of the permanent atoms, but thismatter is very abstruse, and the time has not yet come for further elucidation.At the third outpouring, (in which the fourth kingdom, the human, was formed),it was this Law of Magnetic Control that effected the juncture of astro-animalman, and the descending Monad, using the spark of mind as the method ofat-one-ment. Again we can see how it works. The monadic plane, the buddhicplane, and the astral plane are all three closely allied, and we find there theline of least resistance. Hence the facility with which the mystic contacts thebuddhic and even higher planes. The lines of least resistance in the threesystems are:System I. Physical, mental, and atmic. The atmic was the highest point ofachievement in that system. II. Astral, buddhic and monadic. III. Mental, atmicand logoicNote the correspondence therefore to be seen between the fourth kingdom and theworking of this, the fourth law. It is of vital moment in this fourth chain.As regards human evolution, this fourth law is of prime importance at this time.The aim of human endeavour [585] is both to be controlled by this law, andlikewise to wield it in service. It is the law whereby sex expression, as weknow it, is transmuted and elevated; sex is only the physical planedemonstration of the Law of Attraction; it is the working out of that law in thehuman kingdom, and in all the lower kingdoms, too. The love of all thatbreathes, and the attraction that works out in service, is the same thing asdemonstrated in the Triad. Sex expression, the coming together of two, becomestransmuted into the coming together of many for acts of service, which will givebirth to new ideals, and to a new race—the spiritual.Here I might point out a numerical fact that may be of interest in connectionwith the fourth hierarchy. This human hierarchy is the fourth, as we know, yetif we count the five hierarchies that have passed on, it is in reality theninth. Nine is the number of initiation, the number of the adept, and of the manwho functions in his buddhic vehicle.The fourth Ray also operates in close connection with the fourth Law. It is theRay of Harmony or Beauty—Harmony through control, that control entailing theknowledge of wisdom. It is the harmony of similarity; it is the equilibrising ofall through the realisation of the laws of magnetism that produce theco-ordination of the many diverse into the one homogeneous; magnetism governsthe synthesis of the many aspects into a form of unity. This harmony is reachedthrough the fifth plane, and the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge acts as a stepto the fourth, for many who work on the fifth Ray pass eventually to the fourth.In this system the fifth Ray is of paramount importance in the development ofall egos. Each must pass some time on it before definitely remaining on hismonadic Ray. In many incarnations much time is spent on the fifth subplane ofeach plane, which is governed principally by the fifth Ray. All pass [586] thenon the fourth subplane governed by the fourth Ray, and in this particular periodof the fourth round in the fourth chain, more time is spent on the fourthsubplane by evolving Egos than on any other. Many come into incarnation directlyon to this plane, and it is here that they begin to think harmoniously.The Laws in the Three Worlds. —We will now take up and briefly study the threemost important laws affecting the evolving human being, as he lives his life inthe three worlds. These laws are:1. The Law of Fixation.2. The Law of Love.3. The Law of Sacrifice and Death.These laws are all dominated and controlled eventually by the three higher lawsin the system—the Laws of Magnetic Control, of Disintegration, and of Cohesion.There is a direct connection between these seven laws and the seven Rays orVibrations, and if we study the correspondence we shall recognise the fact thatthe first law, that of Vibration, is the controlling law of the six,demonstrating through the second law, that of Cohesion, just as the solar Logosis at this time manifesting Himself through His second aspect in this the secondsolar system.The first Ray of Will or Power is the first aspect of the All-self, and in thethird outpouring, ( 183 [text00028.html#Y_FN183] ) came [587] down to the fifthplane, along with the other monads. A subtle correspondence exists between themonads of Will on the fifth plane, the fifth law, and the fifth Ray.The second Ray or the Love-Wisdom aspect wields a control on the fourth andsixth planes, and dominates the Laws of Cohesion and Magnetic Control, and theastral Law of Love. There is a direct interlinking between the abstract Rays andthe laws of the planes where they specially control.The third Ray which is the Activity aspect, controls the Laws of Disintegrationand of Death, on the third and seventh planes.Therefore, it will be apparent to the careful student of the wisdom that:1. The Power Aspect —Ray 1, Planes 1 and 5, and the Laws of Fixation andVibration, form one interlocking whole.2. The Love Aspect —Ray 2, Planes 2, 4, 6, and the Laws of Cohesion, MagneticControl, and of Love, form another unit.3. The Activity Aspect —Ray 3, Planes 3 and 7, and the Laws of Disintegration,Sacrifice and Death, make still another group.It is logical for the first Ray only to have control, as yet, on two planes, forthe Power Aspect waits for another system in order to demonstrate in fulldevelopment. Ray two, the synthetic Ray for our system, controls [588] on threeplanes; it has the preponderance, for paramountly we are the Monads of Love, andLove is our synthesis. Ray three, the dominant Ray of the system which is past,its synthetic Ray, controls on two planes, and on one that is little understood,for, just as the physical body is not considered a principle, so there is asphere of activity that is not included in our enumeration, it is past and gone.Some explanation of this lies hid in the occult words, “The Eighth Sphere.”In regard to the four minor Rays of Harmony, Concrete Science, Devotion andCeremonial Order, their control exists in degrees on all the planes, but theyhave their particular emphasis in the evolution of the reincarnating ego in thethree worlds at this time. These four Rays control, in a subtle and peculiarmanner, the four kingdoms of nature—mineral, vegetable, animal and human—and attheir merging into the three Rays of Aspect (the Activity Ray of the Mahachohanbeing the synthesiser of the lower four in our planetary scheme) have acorrespondence with the merging of man (the product of the three kingdoms andthe fourth) into the superman kingdom, the spiritual. The fourth Ray and thefourth Kingdom form a point of harmony for the lower three, and all four thenpass into the major or upper three. This is worthy of our serious thought, andthe analogy of the fourth plane will also be apparent. For this system, thebuddhic plane, the human kingdom, and the fourth Ray of Harmony or Beauty orSynthesis, have a point of correspondence, just as the fourth rootrace is theone in which the synthesis is first observed—the door into the fifth kingdom ofSpirit being then opened; the fourth rootrace also developed the astral capacitythat made contact with the fourth or buddhic level possible.In a subtle way too (I use the word subtle for lack of a better, meaning astatement of actuality that seems an [589] illusion), the three minor Rays,Concrete Science, Devotion and Ceremonial Law, have each a connection with thethree kingdoms of nature below the human, and with the three laws of the threelower worlds.The Ray of Ceremonial Order has special significance at this time; it controlslife in the mineral world, and in the final stages of involutionary life at thepoint where the upward turn of evolution is made. Through Ceremonial Order comesthe control of the lesser builders, the elemental forces, the point of synthesisin the lowest plane of all, the period of transition. In all such periods theseventh Ray comes in (as now) the Ray of Law and Order, of accurate arrangementand formation. It is the reflection on the physical plane of the Power andActivity Aspects working in synthesis. Rays 1, 3, 7, have an interplay, as weknow. Ray seven is the appearance in combination of the forces of evolution. Itis the manifestation of Power and Activity on the lowest plane of all. It isallied to the laws of the third and seventh planes, Disintegration and Death,for all periods of transition are periods of the destruction and building offorms, and the shattering of the old in order that newer and better chalices oflife may be constructed.The Ray of Devotion has a definite though little known connection with thevegetable kingdom. We must remember that it is linked to a subsidiary law of thecosmic Law of Attraction. It is in the vegetable kingdom that we find one of thefirst and temporary approximations between the evolving human Monad, and theevolving deva Monad. The two parallel evolutions touch in that kingdom, and thenagain follow their own paths, finding their next point of contact on the fourthor buddhic level, and a final merging on the second.The concrete Rays have an especial effect on the negative evolution of thedevas, who form the feminine aspect of the divine hermaphroditic Man, workingalong [590] the lines of more positive development. The abstract Rays do asimilar work on the positive human hierarchy, tending towards a more receptiveattitude. This hierarchy forms the masculine aspect of the divine Hermaphrodite.But at three points on the path of evolution the Monads of Love, working on theabstract qualities, touch the devas of activity working on concrete faculty. Theperfection of the two evolutions marks the point of attainment of the divineHeavenly Man; it is the perfecting of the two major centres, creative activityand love, of the Logos. In their lower aspect these centres are known as thecentres of generation and the solar plexus, but are transmuted, as evolutionproceeds, into the throat and heart centres. Then, in a dual synthesis, theywill pass on into the third system, that in which the Power aspect is developed,and the head centres will be complete. This achieved, our Logos has triumphed,and measured up to the sixth cosmic Initiation, just as He should measure up inthis system to the fourth.The Ray of Concrete Science has a peculiar relationship to the animal kingdom,in that it is the Ray that governs the merging of that kingdom into the human.The planet, Venus, in her fifth round, gave the impetus which produced the sparkof mind in animal man—a fact well known. It is also the fifth Ray, and has aninteresting connection with the fifth Law of Fixation. We might study, too, withprofit, the analogy that can be seen between these factors and the fifthroot-race, the race of peculiarly strong development of the concrete mind. TheLaw of Analogy always holds good.With this as a basis, the three laws of the personality become replete withlife, and can be summed up in the well-known term, “The Law of Rebirth and Deathin the three worlds.” The fifth law governs a fixed point in the personality,that of the fifth principle.[591] The Law of Love in the astral body also has its points for consideration.There is a direct link between the astral body (love in the personality), thebuddhic vehicle (love in the Triad), and the Monads of Love. Later on, this willbe understood more fully, but it is the main channel for the basic law of thesystem, Love. These three points mark periods of completion, and likewisestarting-points for fresh endeavour in the life of the evolving Monad—from thepersonality to the Triad, from the Triad to the Monad, from the Monad back againto its source.5. The Law of Fixation. —This is the governing law of the mental plane, findingits greater correspondence in the Law of Karma on cosmic mental levels. “As aman thinks, so is he;” according to his thoughts are his desires and acts, andso results the future. He fixes for himself the resultant karma. The word“Fixation” is chosen for two purposes: First, because the word implies thecapacity of the thinker to shape his own destiny, and secondly because the wordimplies a stabilising idea, for as evolution progresses, the Ego evolves thefaculty of forming definite concrete thought-forms, and, through these stableproducts, of subduing the fluctuations of the astral body.This law of the fifth, or mental plane is one of the most important laws withwhich we have to do at any time, and it will find its most completedemonstration in the next, or fifth round. In relation to this fourth round thefollowing facts may be gathered about its working:It is the law under which the evolving personality builds up, during the courseof many lives, the causal body; it fixes the matter inhering in that body,placed there by the man as the ages slip away, and crystallises it. Before thefourth Initiation the crystallisation is complete, and the inevitable shatteringthat is the result of crystallisation in all forms, takes place, setting the[592] indwelling life free for further progress. All forms are but hindrancesand limitations, and ultimately must go, but they have their needed place in thedevelopment of the race. Eventually the causal body of the entire race itselfdisintegrates.This law governs the crystallisation of all forms prior to their shattering inthe process of evolution.It governs the time of rebirth, being one of the subsidiary branches of the Lawof Karma. Each of the seven subsidiary laws is linked to one of the cosmic laws,or with the Sirian Law of Karma. We need always to remember that theconsciousness of the cosmic mental plane is the logoic goal of attainment, andthat the Sirian Logos is to our solar Logos what the human Ego is to thepersonality. The Law of Karma, or cosmic Fixation, is the law of the cosmicmental plane, and controls the corresponding law in our system.In the fifth round this law will act as the divider, temporarily crystallisingand fixing into two great classes the human Monads, as they evolve. One groupthen (containing those who will reach the goal), will pass gradually out fromunder the domination of this law, and will come under the Law of MagneticControl. The other will remain under the law in a static condition, until in alater period a fresh opportunity will come; old forms will break, and in anothermahamanvantara, and in its fifth period, will come the chance for which theywill have waited, when they can again swing into the current of evolution andthe imprisoned spirits may mount again towards their source.In an occult sense this law is for us the one with which we are the mostintimately concerned. It plays an important part in the hands of the Lords ofFlame, and is one of Their main factors in controlling the three worlds. Notehere an interesting fact, that Venus is the sixth planet (esoterically thesecond), and is in her [593] fifth round, and hence is ahead of us along everyline.This law demonstrates the static quality of love, static temporarily, butnecessarily so when viewed from the standpoint of time, the great deluder. Onthe path of involution this law again works with the permanent atoms in thethree worlds, with the building in of material around those atoms, in connectionwith the building devas and the reincarnating Egos. The devas are the motheraspect, the builders of the body, and the reincarnating Jivas are the sonaspect; yet the two are but one, and the result is the divine hermaphroditicman. (See page 512)6. The Law of Love .—It is not easy, in this brief digest, to approach thetremendous problem of the place love plays in the evolving scheme of things asunderstood by three-dimensional man. A treatise could be written on the subject,and yet leave it unexhausted. Much light comes if we can ponder deeply on thethree expressions of Love: Love in the Personality, Love in the Ego, and Love inthe Monad. Love in the Personality gradually develops through the stages of loveof self, pure and simple and entirely selfish, to love of family and friends, tolove of men and women, until it arrives at the stage of love of humanity orgroup love consciousness which is the predominant characteristic of the Ego. AMaster of Compassion loves, suffers with, and remains with His kind and with Hiskin. Love in the Ego gradually develops from love of humanity into loveuniversal—a love that expresses not only love of humanity, but also love of thedeva evolutions in their totality, and of all forms of divine manifestation.Love in the Personality is love in the three worlds; love in the Ego is love inthe solar system, and all that it contains; whilst love in the Monaddemonstrates a measure of cosmic love, and embraces much that is outside thesolar system altogether.[594] This term “The Law of Love,” is after all too generic a term to apply toone law governing one plane, but will have to suffice for the present, as itconveys the type of idea that is needed, to our minds. The Law of Love is inreality but the law of the system in demonstration on all the planes. Love wasthe impelling motive for manifestation, and love it is that keeps all in orderedsequence; love bears all on the path of return to the Father’s bosom, and loveeventually perfects all that is. It is love that builds the forms that cradletemporarily the inner hidden life, and love is the cause of the disruption ofthose forms, and their utter shattering, so that the life may further progress.Love manifests on each plane as the urge that drives the evolving Monad onwardsto its goal, and love is the key to the deva kingdom, and the reason of theblending of the two kingdoms eventually into the divine Hermaphrodite. Loveworks through the concrete rays in the building of the system, and in therearing of the structure that shelters the Spirit, and love works through theabstract rays for the full and potent development of that inherent divinity.Love demonstrates, through the concrete rays, the aspects of divinity, formingthe persona that hides the one Self; love demonstrates through the abstract raysin developing the attributes of divinity, in evolving to fullest measure thekingdom of God within. Love in the concrete rays leads to the path of occultism;love in the abstract rays leads to that of the mystic. Love forms the sheath andinspires the life; love causes the logoic vibration to surge forward, carryingall on its way, and bringing all to perfected manifestation.In System I, Activity, Desire for Expression, and the Impulse to Move was thebasic note. That activity produced certain results, certain permanent effects,and thus formed the nucleus for the present system. Ordered Activity is thefoundation of this system of ordered [595] Love, and leads to system three,wherein ordered Activity, with ordered Love for its impulse, results in orderedloving Power.The sixth Ray of devotion and the sixth law of love have a close alliance, andon the sixth plane comes the powerful working out in the lower Triad, thePersonality, of the Law of Love. On the astral plane, the home of the desires,originate those feelings which we call personal love; in the lowest type ofhuman being this shows itself as animal passion; as evolution proceeds it showsitself as a gradual expansion of the love faculty, passing through the stages oflove of mate, love of family, love of surrounding associates, to love of one’sentire environment; patriotism gives place later to love of humanity, oftenhumanity as exemplified in one of the Great Ones. The astral plane is, at thepresent time, the most important for us, for in desire—not corrected ortransmuted—lies the difference between the personal consciousness and that ofthe Ego. ( 185 [text00028.html#Y_FN185] )In the sixth Scheme, that of Venus, this can be seen clearly; it is the schemeof love. Viewed from one angle, the Venusian Scheme is the second, and fromanother it is the sixth. It depends upon whether we reason from thecircumference to the centre or the reverse.It is the home of the planetary Logos of the sixth Ray. This may sound like acontradiction, but it is not so really; we must remember the interlocking, thegradual shifting and changing, that takes place in time on all [596] the Rays.In the same way the Earth chain is the third if viewed from one aspect and thefifth viewed from another.In the sixth chain of each scheme, this sixth law and the sixth Ray have a veryimportant significance, whilst the seventh chain of each scheme is alwayssynthetic—Love and Activity in a perfect balance. The same effect can bedemonstrated in the sixth Round. In the sixth Round of the present chain of theEarth scheme, the sixth law will demonstrate with great clarity and force, aslove shown in brotherhood, love translated or transmuted from the astral to thebuddhic. So in the sixth rootrace and the sixth subrace a similar analogy willbe seen. Out of the shattered form of the fifth subrace of the fifth root race,built up under the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge, with the aid of the fifthLaw of Fixation, will emerge the sixth subrace of brotherly love—love shown inthe realisation of the one life latent in each Son of God.7. The Law of Sacrifice and Death. This law links itself to the third law, thatof Disintegration following the connection that always exists between the atmicand the physical plane. The Law of Disintegration controls the fivefolddestruction of forms in the five lower worlds, and the Law of Death controlssimilarly in the three worlds. It is subsidiary to the third law. The Law ofSacrifice is the Law of Death in the subtle bodies, whilst what we call death isthe analogous thing in the physical body. This law governs the gradualdisintegration of concrete forms and their sacrifice to the evolving life, andis closely linked in its manifestation with the seventh Ray. This Ray is the onethat largely controls, that manipulates, that geometrises and that holds swayover the form side, governing the elemental forces of nature. The physical planeis the most concrete exemplification of the form side ; it holds the divine lifeimprisoned or [597] enmeshed at its densest point, and it works at this time inline with the seventh law. In a mysterious way this law is the reverse side ofthe first, or the Law of Vibration. It is Vulcan and Neptune in opposition,which is as yet an almost incomprehensible thing for us. The densest form ofexpression on the physical plane is after all but a form of synthesis; just asthe rarest form of expression on the highest plane is but unity or synthesis ofa finer kind. One is the synthesis of matter, and the other the synthesis oflife.This law governs the seventh chain in each scheme; each chain having achievedthe fullest expression possible in the scheme, comes under the Law of Death, andobscuration and disintegration supervenes. In a cosmic sense and analogy, it isthe law that governs the coming in of pralaya at the end of a system. It is thelaw that shatters the cross of the cosmic Christ, and places the form of theChrist within the tomb for a period of time.The Principle of Mutation. In concluding the above information about the laws,it is needful that we all recognise the extreme danger of dogmatising aboutthese matters, and the risk of laying down hard and fast rules. Much must remainunexplained and untouched, and much also will serve to raise only questions inour minds. Comprehension is as yet impossible. Until fourth-dimensional sight isours, it will scarcely be possible for us to do more than hint at, and get apassing vision of, the complexity and the interweaving in the system. It is noteasy for us to do more than grip as a mental concept the fact that the rays,schemes, planets, chains, rounds, races and laws form a unit; seen from theangle of human vision the confusion seems unimaginable, and the key of itssolution to be so hidden as to be useless; yet, seen from the angle of logoicsight, [598] the whole moves in unison, and is geometrically accurate. In orderto give some idea of the complexity of the arrangement, I would like here topoint out that the Rays themselves circulate, the Law of Karma controlling theinterweaving. For instance, Ray I may pass around a scheme (if it is theparamount Ray of the scheme) with its first subray manifesting in a chain, itssecond in a round, its third in a world period, its fourth in a root race, itsfifth in a subrace, and its sixth in a branch race. I give this in illustration,and not as the statement of a fact in present manifestation. This gives us someidea of the vastness of the process, and of its wonderful beauty. It isimpossible for us, sweeping through on some one Ray, to visualise or in any wayto apprehend this beauty; yet, to those on higher levels and with a wider rangeof vision, the gorgeousness of the design is apparent.This complexity is for us very much increased because we do not yet understandthe principle governing this mutation. Nor is it possible for even the highesthuman mind in the three worlds to do more than sense and approximate thatprinciple. By mutation I mean the fact that there is a constant changing andshifting, an endless interweaving and interlocking, and a ceaseless ebb andflow, in the dramatic interplay of the forces that stand for the dual synthesisof Spirit and matter. There is constant rotation in the Rays and planes, intheir relative importance from the standpoint of time which is the standpointmost closely associated with us. But we can rest assured that there is somefundamental principle directing all the activities of the Logos in His system,and by wrestling to discover the basic principle on which our microcosmic livesrest, we may discover aspects of this inherent logoic principle. This opens toour consideration a wide range of vision, and [599] though it emphasises thecomplexity of the subject, it also demonstrates the divine magnitude of thescheme, with its magnificent intricacies. The reason the fourth is a major roundis because in this round two things happened—the spark of mind was implanted andthe door was opened from the animal kingdom into the human; and later, anotherdoor opened, on to the Path leading from the human kingdom into thespiritual—again a dual reason. The fifth round is a major round because it marksa point in evolution where those who will achieve the goal, and those who willnot, are sharply differentiated into two groups; the seventh is a major roundbecause it will mark the merging of the two evolutions, the human and the deva.The major root races are chosen under the Law of Correspondence. In the thirdroot race came the third Outpouring, the merging and the point of contactbetween the Spiritual Triad and the Lower Quaternary. The fifth root race marksa point where higher and lower manas approximate, and where the concrete mind,meeting its highest development of this round, gives place to the intuition fromabove. Here again we have a twofold reason. The seventh root race againdemonstrates dual attainment, love in activity, the basis of the third system ofWill or Power.The three major Rays, being dual, are their own sufficient explanation. They areat present the mode of expression of the three aspects, and demonstrate undertheir appropriate Logoi, Who manipulate world affairs through the threedepartments, of which the rulers on our planet are the Lord Maitreya, the Manu,and the Mahachohan. The three major planes demonstrate easily their uniqueposition—on plane two we have the home of the Monads of Love, on plane five wefind the habitat of their reflections, the reincarnating Egos, and [600] on thephysical plane we find the working out at its densest point of the life of theSpirit.This principle of mutation governs every department in the Law ofCorrespondences, and certain things can be stated as regards the system, and itscomponent parts which will be found illuminating if we remember that they arefacts for the present . Let me again illustrate: we have been told that thethree major Rays at this time are the first, the second, and the seventh. Butlater, the Rays now major may become subsidiary, and others take their place,though for this solar system the second Ray, being the synthetic Ray, willalways be a major Ray. Perhaps we can here get a hint on this great principle,though we must be careful not to draw it out to too fine a conclusion. For thissystem the major Rays will always be the dual Rays—the negative-positive Rays,the masculine-feminine Rays—this being the dual system. The major Rays forsystem three will be those in triple manifestation.The following table may be found of interest, if regarded as relative, and asholding information for the present time, but also as being subject to changeand circulation:7 Rays Major 1-2-7 Four subsidiary converging on the fifth. 7 Principles 3 MajorMonad, Ego and Personality, synthesising at various stages the four subsidiary.7 Chains Major 1-4-7 7 Planes Major 2-5-7 7 Manvantaras Major 3-4-7 7 RoundsMajor 4-5-7 7 Root races Major 3-5-7 7 Sub races Major 1-5-6 7 Initiations Major1 4 5 if viewed from the angle of human attainment, and 1-5-7 if viewed from ahigher.[601]II. THOUGHT ELEMENTALS AND DEVAS.1. THE RULER OF FIRE—AGNI.a. Agni and the Solar Logos.Thus far in this treatise we have considered the first section of the book whichhas dealt somewhat with the internal fires of the system, both macrocosmic andmicrocosmic. In this the second section we are dealing with the fire of mind.This section, together with the nine introductory questions, constitutes themain part of the treatise. In it we have dealt with the nature and function ofmind and with the egoic ray. We have dealt also, somewhat, with the form side ofthought, with its material manifestation and with its substance.We proceed now to take up the consideration of the Ruler of Fire, AGNI , and arebrought to the study of the vitality that energises and the Life that animates;to the contemplation of the Fire that drives, propels, and produces the activityand organisation of all forms. The realisation of this will reveal the fact thatwhat we are dealing with is the “Life and the lives,” ( 186, 187[text00028.html#Y_FN186] ) as it is called [602] in the Secret Doctrine; withAgni, the Lord of Fire, the Creator, the Preserver, and the Destroyer; and withthe forty-nine fires through which He manifests. We are dealing with solar fireper se, with the essence of thought, with the coherent life of all forms, withthe consciousness in its evolving aspect, or with Agni, the sumtotal of theGods. He is Vishnu and the Sun in His glory; He is the fire of matter and thefire of mind blended and fused; He is the intelligence which throbs in everyatom; He is the Mind that actuates the system; He is the fire of substance andthe substance of the fire; He is the Flame and that which the Flame destroys.Students of the Secret Doctrine when they read carelessly are apt to considerHim only as the fire of matter and omit to note that He is Himself thesumtotal—and this is especially the case when they find that Agni is the Lord ofthe mental plane. ( 188 [text00028.html#Y_FN188] ) He is the animating life ofthe solar system, and that life is the life of [603] God, the energy of theLogos, and the manifestation of the radiance which veils the Central Sun. Onlyas He is recognised as Fohat, the energy of matter, as Wisdom, the nature of theEgo and its motivation, and as essential unity, can any due conception bearrived at as to His nature or being. He is not the solar Logos on the cosmicmental plane, for the egoic consciousness of the Logos is more than His physicalmanifestation, but Agni is the sumtotal of that portion of the logoic Ego whichis reflected down into His physical vehicle; He is the life of the logoicPersonality, with all that is included in that expression. He is to the solarLogos on His own plane what the coherent personality of a human being is to hisEgo in the causal body. This is a very important point to be grasped, and ifmeditated upon will bring to the student much enlightenment. His is the lifethat fuses and blends the threefold nature of the Logos when in physicalincarnation; His is the coherent force that makes a unity of the triple logoicPersonality, but man can only arrive at His essential nature by the study of thelogoic physical vehicle—hence the difficulty; he can only understand by aconsideration of His psychic emanation as it can be sensed and viewed by passingthe history of the races in retrospect. Man’s personality reveals his nature ashis life progresses; his psychic quality unfolds as the years slip away, andwhen he passes out of incarnation he is spoken of in terms of quality, good orbad, selfish or unselfish; the effect of his “emanation” during life is thatwhich remains in men’s minds. Thus only can the logoic personality expressitself, and our knowledge of His nature is consequently limited by our closeperspective, and handicapped by the fact that we are participants in His life,and integral parts of His manifestation.It is only as we begin to function upon the buddhic plane that we can in any way“live in the subjective” [604] side of nature, and it is only as our knowledgeof the spiritual life increases, and as we pass definitely through the portal ofinitiation into the fifth kingdom that we can appreciate the distinction betweenthe dense physical, and the vital body. Only as we become polarised in thecosmic etheric body and are no longer held prisoner by a dense material sheath(for the three lower planes are but the dense body of the Logos) do we come to afuller understanding of the psychic nature of the Logos, for we stand then inthe body which bridges the gulf between the dense physical, and the astral bodyof the Logos. Only when this is the case do we understand the function of theLord Agni as the vital life of the cosmic etheric, as the vitality of theHeavenly Men and the activity of Their sheaths.b. Agni and the Mental Plane .I seek to deal with a very important point here, emphasising the closeconnection between Agni, the sumtotal of the life force of the logoic threefoldpersonality, as He is seen at work on the mental plane (which closely concernsman), and that manifesting driving force or intelligent will which emanates fromthe cosmic mental plane. There is a very interesting series of correspondencesto be worked out here and we might briefly indicate the lines to be followed inthis connection by the ensuing tabulation:The 5th cosmic plane The cosmic mental. The 5th systemic plane The mental plane.The 5th subplane of the physical The gaseous. The 5th principle Manas. The 5thLaw Fixation, the Law of Concretion. The 5th Ray Concrete knowledge. The 5thround The round of manasic attainment. The 5th root-race The Aryan. Mentaldevelopment. The 5th sub-race The Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon. Concrete mind. The5th group of Devas Fire Devas of the mental plane. The 5th ManvantaraThree-fifths of the manasaputras achieve. The 5th scheme The Lord of concretescience. The 5th Mahamanvantara (or solar system) The solar Logos achieves Hisfifth major Initiation. The 5th chain Principal evolution—fire devas. The 5thHierarchy The greater Builders. Vibrations of fifth order Manasic.[605] It will, therefore, be apparent that when the system is viewed in reverseorder and the physical plane is counted as the first (as it often is whenconsidering it as the field of strictly human evolution), that the thirdplane—the mental plane—comes under the same group of correspondences and Agni,as the energising factor of the dense physical body of the Logos, or as the fireof His most concrete manifestation, vitalising, warming and holding alltogether, has to be considered.Three hierarchies are, in this mahamanvantara, of profound significance, thefourth or human Creative Hierarchy, and the two deva hierarchies, the fifth andsixth.The fourth Hierarchy in the larger scheme is literally the ninth, for fivehierarchies have earlier passed on and are considered as pure abstractions. Inthis system concretion concerns us, and the blending of form and of energy intoone coherent whole. In the ninth, tenth and eleventh Hierarchies lie the clue tothe nature of Agni, the Lord of fire, the sumtotal of systemic vitality. He whounderstands the significance of these figures, and their relation to each otheras the triple division of a Unity in time and space will have discovered [606]one of the keys which will unlock a door hitherto fast closed. They are thenumbers of achievement, of potentiality brought into full activity and of innatecapacity demonstrating in perfect fruition. All potentiality lies in thevitalising, energising power of Agni, and in His ability to stimulate. He islife itself, and the driving force of evolution, of psychic development and ofconsciousness. This fact is hidden in these figures, and not the evolution ofsubstance, which is but a result, emanating from psychic causes. These threenumbers are the basis of the cyclic calculations which concern the egoic cycles,and the cycles of Vishnu, as distinguished from the cycles dealing with thethird aspect. Occult students have not sufficiently grasped the fact thatobjectivity is an inevitable result of an inner conscious subjective life. Whenthis is better apprehended, bodies on the physical plane, for instance, will bepurified, developed and beautified through a scientific attention paid to thedevelopment of the psyche, to the unfoldment of the Ego, and to the stimulationof the egoic vibration. The cause will be dealt with and not the effect, andhence the growing appreciation by the human family of the study of psychology,even though as yet they are but studying the kama-manasic body, and have notreached back to the egoic consciousness. The lunar Lords have had their day; nowAgni, as the solar Lord of life and energy, will assume due importance in humanlife.c. Agni and the Three Fires .In studying the manifestation of Agni in the solar system it should beremembered that we are considering here His essential nature as actuating fire.We have seen that He is the threefold logoic personality, but He is thethreefold Logos in a subjective sense, and the form aspect is only subsidiary.Perhaps a tabulation may make this point clearer.[607]TABULATION VAGNI—LORD OF FIREAspect Fire Result Subjective Manifestation Origin of Energy ObjectiveManifestation First, Will Electric Fire Activity of Spirit The One Life.

Only thus will the true nature of Agnibe apprehended. As the logoic personality He is demonstrating through atriplicity of sheaths forming a unity, and only thus will it become apparent whyat this stage in evolution the material aspect is the most considered.The entire system is the physical sheath of the Logos and consequently the mosteasily cognised, for the Logos is as yet centred in His cosmic sheaths and canonly reveal Himself through their medium.Man’s just apprehension of this mystery of electricity will only come about ashe studies himself, and knows himself to be a triple fire, manifesting in manyaspects.MAN, A FIREMonadic fire Electric fire Spirit Will The Central Spiritual Sun.

Active Intelligence Manas Fire by friction Substance The permanent atoms.Conscious ActivityTHE PERSONALITYWill Mental body Electric fire Lower mind Thought Love Astral body Solar fireKama Desire Activity Physical body Fire by friction Prana ActivityI seek to emphasise here the fact that in this threefold manifestation there isa ninefold unfoldment. It should ever be borne in mind that seven is the numberwhich governs the evolution of substance and of form building in the solarsystem, but that nine is the number governing the development of theconsciousness within that form of the psyche. This is seen in the sevenfolddisplay of logoic life through the planetary scheme, and the ninefold nature ofegoic unfoldment.If the student here substitutes for the words, Monad, Ego and personality, thethree aspects of the Logos, and will bear in mind that as yet all that he canascertain or cognise is the lowest of the logoic manifestations—thepersonality—it will be apparent why so much must remain mysterious to even thehigher grades of initiates, and why even the perfected Dhyan Chohan cannotpenetrate the secrets of the Logos outside His system. ( 189[text00028.html#Y_FN189] ) They [610] can cognise much concerning Agni, the Lordof Fire, but until They can contact that of which He is an emanation, areflection or a ray, there is a limit to what may be known..Agni is Fohat, the threefold Energy (emanating from the logoic Ego) whichproduces the solar system, the physical vehicle of the Logos, and animates theatoms of substance. He is the basis of the evolutionary process, or the cause ofthe psychic unfoldment of the Logos, and He is that vitality which ultimatelybrings about a divine synthesis in which the form approximates subjectivedemand, and after being consciously directed, and manipulated, is finallydiscarded. This is the goal for the Logos as it is for man; this marks the finalliberation of a human being, of a Heavenly Man and of a solar Logos.We could divide the process into three periods:First. The period wherein the fire of matter (the heat of mother) hides,nourishes and brings to birth the infant Ego. This is the period of purelypersonality life, when the third aspect dominates, and man is in the veil ofillusion.Second. The period wherein the Ego, or subjective life within the form, passesthrough certain stages of unfoldment, and comes to an ever fuller consciousness.This is the period of egoic development, and is produced by the gradual mergingand blending of the two fires. It is the life of service and of the Path.Third . The period wherein the egoic consciousness itself is superseded byspiritual realisation, and the fire of Spirit blends with the other two.At first the personality acts the part of mother, or of material aspect, to thegerm of the inner life. Then [611] the Ego manifests its life within thepersonal life, and produces a shining forth which “groweth ever more and moreuntil the perfect day.” (Bible. Proverbs IV, 18.) At that perfect day ofrevelation it is seen what man in essence is, and the Spirit within is revealed.This can be studied from the Christian angle, and Paul was but voicing an occulttruth when he enunciated the facts concerning the birth of the Christ within theheart, and the growth of the higher life at the expense of the lower. Thus alsocan it be taught along occult, and not mystic, lines in the recognition (byscience) of the vitalisation of the permanent atoms (the force centres of thesheaths or substance), of the unfoldment of the egoic lotus, and the awakeningof its petals, and in the final revelation of the jewel in the lotus.All that can be said of man can be predicated of the Logos on an inconceivablygreater scale. As man discovers the laws of his own material sheaths—the laws ofsubstance—he is ascertaining the nature of the fires of the outer man or Fohat,as he vitalises the logoic vehicle; the fires of his own sheaths are aspects ofAgni as the fire of matter. As he ascertains the nature of consciousness, andthe laws of psychical unfoldment he is studying the nature of the vitality ofthe subjective man, and the laws of conscious being, thus studying Agni as Hemanifests as Light and Cool Radiance, shining through the vehicle. Later (forthe time is not yet) as he comes to comprehend the nature of his Monad, thespiritual or essential life which is developing consciousness by means of thesheaths, he will discover the nature of Agni as He shews forth as pureelectricity. Even though this is not yet possible, nevertheless the statement asto the lines of investigation which can be pursued, and the realisation of thatwhich may eventually [612] be achieved, may cause men’s minds to turn to thestudy of the real and of the true.2.The fire devas, the Greater BuildersI have divided the groups of devas and elementals into evolutionary andinvolutionary Builders—those who are in themselves positive force, and thosewhich are negative force, the conscious and the blind workers. It is absolutelyessential that students bear in mind here that we are studying the mystery ofelectricity and therefore must remember the following facts:—a. Introductory Remarks.The Mystery of Electricity. The greater Builders are the positive aspect ofsubstance or of electrical phenomena whilst the lesser Builders are the negativeaspect.Two types of force are represented in the activities of these two groups and itis their interaction and interplay which produces Light, or the manifested solarsystem.Their sumtotal is substance in its totality, the intelligent active form, builtfor the purpose of providing a habitation for a central subjective life.They are also the sumtotal of the Pitris, ( 191 [text00028.html#Y_FN191] ) orFathers of mankind, viewing mankind as the race itself, the fourth kingdom innature, the Heavenly Men in physical manifestation . This is a most importantpoint to emphasise. These deva activities in relation to Self-Consciousness(which is the distinctive characteristic of humanity) can best be studied in thelarge, or through [613] the consideration of groups, of races, and of the lifeof the scheme, the manifestation of one of the Heavenly Men. When the studentbrings his study of deva work down to the terms of his own individual life he isapt to become confused through too close a juxtaposition.The greater Builders are the solar Pitris, whilst the lesser Builders are thelunar ancestors. I would here explain the occult meaning of the word “ancestor,”as used in esotericism. It means literally initiatory life impulse. It is thatsubjective activity which produces objectivity, and concerns those emanatoryimpulses which come from any positive centre of force, and which sweep thenegative aspect into the line of that force, and thus produce a form of somekind. The word “ancestor” is used in connection with both aspects.The solar Logos is the initiatory impulse or Father of the Son in His physicalincarnation, a solar system. He is the sumtotal of the Pitris, in the process ofproviding form . The union of Father (positive force) and Mother (negativeforce) produces that central blaze which we call the form, the body ofmanifestation of the Son. A Heavenly Man holds an analogous position in relationto a planetary scheme. He is the central germ of positive life or force, which,in due course of time, demonstrates as a planetary scheme, or an incarnation ofthe planetary Logos. A man similarly is the positive life or energy which,through action on negative force, creates bodies of manifestation through whichhe can shine or radiate. ( 192 [text00028.html#Y_FN192] ) ( 193[text00028.html#Y_FN193] ) ( 194 [text00028.html#Y_FN194] )The lesser Builders ( 195 [text00028.html#Y_FN195] ) are the negative aspect andare swept into action in group formation through the play [614] of positiveforce upon them, or through the action of the conscious Minds of the system. Atthe present stage of evolution—during the period of Light—it is difficult forthe human being (until he has attained the consciousness of the Ego) todifferentiate between the types of force, and to work consciously with thesedual aspects. An Adept of the Light works with force in substance, viewingsubstance as that which is negative, and therefore occultly to be moved, and Hecan do this because He has (in the three worlds of His endeavour) achievedunity, or the point of balance and equilibrium, and can therefore balance forcesand deal with positive and negative energies as appears best in the interests ofthe plan of evolution. The Brother of Darkness, knowing himself to be positiveforce in essence, works with negative substance, or with the lesser Builders tobring about ends [615] of his own, incited thereto by selfish motive. TheBrothers of Light co-operate with the positive aspect in, and of, all forms—thebuilding devas of evolutionary intent—in order to bring about the purposes ofthe Heavenly Man Who is the sumtotal of planetary physical manifestation.It can be seen, therefore, how necessary it is that the functions of the devasof all grades be comprehended. It is however equally important that man shouldrefrain from the manipulation of these forces of nature until such time as he“knows” himself, and his own powers, and until he has fully unfolded theconsciousness of the ego; then, and only then, can he safely, wisely, andintelligently co-operate in the plan. As yet, for the average man or even theadvanced man this is dangerous to attempt and impossible to accomplish.Now, let us add a few more statements upon which the student can ponder beforewe pass on to study specifically the three main groups of building devas on thethree planes in the three worlds which most intimately concern man.The building devas ( 196) [text00028.html#Y_FN196] are the Ah-hi, or UniversalMind. They contain within their consciousness the plan logoic, [616] andinherently possess the power to work it out in time and space, being theconscious forces of evolution.They not only embody the Divine Thought but are that through which it manifests,and its actuating activity. They are essentially motion. The lesser builders aremore particularly the material form which is actuated, and in their cohorts arethe substance of matter (considering substance as that which lies back ofmatter).They are that which produces concretion and which gives form to the abstract.The terms “ rupa” and “arupa” devas are relative, ( 197 [text00028.html#Y_FN197]) for the formless levels and the formless lives are only so from the standpointof man in the three worlds; the formless lives are those which are functioningin and through the etheric body of the Logos, formed of the matter of the fourhigher planes of the system. From this point of view the mental plane providesan interesting consideration:—its three higher subplanes are positive, andcentralise the positive force of the plane. This focussing of the positiveaffects the negative substance of the four lower planes and brings aboutlikewise:a. The formation of force centres on the causal levels, those force centresbeing egoic groups in their various divisions.b. The concretion of substance, or the building of the dense physical body ofthe Logos.On the physical plane of the solar system an analogous process can be seentaking place as regards the physical [617] body of man, or his concretemanifestation. In his case, the fourth subplane is the focal point of positiveforce. On that plane are located the etheric centres of man, which have, in theevolutionary process and in the work of force direction, a relationship to hisphysical body similar to the relationship which groups of Egos on the mentalplane have to the dense physical body of the Logos. This is a profound occulthint.In the words “prana and the etheric body” (or life force and form) we have thekey to the mystery of the solar and lunar pitris, and a hint as to the place ofthe physical body in the scheme of things.The solar Pitris and devas find their force expression most adequately throughman, with all that is included in that term. They are the source of hisself-consciousness, and it is their action upon the negative aspect whichproduces the human Ego (on a large scale, viewing them in their totality ascosmic force); it is their action upon the negative or mother aspect which, oncosmic levels, produces that Self-conscious Unity, a solar Logos, functioningthrough His physical vehicle. From the Christian standpoint, the greaterBuilders are the Holy Spirit, or force overshadowing and fecundating matter,whilst the negative or lesser Builders correspond to the Virgin Mary.The lunar Pitris, and lesser builders from the systemic point of view find theirfullest expression in the animal kingdom. When they, as the initiatory impulse,had produced animal man they had performed their prime function, and just as (ona smaller scale and in connection with only one of the Heavenly Men) the moon isa dying and decadent world, so on a systemic scale and therefore covering a vastperiod of time, the work of the lunar Pitris is slowly coming to a conclusion asthe power of the third kingdom, the animal, over the human is being [618]superseded by spiritual power; the systemic correspondence to lunar pitricactivity will occultly die out.The lunar Pitris, ( 198,199 [text00028.html#Y_FN198] ) the builders of man’slunar body and their correspondence in the other kingdoms of nature, are thesumtotal of the dense physical body of the Logos, or the substance of themental, astral and physical planes (the gaseous, liquid and dense bodies whichform a unity, His physical vehicle, viewing it apart from the etheric). They arethe product of an earlier solar system; their activities date from there. Thatsystem stands to the present one as the lunar chain to ours. That is why thephysical body is considered no principle (either for man or the solar Logos);that is why the lower nature is considered evil, and why man must “slay hislunar body.” ( 201 [text00028.html#Y_FN201] ) Evil is that which can becontrolled and subdued but which is permitted to govern. The positive can alwaysmanipulate the negative. When the negative line is followed and the line ofleast resistance to that which is no principle, is pursued, then we have evil.In the first solar system the negative substance aspect, the Mother aspect ormatter, was perfected. The lower Pitris dominated. In this system force activitylies in the hands of the solar Pitris or greater devas. At the close of themahamanvantara they will have built according [619] to the plan a perfect sheathor vehicle of expression for the Divine Thought, and this through themanipulation of negative substance; they utilise the heat of the Mother tonourish the germ of the Divine Thought, and to bring it to fruition. When thegerm has developed to maturity the Mother aspect no longer has a place, and theMan occultly is freed or liberated. This idea runs through all manifestations,and the kingdoms of nature or the form (no matter what form it may be) nourishthe germ of that which is the next step on in the evolutionary process, and areconsidered the Mother aspect. This aspect is eventually discarded andsuperseded. For example, the third kingdom, the animal, in the early stagesnourishes and preserves the germ of that which will some day be a man; thepersonality is the preserver of that which will some day unfold into spiritualman.It will thus become apparent to students how the Heavenly Man, viewing Him as asolar Deity, a self-conscious Entity, works with His negative aspect throughpositive force, from logoic etheric levels upon the three aspects of the logoicdense physical, thus bringing to maturity the atoms and cells of His Body,fostering the germ of self-consciousness, fanning the flame until each unitbecomes fully group conscious and aware of his place within the body corporate.Each human being likewise, functioning in the three worlds, works in acorresponding way upon the conscious cells of his bodies, until each atomeventually achieves its goal. The Heavenly Man works necessarily through egoicgroups, pouring positive force upon them until they emerge from passivity andnegativity into potency and activity. Man works correspondingly through hiscentres upon his sheaths, and has a responsibility to the lesser lives whichunder the karmic law must be worked out. This is the basis of the evolutionaryprocess.[620] b. The Functions of the Devas.Having predicated certain basic facts about the devas, viewing them as the sumtotal of the energy of substance and of substance itself, we come down to moretechnical details and to the more detailed consideration of these buildingforces as they construct the thought-form of the Logos, the solar System. Fromthis consideration of them certain practical knowledge will eventuate:First. Knowledge of how to build in mental matter in the three worlds, and howto employ the devas of the gaseous plane of the cosmic physical.Second. Realisation of how to combine the pairs of opposites, and thus give bodyand form to concept.Third. Materialisation upon the physical plane of the embodied idea.1. Manifestation of the Logoic Aspects. This is achieved through the closeconsideration of the laws of being, and of the method pursued by the Logos ingiving His conception form, thus working out His purpose, or will, through thatform. In the three planes of man’s endeavour we have reflected the three aspectsof the Logos as they produce manifestation:The Mental Plane . . . reflection of the first aspect. The plane of concept, ofthe union of Father-Spirit-Will and Mother-Matter-Energy. This is the work ofthe Logos, and this union produces the Son, for Divine Thought takes form. Thebody of the Ego is there found.Astral Plane . . . reflection of the second aspect, the Son. Materialisationproceeds through desire, and the form grows and evolves, becoming more adequate.Physical Plane . . . Manifestation. The thought-form (of man or the Logos)appears in activity. The Son is born on the physical plane, the thought of theThinker (divine or human) becomes an entity, separated [621] from itsoriginating source, yet energised by the vitality emanating from him.All this becomes possible—speaking now from the human standpoint—through theaction of the devas who are that which embodies thought, and that which give itits separated energy, as distinct from the purpose which will work out tofruition as the form becomes adequate as a medium of expression.2. Deva force substance. As we consider the devas of the seven planes of thesolar system, and especially as we consider those who work in the three worlds,we must bear in mind the following statements:The First Statement. They are the devas who are the dual force-substance of thelowest cosmic plane, the cosmic physical. As regards the three worlds, they arethe deva force and substance ( 202 [text00028.html#Y_FN202] ) which compose thedense physical body of the Logos, hence man is limited, as he works on theseplanes, to those devas who are primarily regarded (from the higher levels) ashaving no part in the seven principles of the Logos; to those devas who form thegaseous, liquid, and concrete form of the Logos, the devas of concrete fire, ofwater and of earth in its densest aspect; to those devas who are the automatic,subconscious builders, carrying on the work of the dense physical vehicle of theLogos in the same sense as the builders in man’s body work automatically andunconsciously, producing the cells and energising the bodily functions. This isthe basis of the danger to man in tampering with these forces. He is too closeto them in many ways; he identifies himself with them and until [622] he hasattained the consciousness of the Ego, and has with full knowledge establishedhis identity with the Spirit aspect and not with substance, he is liable to beswept into the line of blind force, and become a lost soul should he trespassignorantly, and curiously, into their domain.He is concerned also with those devas who are as yet animated by the life andpurpose which distinguished the evolution of the first solar system. That lifeis the life of God, and that purpose is the working out of His will, but it isevil from our present standpoint, for it is superseded as far as man isconcerned by a different purpose and goal. Therefore, identification with thatwhich is past, retrogression and the methods of the old are for a man a returnalong the path of self-conscious evolution, and lead eventually to a loss of theegoic principle, or of ego-ism, which distinguishes a man (human or heavenly)from the rest of evolution.The Second Statement. The hope for the devas and for the form aspect lies in thefact that each of the subplanes of the cosmic physical plane comes under thedirect influence of cosmic forces, originating on the six other cosmic planes.Of these forces everything is unknown and inconceivable, except the vague andgeneral indications of these currents and forces as they may be felt asemanating from the cosmic planes.The cosmic mental plane. This manifests for us in the three types of force to beseen on the systemic mental plane. These three types have not been sufficientlystudied, and are:a. The force which plays through all the manasic permanent atoms, and whichproduces basically that manifestation which we call the three worlds.b. The force which animates those groups of “lotuses” [623] which we call egoicgroups or centres-aggregations of causal bodies.c. The force which vitalises all the mental units and which is distributedthence to all the other permanent atoms.These three types of force deal with the substance aspect—permanent atoms,causal vehicle, and mental units, and are therefore directly impressingthemselves upon the devas who build these forms out of their own substance, andthus develop the divine plan. These three types of force affect substance, butwith a psychic intent, being themselves swayed and actuated according to divinepurpose, and from high levels. They emanate from the concrete levels of thecosmic mental plane (being therefore the force flowing through the mental unitof the Logos), and are concerned with the force centre which focalises thelogoic mental body. They are the force of Agni in His first aspect. He is thatfire which is distinctive of the cosmic mental plane, reflected in the cosmicgaseous subplane of the cosmic physical plane—our systemic mental plane.The Cosmic Astral Plane. The force from this plane plays through our systemicastral plane, the cosmic liquid physical sub-plane, and it is practicallysubject only to two differentiations, each of them occultly embodied in twogreat groups of devas:First. The devas who are the substance or force of the astral plane, viewing itas the sumtotal of desire, of feeling and of sensation. They are, therefore, thenerve centers, or nerve plexi, of the logoic physical body, for the systemicastral plane provides the nervous system of the logoic physical body. It is thebody of intensest vibration from the physical standpoint, and the vehiclethrough which all is transmitted to that portion of the logoic physical bodywhich corresponds to the brain [624] in man. I can elucidate this no further,but the few words here imparted open up a tremendous range of thought, and givethe key to much which transpires and which is distressing in solar evolution aswell as human.Second. Those devas who are the sumtotal of the astral light. They are theagents of the karmic lords, who are in themselves deva entities of aninconceivably advanced evolution and who, in their own substance,1. Record.2. Produce effects from cause.3. Direct force.This particular group of devas emanate from a great force centre which wegeneralise by calling it by the name of the sun Sirius. Sirius-kama-manas—thecosmic astral plane—and the systemic astral plane—make a close interlockingchain, and form the line of least resistance for a particular type of negativeforce to pour through.The Cosmic Physical Plane. This is the force (external and internal) of thesolar system itself, and of its environing space. It might be regarded as thepranic forces, pouring through the logoic etheric body (our four highersubplanes) which are positive to the lower three, impregnating these lower threeplanes (a reflection in substance, or in the Brahma aspect, of the union ofFather-Mother) and producing the purely concrete manifestation. This is why thephysical vehicle has such control during long stages of man’s evolution, for theforce of this type of energy is necessarily felt more strongly than any other.It is deva force, and substance, which is so close to us as powerfully to deludeus. Here lies the mystery of maya, and here is to be found the secret ofillusion. Here exists for man the first great stage of the battle for fullSelf-consciousness, and for identification with the God-aspect, and not with the[625] matter-aspect. Here lies the occult reason why man is called by hisfather’s name and not his mother’s. When man has dominated the deva essences ofthe physical plane, he controls next those of the astral and dominates themental essences. Having achieved this in his own nature he can then safelybecome a magician and contact, control and work with, the devas in connectionwith the plans of the Heavenly Man. In the realisation of the three types offorce, will be found for man the key to the mystery of his centres.The secret of the note of the head, the heart, and the throat centre is foundhere and their blending with the lower centres so that the note of the highersounds out, and the lower produces only harmony. Upon the note of nature theLogos has to superimpose a higher note. To the natural note of the centre (whichis found through the development of the lower centre, which is its reflection orcorrespondence) must be added the dominant note of the higher centre, and, inthe dual harmony the centre vibrates as desired. The note is the result ofcorrect activity. That is why the lower centres of man are (in the early stagesof his career) the controlling factor. He has to learn their note, and from itto attain the key of the higher. Then the higher takes the prominent place, andthe lower only serves the purpose of providing that which is understood asoccult “depth.” Why is this? Because in these notes those groups of devas whoare the force and energy of the centres (which are centres in substance) arecontacted and controlled. Through their activity, directed through the centres,the material sheaths—physical, astral and mental—are built.These ideas of force and the sheaths are the basis of the astrological teachingthat is one of the keys to the Secret Doctrine .( 203 [text00028.html#Y_FN203] )We should therefore bear in mind that [626] the Deva Lords, Agni, Varuna,Kshiti, ( 204 [text00028.html#Y_FN204] ) represent in the exoteric teaching thesubstance aspect of the dense body of the Logos whilst the force aspect asflowing through the etheric body of the Logos is considered under various names,such as Shiva, Surya, Brahma. Yet the two aspects are but one.The Third Statement. The final point I seek to make here is that in connectionwith these three lower planes and their many groups of devas it must beremembered that their polar opposites are to be found in the great devas of thehighest three planes.Divine 1st Cosmic ether Primordial Fire Mental Plane Fire. Monadic 2nd Cosmicether Akasha AstralPlane Astral light. Spiritual or Atmic 3rd Cosmic etherAether Physical Plane EtherThe particular type of differentiated force which they embody, when brought intounion with each other is that which causes concretion, or the appearance, inspace and time, of the dense physical body. This should be carefully considered,along with the very interesting fact that on the fourth plane of our system (thefourth cosmic ether, or buddhic plane) we have the sphere of certain occulthappenings which cannot be more than hinted at, because their true significanceis one of the secrets of initiation. They are an aspect of the plan of the Logoswhich can be contacted direct by those who have expanded their consciousnessadequately.[627] The buddhic plane, or fourth cosmic ether, is the plane whereon:a. The sacred planets function.b. Man will eventually function freed from the triple lower man.c . The true meaning of the words “Divine Hermaphrodite” is there to becomprehended.d. It is predominantly the plane of life-force, and one of the planes ofgeneration.e. Here man will for the first time understand and utilize his relationship withthe devas.f. It will see the fruition of the combined evolutionary process of the twosolar systems.g. It is the plane from whence all planetary avatars emanate.h. The Heavenly Men take the first Initiation on this plane.i. On this plane the true inner significance of the “Sun” is apprehended.More I cannot say, but careful study of that which is here given may open upmuch that is of significance in the study of the macrocosm and the microcosm.c. The Devas and the Planes.Preliminary Remarks. We have considered in broad and general terms the varioustypes of force which animate deva substance, and its origin. Now we can studymore specifically the deva entities in their various groups, having laid downthe fundamentals in connection with them.In this particular section students must remember that we are not consideringthose builders of involutionary development which are spoken of in theosophicaland occult literature as the elemental essences. We are discussing those who areon the evolutionary arc, and who are the agents of cosmic force, whilst thelesser builders are the agents specifically of solar and of lunar force. Solarforce implies the various differentiations of the threefold cosmic force as itmanifests within the solar [628] system. Solar force can also (as far as thecreative or building faculty of man is concerned) be termed planetary force, forevery human being (be he Adept or ordinary man) builds and creates his thoughtforms—consciously or unconsciously—within the planetary spheres in the threeworlds.We shall now come to a considerable amount of tabulation, for all that it iswise and possible to give at this time are certain facts, names and outlineswhich can only be demonstrated through the law of correspondence. The key tocomprehension is always this law. The basic differentiation in the solar systemis as follows:Agni Electric fire Spirit Central Spiritual Sun Energy Surya Solar fire VishnuHeart of the Sun Light Brahma Fire by friction Physical visible Sun FohatAs electric fire the Logos manifests as the seven aspects of Will, spiritualimpulse or purpose.As solar fire He manifests as the seven Rays, or as the Light of Wisdom, theConsciousness, radiating through the form.As fire by friction He manifests as the seven Sons of Fohat, the seven greatfires, or the active heat of intelligent substance.These three aspects of the God of Fire, and of the fire of God, are the threeEntities of the logoic Trinity, and each in turn manifests through seven otherEntities Who form their total manifestation.Sevenfold electric fire. The seven types of spiritual existences, or the sevenSpirits before the Throne in Their essential essence; the dynamic force or willlying back of all manifestation. They form on their own plane in a peculiarsense the logoic “Jewel in the Lotus,” and [629] hence are inconceivable to ourintelligence in this solar system, as They are not revealed until the “Son bemade perfect,” or the logoic consciousness is fully awakened. They areesoterically the “Spirits of Darkness.”Sevenfold solar fire. The seven Heavenly Men, the sumtotal of Light, the sevenRays of manifestation of the Spiritual Sun. In time and space these seven Raysof Light become the nine (the major three, with the third demonstrating asseven) and are thus esoterically the nine petals of the logoic Ego as Hemanifests in His physical vehicle. They are esoterically the “Sons of Light.”Sevenfold fire by friction . The seven brothers of Fohat. The sevenmanifestations of electricity, or of electrical phenomena. These are the sevenRaja-Lords or Devas of the seven planes; they are the seven Fires, or thoseseven states of activity through which consciousness is expressing itself. Theyare the vehicles of consciousness and the seven vibrations. They areesoterically the “Brothers of energy.”Therefore it will be apparent that the sumtotal of logoic manifestation as itcan be seen in existence in time and space is:Seven Spirits sevenfold will. Seven Rays sevenfold quality or psyche. Seven DevaLords sevenfold form.The latter are literally the seven spirillae, or force vibrations within thelogoic physical permanent atom. This needs to be carefully borne in mind andpondered upon. The seven Rays are the sumtotal of the psychic nature of theLogos, as it radiates through His physical form—His seven qualities, theaggregate of the expression of His desire, or love nature. The seven Spirits arethe sumtotal of His Will-to-be aspect, the synthetic Life of His totalmanifestation, that which causes the persistence [630] of the form, and itsevolution for as long as the logoic Ego seeks physical existence.To carry the simile, or analogy, even further back and thus bear in mind theresemblance between microcosmic and macrocosmic development we have:1. The seven Spirits who find Their originating incentive on:a. The cosmic lower mental levels.b. The logoic “Jewel in the Lotus.”c. The cosmic atmic plane.2. The seven Heavenly Men are in the line of force from:a. The cosmic astral plane.b . The logoic nine-petalled lotus.c. The cosmic buddhic plane (the seven Rishis of the Great Bear).3. The seven Sons of Fohat find their vital force emanating from:a . The cosmic physical plane.b. The logoic permanent atoms (within the causal body).c. The cosmic higher mental levels.Yet these three are but the expressions of One Existence, for behind the Logosin physical incarnation is to be found the logoic Monad, expressing Itselfthrough the logoic Ego, and its reflection, the logoic Personality.All these spiritual Essences are individualised self-conscious Identities, andthe “Fiery Lives” are real, and conscious, vital Existences. Thus we see theLogos manifesting as One Unity yet Three in One; we see the threefold Unitydifferentiating into the seven great Lives, containing within Themselves alllesser lives.Another broad differentiation must next be touched upon: [631]a. The seven Fires form the forty-nine Fires.b. The seven Heavenly Men manifest through forty-nine lesser Rays.c. The seven Spirits shew forth as forty-nine Existences.In connection with the Spirit aspect it will prove unprofitable to carry thethought any further. Of Spirit per se we can know nothing, and beyondpredicating the forty-nine ( 205 [text00028.html#Y_FN205] ) solar Manus (each ofthe Heavenly Men is expressing Himself on the physical plane through sevenManus) it is impossible to go. Therefore, in discussing these abstractquestions, we will concern ourselves only with the seven Rays of Light, orHeavenly Men, and the seven Fires.Each of the seven Rays of Light differentiates into seven making the forty-nineaspects of the logoic psychic nature, as it shews itself on the cosmic physicalplane, and each of the seven Fires manifests as seven lesser Fires, making theforty-nine Fires referred to by H. P. B. in the Secret Doctrine . (S. D., I,567.) The seven Heavenly Men manifest each through seven lesser Entities, Whoform the psychic centres in Their body in the same manner as They—in Theirturn—form the psychic centres in the logoic vahan or vehicle. Each of the sevenFires, or Deva Lords, of a plane manifest through seven lesser devas, who formthe central fire, and consciousness of the substance of a subplane. It is withtheir mutual interplay and work that we are now concerned, or with the study ofmatter as it is affected and built into form through the medium of DivineThought or Will.Of the higher Fires (the Lords of the four higher planes) I do not seek to deal,for it only profits us to [632] study the construction of thought-forms in thethree worlds through the medium of deva essences; these are vitalised andmanipulated by the Builders, the Dhyan Chohans, the Heavenly Men through theforce of Their Life, through Their knowledge of the logoic Will or purpose, andthrough the power of Their psychic nature. Thus They are occupied in buildingthe logoic physical body, and in carrying out His plans in that body, in thisway fulfilling the purpose for which He incarnated. Their work is infinitelygreater than this, for it lies primarily on cosmic levels, but this is whatconcerns us, and all that we can, in any way grasp. Man in the three worlds ofhuman endeavour works at two things:First. The building of his body of manifestation, a threefold body.Second. The construction of thought-forms, which he builds of mental matter andvitalises by desire, and which he holds within his aura, thus constructing atiny system of his own.Both man, and the Heavenly Men, work in deva substance; both co-operate with thedevas; both manifest will, psychic quality and intelligent activity as theypursue their work but a difference lies, not only in degree, but inconsciousness. Man works usually unconsciously. The Heavenly Men, on cosmiclevels, work for the most part consciously. Herein lies a hint as to the stageof evolution of our Logos.This matter is of real difficulty, for the subject is abstruse and profound. Wewill now leave these basic ideas, and deal more specifically with the devas withwhom we are immediately concerned, or with the three groups I have outlined—theAgnichaitans, the Agnisuryans, and the Agnishvattas. They are concernedprimarily with the evolution of the dense body of the Logos, the liquid, gaseousand dense subplanes of the [633] cosmic physical, or the three worlds of humanendeavour; with the magnetic radiation of the Logos through His physicalvehicle, and with the radiatory emanations of the particular Heavenly Man Who isexpressing Himself through our planet. Finally they are concerned with theevolution of consciousness ( 207 [text00028.html#Y_FN207] ) in the three worlds,and particularly with the individualisation of the human unit of consciousness,and with the vitalisation of the centres in the body of the Heavenly Man withWhom we are peculiarly connected.The subject of our consideration now is the fire devas of the physical plane,those great building devas who are working out the purposes of the Logos in hisdense, physical body. Let us get our ideas as clear as possible on this matter;in the following tabulation, the status of these devas will be apparent at aglance:SystemicName Cosmic Plane Plane Nature Ruler Agnichaitan 7th subplane - cosmic physicalPhysical Densest concretion Kshiti Agnisuryan 6th subplane - cosmic physicalAstral Liquid Varuna Agnishvatta 5th subplane - cosmic physical Mental GaseousAgniThe Agnichaitans. These are the devas who construct, and build in matter of thedensest kind in connection with logoic manifestation. They function on theseventh subplane of the cosmic physical plane, and are the producers of thegreatest concretion. In the planetary body of our planetary Logos they are thebuilders of the Earth, His densest form, and throughout the entire solar systemthey are the sum-total of that activity and vibration [634] which demonstratesthrough what we call “solid substance.”Therefore, it will be apparent that under the law they will have a peculiarlypowerful effect on the lowest subplane of the systemic physical plane; hencetheir esoteric appellation of the “Agnichaitans of the inner or central heat.”They are the totality of the lowest vibration in the cosmic physical vehicle.The Agnisuryans are the builders on the sixth subplane of the cosmic physicalplane, our systemic astral plane. They represent, as I have before hinted, thesympathetic nervous system in the logoic physical body, just as their brothersof the seventh vibration represent the sumtotal of the circulatory or bloodsystem. A hint to the student who is interested in the physiological key lies inthe relationship between the two great groups of devas who build and constructthe most objective portion of logoic manifestation, and the two groups ofcorpuscles which in their mutual interaction hold the body in health; there isan analogy also in the relationship between the devas of the astral plane, andthe motor and sensory nerves of the physical body. I will not enlarge upon thisangle of vision.These devas have to do, in a very esoteric sense, with the nerve plexus in the:a. Solar system. (Physical Sun)b. Planetary scheme. (Dense Planet)c. Human physical body. (Dense Body)and are therefore a powerful factor in the eventual vitalisation of the centresin man. The etheric centres, or the focal points of force of a Heavenly Man areon the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane. The astral plane is closelyallied to the buddhic, and as the etheric centres of our Heavenly Man, forinstance, come into full activity, the force is transmitted through the astralcorrespondence [635] to the fourth physical ether, in which the centres of manexist.The Agnishvattas are the builders on the fifth or gaseous subplane of the cosmicphysical, and—from the human standpoint—are the most profoundly important, forthey are the builders of the body of consciousness per se. From the psychicstandpoint of occult physiology, they have a close connection with the physicalbrain, the seat or empire of the Thinker, and as at this stage all that we canknow must be viewed kama-manasically, it will be apparent that between thesympathetic nervous system and the brain is such a close interaction as to makeone organised whole. This microcosmic correspondence is of interest, but instudying these groups of devas at present we will view them principally in theirwork as systemic and planetary builders, leaving the student to trace out forhimself the human analogy. He will learn thereby. Having indicated certain linesof thought, we will now take up these groups one at a time and consider them.The Agnichaitans—Physical Plane Devas.These devas are the sumtotal of physical plane substance. This plane is, as weknow, divided into two parts:The four ethers, four subplanes.The demonstrably concrete or dense three subplanes.We have here a subdivision of the seventh subplane of the cosmic physical planemaking the lowest manifestation one that is divided into forty-nine subplanes orstates of activity. For purposes of active work, the devas of the system aredivided into forty-nine groups—the forty-nine fires. The Agnichaitans in turnare also divided into forty-nine groups, thus reflecting the whole. [636]1. The Raja-Lord. Kshiti. The life of the physical plane.2. Three groups of Agnichaitans concerned with:A. The force or energy of physical substance. That electrical aspect whichproduces activity.B. The construction of forms. They produce the union of negative and positivesubstance, and thus bring into being all that can be seen, and touched in theexoteric and ordinary connotation.C. The internal heat of substance which nourishes and causes reproduction. Theyform the purely mother aspect.These three groups are subdivided again into seven groups which form the matterof each subplane, viewing that matter as the body of manifestation of one of theseven devas through whom the Raja-Lord of the plane is manifesting.These seven groups are again divided into seven, making forty-nine.The three groups function as follows:Group A. on the first subplane. They are the sumtotal of the atomic matter ofthe physical plane.Group B. on the second, third and fourth etheric subplanes. They are thesubstance of those planes, the transmitters of prana, through which prana flowsto the most concrete aspects of the logoic dense vahan, or vehicle.Group C. the lowest three subplanes; they are the devas who are the essences ofall that is tangible, visible and objective.A very real distinction must be made by students between the centres and theremainder of the body, as they investigate the construction of the body of thesolar Logos or of a planetary Logos.[637] The centres are allied or connected with consciousness, and are composedof self-conscious units—the human Monads. The remainder of the body is composedof deva substance, yet the two together form a unity. The deva units thereforefar outnumber the human, and deva substance is also feminine and negative, thehuman Hierarchy being masculine. Through the positive activity of the centres,the negative deva substance is influenced, built and energized. This is true ofa solar Logos, a planetary Logos and a human being.Three types of force, therefore, play upon or through these devas:a. That energizing the devas of the first subplane, the atomic. This emanatesdirectly from the first aspect of Brahma, or Agni, considering Him as aself-conscious Identity, the third Person of the logoic Trinity, and thereforeSpirit, Soul and Body Himself in His separated essential nature.b. That energizing the devas of construction, or the form building groups; thiscomes from the second aspect of Brahma, and is prana, issuing from the physicalSun, and working under the Law of Attraction.c. That energizing the devas of the lowest three orders, emanating from Brahmain His third aspect. Thus in the dual force, or the aspects of matter itself,interacting the one upon the other, densest forms of all are produced. Yet thesethree function as one.Group C. Agnichaitans. In considering these groups of Agnichaitans, we mustremember that we are dealing with that manifestation of the Logos with whichexoteric science is dealing, and that as regards Group C, science is alreadymaking fair progress in the accumulation of knowledge; it remains yet forscience to [638] acknowledge the “entified” nature of substance, ( 208, 209[text00028.html#Y_FN208] ) and thus account for the life that energizes thesubstance of the three lower subplanes. This recognition by science that allforms are built of intelligent lives will come about when the science of magicbegins again to come to the fore, and when the laws of being are betterunderstood. Magic concerns itself with the manipulation of the lesser lives by agreater life; when the scientist begins to work with the consciousness thatanimates substance (atomic or electronic), and when he brings under hisconscious control the forms built of this substance, he will gradually becomecognizant of the fact that all entities of all grades and of varyingconstitutions go to the construction of that which is seen. This will not beuntil science has definitely admitted the existence of etheric matter asunderstood by the occultist , and until it has developed the hypothesis thatthis ether is in differing vibrations. When the etheric counterpart of all thatexists is allocated to its rightful place, and known to be of more importance inthe scale of being than the dense vehicle, being essentially the body of the[639] life, or vitality, then the role of the scientist and the occultist willmerge.H. P. B. has said (S.D., II. 621) that the dense physical is not a principle,and this point is frequently overlooked in connection with man and the Logos.Its importance cannot be too strongly realised for it has the effect oftransferring the point of centralisation, or of polarisation in the case of maninto his etheric body, composed of matter of the four higher subplanes of thesystemic physical plane, and in the case of the Logos, of the four highersubplanes of the cosmic physical plane. The point is one of a very realcomplexity, for it involves the realisation that, from the standpoint of theoccultist, the lowest vibration with which he may concern himself is that of thesystemic etheric in its four lesser allied vibrations; similarly macrocosmicallythe lowest logoic vibration with which the greater Adepts are concerned is thecosmic etheric. The three lowest systemic and cosmic vibrations are the resultof:Reflex action on the part of negative substance for the lower three are negativeto the higher four.Synchronous vibration , inherent in negative substance, the residue of anearlier system, and embodying therefore past karma for the Logos and for man.Vibrations that are gradually being superseded by the imposition of a highernote; therefore for both man and the Logos, they occultly form the “body ofdeath.”This brings us to the point which we are seeking to make anent this third groupof the lowest devas. They are very destructive where man is concerned, for theyembody the final and therefore powerful vibration of the past system, theconscious activity of dense matter. Hence there is consequently a profound truthin the [640] statement that man is at the “mercy of the elements.” Man canphysically be burned and destroyed by fire; he is helpless before volcanicaction, and cannot protect himself from the ravages of fire, unless in theinitial stages of such deva endeavour. The occult importance of the war manwages on the fire devas for instance is very real in connection with the firedepartment in any city. The time lies far ahead as yet, but it will surely come,when the personnel of these departments will be chosen for their ability tocontrol the agnichaitans when manifesting destructively, and their methods willno longer be that of water (or the calling in of the water devas to neutralisethe fire devas), but that of incantation, and a knowledge of the sounds thatwill swing into action forces which will control the fiery destructive elements.The third group of these devas is very definitely connected with the control ofthe Manu’s department, and of the great devas associated with that department onthis planet. Through their activity during certain cycles the entire surface ofthe Earth is changed through the medium of volcanic action; continents areraised and submerged; volcanoes are active or quiescent, and thus the world ispurified by fire. In their own department these Agnichaitans are kept busybuilding the mineral forms through the agency of fire; they are the alchemistsof the lower regions, and through contact with them, and through the knowledgeof “the words” by which they are controlled, the future scientific alchemists (Iuse this expression in contradistinction to the idealistic alchemists of thepast) will work with minerals and with the lives embodied in all mineral forms.The secret of the transmutation of the baser metals into gold will be revealedwhen world conditions are such that gold is no longer the standard and hence thefree manufacture of gold will not lead to disaster, and [641] when scientistswork with the life aspect, or with positive electrical life, and not with thesubstance or form aspect.We have seen that the work of the lowest group of Agnichaitans is to buildcontinents by fire, to purify by fire during alternate cycles, and to constructthe metals and the minerals. It is also concerned with the tending of the firesof the hearth, or those fires which warm, cheer and produce livable conditionsin a planet, and incidentally in a home. This is of very vital import, for itmeans that they are connected with the central basic fires in the bowels of theEarth, with the central basic fire that nourishes and warms the physical formsof all the kingdoms of nature, and consequently with the kundalini fire at thebase of the spine in individual man.It is not advisable for us further to enlarge upon their functions. It should benoted that in connection with the matter aspect there is less to be said than onconsciousness, and on the hylozoistic aspect of manifestation. The reason liesin the fact that exoteric science is slowly, yet steadily, finding out thenature of phenomena, and discovering for itself the character of electricalmanifestation. In their slowness of discovery lies safety. It is not wise norright yet for the true nature of these different forces and powers to be fullyknown; therefore, it is not possible for us to do more than indicate certainbroad general lines. In due course of time, as the human family becomes centredin the higher, and not in the lower nature, and as the force from the higherplanes can more easily impose itself on the lower, the facts concerning theseLives and Builders, their methods of work, and the laws of their being will beknown. Knowledge at this time would be productive of two results. It would firstof all bring the human family into the power (as yet blind and destructive) of[642] certain elementals, who are of a nature analogous to that of the physicalbody. Hence destruction of the form would ensue, or paralysis and insanity on alarge scale would eventuate. Secondly, it would put power into the hands ofcertain of the Brothers of the Left Hand Path ( 211 [text00028.html#Y_FN211] )and of a number of unconscious magicians (of whom there are quite a number) whowould use it only for selfish, evil and material ends. Hence no more can be saidanent dense physical substance and its embodiers. The Agnichaitans of the thirdgroup are as yet a menace to man, and are only handled in group formation, andon a large scale by the head of the Manu’s department through their ownrulers-certain devas of a development equal to that of the sixth Initiation.The occult Hierarchy of our planet is primarily concerned with the developmentof self-consciousness in man, and with the intelligent interpretation of thehappenings of Nature; it is concerned with a wise co-operation with the buildingForces of nature; and the object of its main endeavour is the vitalisation andactivity of the centres in the Heavenly Man of our planet, and in the individualunits of the human family.The occult Hierarchy is a great force centre, the heart, head, and throat of theHeavenly Man as these three centres function in a triple co-ordination.Paralleling their activities along the line of consciousness (and primarilyconsciousness or intelligence as it demonstrates through the third and fourthkingdoms) is to be found a great hierarchy of devas who concern themselves withthe development of that portion of the body of a Heavenly Man which is notincluded in the active centres. Perhaps some idea of what I seek to convey [643]may be gathered from an illustration. The occult Hierarchy is concerned with theunfoldment of the nine-petalled Lotus in the Heavenly Man, and in man (theformer through reflex action between the cosmic physical and the cosmic mental),while the great deva Hierarchy is concerned with the permanent atoms, with theegoic body, and with the development of the spirillae. Thus the function of theAgnichaitans of the lowest furnaces—macrocosmically and microcosmically—will beseen and comprehended by the wise student.Group B. Agnichaitans. In taking up the matter of the second group ofAgnichaitans—Group B—we are dealing with that important group of devas who aredesignated in some works as the “devas of the shadows.” Their function isprimarily a fourfold one, and they are the basis of motion or of activity on allplanes, which activity is produced by the interplay of the negative and positiveaspects of Brahma, the manifested God.First, they are the builders of the etheric bodies of all sentient existences,and primarily of all the etheric bodies of men.Second, they are the transmitters of prana.Third, they perform a very definite function in the evolutionary process oflinking up the four kingdoms of nature, being essentially the transmuters andtransmitters of the lower into the higher. They build between eachkingdom—mineral, vegetable, animal and human—that which in each case correspondsto the antaskarana, or the bridge linking higher and lower manas, and whichtherefore is the channel for the transmission of the life from out of the lowerhuman kingdom into the higher spiritual one. It will be found that between eachof the different stages of consciousness (from the subconscious through theself-conscious to the superconscious) there is a period of linking, of building,and of bridging, and this is carried out by the agency of [644] certain groupsof devas on all the planes. These three groups on the physical plane find theircounterparts and their work paralleled on higher levels. The point to beremembered is that this work of bridging from one stage or from one kingdom toanother has to be performed under the following conditions:a. As the result of an impulse emanating from the lower, or originating in theactive desire of the lower to embrace or contact the higher. This is ofparamount importance, for all progress must be self-induced, self-initiated, andbe the result of an inner activity.b. As the result of reflex action from the higher stage or kingdom; it isbrought about by the activity of the lower which calls forth a response from thehigher. All vibration, it must be remembered, travels along waves of livingsubstance.c. As the result of extraneous stimulation produced by the activity of certainconscious powers, interested in the process of evolutionary development.All these conditions can be seen in the process of the initiation of man, and ofhis transference from the fourth kingdom into the spiritual. His efforts must beself-induced, or the effect of his own self-conscious endeavour; they will meetwith a response from his superconsciousness, the atmic aspect or Spirit and thisdual interplay will be further aided by the Guardians of the Rites ofInitiation. Yet all three effects are felt in spirit-matter; all proceed underthe law of vibration, and this law is literally the response of deva substanceto force emanating from some conscious or unconscious source.Fourth, these “devas of the shadows,” perform certain activities of aninteresting and varied kind, but [645] of such diversity as to make enumerationwellnigh impossible. We might attempt with brevity to state a few of thesefunctions, remembering ever that what can be predicated of them on the physicalplane can also be predicated of their correspondences on all the planes. This wecan leave to the student to work out for himself, begging him again to bear inmind that we are dealing with the devas on the evolutionary arc, which may bedivided into the following classes, amongst many others.Class 1. The special agents of magic. They are peculiarly susceptible to thebuilding vibrations of the seven rays.Class 2. A group of Agnichaitans who manifest as physical plane electricity.They are a group who are coming somewhat under the control of man, and will bemore and more dominated by him.Class 3. A group who form the health auras of all the three middle kingdoms ofnature (vegetable, animal and human) either collectively or individually. Man iscoming into contact with them along medical lines and beginning somewhat torecognise them. One of the great errors into which the human family has fallenhas been the endeavour to administer mineral drugs to man for medicinalpurposes. It has resulted in a combination of deva substances which was neverintended. The relation of man to the lower kingdoms, and particularly to theanimal and mineral, has brought about a peculiar condition in the deva world andhas tended to complicate deva evolution. The use of animal food (and the use ofminerals as medicine in a lesser degree) has produced a commingling of devasubstance, and of vibrations which are not attuned to each other. The vegetablekingdom is in a totally different situation, and part of its karma has lain inthe providing of food for man; this has resulted in a needed transmutation ofthe life [646] of that kingdom into the higher stage (the animal) which is itsgoal. The transmutation of vegetable life takes place necessarily on thephysical plane. Hence its availability as food. The transmutation of the life ofthe animal into the human kingdom takes place on kamamanasic levels. Hence thenon-availability, esoterically understood, of the animal as food for man. Thisis an argument for vegetarian living which needs due consideration.Class 4. A very important class of etheric devas (as far as man is concerned)who are definitely the constituent substance of his centres. They occupy thisposition for karmic reasons, and are, from many angles, some of the most highlyevolved of the devas of the shadows. They are distinguished by their ability torespond to a particular set of planetary vibrations in a peculiar manner, and intheir essential essence, and in their own peculiar sphere enable man to react toRay stimulation. Each centre is under the influence of one or other of theplanets. In this fact lies the ability of man eventually—through the agency ofhis centres—to put himself en rapport with the sevenfold soul of the world.Class 5. We have here a very important group of devas, who are peculiarly activeand esoterically dominant during this round; they are the Agnichaitans who formthe centre which vibrates to the measure of kundalini in its many forms anddemonstrations; this is the centre at the base of the spine. In this centre wehave a very effective display of the two polarities, for the petals of thecentre which is the seat of kundalini, and the fire or vitality which animatesthem are negative and positive to each other. This centre is to be found in someform or other in all sentient beings and upon it largely depends: [647]a. Consciousness at one of its seven stages.b. Continuity of existence.c. Perpetuation of species or reproduction on some or other of the planes.It might be of interest here to note that this centre is literally a fourfoldradiation, and the “Cross of the Holy Spirit,” the equal armed Cross, is itssymbol. This four-petalled lotus is the result of evolution. In the firstkingdom of nature, the mineral, through which a specific Entity is manifesting,this centre is a unity on etheric levels, for only one petal is to be seen. Inthe vegetable kingdom, viewing it as the expression of a great Existence, twopetals are becoming active. In the third kingdom, the animal, the centre at thebase of the spine will be found to have three petals, whereas in man, the lotusis vibrating in a fourfold manner. At each initiation of the great Being Who ismanifesting through our planet, one of these petals becomes unfolded on ethericlevels, so that at individualisation, the four became active, and Hisselfconscious activity was brought right down on to the physical plane. Theanalogy can be seen typified at His great Initiation which took place in thefourth round and the third rootrace; the correspondence between the thirdkingdom and the fourth, and their production of the esoteric seven is one of thelines of study for the occultist.As each of the petals of the etheric centres becomes vibrant, or an at-one-mentis brought about in deva substance, a quickening takes place on allied levels inthe cosmic etheric body of the planetary Logos, and of the solar Logos. Certaincorrespondences in the petals of the egoic lotus of the different units of thehuman family, and (on cosmic levels) in the solar and planetary egoic bodiesbecome apparent. It should also be borne in mind that these basic centres,wherein the [648] kundalini fire lies hidden, are found in the followingExistences, as They function in physical bodies:1. A solar Logos.2. A planetary Logos.3. Those Entities Who are the sumtotal of consciousness as it expresses itselfthrough the different kingdoms of nature—manifesting through them as a manmanifests through his body.4. The Lord of a chain.5. The Lord of a globe.6. Certain Beings Who form the life of specific groups. They are esoteric, andTheir function is one of the secrets of initiation.7. Man.8. Animals.It should be here also remarked that in the logoic manifestation one of theplanetary schemes forms the centre in the logoic body which harbours kundalini.This scheme, whose name must not as yet be revealed, is largely given over todeva control—the two groups of devas meeting there, and performing theirfunction of animating the dense physical body of the Logos in the same way asthe kundalini in man at this stage animates his dense physical vehicle. Later,as the third major scheme assimilates the life-activity of the lower four, thiskundalini fire will be withdrawn, and will be transmuted into the activity ofthe logoic Throat centre.In planetary manifestation, one of the chains performs a similar work in theevolutionary process of the planetary Logos. Again the same can be predicated ofone of the globes in a chain. In this fourth round, therefore, it can be seenwhy the fire at the base of the spine (viewing it in its esoteric significance,and in connection with the Logos, and the Logoi, and not only in connection withman) plays so dominant a part in the stimulation of [649] the logoic Quaternary,or of His Lower Self. Herein is found the mystery of present evil, the source ofpresent distress, and the basis of planetary experience. The kundalini fire inthe logoic body is at the height of its activity in stimulating His physicalbody—our lower three systemic planes—and the four petals of that particularcentre are coming into full activity in this fourth round. It must be rememberedthat He is the sum-total of all the centres in manifestation, and the aggregateof all the fires of kundalini in every department of nature. The trouble in ourplanet, and likewise the hope for our planet, lies in this very fact. Theetheric centre of our planetary Logos being in matter of the fourth cosmic ether(the buddhic plane) stimulates at present His lower quaternary, our three worldsof human endeavour. The direction of the force lies here, and not until the nextround (when three-fifths of the human kingdom will be developing the buddhicvehicle), will the point of equilibrium for Him be reached, and the direction ofthe serpent fire be directed higher.This holds the clue to much. A further clue to the sad condition to be seen inthe world (especially along sex lines) lies in the fact that those units of thehuman family who contribute to the constitution of this particular centre out ofthe seven, are frequently at this stage over-vitalised, the physical vehiclevitality indicating to them the line of least resistance. To word it otherwise:The deva forces who form the centre, and are likewise the activity of thecentre, are as yet over-dominant, and the power they acquired in the earliersolar system has not yet been transmuted into spiritual power.We have above considered a few of the devas of the ethers but have of necessityleft many untouched. The vastness of our subject will be apparent when it isremembered that in dealing with the devas we are dealing [650] with that whichis the basic substance of manifestation, or Spirit-matter; with the negative orthe mother aspect, in the divine duality, and with the sum total of all that is.We are concerned with the tangible form, using the word “tangible” as that whichcan be apprehended by consciousness in one or other of its many states. Theutter impossibility of cataloguing the forms and aspects of deva substance, orof tabulating the myriad groups and classes will be borne in on ourcomprehension. On all the planes these three groups will be found, and all arerecipients of force. An analogy likewise exists between these three groups ofdevas on the systemic physical plane, and their correspondences on the cosmicphysical plane. Briefly it might be pointed out that we have:Group A The plane Adi Divine evolution. Systemic atomic Group B The three worldsof the Triad Spiritual evolution. Logoic etheric. Group C The three worlds Humanevolution. Logoic dense physical.In this lies much of interest for the student as it makes clear thecorrespondence between the evolution of substance and the evolution of spirit.As regards the devas of Group B, little more can be said. Only a few moregeneralities are advisable.These devas, especially those of the fourth ether, are so closely connected withman that one of the immediate developments ahead will be his awakening to arealisation of their existence, and his consequent gradual domination of them.This domination will be the result of several things but will only be completewhen he can function on the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane. One of thethings the Hierarchy at this stage is seeking to do, is to retard this awakeningof the mass of mankind to this realisation, for that event will necessitate[651] many adjustments, and, at the beginning, may produce many apparently evileffects. The development of the physical eye is a thing which is proceedingunder the Law, and inevitably the whole race of men will at length attain thatdual focus which will enable man to see both the dense and the etheric forms. Atthis stage his inability to do so is largely due to a lack of pranic vitality.This is mainly the result of wrong conditions of living, and the misuse of food.The present general trend towards juster and purer conditions of life, thereturn of man to simpler and saner ways, the widespread feeling for bathing,fresh air, and sunlight, and the greater desire for vegetable, and nut foods,will result inevitably in a more ready assimilation of the pranic fluids. Thiswill produce certain changes, and improvements, in the physical organs, and inthe vitality of the etheric body.Therefore, those of us who see somewhat of the Plan are urged to spread theknowledge of the Wisdom Religion, and above all to break loose from thepreconceived dogmas of pre-war days. It should be pointed out here that the warwas a great occult event, and caused a vital change in many of the plans andarrangements of the Hierarchy. Modifications have been necessitated, and someevents will have to be delayed whilst others will be hastened. One of theprofoundest effects of the war was felt among the devas of the shadows, andprimarily among those of the fourth order. The etheric web which protectedcertain groups in the human and animal kingdoms was rent in various places, andthe results of that disaster have to be offset. Another effect upon the devasresulting from the war, as it worked, can be seen among the devas of Group A, orthose devas who are (in an occult sense) the physical permanent atoms of allself-conscious beings. The fourth spirilla was tremendously stimulated, and itsevolution hastened [652] to an extraordinary degree, so that some of the lesserevolved men, through the stress of danger and experience, had this fourthspirilla brought up to, and beyond, that of normal humanity. Through thisstimulation of the fourth spirilla of the units of the fourth Creative Hierarchyin this fourth round on the fourth globe in this fourth scheme, a tremendouspush onward along the evolutionary path has been effected, and hence one of thegreat objects of the war has been achieved. A still more terrific stimulationwas given in the fourth rootrace during the war of that period, and the resultwas the passing on to the Path of Initiation of many who normally would not evennow be treading it. A similar effect can be looked for at this time, and theHierarchy is preparing itself for the taking over of much of an extra-planetarynature owing to the almost immediate availability of comparatively large numbersof the sons of man. We must not forget that this stimulation of the spirillaeaffects the matter aspect, or deva substance. Man is literally deva substance,and a God, thus being a true reflection of the solar Logos. ( 212[text00028.html#Y_FN212] ) ( 213 [text00028.html#Y_FN213] )[653] Group A. Agnichaitans. We have seen that on all planes the groups of devascan be divided into three [654] main groups, even though usually studied intheir dual capacity of involutionary and evolutionary force units. Broadlyspeaking, these groups can be viewed as:a. Those which embody the positive aspect, or positive electrical phenomena.b. Those which embody the negative aspect.c. That group which—in time and space—is the union of the two aspects andwhich—during evolution—demonstrates the third type of electrical phenomena.Another grouping of this triplicity can be made which brings them into line withthe order of manifestation as laid down in the ancient cosmogony, and this wefollowed when we enumerated the groups of Agnichaitans.Group A—Corresponds to the manifestations of existence as seen on the highestplane, or that aspect which is understood by the term Agni.Group B—Corresponds to the Vishnu-Surya aspect.Group C—Corresponds to the Brahma or the creative Logos aspect.We have recapitulated thus, as it is desirable to have the thought clearlydefined.We have touched upon the two lower groups of devas. Now, we might take up theconsideration of Group A, the most important group on the physical plane fromthe standpoint of creation, and of objectivity, for they are the life of matteritself and the intelligence animating the forms of all that exists on thesystemic physical [655] plane; they are not self-conscious intelligence, butconsciousness as understood by the occultist.Each of the atomic subplanes in the solar system is closely interrelated withthe others, and the seven atomic subplanes of all the planes form a unity, andare essentially the cosmic physical plane as the term is occultly understood.The subplanes of which they are the originating source bear the samerelationship to them as the six principles do to the seventh. Therefore, thedevas of Group A are the concentrated creative force of the subplanes, theorigin of the objective side of physical manifestation, and the source of theseven Breaths of the creative Logos on the physical plane. But it must beremembered that in each scheme the creative impulse or will is the planetaryLogos of the scheme, Who as truly creates His body of Manifestation under theLaw (His dense physical planet) as man—under the same Law—creates his physicalbody, or as the solar Logos (at the other end of the scale) creates His body, asolar system.This has a definite and esoteric bearing upon the subject under discussion, andthe essential differences between the Heavenly Men seeking manifestation will beseen in Their schemes, and therefore in the types of devas through whom Theyfunction, and out of whose essence Their form is made.It might be expressed thus: Just as each man has a body which, in its maincharacteristics and form, resembles other bodies, yet in its quality andpersonal distinctive features is unique, so each of the Heavenly Men builds forHimself a body out of deva substance or spirit-matter which is of the samenature as that of His brothers, and yet which is distinctive, coloured by Hisown peculiar colouring, vibrant to His own particular key, and able todemonstrate His own unique quality. This is produced through the peculiar typeof deva [656] essence He chooses, or (to word it perhaps more occultly) it hasinvolved the response of certain peculiar groups of devas to His note. Theyembody in themselves just those constituents which He requires to build His bodyor scheme. It will, therefore, be recognised that the devas of Group A, beingwhat we might call the key-devas , are of prime importance, and, from ourpresent standpoint, must remain abstract and esoteric. If we consider this underthe Law of Analogy, and study the essentially esoteric nature of the plane ofthe Logos (the first plane, called Adi) the reason for this will be apparent. Ifthe devas of Group A could be recognised, or even contacted by advanced men, thestudy of their nature, colouring and tone would reveal to unprepared humanitythe colouring and tone of our particular planetary Logos. For this knowledge therace is not ready. It would reveal also, through the study of the Law of Actionand Reaction, which of the incarnating Egos were on the ray of this Logos; thedeductions from this would lead men into dangerous realms, and put power intohands as yet unprepared to wield it wisely.Therefore, Group A of Agnichaitans must remain profoundly esoteric, and theirtrue nature can only be revealed to the Adept of the great Law.Thus only a few hints are permissible, and these deal simply with therelationship of man to these entities. He is related to them primarily becausehis physical permanent atom is directly energised by them, being a part of theiressential nature, and having a place in their form. It will be apparent to anystudent that if the permanent atoms of the lower man are within the causalperiphery the devas of the three worlds on the atomic subplanes must work in theclosest co-operation; there must be unity of purpose and of plan.The devas of the atomic levels of all the planes in our scheme work in closeaffiliation: [657]a. With each other, thus making seven groups who are the sumtotal of the Brahmaaspect of our planetary Logos.b. With the seven groups who constitute the atomic matter of that scheme whichis the polar opposite of ours.c. With that particular group in that scheme which is one of the points in asystemic triangle of which our scheme and our opposite scheme are the other two.d. With corresponding groups in lesser degree in all the systemic schemes.e. With the scheme which corresponds to the first aspect, or the plane of Adi.f. With those devas who form the spirit-substance of the manifestation of thatparticular Rishi of the Great Bear Who is the prototype of our particularplanetary Logos.g. With those devas who form the substance of that one of those esotericexistences who are spoken of in the Secret Doctrine (II, 579-582) as “The wivesof the seven Rishis,” or the seven sisters, the Pleiades. One of these sevensisters has a close connection with our Heavenly Man, and therefore we have aninteresting cosmic interplay as follows:1. One of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear.2. One of the seven Sisters, or a Pleiad.3. The Heavenly Man of our scheme.This interplay will be threefold and as far as we are concerned just now willinvolve a transmission of life force through the atomic matter of our planes,circulating in deva substance. This will materially affect certain types ofhumanity more than others, according to their ray and nature, and this effectwill demonstrate in [658] a vivification of the spirillae of the permanent atomsand of the centres.Agnisuryans—Astral Plane Devas.We start here upon a consideration of those groups of devas who are thesubstance of the astral plane, the Agnisuryans. They may be considered in thefollowing manner, and by the employment of synonymous terms, some general ideaof their function may be arrived at before we begin to differentiate them intogroups and study their relation to:1. The various entities who are the soul of the differing kingdoms, or groups,such as the animal kingdom, the human kingdom, and higher in the scale ofconsciousness than men—the planetary Logos.2. Man himself.3. The plane as a totality.We might consider these devas:First, as the substance of the astral plane in its seven grades.Second, as that aspect of logoic manifestation which corresponds to the liquidsubplane in the systemic physical plane.Third, as the vehicle of the deva lord Varuna.Fourth, as the animating lives of that involutionary matter of the astral planewhich we call the elemental essence, and as the vitality energising the desireelementals of all that is sentient. Viewed in this aspect in connectionespecially with man, they are the correspondence on the astral plane to the“devas of the shadows,” for the desire bodies of all human beings are composedof matter of the second, third and fourth subplanes of the astral plane. This isa point which should be closely considered, and the analogy between the ethericbody, the vehicle of prana vitalising the dense physical, and [659] man’s astralbody, and the method of its vitalisation will be found illuminating.Fifth, from the standpoint of the physical plane, as the sumtotal of materialactivity (even though subjective) which produces that which is tangible andobjective. Just as the solar system is a “Son of Necessity,” or of desire, sothe physical bodies of all that exist are the product of the desire of somegreater or lesser entity within the system.It might be apposite here to point out the lines along which energy—whethermanasic, pranic, or astral—enters the system and reaches a particular plane,thus finding its way to all units of consciousness, from an atom to a solarLogos.The dense physical plane itself is energised via:a. The planetary etheric body.b. The mental plane, or the cosmic gaseous subplane.c. The atmic plane, or the third cosmic ether.d. The plane of adi, or the first cosmic ether.and inferentially (by means of the logoic permanent atom) a similar flow offorce enters from cosmic levels.The astral plane is energised via:a. The buddhic plane, the fourth cosmic ether.b. The monadic plane, the second cosmic ether.c. The cosmic astral plane, and thus to the Heart of all Being.The mental plane is energised via:a. The atmic plane, the third cosmic ether.b. The plane adi, the first cosmic ether.c. The cosmic mental plane, beyond which it is unnecessary for us to go.It will be noted by the careful student that these planes might be looked at inconnection with the three worlds [660] as demonstrating two types offorce,—first, a force which tends to differentiation such as on the mental plane(the plane of inherent separation) and on the physical plane (the plane ofactual separation); secondly, a force which tends to unity, such as on theastral plane, and on the plane of essential harmony, the buddhic plane. It mustbe remembered that we are considering force as it flows through, or permeates,deva substance. A hint as to the truth lies in the fact that at present theastral body of man is positive to the physical plane, negative to the mental,and positive to the buddhic plane. As evolution proceeds, the astral body shouldbecome positive to the mental, and thus prove incapable of being swayed bythought currents, and the separative processes of that plane, and negative tothe buddhic plane, or receptive to the forces from that plane. When it hasattained equilibrium, and the forces are evenly balanced, the astral body shouldbecome the transmitter from the buddhic plane, the fourth cosmic ether, via thegaseous, to the dense physical plane. This thought should be studied inconnection with the burning of the etheric web of the planet, thus illuminationmay come. Literally, there is no such division on the astral plane as we find onthe mental or on the physical planes. On both those planes, we have a divisioninto two: the mental plane being divided into higher and lower, rupa and arupa,concrete and abstract, and the physical plane into the etheric levels and thedense subplanes.There is, therefore, a correspondence between these two. The reason for thisapparent division (considering the question apart from the states ofconsciousness of a human being) is due to the stage of development of the greatdevas who embody the plane, who ensoul it, and who manifest through it as a manmanifests through his body. Varuna, the Lord of the astral plane, has achieved amore unified conscious control than His brothers of [661] the mental andphysical planes. He comes into manifestation in connection with one of theHeavenly Men, Who is the Lord of a major Ray. The other two are linked up withthe Lords of a minor Ray. There is a suggestive hint for students in thisinformation. We may justly ask why, if this is so, it should apparently manifestso disastrously in connection with man? There are several reasons for this, onebeing that the force flowing through the vehicle of the great deva, the plane,is consequently stronger than in the other two cases, and this is owing to Hismore advanced stage of development and also to the fact that the Logos Himselfis polarised in His astral body. Another reason is that he has a peculiar linkwith the Ruler of the animal kingdom, and as the human being has not yetdissociated himself from, nor learnt to control, his animal nature, he too comesunder the influence of this tremendous force. There are other reasons hidden inthe karma of our Heavenly Man, but the above reasons suffice.1. The Function of the Agnisuryans. The devas of the astral plane are those withwhom man is very specially connected at this time owing to his astralpolarisation, and to the place desire and feeling play in his development.Consciousness expands through contact, through intelligent appreciation of thatwhich is contacted, and through realisation of that which is to be gainedthrough a specific contact. That which is contacted depends upon reciprocalvibration, and the place therefore of desire (which is the going out aftersensation) and of feeling (which is the reflex of that desire) is of realimportance; they put man constantly in touch—even though he realises it not—withdeva substance of some kind or another. Even when man has reached a relativelyhigh stage of evolution, the demonstration of that point of attainment is seenin the type of not-self which he contacts; it is only when he is an initiatethat [662] he begins to approximate, and to know the meaning of the essentialunity which lies at the heart of Being, and to comprehend the oneness of theUniversal Soul, and the Unity of that subjective Life which secretes itselfbehind form of every kind. It should never be forgotten that the matter aspectis found on all planes; also that forms are ever to be found, until the solarring-pass-not is transcended and the Logos escapes from His present limitation.Owing to this the devas of the astral plane assume a very important place in thethree worlds.Previously, we considered them in a fivefold aspect, dividing them into fivegroups. At this point we will limit our consideration to the relationship ofself-conscious units such as Man and the planetary Logos to this deva substance.A great distinction exists between man and his prototype, a Heavenly Man.The astral plane plays a very real part in the evolution of man, having a closeconnection with one of his principles. Astral matter and vibration is one of thecontrolling factors in the lives of the great majority of people. To theHeavenly Man, astral matter corresponds to the liquid portion in the physicalbody of man, and is for Him therefore no principle.The astral plane is man’s principal battle-ground and the area of his mostintense field of sensation,—mental sensation (esoterically understood) is forhim as yet only a possibility. The astral body is the seat of man’s most violentvibration, and these vibrations are a potent cause of his physical planeactivities. If man only realised it, the devas of the astral plane at presentvery largely control what he does and says, and his goal of evolution (hisimmediate goal) is to liberate himself from their control in order that he, thereal Ego or thinker, may be the dominating influence. To be explicit, and thusto illustrate this point: the little elemental lives which form the body of theemotions, and the positive [663] life of any evolutionary deva who (throughsimilarity of vibration) is linked to any particular man and who gives to him anastral body of a coherent and positive power, are as yet practically in controlof the majority. Man usually does as his desires and instincts prompt him. Ifthis evolutionary deva is of a high order (as will be the case in a highlydeveloped man) the vibration will be high, and the desires and instincts will begood and exoterically right. Nevertheless, if the man is controlled by them, heis as yet under deva influence, and must free himself. If the deva life is of alow order, the man will demonstrate low and vicious instincts, and desires of avile calibre.If these remarks are rightly apprehended, some understanding will come of whatis meant when the deva evolution is spoken of as being a “parallel evolution” tothat of man. In the three worlds the two lines of evolution parallel each other,and must not be consciously one. In the planes of the Triad they are known as aunity, producing the Divine Hermaphrodite, or the Heavenly Man,—theself-conscious human units embodying the three aspects of divinity, while theconscious deva units embody the divine attributes. The two, blended together,form the body of manifestation, the centres and substance of the Heavenly Man.Great is the mystery, and until man knows his place within the conscious whole,he should reserve his opinion as to the meaning thereof. It will be apparent,therefore, in view of the connection between the astral plane with its unifiedwork, and the buddhic plane with the conscious harmony there experienced, thatthe astral body of man calls for the closest study and understanding. A linkwill be found through its medium with the buddhic plane and harmonious activityon the physical plane will be produced. The student of occultism should studycarefully in this connection: [664]a. The physical sun, and its relation to prana and the etheric body.b. The subjective sun, and its connection with the astral plane, with thekama-manasic principle, and the astral body.c . The central spiritual sun, and its relation to the Spirit or atma in man.(S. D., II, 250, 251.)d. The heart of the sun, and its relation to the lower and higher mental bodies,producing that peculiar manifestation we call the causal body. In thisconnection it must be remembered that the force which flows from the heart ofthe sun, works through a triangle formed by the Venusian scheme, the Earth andthe sun.That another triangle was also formed involving two planets was to be expectedunder the law, and the triangles vary according to the scheme involved.Cosmically there is a very interesting series of triangles which will be foundby the student of esoteric astronomy and of occult cycles. They originate in thecentral sun of our particular group of solar systems. This series involves thePleiades. The fact that this is so will not be known until the last decade ofthe present century, and will not be recognised by science till that time whencertain lines of knowledge and discovery will bring scientists to a realisationthat there is a third type of electricity, which ever balances and forms theapex of the triangle. But the time is not yet.All that is here said is expressed in terms of deva groups and deva forces,which form (in their aggregate) substance responsive to analogous vibration.This is occultly expressed under certain definite names. It is possible,therefore, to transmit safely information of a character incomprehensible to theprofane in such a phrase, for instance, as: “The triangle of...of...and ofGroup...of the Agnisuryans formed itself, and in the turning of the Wheelproduced the third.” This conveys to the mind of the occultist the knowledge[665] that in the flow of force from a particular constellation, outside oursystem altogether, through a particular planetary scheme, and thus through theastral body of a planetary Logos, a condition was brought about which producedthe appearance of the third kingdom in nature, the sentient conscious animalkingdom. Some such similar phrase embodies also the deva connection with man’sindividualisation, but it profits not to pass it on; the above is only quoted inorder to do three things:1. Demonstrate somewhat the nature and extent of the forces flowing through oursystem.2. Show the close connection we have with the deva evolution.3. Emphasise the triangular nature and interrelation of all that eventuates.It might be advisable here to bring out a point in connection with the devas ofthe lower planes (those with whom man is peculiarly connected). They can bedivided into certain groups, indicating their place in the scale ofconsciousness. Perhaps the question may here be asked why we are dealing onlywith those deva groups which are to be found in the three worlds. Occultlyunderstood, these devas (of the type we are considering) are only found in thedense physical body of the Logos,—being the substance of the lower threesubplanes of the cosmic physical. The old Commentary says as follows:“The spheres of fire seek location upon the lower three. They originate bymedium of the fifth, yet merge upon the planes of yoga. When the fiery essencespermeate all, then there is no more the fifth nor sixth, nor seventh, but onlythe three shining by medium of the fourth.”Therefore, for the purposes of our present study, the devas are only to be foundin the three worlds. Beyond those three planes we have the three aspects of[666] the major three manifesting through the fourth; we have consequently thespheres of the planetary Logoi upon the plane of buddhi. They synthesise allthat has been developing through the denser manifestation. From the standpointof the esoteric philosophy, the cosmic physical plane on which our entire solarsystem has its place must be studied in a dual manner:1. From the point of view of the Heavenly Men, covering the evolutions of thefour higher planes, or the etheric levels. Of these we can know practicallynothing until after initiation, at which time the consciousness of the humanbeing is transferred gradually on to the cosmic etheric planes.2. From the standpoint of the human being in the three worlds. Man is theconsummating evolution in the three worlds, just as the Heavenly Men are in thehigher four.In the three worlds, we have the parallel evolutions—deva and human in theirmany varying grades—the human naturally concerning us the most intimately,though the two evolve through interaction with each other. In the higher fourworlds, we have this duality viewed as a unity, and the aspect of the syntheticevolution of the Heavenly Men is the one considered. It would interest us muchcould we but understand a little of the point of view of those great devas Whoco-operate intelligently in the plan of evolution. They have Their own method ofexpressing these ideas, the medium being colour which can be heard, and soundwhich can be seen. Man reverses the process and sees colors and hears sounds. Ahint lies here as to the necessity for symbols, for they are signs which conveycosmic truths, and instruction, and can be comprehended alike by the evolved ofboth evolutions . It should be borne in mind, as earlier pointed out, that:[667]a. Man is demonstrating the aspects of divinity. The devas are demonstrating theattributes of divinity.b. Man is evolving the inner vision and must learn to see.The devas are evolving the inner hearing and must learn to hear.c. Both are as yet imperfect, and an imperfect world is the result.d. Man is evolving by means of contact and experience. He expands.The devas evolve by means of the lessening of contact. Limitation is the law forthem.e . Man aims at self-control.Devas must develop by being controlled.f. Man is innately Love,—the Force which produces coherency. The devas areinnately intelligence,—the force which produces activity.g. The third type of force, that of Will, the balancing equilibrium ofelectrical phenomena, has to play equally upon and through both evolutions, butin the one it demonstrates as self-consciousness, and in the other asconstructive vibration.In the Heavenly Man these two great aspects of divinity are equally blended, andin the course of the mahamanvantara the imperfect Gods become perfect. Thesebroad and general distinctions are pointed out as they throw light upon therelationship of Man to the devas.The devas of the physical plane, though divided into the three groups A, B, C,are under another grouping spoken of as “the Devas of the Seventh Order.” Theseventh order is peculiarly linked to the devas of the first order on the firstplane. They are the reflectors of the mind of God of which the first order isthe expression, and manifest it as it has worked through from the [668]archetypal plane. This seventh order of devas is directly under the influence ofthe seventh Ray, and the planetary Logos of that Ray works in close co-operationwith the Raja-Lord of the seventh plane. As the goal of evolution for the devasis the inner hearing, it will be apparent why mantric sounds and balancedmodulations are the method of contacting them, and of producing varyingphenomena. This seventh order of devas is the one with which the workers on theleft hand path are concerned, working through vampirism and the devitalisationof their victims. They deal with the etheric bodies of their enemies, and bymeans of sounds affect deva substance, thus producing the desired results. Thewhite Magician does not work on the physical plane with physical substance. Hetransfers His activities to a higher level, and hence deals with desires andmotives. He works through the devas of the sixth order.The devas of the sixth order are those of the astral plane, and are the devaswho have the most to do with the forces which produce the phenomena we calllove, sex impulse, instinct, or the driving urge and motive which demonstrateslater on the physical plane in activity of some kind. The positive vibration setup on the astral plane produces results on the physical and that is why theWhite Brother, if He works with the devas at all, works only on the astral planeand with the positive aspect.These devas of the sixth order, as might be expected, are closely linked withthose of the second order on the monadic plane, and with the heart centre of theparticular Heavenly Man on Whose Ray they may be found. They are allied too tothe deva forces on the buddhic plane and in these three great orders of devas wehave a powerful triangle of electrical force,—the three types of electricitywhich are met with in occult books. It should be borne in mind that theequilibrising [669] type of force (at present an unknown type) flows in from thebuddhic plane at this time, and the apex of the triangle is there.[Image00013.jpg]These three orders are (in this solar system) the most potent, especially inthis fourth round. They influence particularly the fourth kingdom of nature, andare the basis of that search for balance, of that aspiration towards harmony,union and yoga which distinguishes man in all grades; it shows in its lowermanifestation as the sex instinct as we know it, and in its higher as longingfor union with God.These devas of the sixth order come under the special influence of the Lord ofthe sixth Ray of Abstract Idealism, and it is their connection with Him whichfacilitates the working through of the archetypal idea on to the physical plane.The sixth Creative Hierarchy likewise is specially connected with thisparticular order of devas, and through this dual influence is produced thatphysical manifestation which is definitely objective,—one type of force workingthrough the etheric manifestation, and the other through the dense physical.This will as yet prove an insoluble mystery to the student, but in thesignificance of numbers much can be discovered. This angle of the matter shouldbe studied in order to bring out the true meaning of this sixth order of devas,whose symbol is the six-pointed Star set at a particular angle and in fullmanifestation. The six-pointed star is the sign that a “Son of Necessity” [670](no matter whether God or man) has sought physical incarnation. The devas of thesixth order, the Agnisuryans, are a prime factor in bringing this about. In thesixth round these devas will begin to make their presence felt more and morepotently, but the strength of their vibration will be very gradually turnedupwards, and not downwards into the physical plane. This will involve thetransmutation of desire into aspiration, and will produce eventually theliberation of the planetary Logos, and bring a manvantara (or His cycle ofphysical incarnation) to a close. Withdrawal of the force of desire resultslikewise in the cessation of man’s physical existence. The old Commentaryexpresses this truth in the following words:“The Sixth retire within themselves; they turn towards the Fifth, leaving theSeventh alone.”In continuing our consideration of these deva orders, it should be pointed outthat these three lower deva orders—the lower fifth, the sixth and theseventh—have a close connection with the moon. They are the building agentswhich (working on the involutionary matter of the three worlds) construct thelower three bodies of incarnating man. They are a branch of the lunar Pitris,but the fact should be remembered that this particular branch of pitris arethose functioning in our particular scheme, and are closely allied to ourplanetary Logos. Groups of these Pitris are found wherever man is in incarnationin all the schemes, but in other schemes they differ somewhat from ours, as the“Mystery of the Moon” is connected with a peculiar esoteric condition whichconcerns our own planetary Logos.Wherever man is in incarnation, the Builders of his bodies are to be found butthey will differ in:a. Their rate of vibration.b. Their stage of development. [671]c. Consciousness.d. Fohatic, magnetic and dynamic force.It should be remembered also that each round sees the deva substance or the devaevolution changing; they also evolve and, therefore, the subject of the devas intheir dual aspect as the negative and positive substance which producesobjectivity must be studied in a threefold manner if a true idea is to beapproximated. Therefore, the devas—who are the sum-total of substance—must beconsidered from:The standpoint of round development.The standpoint of any particular planetary Logos as they form His body ofmanifestation, a scheme.The standpoint of the human kingdom.When this is not done, a wrong and narrow idea is the result. In future time, asmay be seen from a study of the Secret Doctrine, (I, 288; II, 179, 187.) theLogos in His septenary Nature will be seen as the Macrocosm for Man, whilst theMicrocosm, Man himself, will be seen also as the Macrocosm for the three lowerkingdoms. This is simply one way of studying the evolution of the consciousEntity—God, Man, or lesser life—by means of deva substance; it involves thestudy of the positive and negative interaction. As says the old Commentaryagain:“When Father approaches Mother, that which will be taketh form. The union of thetwo concealeth the true mystery of Being.When the two great devas seek each other, when they meet and merge, the promiseof life is fulfilled.When the one who sees and knows stands midway between his parents, then can beseen the fruition of knowledge, and all is known upon the planes ofconsciousness.When Anu, the infinitesimal, is seen to contain Ishvara in His potency, when thelesser spheres and cycles expand into the [672] circle of the Heavens, thenshall the essential Unity be cognised and manifested fully.When the One that holds the life becomes the three behind which that life ishidden; when the three by revolution become the seven and the ten; when thethirty million crores of deva lives repeat the revolution; when the centralpoint is reached and reveals the three, the nine, and the inner blazing JEWEL,then is the circle of manifestation consummated, and the One again becomes theten, the seven, the three and the point.”Herein lies the key to the mystic marriage, and to the student of occultism muchmay be revealed through the study of these pairs of opposites; it will cause therevelation of the process (in time and space) whereby this union and its fruitis consummated, and the resultant creation of the divine Hermaphrodite is seenupon His Own high plane.We must ever keep clearly in mind that we are dealing in this section with theevolutionary devas who are the positive Life animating involutionary matter ordeva substance. Consequently, the correspondence of the mystic marriage ofSpirit and matter can be seen working out also in deva substance itself, throughthe interaction of negative and positive deva lives. Substance itself representsessential duality; forms repeat the same duality, and when we arrive at manhimself again, we have duality plus a third factor. These three orders of devasubstance—the lower fifth, the sixth and seventh—are a very mysterious group asfar as man is concerned.( 217 [text00028.html#Y_FN217] ) [673] They havescarcely been hinted at as yet in occult literature, but they contain withinthemselves the secret of our planetary individualisation. They were the groupwhich had much to do with the “sin of the mindless,” and are very closelyassociated with animal man. To the power and control which these pitris assumedmust be ascribed much of the disastrous early happenings referred to in theSecret Doctrine , such as the above mentioned “sin,” and also the early“failures” in building suitable vehicles for Spirits seeking incarnation. Herealso may be found the beginnings of that mysterious divergence which we call the“left and right hand paths,” which conditions (existing within the body logoicand consequently being part of the divine consciousness) originated in theremote “space of time,” when the sons of God were seeking form. It has to dowith a special condition in the astral body of our planetary Logos, and with Hishistory as it lies hidden in the astral light.It concerns that which He has to surmount and many of the problems which facethe occultist, including the “sin of the mindless,” the failure in Atlanteandays, and even that mysterious “failure” of the Buddha (which has a planetarysignificance only hinted at in the Secret Doctrine) ( 218[text00028.html#Y_FN218] ) can be traced back to the condition of the devasubstance of which the astral body of our planet, and the astral bodies of allforms are formed. Our planetary Logos is one of the Lords spoken of as being alesser lord, and more “full of passion” than the higher three. Not even yet isHis work completed, and deva [674] substance in its various living orders is notyet brought fully under His control. The deva evolution has far to travel.If this idea be extended to the solar system, it will be apparent that theastral vehicles of the different planetary Logoi differ. This difference isnecessarily dependent upon Their cosmic astral life which directly affects thesystemic astral, or the physical liquid subplane of the cosmic physical. This isa point but little realised. The dense physical body of the planetary Logosexists, as we know, in a threefold condition—dense, liquid, and gaseous—and eachis acted upon directly from the corresponding cosmic plane. The condition of thevarious physical planets will some day be found to be dependent upon this fact.When the psychic nature of the planetary Logos is understood (which knowledge isentered upon after initiation, being a part of the Wisdom) the nature of thedifferent schemes, as regards their watery aspect, for instance, will be foundto be connected with a particular astral state. As the initiate progresses inwisdom, he intuitively comprehends the essential nature of the seven groups, orof the logoic Septenate, which is that concerning their colour or quality. Thiscolour or quality is dependent upon the psychic nature of any particularplanetary Logos, and His emotional or desire nature can thereby be somewhatstudied by the initiate. This will lead eventually to a scientific considerationof the effect of this nature upon His dense physical body, and particularly thatportion of it which we call the astral plane, the liquid sub-plane of the cosmicphysical plane. A reflection of this (or a further working out, if that term ispreferred) is found in the liquid portions of the physical planet.The seventh subplane of the cosmic physical plane can be subdivided into seven,which are our seven physical [675] subplanes. It is this knowledge which enablesa magician to work. Given a certain physical phenomenon—such as the weight ofwater, for instance, upon a planet—and an initiate of the higher orders can formdeductions from it as to the quality of the exalted Life manifesting through aplane. He arrives at this knowledge through a process of reasoning from theliquid (sixth) subplane of the systemic physical plane to:a . The liquid subplane of the cosmic physical, our systemic astral plane.b. The fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane.c. The second cosmic ether, the monadic plane, or the plane of the sevenHeavenly Men.d. The cosmic astral plane, thus getting in touch with the desire nature of theGod.This method naturally involves a vast knowledge of the deva substance andpredicates an intuitive realisation of their orders and groups, the keynotes ofthose orders and of the planes, and also of the triple nature of substance and aknowledge of how to work with the third type of electrical force, which is thetype of energy which puts a man in touch with extra-systemic phenomena. Hencethat force still remains unknown, and is only contacted as yet by highInitiates.It will again be apparent why the Agnisuryans are of such supreme importance;they embody force which is a direct emanation from the cosmic astral plane andwhich reveals—when triply blended—the desire nature of our Heavenly Man, and ofany particular planetary Logos. In the two opposites, which are called by thetheologians “Heaven and Hell,” we have two of these types of force hinted at,and in this thought we have indicated one of the keys to the astral plane.2. Summary . Before passing to the consideration of [676] those devas who areconcerned with the construction of man’s causal body, and who are the linkinggroup between the Triad and the Quaternary, both in man and the Logos, we willbriefly enumerate the principal groups of Agnisuryans on the systemic astralplane, as they, in their totality, form the body of manifestation of the greatdeva or Raja-Lord of the plane.First. The Raja-Lord of the Plane, the great deva Varuna, Who is the centralLife of the substance of the astral plane of our planetary scheme. He is Himselfan outpost of the consciousness of that greater Deva Who embodies the substanceof the solar astral plane, or the sixth subplane of the cosmic physical plane.He again in His turn reflects His prototype, that great cosmic Entity Whoensouls the cosmic astral plane.Second. Seven great Devas, who are the positive force of each of the sevensubplanes of the systemic astral plane.Third. Various groups of devas, performing different functions carrying outvarying activities, and producing constructive results. They might be enumeratedas follows, bearing in mind the fact that we are but touching upon a few of themany groups, and that there are numbers whose name is utterly unknown to man andwould be unintelligible if mentioned:1. Those devas who form the permanent atomic substance of all the Monads, bothin and out of physical incarnation. They are divided into seven groups accordingto the Ray of the Monad.2. Those devas who form the “liquid” aspect in the physical body of theplanetary Logos and of the solar Logos. They are myriads in number, and includedeva existences ranging all the way from those who ensoul the astral plane, andthe astral currents of the highest religious and aspirational nature, to thelittle water [677] spirits which are reflections of such astral entitiesprecipitated in watery physical matter.3. A group of devas, who form the desire body of that great entity who ensoulsthe animal kingdom. They are the total kamic manifestation (divorced frommentality) of animal desire in its incentive impulsive aspect.4. Certain devas who—being of the third order—form the Heaven of the averageorthodox Christian or believer of any faith. Another group—being the seventhorder—form the Hell for the same class of thinker.5. Those devas who form the astral life of any thought-form. These we will dealwith later when studying thought-form construction.6. A mysterious group of devas intimately connected at this time with the sexexpression in the human family on the physical plane. They are a group who are,at this juncture, swept into being, and they embody the fire of sex expressionas we understand it. They are the impulse, or instinct, back of physical sexdesire. They were peculiarly dominant in the fourth root-race, at which time sexconditions reached a stage of unbelievable horror from our point of view. Theyare gradually being controlled, and when the last of the Lemurian Egos haspassed into the fifth root-race they will be slowly passed out of the solarsystem altogether. They are connected with the passional “fire” of the solarLogos and with one of His centres in particular; this centre is being graduallyobscured and its fire transferred into a higher centre.7. There is also a group of devas connected with the Lodge of Masters, whosework it is to build the aspirational forms towards which average man may aspire.They are divided into certain groups—three in number—connected with science,religion and philosophy, and through these groups of deva substance the Heads ofthe three departments reach men. It is one of Their [678] channels for work. TheMaster Jesus is particularly active at this time along this line, working incollaboration with certain adepts on the scientific line, who—through thedesired union of science and religion—seek to shatter the materialism of thewest on the one hand and on the other the sentimental devotion of the manydevotees of all faiths. This is made possible now through the passing out of thesixth Ray and the coming in of the seventh. It should be borne in mind by allstudents when considering the planes, plane substance and energy that they arein a condition of flux and change all the time. The matter of all planescirculates, and cyclically certain portions become more energised than others;the matter of the planes is thus under a threefold influence, or—to word itotherwise—deva substance is subjected to a threefold cyclic stimulation:1. Ray stimulation, dependent upon any Ray being in or out of power. It isinter-systemic and planetary.2. Zodiacal stimulation, which is an extra-systemic stimulation, and is alsocosmic and cyclic.3. Solar stimulation, or the impact of direct solar force or energy upon thesubstance of a plane; this emanates from the “Heart of the Sun” and ispeculiarly potent.All the planes are subjected to this threefold influence but in the case of thebuddhic and the astral planes, the force of this third stimulation is verygreat. The adepts—working in conjunction with the great devas—utilise cyclicopportunity to effect definitely constructive results.8. A group of devas closely connected with the mysteries of initiation. Theyform what is esoterically called the “path of the Heart,” and are the bridgebetween the astral and the buddhic planes. They are in no way [679] connectedwith the permanent atoms in the causal body, but are very definitely associatedwith the central tier of petals in the egoic lotus, or with the “petals oflove.” Force interacts between these three petals on the one hand, and the devaswho form the “Path of the Heart” upon the other, those who are the bridge ofastral-buddhic matter whereby initiates of a certain mystic type make the “greatapproach.”9. Devas of all degrees and vibratory capacity who make up the bulk of thedesire forms of every kind.10. The devas of transmutative force. They are a peculiar group of devas whoembody the “fires of transmutation” and are called by various names, such as:The furnaces of purifications.The melting elements.The gods of incense.It is impossible to enumerate more now, and likewise profitless and it has onlybeen deemed advisable to bring these many types of deva substance to the noticeof students on account of the pre-eminent importance of the astral body in thethree worlds. It is by the domination of these deva lives, and the“transmutation of desire” into aspiration, and by the purificatory fires of theastral plane that man eventually succeeds in attaining buddhic consciousness.It has been the recognition of the cleansing power of the occult fluids—waterand blood—that has led to the emphasis laid by Christians (even thougherroneously interpreted) upon these two.3. The Solar Angels, The Agnishvattas.Introductory Remarks.We start here upon the consideration of the Agnishvattas, or the Fire devas ofthe mental plane, and are [680] thus launched upon the most stupendous subjectin connection with our planetary evolution; it is the one having the most occultsignificance for man, for these solar Angels ( 219 [text00028.html#Y_FN219] )concern his own essential nature, and are also the creative power by which heworks. For all practical purposes, and for the elucidation of the spiritualevolution of man, this immediate section is of the greatest interest andimportance; it should be one of the most widely studied sections of thistreatise. Man is ever profoundly interested in himself, and before he can dulydevelop must comprehend scientifically the laws of his own nature, and theconstitution of his own “mode of expression.” He must realise likewise somewhatof the inter-relation of the three fires in order that he may himself at somefuture date “blaze forth.”The question of these Fire Dhyanis and their relation to man is a most profoundmystery, and the entire matter is so clothed in intricate legends that studentsare apt to despair of ever arriving at the desired, and necessary clarity ofthought. Not yet will it be possible entirely to dispel the clouds which veilthe central mystery, but perhaps, by due tabulation and synthesis, and by acautious amplification of the data already imparted, the thoughts of the wisestudent may become somewhat less confused.There are two statements in the Secret Doctrine which are often overlooked bythe casual reader but which, if [681] duly pondered upon, convey muchinformation. Let us make note of these two statements:1. Two connecting principles are needed. This requires a living spiritual Fireof the middle principle from the Fifth and third states of Pleroma. This fire isthe possession of the Triangles.2. These Beings are Nirvanis from a preceding Mahamanvantara.We have been considering somewhat the devas of evolutionary tendency who aregrouped roughly together as the lunar Pitris. ( 220 [text00028.html#Y_FN220] )These lunar Pitris are divided into four groups and are concerned with thebuilding of man’s dual physical body, with his astral body and with his lowermental body; these sheaths are energised by their force through the medium ofthe permanent atoms. But for the purposes of the subjective nature of man, theyare to be considered in their three groups—etheric, astral and lower mental. Thework of the Agnishvattas (the self-conscious principles, the Builders orconstructors of the egoic body on the higher mental levels) is to unite thehigher three principles—atma, buddhi, manas—and the lower three, and thus becomein very truth the middle principle in man. They themselves originate from thelogoic middle principle. (S. D., II, 83.) Thus the esoteric seven is completed.The physical body in its denser manifestation is, as we know, not esotericallyconsidered a principle.The devas of the lower mental levels in relation to [682] man work through themental unit, and are, roughly speaking, divided into four groups, being in factthe first condensation of the threefold lower body of man. They form part of hislunar body. They are directly linked with the highest spiritual essences, andrepresent the lowest manifestation of force emanating from the cosmic mentalplane, and finding its link with the human Hierarchy through the mental units.They are the gaseous devas of the logoic physical body. We will not deal withthem in greater detail at this moment for as we study the subject of the fifthprinciple certain points will become clearer; their work in connection with mancan be enlarged upon as we proceed. More detail at this moment would but serveto complicate.Let us be quite clear in our minds just what we are in process of considering.We are dealing with:1. That fifth state of consciousness called the mental plane,2. The substance of that plane as it exists in its dual aspect, rupa and arupa,(222 [text00028.html#Y_FN222] )3. The lives who ensoul that matter, especially in their relation to man,4. The Egos or the self-conscious units who form the middle point inmanifestation,5. The building of the causal body, the opening of the egoic Lotus, and theconstruction of those groups we call egoic groups,6. The individuality of those Existences whom we call:a. Agnishvattas.b . Manasa devas.c . Fire dhyanis.d. Solar angels, or solar Pitris.e. The Asuras.and many other names mentioned in the occult books.[683] Much confusion exists in the minds of students as to the distinctionbetween the Agnishvattas who incarnated in man, and those who simply wereresponsible for the implanting of the manasic or mental spark in animal man.This opens up for us the entire question of individualisation itself, and theincarnation of certain spiritual existences who—when in bodily form—are spokenof as Avatars, as Buddhas of Activity, or as direct manifestations of the Logos.The entire mystery is hidden in the relationship of the individual Monads whoform the various centres in the body of a planetary Logos and the self-consciousIdentity of that planetary Logos Himself. The student must here bear in mind thefact that the mental plane is the first aspect of the dense physical body of theplanetary Logos, the buddhic plane being a cosmic etheric plane, and the onewhereon are to be found the etheric centres of a Heavenly Man.From the buddhic plane (in a planetary or solar sense) comes the vitality andimpulse which galvanises the dense physical vehicle into purposeful and coherentaction; it is on the mental plane, therefore, that this impulse is first feltand the contact between the two realised. Herein lies a hint which will serve apurpose if pondered upon. The student should study the place and purpose of themental plane, and its relation to the planetary Logos and a solar Logos. As heinvestigates more closely the nature of his own etheric body, he must extendthat knowledge to higher levels, and must endeavour to comprehend theconstitution of the greater sphere of which he is but a part. As the nature ofhis own centres, and their effective action upon his own dense physical body, isbetter understood, he will pass to a fuller comprehension of the correspondingeffect in the body of the Logos.It is on the mental plane (the reflection in the three worlds of the third andfifth states of Pleroma), that the full force of etheric vitality is felt. Ahint as to the [684] significance of this may be found in the fact that theetheric body of man receives, and transmits prana directly to the physical body,and that the vitality of the physical frame is to be gauged largely by thecondition and action of the heart. The heart circulates vitality to the myriadsof cells that constitute the dense physical sheath; something analogous is seenin the fact that these fire devas are “the Heart of the Dhyan chohanic body,” (223 [text00028.html#Y_FN223] ) for their energy comes from the spiritual sun, inthe same sense that the energy of the pranic devas of the etheric body comesfrom the physical sun. This energy of the Agnishvattas manifests on the mentalplane, the gaseous subplane of the cosmic physical just as the energy of theetheric centres on the fourth etheric subplane manifests first and potently onthe gaseous matter of the physical body. This is why the Sons of Wisdom,embodying the buddhic principle, the life force, or love aspect, arenevertheless known on the fifth plane as the self-conscious principles; buddhiuses manas as a vehicle, and occult writers often speak in terms of the vehicle.The Ego, or the self-conscious Identity is in essence and in truth Love-Wisdom,but manifests primarily as intelligent consciousness.We should endeavor to study carefully the following statement which is concernedwith kama-manas, and which deals with the conditions which produceindividualisation, or which call forth into self-conscious Being the Monadsseeking full self-expression. It is as follows:Only as the heart centre of a Heavenly Man (each in His cycle and each differingcyclically) becomes vitalised and attains a certain vibratory capacity does theindividualisation of the Monads become possible under the Law.Again, it is only as the threefold dense physical body of a planetary Logos (asexpressed by our three worlds, the mental, astral and dense physical planes) hasreached [685] a corresponding vibration and retraced the cyclic development ofthe previous mahamanvantara, that there is produced that vibratory contact whichcauses the shining out upon the mental plane of the egoic groups. It bringsforth a manifestation of the heart impulses of the Heavenly Man, and thus swingsinto objectivity those Monads (energised by the life of the Heart) who formvarious centres. The old Commentary says:“When the Heart of the Body throbs with spiritual energy, when its sevenfoldcontent thrills under the spiritual impulse, then the currents spread andcirculate and divine manifestation becomes a Reality; the divine Manincarnates.”The physical plane analogy is seen at the life stimulation which is felt betweenthe third and fourth month during the prenatal period, when the heart of thechild thrills with life and individual existence becomes a possibility.This life vibration emanates from the soul of the mother (the correspondence tothe Pleroma or universal soul) and is coincident with the awakening of the thirdspirilla in the permanent physical atom of the infant. It must be borne in mindthat just as in each round all the preceding stages are rapidly recapitulated,and just as in the prenatal period the foetus recapitulates during the formativeprocess the history of the preceding kingdoms, so in the solar system a similarprocedure can be seen. When a certain point is reached and the lower threeplanes are vibrating, or energised, then cosmic incarnation becomes apossibility; the “Heart” occultly awakens, and the “Son of God,” the expressionof the desire and love of the Logos, is born.( 224, 225 [text00028.html#Y_FN224]) The cosmic incarnation of certain exalted Beings is consummated, and one ofthe indications of this is the appearance of the egoic groups [686] on mentallevels, and the resultant individualisation. Method and time may vary accordingto the nature of any particular planetary Logos, but for each and all the “Heartof the Body” has to thrill with awakening life before the response comes fromthe lower. The lunar Pitris have to carry on their work in our scheme and systembefore the solar angels, thrilling with expectancy, take possession of the formsprepared through their endeavour, and stimulate them into self-conscious lifeand separated existence. Thus the four great schemes in the solar system, whichare the vehicles for four of the planetary Logoi (Who constitute the logoicQuaternary), have to reach a certain stage of vibratory capacity, and ofconsciousness before a similar happening occurs in its fullness in the solarsystem, and the lower four and higher three are synthesised. The logoic heart isthrilling, and response comes already from all the schemes, as three spirillaeare vibrating in all of them, but the Son of God is not yet fully and cosmicallyself-conscious. As response comes the centres awaken. One logoic centre isresponding fully to the heart stimulation, and that is Venus, who is passingthrough the final round.If the student endeavours to dissociate our solar system from that whichpreceded it, and if he considers the pralaya at the close of this mahamanvantarato be a final one, and the utter consummation of all things, he errs. In thepreceding system the cosmic physical plane attained a certain vibratorycapacity, and the devas of the internal furnaces became (relatively speaking)highly evolved, the “fires of matter” then blazing forth. Certain Existencesattained self-consciousness in that earlier system, and are the “nirvanis”spoken of by H. P. B. (See S. D., II, 83, 84, 243.) As might be expected, theyare characterised by active intelligence, achieved and developed by means ofmaterial evolution during a previous mahamanvantara. They [687] are the Manasadevas and in their totality are the vehicles of the Divine mind, thedhyan-chohanic forces, the aggregate of the Ah-hi. In this solar system thevibration of the cosmic astral plane is becoming dominant, and through thatvibration, travelling via the fourth cosmic ether (whereon as earlier stated arethe etheric centres of the planetary Logoi) and our systemic astral plane,certain eventualities become possible. The “Sons of desire,” logoic or human,can learn certain lessons, undergo certain experiences, and add the faculty oflove-wisdom to the intelligence earlier gained.Our solar Logos, and the Heavenly Men, are polarised on the cosmic astral plane,and the effect of Their life energy as it flows through the systemic “Heart” canbe seen in the activity of the astral plane, and in the part sex and passionplay in the development of man. At the close of this mahamanvantara there willbe ready for manifestation in the coming third system nirvanis who will be, invery essence, “active intelligent love”; they will have to wait until the fivelower planes of the system have reached a stage of vibratory development whichwill permit them to enter, as the nirvanis in this system waited until the threelower planes became adequate in vibratory response. We are here speaking interms of the Heavenly Men. In the Earth scheme, the analogy is hidden in theadvent of the Egos in the third round, in the third root race and in the thirdchain. Individualisation, as we understand it, was not possible until the “thirdstate of pleroma” was reached, either universally where a Heavenly Man isconcerned, or relatively in connection with a human unit.Considering the same subject from below upwards it is the animal in the thirdkingdom which individualises. Viewing it from above downwards it is the fifthkingdom, the spiritual, which ensouls the third and produces the fourth, orself-conscious human kingdom. These figures [688] should be studied for theyhold the mystery hid, and though the true occult meaning will not be revealeduntil the third major Initiation, nor fully comprehended until the fifth, yetlight may stream in on a difficult point. Equally so in the next solar system,individualisation (if such an inadequate term may be applied to a state ofconsciousness inconceivable even to an initiate of the third Initiation) willnot be possible until the second or sixth stage of Pleroma. Consciousness willblaze forth then on the Monadic plane, and it will be the plane ofindividualisation. All states of consciousness below that high level will be tothe Logos what the consciousness of the three worlds is to Him now. Just as thephysical body of man is not a principle, so all planes at this time below thefourth cosmic ether are not considered by the Logos to be a principle.Our present solar Angels or fire devas will then have a position analogous tothat of the lunar Pitris now, for all will form a part of the divineconsciousness, and yet, will be esoterically considered as “below the threshold”of consciousness. Man has to learn to control, guide and use the deva substancesof which his lower sheaths are made; this goal involves the development of fullself-consciousness, which is brought about through the agency of the solarAngels or builders and vitalisers of the egoic body; they are those through whomself-consciousness becomes a fact. In the next solar system they too will nolonger embody the type of consciousness towards which man aspires; he will haveto rise to still greater realisations, and again by occultly “putting his footupon” them these higher realisations will become possible. In this solar systemhe has to mount by the putting his foot upon the serpent of matter. He rises bydomination of matter and becomes himself a serpent of wisdom. In the next solarsystem he will mount upward by means of the “serpent of wisdom,” and by thedomination [689] and control of the Agnishvattas, achieve something of whicheven the illuminated mind of the highest Dhyan-chohan can not yet conceive.a. The Fifth Principle.The solar Angels are the Pitris, the builders of the body of the Ego, and theproducers of individualisation or the realised consciousness, the Agnishvattas,the great devas of Mind.Certain broad and general affirmations have been laid down with the purpose inview of opening up this stupendous and practical subject, and in an endeavour tolink up this solar system in its fundamental manasic aspect with the past andthe future.The section we are now approaching concerns the development of the divineManasaputras, viewing them as a collective whole, containing the Divine Mind,and considering the individual Monad, who responds to Their life as a part ofthe body of these Dhyani Buddhas.(a.) Cosmically considered. An occult sentence has its place here. It holds thekey to the mystery of the fivefold Dhyanis:“The higher Three in cyclic unison sought to know and to be known. The lowerThree (for we count not here the eighth) knew not nor saw; they only heard andtouched. The fourth had not a place. The Fifth (which also is the fourth) formedat the middle point a cosmic TAU, which was reflected on the cosmic Seventh.”H. P. B. states (S. D., I, 200, 201. II, 251, 252.) that the individualisedMonad has more spiritual consciousness than the monad itself on its own plane,the second. It must be remembered here that the planetary Logoi are only inphysical incarnation in our system, their bodies of individualisation being onthe cosmic mental plane, therefore full expression for them [690] is impossibleduring manifestation. Relatively therefore, during manifestation , man is ableto express himself fully when he attains the “consciousness of the high places.”It should, therefore, be pointed out at the very beginning of our study of thisfifth principle that the divine Manasaputras on their own plane must beconsidered from the standpoint of physical incarnation, whereas man can beconsidered from what is, for him, a spiritual aspect. ( 229[text00028.html#Y_FN229] )Human individualisation, or the emergence of the self-conscious units on themental plane, is involved in a larger development, for it synchronizes with theappropriation of a dense physical body by the Planetary Logos; this body iscomposed of matter of our three lower planes. As the etheric centres of theManasaputras on the fourth cosmic etheric plane become vitalised, they produceincreased activity on the systemic mental plane, the cosmic gaseous, and theconsciousness of the Heavenly Man and His life energy begins to make itselffelt. Simultaneously, under the Law, mind force or manasic energy pours in fromthe fifth cosmic plane, the cosmic mental. This dual energy, contacting thatwhich is inherent in the dense physical body of the Logos itself, producescorrespondences to the centres upon that plane and the egoic groups appear. Theyblend in latency the three types of electricity, and are themselves electricalphenomena. They are composed of those atoms, or types of lives, which are a partof the fourth [691] Creative Hierarchy, the aggregate of purely human Monads.Similarly, this triple force, produced by this conscious appropriation by theHeavenly Man, animates deva substance and the dense physical body of theplanetary Logos is manifested objectively. This is what is meant by thestatements that devas are found only in the three worlds. It is a statementanalogous to the one that humanity is only found in the three worlds;nevertheless, the human Monads in their seven types are found on the plane ofspirit—as it is the plane of duality—the deva monads are likewise found there.Students should ever bear in mind that these occult subjects can be expressed ina twofold manner:In terms of the three worlds, or from the standpoint of the logoic densephysical body.In terms of force or energy, or from the standpoint of the logoic body of pranaor vitality, the four cosmic ethers.What we understand by the fifth principle is but the expression on the causalplane of that force or energy which emanates from the logoic causal body on thefifth cosmic plane, via the logoic correspondence to the mental unit. (Thesecorrespondences involve a concept far in advance of what is possible even to aninitiate at this time). In the fifth round, the inner significance may becomemore apparent to the disciple. As the logoic will is gradually transmuted intodesire and thus the physical incarnation is produced, a tremendous downflow ofvitalising force from the fifth cosmic plane takes place, until it arrives atour fifth plane, the mental. This force it is which—at the correct cyclicmoment—causes certain eventualities in time and space and in the three worlds,His dense physical body. The first of these events is the appropriation by theLogos of that dense physical vehicle, and the flashing into manifestation [692]of the physical Sun and the physical planets. Though this, from our standpoint,covers an inconceivably vast period of time, to the Logos it is but the briefperiod of gestation which all bodies undergo. A second momentous occurrence isthe appropriation by the various Prajapatis , ( 230 [text00028.html#Y_FN230] )or Heavenly Men of their physical bodies—again at varying times and according totheir evolutionary stage. This is of later date for the seven than for thethree. An idea of the meaning of this distinction can be gleaned by the student,as he studies the process of the incarnating ego.What do we consequently find? First of all, impulse, or the will-to-be,emanating from the mental plane; then desire, emanating from the astral plane,producing manifestation on the dense physical.This idea must be extended to the three Logoi or logoic Aspects and we then havethe key to the mystery of the nine Sephiroth, the triple Trimurti.The other event might be noted,—the appropriation at a still later period intime and space by the individual Monads of their bodies of manifestation.The pouring in of this force of energy, emanating from the fifth logoicPrinciple, brings about two things:The appropriation by the sevenfold Logos of His dense physical body.The appearance on the fifth systemic plane of the causal bodies of the humanMonads.orFor the greater Life it was incarnation.For the lesser lives it was individualisation.This needs pondering upon.[693] It will, therefore, be apparent to all thinkers why this fifth principlestirred the third aspect into self-conscious activity.(b.) Hylozoistically considered . ( 231 [text00028.html#Y_FN231] ) In continuingour consideration of the fifth logoic Principle, we will now view it in itshylozoistic aspect. We have seen that it can be regarded as the force, theenergy or the quality which emanates from the logoic mental unit on the cosmicmental plane; this necessarily has a definite effect on the fifth systemicplane, and on the fifth subplane of the physical plane, the gaseous. Beforetaking up the subject of the Agnishvattas in detail, there are three pointswhich should be borne in mind.First, it should be remembered that all the planes of our system, viewing themas deva substance, form the spirillae in the physical permanent atom of thesolar Logos. This has earlier been pointed out, but needs re-emphasising here.All consciousness, all memory, all faculty is stored up in the permanent atoms,and we are consequently dealing here with that consciousness; the student shouldnevertheless bear in mind that it is on the atomic subplanes that the logoicconsciousness (remote as even that may be from the Reality) centres itself. Thispermanent atom of the solar system, which holds the same relation to the logoicphysical body as the human permanent atom does to that of a man, is a recipientof force, and is, therefore, receptive to force emanations from anotherextra-systemic source. Some idea of the illusory character of manifestation,both human and logoic, may be gathered from the relation of the permanent atomsto the rest of the structure. Apart [694] from the permanent atom, the humanphysical body does not exist.Again, forms differ as do kingdoms according to the nature of the force flowingthrough them. In the animal kingdom that which corresponds to the permanent atomresponds to force of an involutionary character, emanating from a particulargroup. The human permanent atom responds to force emanating from a group on theevolutionary arc and the Ray of a particular planetary Logos in Whose body ahuman Monad has a definite place.Secondly , it must be noted that in view of the above it will be apparent thatwe are, at this period of manasic inflow and development, concerned with thecoming into full vitality and activity of the fifth logoic spirilla; thisvitalisation shows itself in the intense activity of the mental plane, and thethreefold nature of the electrical phenomena to be witnessed upon it.a. The atomic subplane manasic permanent atoms Positive b. The fourth subplanemental units Negative c. The egoic groups causal bodies Equilibrium or neutralThis is in process of demonstration during the course of evolution. We aredealing here with the substance aspect and considering energy in its variousmanifestations. The response of deva substance to the inflow of force on themental plane has a threefold effect in connection with the Logos or theSeptenate:1. It produces a greatly increased vitality in the logoic centres on the fourthcosmic ether, due to reflex action, which is felt both above and below the planeof activity.2. It stimulates the efforts of the highest specimens of the third kingdom, anda dual effect is produced [695] through this, for the fourth kingdom in naturemakes its appearance on the physical plane and the Triads are reflected on themental plane in the causal bodies to be found thereon.3. As earlier said, the dense physical is linked and co-ordinated with theetheric bodies of the solar logos and of the planetary Logos. Therefore, thelower three planes are synthesised with the higher four, and the devas of anearlier mahamanvantara or solar cycle are brought into conjunction with those ofa newer order who were awaiting just conditions. The physical incarnation of theLogos is completed. The lower three kingdoms, being negative to the higherforce, the mutual attraction of these two and their interaction bring into beingthe fourth or human kingdom. The three fires of mind, Spirit and matter arebrought together and the work of full self-consciousness begun.Finally, the student should very carefully study here the significance of thenumbers three, four and five in the evolution of consciousness. Numerology hashitherto been studied primarily, and rightly, from the substance aspect, but notso much from the standpoint of conscious energy. The Triad, for instance, isusually looked upon by our students as the triangle formed by themanasic-buddhic and atmic permanent atoms; the cube stands for the lowermaterial man, and the five-pointed star has frequently a very materialinterpretation. All these angles of vision are necessary, and must precede thestudy of the subjective aspect, but they lay the emphasis upon the materialrather than upon the subjective; the subject nevertheless should be studiedpsychologically. In this solar system, the above numbers are the most importantfrom the angle of the evolution of consciousness. [696] In the earlier system,the numbers six and seven held the mystery hid. In the next system, it will betwo and one. This refers only to the psychical development. Let me illustrate:The five-pointed star on the mental plane signifies (among other things) theevolution, by means of the five senses in the three worlds (which are alsocapable of a fivefold differentiation) of the fifth principle, the attainment ofself-consciousness, and the development of the fifth spirilla.On the buddhic plane, when flashing forth at initiation, this number signifiesthe full development of the fifth principle or quality, the completed cycle ofthe Ego upon the five Rays under the Mahachohan, and the assimilation of allthat is to be learned upon them, and the attainment—not only of fullself-consciousness, but also of the consciousness of the group wherein a man isfound. It infers the full unfoldment of five of the egoic petals, leaving fourto open before the final initiation.The five-pointed star at the initiations on the mental plane flashes out abovethe head of the initiate. This concerns the first three initiations which areundergone in the causal vehicle. It has been said that the first two initiationstake place upon the astral plane and this is correct, but has given rise to amisunderstanding. They are felt profoundly in connection with the astral andphysical bodies and with the lower mental, and effect their control. The chiefeffect being felt in those bodies, the initiate may interpret them as havingtaken place on the planes concerned, for the vividness of the effect, and thestimulation works out largely in the astral body. But it must ever be rememberedthat the major initiations are taken in the causal body or—dissociated from thatbody—on the buddhic plane. At the final two initiations, which set a man freefrom the three worlds and enable him to function in the logoic body of vitalityand to wield the force which animates that logoic [697] vehicle, the initiatebecomes the five-pointed star, and it descends upon him, merges in him, and heis seen at its very centre . This descent is brought about through the action ofthe Initiator, wielding the Rod of Power, and puts a man in touch with thecentre in the Body of the planetary Logos of which he is a part; this isconsciously effected. The two initiations, called the sixth and seventh, takeplace on the atmic plane; the five-pointed star “blazes forth from withinitself” as the esoteric phrase has it, and becomes the seven-pointed star; itdescends upon the man and he enters into the Flame.Initiation and the mystery of numbers primarily concern consciousness, and notfundamentally “ability to function on a plane,” nor the energy of matter, asmight be gathered from so many occult books. They deal with the subjective life,life as part of the consciousness and self-realization of a planetary Logos, orLord of a Ray, and not life in matter as we understand it. A Heavenly Manfunctions in His pranic vehicle, and there His consciousness is to be found asfar as we are concerned in this system; He works consciously through Hiscentres.To sum up: There is a stage in the evolution of consciousness where the three,the four and the five blend and merge perfectly. Confusion on this point arisesfrom two causes which are the point of individual achievement of the student. Weinterpret and colour statements according to the state of our own innerconsciousness. H. P. B. hints at this (S. D., III, 456.) when dealing with theprinciples; also the interpretation of these figures varies according to the keyemployed. The fifth or spiritual kingdom is entered when the units of the fourthkingdom have succeeded in vitalizing the fifth spirilla in all the atoms of thethreefold lower man; when they [698] have unfolded three of the egoic petals andare in process of unfolding the fourth and fifth and when they are becomingconscious of the pranic force of the Heavenly Man.(c.) The Solar Angels and the Fifth Principle . We can now study the Entitiesconcerned with this fifth principle and their effect upon the evolution ofconsciousness. Where man is concerned these solar Angels, the Agnishvattas,produce the union of the spiritual Triad, or divine Self, and the Quaternary, orlower self. Where the Logos is concerned, whether solar or planetary, theyproduce conditions whereby the etheric, and the dense physical become a unit.They represent a peculiar type of electrical force; their work is to blend andfuse, and above all else they are the “transmuting fires” of the system, and arethose agents who pass the life of God through their bodies of flame as itdescends from the higher into the lower, and again as it ascends from the lowerinto the higher. They are connected in their highest groups with that portion ofthe logoic head centre which corresponds to the heart, and here is the clue tothe mystery of kama-manas. The kamic angels are vitalised from the “heart”centre and the manasic angels from the logoic head centre, via the point withinthat centre connected with the heart . These two dominating groups are thesumtotal of kama-manas in all its manifestations. The solar angels exist inthree groups, all of which are concerned with the self-consciousness aspect, allof which are energised and connected with the fifth spirilla of the logoicpermanent atom, and all of which work as a unit.One group, the highest, is connected with the logoic head centre, whether solaror planetary. They work with the manasic permanent atoms and embody thewill-to-be in dense physical incarnation. Their power is felt on the atomicsubplane and on the second; they are the [699] substance and the life of thoseplanes. Another group is connected definitely with the causal bodies of all Egosand are of prime importance in this solar system. They come from the heartcentre, and express that force. The third group, corresponding to the throatcentre, show forth their power on the fourth subplane through the mental units.They are the sumtotal of the power of the Ego to see, to hear and to speak (orsound) in the strictly occult sense.A hint may here be given to those who have power to see. Three constellationsare connected with the fifth logoic principle in its threefold manifestation:Sirius, two of the Pleiades, and a small constellation whose name must beascertained by the intuition of the student. These three govern theappropriation by the Logos of His dense body. When the last pralaya ended, andthe etheric body had been co-ordinated, a triangle in the Heavens was formedunder law which permitted a flow of force, producing vibration on the fifthsystemic plane. That triangle still persists, and is the cause of the continuedinflow of manasic force; it is connected with the spirillae in the logoic mentalunit and as long as His will-to-be persists, the energy will continue to flowthrough. In the fifth round, it will be felt at its height.In considering the Entities (233 [text00028.html#Y_FN233] ) who gave the manasicprinciple to man, we must remember that they are the beings who, in earliermanvantaras have achieved, and who—in this round—waited for a specific moment at[700] which to enter, and so continue their work. A parallel case can be seen atthe entry—in Atlantean days—of Egos from the moon-chain. The parallel is notexact, as a peculiar condition prevailed on the moon, and a peculiar karmicpurpose brought them all in at that time.It should here be remembered that in the moon the fifth principle of manasincubated normally, and instinct gradually developed until it imperceptiblymerged into manas, being of a similar nature; in this round a peculiar conditionnecessitated extra-planetary stimulation, and this special group of Pitriseffected a transition of the lower into the higher through a downflow of energyvia the Earth’s Primary from an extra-systemic centre.The central three rounds, as in the planes and principles, are the mostimportant for the evolution of the self-conscious units in this system, and thisworking towards perfection of the three, the four, and the five, mark, for theplanetary Logos, as for man, the cycle of maturity. The earlier and later cyclesmark that of growth towards maturity, and the garnering of the fruits of earlierexperience. The three Halls again can be here considered from this aspect, andthe central period allocated to the Hall of Learning.On all the planets these manasadevas are found working, ever in their threegroups but varying the methods employed according to the stage of the evolutionof the planet concerned, and the karma of its planetary Lord. Their method ofwork on the Earth can be studied in the Secret Doctrine and has a mostsignificant interest for men at this time. ( 234 [text00028.html#Y_FN234] ) Thethree groups should be carefully considered from the standpoint of their occultwork, which is hinted at under the terms of:a. Those who refused to incarnate.b. Those who implanted the spark of manas.c. Those who took bodies and moulded the type.[701] The second group, the intermediate, can be subdivided into two lessergroups:a. Those who implant the spark of manas,b. Those who fan and feed the latent flame in the best types of animal man,thus again making five. These statements have been accepted at their face value,but little attention is paid to the real meaning. Much profit would come if thestudent would study the subject from the standpoint of energy, and of magneticinteraction. Those who refused to incarnate or to energise with their life theprepared forms, were acting under Law, and their opposition to incarnation inthese forms was based on magnetic repulsion . They could not energise the formsprovided, for it involved the opposition of that which is occultly the same. Thelesser was not negative to the greater Life. Where the Spark was implanted wehave the receptivity of the negative aspect to the positive force and thereforethe progress of the work. In every case we have deva substance of one polarityenergised by another polarity with the goal in view of producing—through theirmutual interaction—a balancing of forces, and the attainment of a third type ofelectrical phenomena.The question of the coming of the Lords of Flame is discussed hereafter underthe heading “Individualisation.” At this point we are only dealing with the workof these chohanic forces in a systemic and cosmic sense. These solar entities,being liberated intelligent Essences were in pralaya of a secondary nature whenthe time came for their reappearance in manifestation. When the WORD soundedforth which produced desire in the Triad for self-expression, and when the soundof the lower manifestation had blended with it, and had risen up into theHeavens, as the occult books express it, [702] an effect was produced whichcaused a response in certain allied constellations; this set loose energy whichswept into the solar system, carrying with it those solar angels who “rested inthe Heart of God until the hour was come.” Their appearance upon the mentalplane brought about the union of Spirit and matter, and from this union was borna self-conscious Identity, the Ego. On cosmic levels, an analogous processoccurs in connection with such stupendous Identities as a solar Logos, and theseptenary Lives.As the energy of a human being, seeking incarnation, passes down from the planeof intensive purpose, the mental plane, into the physical vehicle on the gaseousor fifth subplane, so a somewhat analogous stimulation takes place in the bodylogoic. A somewhat similar process can also be seen in connection with thisenergy in a human body as it stimulates the life of the individual cell, andbrings about relatively its intelligent co-operation in group work, and itsability to take its place in the body corporate. It is so with the human Monads,the cells in the body logoic. When science recognizes this fact (which willscarcely be yet awhile) attention will be turned to the volatile essences of thebody, to the heart centre particularly, and its relation to these gaseouselements. The heart will be found to be not only the engine which circulates thelife fluids, but also the generator of a certain type of intelligent essencewhich is the positive factor in the life of the cell.Some idea can be gathered from this as to the microcosmic process, for theindividualization of the units is brought about through a macrocosmic happeningwhich produces effects in the microcosm.A final point here needs emphasising. Occultly understood, the five Kumaras orthe five Mind-born Sons of Brahma are the embodiers of this manasic force on[703] our planet; but They only reflect (in the Hierarchy of our planet) thefunction of the five Kumaras or Rishis who are the Lords of the five Raysmanifesting through the four lesser planets and the synthesising planet.These five Kumaras are the channels for this force and one of Them, the Lord ofthe planet Venus, embodies in Himself the function of the fifth Hierarchy. Thisaccounts for the activity of Venus at the moment of individualisation in thisround. In the next round, this fifth Hierarchy will be utilising our Earthscheme in this way, and we shall then see manas in full fruition working out inthe human family. This fifth Hierarchy of Agnishvattas in their many gradesembody the “I principle” and are the producers of self-consciousness, and thebuilders of man’s body of realisation. In time and space, and on the mentalplane, they are Man himself in essential essence; they enable him to build hisown body of causes, to unfold his own egoic lotus, and gradually to free himselffrom the limitations of the form which he has constructed, and thus to puthimself—in due course of time—into the line of another type of energy, that ofbuddhi. To word it otherwise, through Their work man can become consciouswithout the manasic vehicle, for manas is but the form through which a higherprinciple is making itself known. The life of God comes cyclically under theinfluence of the different Hierarchies or forces, all of which temporarily buildfor it a vehicle, pass it through their substance, give to it in this way acertain quality or colouring, and increase thereby its vibratory capacity untileventually the life is set free from hierarchical limitation. It then returns toits eternal Source plus the gain of its experiences and with the increasedenergy which is the result of its various transitions.Let us bear carefully in mind, that the Rays are the positive aspect inmanifestation and pass down into [704] negative matter, deva or hierarchicalsubstance, thus causing certain evidences of activity. The Hierarchies are thenegative aspect as far as the Rays are concerned and are responsive to Rayimpulse. But within each Ray and each Hierarchy in this system a dual forceagain will be found. The Sons of God are bisexual. The deva substance is alsodual, for the evolutionary devas are the positive energy of the atom, cell orsubhuman form, for instance, while the electrons or lesser lives within the formare negative.The mystery of the Manasaputras is hidden in this, and in the function of thefifth Hierarchy, and it is not possible to reveal more of it. The secret ofBuddhi, the sixth or Christ principle, which concerns these Sons of God, and thesecret of the fifth Hierarchy which is the vehicle or recipient of buddhi,cannot be mentioned outside initiated circles. It holds hid the possibility ofegoic unfoldment, and keeps secret the karma of the Heavenly Men, the fiveKumaras.The fifth principle of manas is embodied in the five Kumaras, and if the studentstudies the significance of the first five petals which are unfolded in theegoic lotus, he may touch upon the fringe of the mystery. The fifth Ray, whichis the Ray of the fifth Kumara, is potently responsive to the energy flowingthrough the fifth Hierarchy. As the student of occultism knows, the Lord of thefifth Ray holds that place in the Septenary enumeration, but under the fivefoldclassification, he holds the third or middle place.1. The cosmic Lord of Will or Power. 2. The cosmic Lord of Love-Wisdom. 3. Thecosmic Lord of Active Intelligence 1. 4. The cosmic Lord of Harmony 2. 5. Thecosmic Lord of Concrete Knowledge 3. 6. The cosmic Lord of Abstract Idealism 4.7. The cosmic Lord of Ceremonial Magic 5.[705] This should be pondered on, and His close connection therefore, as atransmitter of force within the Moon chain, the third chain, in connection withthe third kingdom, the animal, and with the third round, must be borne in mind.One symbol that may be found in the archaic records in lieu of His Name ordescription is an inverted five-pointed star, with the luminous Triangle at thecentre. It will be noted that the points involved in this symbol number eight—apicture of that peculiar state of consciousness brought about when the mind isseen to be the slayer of the Real. The secret of planetary avitchi ( 235[text00028.html#Y_FN235] ) is hidden here, just as the third major scheme can beviewed as systemic avitchi, and the moon at one time held an analogous positionin connection with our scheme. This must be interpreted in terms ofconsciousness, and not of locality.In the fifth round, at its middle point, certain things will eventuate.The fifth Hierarchy will rise to its full power. This will precede the JudgmentDay, and will mark a point of tremendous struggle, for the manasic vehicle“manas” (which they embody) will rebel against the translation of the lifewithin (the buddhi). There will, therefore, be seen on a racial scale andinvolving millions simultaneously, a repetition of the self-same struggle whichembroils the man who seeks to transcend mind and to live the life of Spirit.This will be the final Armageddon, the planetary kurukshetra, and will besucceeded by the Judgment Day when the Sons of Manas will be cast out and theDragons of Wisdom rule. This only means that those in whom the manasic principleis over-potent or under-developed will be considered as failures and will [706]have to wait for a more suitable period for development, while those who areliving the buddhic life, and in whom it is waxing stronger—spiritual men,aspirants, disciples of various degrees, initiates and adepts—will be left topursue the natural course of evolution on this scheme.The mystery of Capricorn is hidden in these five and in the Biblical words “thesheep and the goats.” (Bible. Rev., 20:6-7. Matt., 25:32.) The Christian hintsat this when he speaks of the Christ reigning on earth a thousand years duringwhich the serpent is imprisoned. The Christ principle will triumph for theremainder of the manvantara, and the lower material nature and mind will be heldin abeyance until the next round, when fresh opportunity will arise for certaingroups of the discarded, though the majority will be held over until anothersystem. Something similar again will take place on the fifth chain but as itconcerns a centre in the planetary Logos of which we know but little, we neednot here enlarge upon it.The planetary chains embody centres, and as they are awakened and come understimulation, they swing into physical incarnation certain types of manasaputras.The type dominated by the fifth chain energy is little known as it is yet inprocess of evolution within another scheme, the fifth, so it is waste of ourtime to consider it. It is connected with the unfoldment of the fifth egoicpetal of a planetary Logos on His Own plane and consequently with the activityof the fifth spirilla. When the hour strikes, these units of energy will “comein” from another scheme on a stream of cosmic energy which will swing through aparticular systemic triangle, just as when the egos came in this round.It might here be pointed out that the solar Angels concerned with the fifthHierarchy are naturally a potent factor in the evolution of the fifth orspiritual kingdom; they are that which make it possible, for they not only [707]bridge the gap between the fourth and third kingdoms, but bridge that foundbetween the fourth and fifth.We need not consider any further this question of the fifth principle, for tworeasons:First, that the subject has been sufficiently covered for our purpose in anearlier section, and secondly, that the full revelation in connection withcosmic manas and the entities who come in on that influence may not further berevealed at this moment. That which is given in the Secret Doctrine , andsupplemented here by further details, will suffice for the investigations ofstudents for another generation. Each generation should produce those able toascertain subjective fact for themselves; they will utilize that which isexoteric and known as stepping stones on the path to perfect knowledge. Theywill know, and they will give out, and only the next cycle of fifty years aftertheir work is accomplished will see the recognition by the many of the truthrevealed by the few. In the case of H. P. B. this is apparent. On the tide ofthe present endeavour, the Secret Doctrine will be vindicated and her workjustified.b. On Individualisation.(a.) The Work of the Solar Angels . Let us briefly consider the generalconstruction of the body of the Ego enumerating its component parts and bearingin mind that the form is ever prepared prior to occupancy. From the study ofthis body, we can get some idea of, and some light upon macrocosmicIndividualisation.The causal body, called sometimes (though inaccurately) the “karana sarira,” hasits place on the third subplane of the mental plane, the lowest abstract plane,and the one whereon the Ray of the third Logos provides the necessary “light forconstruction.” (This is because each subplane comes specially under theinfluence of its Number, Name, or Lord.) When the hour [708] strikes and thevehicles for buddhi are to be co-ordinated certain great Beings, Lords of theFlame, or Manasadevas, through driving external force, come in conjunction withthe material of that subplane, and vitalise it with Their Own energy. They forma new and positive impulse which co-ordinates the material of the plane andproduces a temporary balancing of forces. Hence the meaning of the “white,” ortransparent condition of the new causal body. It remains with the new-born egofirst to upset the equilibrium, and then to regain it, at the close of theprocess, producing a radiant form, full of primal colours.At the coming in of the Manasadevas to produce self-consciousness and to bringabout the incarnation of the divine Egos, four things occur on that plane. Ifthe student adds to these four those which have been already imparted in variousoccult books anent the effect of individualisation on animal man and hisappearance as a self-conscious identity on the physical plane, a workinghypothesis is provided whereby man can scientifically undertake his ownunfoldment. These four are given in the order of their appearance in time andspace:First . There appear upon the third subplane of the mental plane certainvibratory impulses—nine in number—corresponding to the fivefold vibration ofthese Manasadevas in conjunction with the fourfold vibration set up from belowand inherent in the matter of this subplane, the fifth from the lowerstandpoint. This produces “the ninefold egoic lotus,” which is at this stagetightly closed, the nine petals folded one upon the other. They are vibrant, andscintillating “light” but not of excessive brightness. These “lotus buds” are ingroups, according to the influence of the particular ones of the fivefoldDhyanis Who are acting upon it and Who form it out of Their own substance,colouring it faintly with the “fire of manas.”[709] Second. There appears a triangle on the mental plane, produced by manasicactivity, and this triangle of fire begins slowly to circulate between themanasic permanent atom, and a point at the centre of the egoic lotus, and thenceto the mental unit, which has appeared upon the fourth subplane through innateinstinct approximating mentality. This triangle of fire, which is formed of pureelectrical manasic force, waxes ever brighter until it produces an answeringvibration from both the lower and the higher. This triangle is the nucleus ofthe antaskarana. The work of the highly evolved man is to reduce this triangleto a unity, and by means of high aspiration (which is simply transmuted desireaffecting mental matter) turn it into the Path and thus reproduce in a highersynthetic form the earlier “path” along which the descending Spirit came to takepossession of its vehicle, the causal body, and from thence again work throughthe lower personal self.Third. At a certain stage of vibratory activity, the work of the Lords of theFlame having produced a body or form and a vibration calling for response, thereoccurs a practically simultaneous happening.A downflow of buddhi takes place along the line of the manasic triangle until itreaches a point at the very centre of the lotus. There, by the power of its ownvibration, it causes a change in the appearance of the lotus. At the very heartof the lotus, three more petals appear which close in on the central flame,covering it closely, and remaining closed until the time comes for therevelation of the “jewel in the Lotus.” The egoic lotus is now composed oftwelve petals, nine of these appear at this stage in bud form and three arecompletely hidden and mysterious.At the same time, the three permanent atoms are enclosed within the lotus, andare seen by the clairvoyant as three points of light in the lower part of thebud, beneath [710] the central portion. They form at this stage a dimly burningtriangle. The causal body, though only in an embryonic condition, is now readyfor full activity as the eons slip away, and is complete in all its threefoldnature. The matter aspect , which concerns the material form of the man in thethree worlds, or his active intelligent personal self call be developed andcontrolled through the medium of the mental unit, the astral permanent atom andthe physical permanent atom. The Spirit aspect lies concealed at the heart ofthe lotus, in due course of time to stand revealed when the manasadevas havedone their work. The will that persists forever is there. The consciousnessaspect embodying the love-wisdom of the divine Ego as it reveals itself by themeans of mind is predominantly there, and in the nine petals and their vibratorycapacity lies hid all opportunity, all innate capacity to progress, and all theability to function as a self-conscious unit, that entity we call Man. ( 237[text00028.html#Y_FN237] ) Mahadeva sits at the heart, Surya or Vishnu revealsHim in His essence as the Wisdom of Love and the Love of Wisdom, and Brahma, theCreative Logos makes that revelation possible. The Father in [711] Heaven is tobe revealed through the Christ, the Son, by the method of incarnation madepossible through the work of the Holy Spirit. All this has been brought about bythe sacrifice and instrumentality of certain cosmic entities who “offerThemselves” up in order that Man may be. From their very essence, they give outthat which is needed to produce the individualising principle, and that which wecall “self-consciousness,” and thus enable the divine Spirit to enter intofuller life by means of limitation by form, by means of the lessons garneredthrough a long pilgrimage, and through the “assimilation of manifoldexistences.”The fourth point to be noted is that when these three events have occurred, thelight or fire that circulates along the manasic triangle is withdrawn to thecentre of the lotus, and this “prototype” of the future antaskarana, if so itmay be expressed, disappears. The threefold energy of the petals, the atoms andthe “jewel” is now centralised, because impulse must now be generated which willproduce a downflow of energy from the newly made causal vehicle into the threeworlds of human endeavour.We have dealt with the method of individualisation through the coming in of theLords of the Flame because it is the prime method in this solar system; whatevermethods may be pursued in the varying schemes and chains, this—at the middlestage—is the universal rule. Karmic conditions having to do with a planetaryLogos may effect modifications, and bring into action manasadevas whose activitymay not be the same in working detail, but the results are ever similar, and thedivine Egos in their causal bodies have analogous instruments to workthrough....A final point which is of profound significance is that the Agnishvattasconstruct the petals out of Their Own substance, which is substance energised bythe principle [712] of “I-ness,” or ahamkara. They proceed to energise thepermanent atoms with Their own positive force, so as to bring the fifth spirillain due course of time into full activity and usefulness. All possibility, allhopefulness and optimism, and all future success lies hid in these two points.As we have seen, the work of the Agnishvattas on the mental plane resulted in adownflow of force or energy from the Monad (or Spirit) and this, in conjunctionwith the energy of the lower quaternary produced the appearance of the body ofthe Ego on the mental plane. In ordinary electric light, we have a faintillustration of the thought I seek to convey. By the approximation of the twopolarities, light is created. By an analogous type of electrical phenomena, thelight of the Monad shines forth, but we have to extend the idea to the subtlerplanes, and deal with seven types of force or energy in connection with the onepolarity and with four in connection with the other. A scientific formula forthe process of individualisation conveys this dual approximation with itsdiffering types of energy in one symbol and a number, but it cannot here berevealed.The Manasadevas are themselves energised by force from the cosmic mental plane—aforce which has been in operation ever since the individualisation of the solarLogos in kalpas far distant. They, in Their corporate nature, embody the will orpurpose of the Logos, and are the cosmic “prototypes” of our solar Angels. Thesolar Angels on the mental plane of the system embody as much of that will andpurpose as the Logos can work through in one single incarnation and as They, inTheir groups, can develop. They work, therefore, through egoic groups andprimarily, after individualisation, upon the mental units of the separatedidentities who go to the constituency of the groups. This is Their secondarywork. Their work in part might be described as follows:[713] Primarily, they bring about the union of the divine Ego and the lowerpersonal self. This has been dealt with.Secondly, they work through the mental units, impressing upon the atom thatportion, microscopic as it may be, of the logoic purpose which the individualcan work out on the physical plane. At first their influence is unconsciouslyassimilated, and the man responds to the plan blindly and ignorantly. Later, asevolution proceeds, their work is recognised by the man in a consciousco-operation with the plan of evolution. (238 [text00028.html#Y_FN238] ) Afterthe third initiation, the will or purpose aspect predominates.It might here be noted that it is the positive force of the Manasadevas thatproduces initiation. Their function is embodied by the Hierophant. He, seeingbefore Him the vehicle for buddhi, passes the voltage from the higher planesthrough His body, and by means of the Rod (charged with positive manasic force)transmits this higher manasic energy to the initiate so that he is enabled toknow consciously and to recognise the plan for his group-centre through theimmensely increased stimulation. This force descends from the manasic permanentatom via the antaskarana and is directed to whichever centre theHierophant—under the Law—sees should be stimulated. He stabilises the force, andregulates its flow as it circulates throughout the egoic Lotus, so that when thework of unfoldment is accomplished the sixth principle at the Heart of the Lotuscan stand revealed. After each initiation the Lotus is more unfolded [714] andlight from the centre begins to blaze forth—a light or fire which ultimatelyburns through the three enshrining petals, and permits the full inner glory tobe seen, and the electric fire of spirit to be manifested. As this is broughtabout on the second subplane of the mental plane (whereon the egoic lotus is nowsituated) a corresponding stimulation takes place in the dense substance whichforms the petals or wheels of the centres on the astral and etheric levels.(b.) Individualisation and the races. If this treatise serves no other purposethan to direct the attention of the scientific and philosophic students to thestudy of force or energy in man and in groups, and to interpret man and thehuman family in terms of electrical phenomena, much good will have beenaccomplished. The polarity of a man, of a group, and of a congery of groups, thepolarity of the planets and their relationship to each other and to the Sun, thepolarity of the solar system and its relationship to other systems, the polarityof one plane to another, and of one principle to another, the polarity of thesubtler vehicles, and the scientific application of the laws of electricity tothe totality of existence on the physical plane will bring about a revolutionupon the planet second only to that effected at the time of individualisation. Iwould point out here a certain significant fact which students will do wellcarefully to consider.In the third rootrace ( 239 [text00028.html#Y_FN239] ) individualisation tookplace. It was an event which became possible through certain conditions andpolar relationships, and because the scientific laws were understood and theKnowers took [715] advantage of a peculiar electrical condition to hasten theevolution of the race. It was electrical phenomena of a stupendous kind, andproduced the “lights which ever burn.” It was the result of the knowledge ofnatural law and its adaptation to opportunity.In the fourth rootrace another adaptation of force occurred. Again time andopportunity were taken advantage of to open the door into the fifth kingdom bythe method of forced initiation. A third type of electricity played its part inbringing about this event, and it is the effect of this electrical phenomenonupon the units (who are themselves centres of energy) which—scientificallyviewed—indicates a man’s suitability for the ceremony of initiation, and hisavailability as a transmitter of spiritual energy to the world. Every initiateis technically a transmitter of force and his work is consequently threefold:1. To provide a threefold vehicle capable of the necessary resistance to theforce and able to receive and hold it.2. To transmit it as energy to the world which he serves.3. To store up a certain amount of it for a twofold purpose:a. To provide a reservoir of force for emergencies and for special work asrequired by the Great Ones.b. To act as a dynamo for the immediate group which all advanced souls,disciples and initiates gather around them on some one or other of the planes inthe three worlds.In the fifth rootrace, another tremendous happening may be looked for, and thetime lies immediately ahead. It had its beginning in the energy which eventuallyculminated in the world war. The first effect of the appearance of freshelectrical stimulation from extra-systemic [716] centres, is ever to bring abouta primary destruction leading on to revelation. That which is imprisoned must beloosed. So it will be in this rootrace, the fifth. Certain cosmic forces are atwork and the full effect of their energy is not yet apparent. This incomingforce, the Hierarchy will avail itself of in order to push forward the planetaryplans. In every case the effect of the phenomenon is felt in some one or otherof the kingdoms beside the human. In the individualisation period, it isapparent that a tremendous stimulation took place in the animal kingdom —astimulation which has persisted, and which has led to the phenomenon of“domestic animals” as we call them, and their relatively high stage ofintelligence as compared to the wild animals. In Atlantean days the opening ofthe door into the fifth kingdom, or into the stage of buddhic consciousness, hada profound effect upon the vegetable kingdom . This effect can be seen workingout in such results as are achieved by Burbank, and which are of a naturecorresponding to the initiatory process in man, involving a rapid achievement ofrelative perfection.In the tremendous event which is impending, in the great revelation which isnear at hand, the Hierarchy will again take advantage of the time and the energyto bring about certain events which will work out primarily in the human kingdombut which will also be seen as force regeneration in the mineral kingdom. Theenergy, when first felt in the human kingdom, brought about the conditions whichcaused the tremendous activity which resulted in war, and which is causing thepresent world stress; in the mineral kingdom it affected certain of the mineralsand elements, and the radioactive substances made their appearance. Thischaracteristic (or radioactivity) of pitchblende and the other involved units iscomparatively a new development under the evolutionary law, and one which,though latent, only [717] needed the drawing forth of the type of energy nowbeginning to pour in on the earth. This force began to flow in at the end of theeighteenth century, and its full effect is by no means yet felt, for it will beseveral hundred years before it passes away. By means of it, certain discoveriesare possible, and the new order comes in upon it. The Great Ones, Who know thetime and the hour, will bring about, in our rootrace, that which corresponds tothe occurrences in the earlier third and fourth races.(c.) Methods of Individualisation. We have seen how the characteristic method ofindividualisation in this solar system is the result of force emanating from thecosmic mental plane, which sweeps into activity those entities whose function itis to form the body of the ego out of their own living substance on the mentalplane and thus, through their own quality and nature, endow human units on thephysical plane with the faculty of self-consciousness, thus producing Man. It istheir work also to energise the mental units of all men, and to co-ordinate, bymeans of the force which they embody, and to energise the sheaths of thethreefold lower man, so that they may in due course of time intelligentlyexpress the will and purpose of the indwelling Thinker. Through the carrying outof this function in the case of the human family, certain planetary and systemicconditions are brought about. The dense and etheric bodies of the Logos and ofthe planetary Logoi are merged, and one coherent vehicle of expression isprovided for these cosmic Entities.In the producing of self-consciousness in the human family, the full consciousoccupation by the Logos involved is consummated. It is the moment of fruition,and (from a certain esoteric standpoint) marks the attainment of one perfectedSeptenary. The three involutionary or elemental kingdoms and the three sub-human[718] kingdoms find their seventh principle in the fourth kingdom in nature, 3 +4 = 7. When the life of God has circled through these seven kingdoms, then fullself-consciousness is achieved from a certain relative standpoint, and the Sonis on the way to attainment. This relative perfection has then to be carried onto other stages, but they are stages in which the separated self-consciousnessof the Identities concerned (whether human or planetary) must eventually mergeitself in universal consciousness.Certain centres in the bodies logoic and planetary are also stimulated and theRays (if it might be so expressed) become radioactive. It is this radiationwhich will eventually bring about conscious group activity, which will lead tointeraction between the planets, and which, under the Law of Attraction andRepulsion, will bring about eventual synthesis.On extra-systemic or cosmic levels, the individualisation process produces acorresponding activity in the egoic body of the Logos, and hence increasedvibration in that centre in the body of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NOUGHT MAY BE SAID,which our Logos represents. It also produces a reaction or “occult recognition”in the prototype of the Septenate, or in the seven Rishis of the Great Bear, andthis reaction in cosmic circles will persist until the end of themahamanvantara, when the Logos is set free (even though temporarily), fromphysical plane existence.It also brings about a setting loose of force from the cosmic mental plane whichis cyclic in character. In this round, the fourth, the maximum force of thiscycle was felt in the third root race. In the next round, during the fourth rootrace, and for a very brief period, a fresh cycle will reach its zenith, and willagain open the door of individualisation in order to permit the entry of certainvery advanced Egos who are seeking [719] incarnation in order to carry out aspecial piece of work. This round will provide no bodies adequate to their need.The next round may do so if the plans proceed as anticipated. In this case theManasadevas concerned will not individualise animal men as in the previousround, but will stimulate the mental germ in those members of the present humanfamily who—as H. P. B. says—though apparently men, are without the spark ofmind. ( 240 [text00028.html#Y_FN240] ) During the next seven hundred years,these low aboriginal races will practically die out and will not—in thisround—reincarnate. They will be rejected. In the next round opportunity willagain occur, and the Manasadevas will again renew their work of formingindividualistic nuclei for the development of self-consciousness. The Egosawaiting opportunity will not, of course, enter in until the human type of thatera is sufficiently refined for their purpose. They are concerned with theunfoldment of the sixth petal of the logoic egoic Lotus, and are of such anature that we can scarcely conceive of them. They are on the line of theBuddhas of Activity, but the above named are free for this mahamanvantara,whereas these particular Egos have yet somewhat to work out. They could only“come in” in the middle of the fifth round, and were a group of initiates whoarrested their own evolution (technically speaking) in order to take up aspecial piece of work on the planet Vulcan; therefore, they must return tocontinue and complete that which has been left undone. Owing to the results oftheir experience on Vulcan, the physical vehicle necessitated is of such anorder that they could not at this time, and in this round, incarnate withoutdisaster.Individualisation in the next round will begin to show indications of the thirdmethod,—that of the next system. [720] This method has been described as that of“occult abstraction.” It will concern itself with the withdrawal from out of thelowest type of the then existing men (through knowledge of the ethericconstitution of the body) of the vitality latent in it, and a temporary turningof that latent fire to the increase of the activity of the germ or spark ofmind; this will be effected by a dynamic action of the will. This seemsimpossible, and well nigh senseless phraseology when considered in terms ofconsciousness and of spirituality, but let the student study the phenomenon interms of the cosmic physical plane, and from the standpoint of the gaseous andetheric subplanes, and he will see that in all these septenary fires it is everthe fire of matter in reality, and these sevenfold diversifications ofelectrical phenomena can ever affect each other.Thus, in the mahamanvantara, the three methods of individualisation inconnection with our planetary scheme are to be seena. In the Moon chain, the gradual evolution of self-consciousness under naturallaw.b. In the Earth chain that of achieved self-consciousness through the aid ofextraneous agencies. It is the distinctive method of this system.c. In the next round and chain the method will be abstraction through willpower, but this in an embryonic manner.I have dealt with these three from the standpoint of our own scheme. In all theschemes whereon man is found at some period or another, these three methods willbe contacted. They mark the gradual control by the Logos on cosmic levels of Histhreefold lower nature. In the first, the correspondence lies in the latentconsciousness of matter, and works under the Law of Economy. It concernsprimarily the Self-consciousness of the Logos [721] in His dense physical body,and His polarisation therein. It is likewise the same for a Heavenly Man, and apart of the mystery of evil is to be found in the readiness of certain of thesecosmic entities (particularly our planetary Logos in the moon chain) to remainpolarised in the physical etheric body after having supposedly dominated thematerial aspect, or gained the control of the third Fire in an earlier system. Ahint lies here for the wise student anent present evil on this planet.The second correspondence concerns the latent “consciousness of desire,” andworks under the Law of Attraction; it is the law for this system, and deals withthe ability of the Logos to “love wisely,” in the occult sense of the term. Ithas relation to the polarisation of the Logos in His astral body, and producesthe phenomenon called “sex activity” on all planes in the system. In the earliersystem, emancipation was effected through the faculty of discrimination, thoughthat word as used to-day is but a faint indication of the systemic process inthose days. Through the force engendered during the process that vibration wasset up which persists to-day in matter. It is evidenced by the activeintelligence and the discriminative selective capacity of the atom of substance.In this system emancipation will be brought about through the line of occultdispassion ; this likewise will leave its mark upon matter, tinging it in such away that in the third system, primordial substance will demonstrate a secondquality. In the next system “non-attachment through abstraction” is as near aswe can get to the method of the liberating process but it is useless for man tospeculate upon this as his mind cannot conceive of the condition.(d.) Avatars, Their nature and Their Work . We have, in our discussion above,connected the phenomenon of individualisation with the appropriation by theLogos, or by a planetary Logos, of Their dense physical vehicles, [722] andTheir self-conscious existence through the medium of the physical body. A verydifficult and mysterious subject might be touched upon here,—that of AVATARS,and though it will not be possible for us to expound it fully, as it is one ofthe most occult and secret of the mysteries, perhaps a little light may bethrown upon this profound subject. For purposes of clarity and in order toelucidate a matter of extreme difficulty to the occidental mind above all (onaccount of the fact that it has not yet grasped the rationale of the process ofreincarnation), it would be wise to divide the differing types of avatars intofive groups, bearing in mind that every avatar is a Ray, emanated from a purespiritual source, and that a self-conscious entity only earns the right to thispeculiar form of work through a previous series of lives of achievement.1. Cosmic Avatars.2. Solar Avatars.3. Inter-planetary Avatars.4. Planetary Avatars.5. Human Avatars.As just said, an avatar is a Ray of effulgent and perfected glory, clothingitself in matter for the purpose of service. All avatars in the strict sense ofthe word are liberated souls, but the cosmic and solar avatars are liberatedfrom the two lower planes of the cosmic planes. While the planetary and theinterplanetary avatars are liberated from the cosmic physical plane, oursystemic planes, the human avatar has achieved freedom from the five planes ofhuman endeavour. In a strictly technical and lower sense, a Master in physicalplane incarnation is a type of avatar, for He is a “freed soul” and thereforeonly chooses to incarnate for specific purpose, but we [723] will not deal withThem. Let us again subdivide these groups so as still further to clarify ourideas:1. Cosmic Avatars: They represent embodied force from the following cosmiccentres among others:a . Sirius.b. That one of the seven stars of the Great Bear which is ensouled by theprototype of the Lord of our third major Ray.c. Our cosmic centre.They represent entities as far removed from the consciousness of Man, as man isfrom the consciousness of the atom of substance. Thousands of those great cycleswhich we call “a hundred years of Brahma” have passed since They approximatedthe human stage, and They embody force and consciousness which is concerned withthe intelligent co-ordination of the starry Heavens.They have achieved all that man can conceive of as the transcendence of will, oflove and of intelligence, and in the synthesis of those three have addedqualities and vibrations for which we have no terms, and which cannot bevisioned by even our highest adepts. Their appearance in a solar system is veryunusual, and is only recognised on the highest two planes. Yet, owing to thematerial nature of our solar system, Their advent is literally the appearance ina physical form of a spiritual Being Who is fully conscious.Such entities from Sirius appear at the occasion of the initiation of the solarLogos, and They have a peculiar connection with the five Kumaras and throughThem (using Them as focal points for force) with the Mahachohan’s department inall the occult Hierarchies of the system. Only once has such a Being visited oursystem, in connection with the appearance in time and space of the fivemind-born Sons of Brahma. The effect of such a visit as that of the Avatar fromSirius is seen [724] as the sumtotal of civilisation and culture, viewing thesefrom the standpoint of the entire system and in one flash of time.An avatar from the cosmic centre will appear as pralaya is nearing and willproduce in the body of the Logos that which we call “Death.” He is the cosmicReaper, and (to reduce the above to words of an understandable nature) Hebelongs to a group which represents the abstracting energy of the cosmos, ofwhich we find faint correspondences in the work of the “destroyer” aspect of theLogos, and in the forces which produce physical death, and the disintegration ofthe physical body of man. It is not possible to say more on these fundamentallyesoteric matters, and the value of what is said lies largely in the bringing tothe mind of the student the reality of our cosmic interrelation.2. Solar Avatars: These avatars are of three types though there are really manymore. They are also extra-systemic visitors, and are mainly concerned withcertain processes in the system, among others the administration of the law ofcause and effect, or of karma. They embody the karma of the past kalpas as faras our Logos is concerned, and give the initiatory impulse to the processes ofadjustment, of expiation and of recognition as it concerns the present system asa whole. One such Entity, the “Karmic Avatar” appeared upon the second logoicvibration, being swept in on the second Breath; He has stayed until now: He willremain with us until all the schemes have entered upon their fifth round, andare nearing their “Judgment Day.” At that time, He can withdraw, leaving theplanetary Logoi concerned to fulfil the karmic purpose unwatched. The vibratoryimpulse will then be so strong and the realisation of the buddhic principle soconsciously vivid that nothing can then arrest the onward march of affairs.Under Him work a number of cosmic entities who, as stated in the Secret [725]Doctrine , ( 241 [text00028.html#Y_FN241] ) have the privilege of “passing thering-pass-not”; these are, nevertheless, not avatars for They are Themselvesevolving through the administration of karma. It is Their work, and opportunityto progress. An avatar can learn nothing from the place of His appearance. Hiswork is to apply the force of some type of electrical energy to substance in oneof its many grades, and thus bring about anticipated results.Another type of solar avatar, Who can be seen appearing in the schemes, hasrelation to the heart centre of a planetary Logos, and appears on the higherplanes (never on the lower) when the heart activity is making itself felt, andwhen the energising process is seen to bring about three things:a. An expansion of consciousness.b. An increase of spiritual light and brilliancy.c. Planetary radioactivity.It is this planetary phenomenon which produces (in connection with the fourthkingdom in nature) the throwing open of the door of initiation to man. Suchavatars do not come in connection with any particular Hierarchy but only inrelation to the total system. They produce the blending of the colours, and thesynthesis of the units in their groups.At the initiation of a planetary Logos, an avatar may appear in His scheme onthe seventh globe from that cosmic centre or star which is ensouled by theparticular Rishi Who (in the constellation of the Great Bear) is His cosmicprototype. This is, for the Entity concerned, the taking of a physical form, forour higher planes are but matter from Their standpoint. This has been emphasisedfrequently, as its significance is not yet sufficiently grasped. By means of theappearance of this Avatar on the seventh globe, the planetary Logos is [726]enabled to preserve continuity of cosmic consciousness even when in physicalincarnation; this solar avatar performs the same function for the planetaryLogos as the Guru does for His disciple. He makes certain events possible bymeans of the stimulation and protection of His aura, and He acts as atransmitter of electrical energy from the cosmic centre. We must be careful tohold this analogy very lightly, for the real work accomplished cannot be graspedby man. This avatar has naturally a direct effect upon the centres of theHeavenly Man and therefore upon the units or human Monads, but only indirectlyand upon the Monad on its own plane. This influence meets with little responsefrom the Monad until after the third Initiation when its conscious life becomesso strong that it grips afresh its egoic expression in one direction, andawakens to planetary realisation in another. This type of avatar appears only atthe time of the initiation of a planetary Logos. The number of initiations takenby a planetary Logos in this system vary from two to four.3. Interplanetary Avatars. A very interesting group of avatars is here to befound. They are mainly concerned with three things: first with thesuperintendence of the transfer of force units or egoic groups from one schemeto another (not with individual units from chain to chain). They appear usuallytwice in the history of a scheme, and though unable to take physical bodies ofgrosser material than those formed of atmic and the buddhic substance, they workwith impulse in mental matter and thus effect these group transfers. TheyThemselves are subdivided into three groups:a. Those effecting the transfer from the minor schemes or Ray manifestations onto the third Ray; They concern Themselves with the result of the merging of thepolar opposites in the four [727] lesser schemes until but one is left; and thenwith the transference of the life and quality of this remaining one on to thethird Ray.b. Those dealing with the transference and interaction of the life forcesbetween the three major Rays.c. Those producing the final systemic transfer at the end of the age.Secondly, certain avatars from the fourth Creative Hierarchy, for esoteric andfor us inexplicable reasons, leave Their Own Hierarchy, and appear in one orother of the deva Hierarchies. This happens only once in the history of eachscheme and occurs at the time of its densest physical appearance, and hasrelation to the transference of deva impulse from one scheme to another. Theyare connected in this way with the appearance of the self-conscious units, beingthe primal embodiment of the latent self-consciousness of the atom of devasubstance. They set the type for the devas of any particular scheme.Once in the history of each scheme, an avatar from the constellation Capricornappears on mental levels. This level is the lowest one on which theseinterplanetary deities appear. No more can be communicated on this matter. “Themystery of the goat” lies hidden here. This avatar makes His appearance in thethird round of the third chain, and disappears in the fifth round of the fourthchain.These interplanetary avatars come in, as the products of much earlier kalpaswhen systemic conditions are refined enough to permit of Their appearance. Theyare the nirmanakayas of an earlier solar cycle Who now again take theopportunity to effect (in an active sense and through physical manifestation)certain uncompleted work.4. Planetary Avatars. These emanate from the central [728] planetary Logos of ascheme and embody His will and purpose. They are of two different kinds. Thefirst type is a manifestation on etheric physical levels of the planetary LogosHimself for a specific length of time. It involves the definite taking of aphysical body by one of the Kumaras. Such an avatar is to be seen in SanatKumara, Who, with the three other Kumaras, embodies the four planetary quaternicprinciples. In a very real sense, Sanat Kumara is the incarnation of the Lord ofthe Ray Himself; He is the Silent Watcher, the great Sacrifice for humanity. (S.D., I, 494; II, 112, 149, 333.)As noted in the above paragraph, there are secondly three Entities Who embodyplanetary principles. They are (speaking from the present standpoint) thedynamic energy which holds together the three lower kingdoms, viewing thesekingdoms as units and not as differentiations. They are closely connected withthe energy aspect of the three earlier chains, and it only needed the work of aninterplanetary avatar (at the formation of the triangle which resulted in theindividualisation period in Lemurian days) to enable Them to take etheric bodiesand incarnate among men. They act as focal points for the energy of theplanetary Logos on His own plane. The first Kumara is in a mysterious sense theenergy which produces self-consciousness in the human family. The three otherkumaras, or the three Buddhas of Activity, act as similar focal points for theenergy which animates the three lower kingdoms, and which produces theirdiffering grades of consciousness. It is not possible to express this greatmystery more clearly but if the student couples these few hints with thoseearlier given in the Secret Doctrine, the mystery of the “Holy Four” may besomewhat clarified from the standpoint of energy and evolution.The times and seasons of their appearing vary according [729] to the particularkarma of the Lord of the Ray, and nothing in connection with these great cycles,and incarnation periods, can be revealed to the unpledged and the profane.5. Human Avatars. These are fully dealt with by H. P. B. and there is nothingfurther to add to her information, for the time is not ripe. (S. D., III,Section 41; III, 345.) All the above has its place here, as it concerns themystery of force and consciousness, and the fullest manifestation of a planetaryLogos and of a solar Logos in a dense physical body is hidden in the appearanceof these various avatars and in their effect.(e.) Individualisation, a form of Initiation . There is but little more that canbe said at this time anent individualisation. What has been said here and in theSecret Doctrine is but a manner of endeavouring to express profound andsignificant facts, concerning existence and manifestation, in terms of humanthought, and through the limiting medium of language. From the most esotericstandpoint “Man is a deva;” he is Spirit and deva substance, united through thework of conscious deva energy. He unites within himself the three aspects of theDeity. He is, while in objectivity:1. The Self, the Not-Self, and the intelligent link in a very vital sense.2. He is Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma, in synthetic manifestation.3. He is the medium whereby the Will of God, the Love of God, and the Mind ofGod become intelligible and apparent.4. He is positive electrical force, plus negative electrical force, plus theequilibrising medium.5. He is the Flame, the Fire, and the Spark in essential manifestation.6. He is electric fire, solar fire and fire by friction.[730] But the point which it is necessary here to emphasise, is that man doesnot, in space and time and in the three worlds, demonstrate all these aspectssimultaneously, but only simultaneously towards the close of the process ofevolution. As in the Macrocosm, Brahma manifests activity first, then the secondor middle aspect and finally the first or purposeful will makes itself seen, sowith the microcosm.The Brahma aspect , that in which the Not-Self or material aspect is apparentand predominant. This covers the sub-human stages, and the first three cycles ofthe Personality Life:a. First cycle savage state. b. Second cycle average man. c. Third cycleintellectual successful man.The Vishnu aspect , that in which the love-wisdom aspect gradually predominatesand emerges through the medium of the Brahma aspect. It covers the final twostages of the human personality life, and that period of egoic growth whichembraces the final two Initiations:a. First cycle The Path of Probation. b. Second cycle The Path ofInitiation.(till the third Initiation) c. Third cycle That covering the fourthand fifth Initiations.This is the temporary consummation, but just as in the animal kingdom, the humanmind was latent and instinctive, and just as in the human kingdom the buddhicaspect is latent and instinctive, so during the final cycle of human endeavour,the Atma, or highest aspect of the Monad, is also latent and instinctive. Thismust produce later stages of development. There are no gaps in evolution, and noperiods wherein there is total absence of any one aspect; all are ever presentbut they [731] “show forth” in alternation. Only when the fires of matter areblazing brightly, and become radiatory, does it become possible for the fire ofmind to show forth, even though ever inherently present. Only when these twofires of matter and of mind have reached a stage of energetic heat and light,can the electric fire of Spirit show forth in its glory. Only again when thesethree are unitedly burning does the fire of matter die down for lack of thatwhich it may consume, and only when that occurs is it possible for the fires ofmind (on mental levels) to burn up that which it has hitherto animated. Whenthis is accomplished, the fire of pure Spirit (increased and intensified by thegaseous essence of the fire of matter, or “fire by friction,” and coloured, andrendered radiatory by the fire of mind) blazes forth in perfected glory, so thatnaught is seen save one vibrant flame. This idea can be extended away from Manto a Heavenly Man, and again to the Logos in His cosmic relationship.Individualisation marks one stage of the process in the intensification of “fireby friction.” It has relation to the achievement of Brahma, and marks a point inthe energising of substance. Certain forms are ready for self-consciousness. Twocosmic Rays of differing polarities are mutually attracted.Initiation marks a stage in the intensification of “solar Fire.” It has relationto the achievement of Vishnu, and marks a point in the evolution ofconsciousness, through self-consciousness to group consciousness, or universalconsciousness.Identification with the aggregate of all groups might be the term used toexpress the final stages of the evolutionary process; it marks a period towardsthe close of the mahamanvantara when all groups begin consciously to work outthe eternal Will. It involves a type of realisation, incredible to man now butwhich is conceivable [732] (though not yet practicable) to the Chohans of theHierarchy now on Earth. They work consciously carrying out the Will of theplanetary Logos in the planet, but even They are as yet far from appreciatingfully the Will and purpose of the Logos as He works through the system. GlimpsesThey may get, and an idea of the general plan, but the details are as yetunrecognisable.c. On Incarnation.(a. ) Cosmic, Planetary and Human. We leave now the consideration ofself-consciousness, as it is produced through the medium of the particular typeof deva substance which the Agnishvattas provided for the body of the Ego, andpass on to the study of incarnation, cosmic, planetary and human. A hint as tothe constitution of these solar Pitris and Manasadevas may come to the studentwho ponders upon the place of the egoic unit in the body of the planetary Logos,and in the particular centre of which it forms a component part. TheseManasadevas and Dhyan Chohans who produce self-consciousness in man are indeedthe energy and substance of the cosmic Heavenly Man.The word “incarnation” in its root meaning conveys the fundamental truthinvolved in the taking of a dense physical body, and should technically beapplied only to that period of manifestation which concerns the three lowersubplanes of the:a. Cosmic physical plane, in relation to a solar Logos and to a planetary Logos.b . Systemic physical plane, in relation to man.This connotation has been preserved where the cosmic entities are concerned, butwhen man is under consideration the term has been applied to the unification ofthe etheric double with the dense physical body, or to the appropriation by manof the vehicle composed of the [733] substance of the lowest subplane of thecosmic physical plane in its lowest aspects. This distinction has a certainsignificance and should be remembered. This appropriation is governed by thesame laws which governed the appropriation by the Logos of His physical vehicle.In order to get an idea of what the procedure is, it might be of value if weconsidered the different kinds of pralaya, and pondered upon those periods whichensue between incarnations. From the point of view of any unit involved, apralaya is a period of quiescence, of cessation from a particular type ofactivity, involving objectivity, yet from the point of view of the great wholewith which the unit may be involved, a pralaya may be considered merely as atransference of force from one direction into another. Though the unit may betemporarily devitalised as regards its form, yet the greater Entity persists,and is still active.Let us take up the matter first from the human standpoint, and study pralaya asit affects the Monad in incarnation. ( 244 [text00028.html#Y_FN244] ) There arefive types of pralaya with which we may legitimately concern ourselves. Weshould notice first the fact that this condition is primarily one that concernsthe relationship between Spirit and matter, in which a condition in substance isbrought about through the action of the energising factor, the Spirit. It has,therefore, to do with the relation of the greater devas as They carry out Theirwork of form-building [734] under the Law of Will of God to the lesser devas whorepresent living substance. It will be apparent to the student that it concernsthe relation of the Holy Spirit to the Mother in the production of the Son, andthen the relation of the Son to the Mother. If the ideas formulated in thistreatise have been carefully followed, it will be obvious that in studying thequestion of pralaya, we are studying the relation (in time and space) of thepositive energy of the solar Logos, the planetary Logos, and of Man to thesubstance through which alone manifestation is possible. Through this relation,existence on the objective planes can be brought about.(b. ) The Nature of Pralaya. We can view pralaya as the work of “abstraction,”and as the method which brings the form under the Destroyer aspect of Spirit,working ever under the Law of Attraction, of which the Law of Synthesis is but abranch. The basic law of the system is that which governs the relation of allatoms to the aggregate of atoms, and of the Self to the Not-self. It is (fromthe occult standpoint) the most powerful force-demonstration in the system, andshould the law inconceivably cease to work, instantaneously the system and allforms therein, planetary, human and other would cease to be. By an act of willthe planetary schemes persist, by an act of will the system IS; by an act of theegoic will man appears. When the Will of the Logos, of the Heavenly Man, and ofthe human divine Ego is turned to other ends, the substance of Their vehicles isaffected, and disintegration sets in. The five types of pralaya which concernthe human unit are as follows:(1) The period of pralaya between two incarnations . This is of a triple natureand affects the substance of the three vehicles, physical, astral and mental,reducing the form to its primitive substance, and dissipating its atomicstructure. The energy of the second aspect (that of the form-builder) iswithdrawn by the will of the Ego, [735] and the atoms composing the form becomedissociated from each other, and are resolved into the reservoir of essence tobe re-collected again when the hour strikes. This condition is brought aboutgradually by stages of which we are aware:The first stage is the withdrawal of the life force in the etheric vehicle fromthe threefold (dense, liquid and gaseous) dense physical body and the consequent“falling into corruption,” and becoming “scattered to the elements.” Objectiveman fades out, and is no more seen by the physical eye, though still in hisetheric body. When etheric vision is developed, the thought of death will assumevery different proportions. When a man can be seen functioning in his ethericphysical body by the majority of the race, the dropping of the dense body willbe considered just a “release.”The next stage is the withdrawal of the life force from the etheric body orcoil, and its devitalisation. The etheric coil is but an extension of one aspectof the sutratma or thread, and this thread is spun by the Ego from within thecausal body much as a spider spins a thread. It can be shortened or extended atwill, and when the period of pralaya has been decided upon, this thread oflight, or of solar fire (note the word “solar”) is withdrawn, and gathered backto the atomic subplane where it will still vitalise the permanent atom and holdit connected within the causal body. The life impulses are then—as far as thephysical plane is concerned—centralised within the atomic sphere.The third stage is the withdrawal of the life force from the astral form so thatit disintegrates in a similar manner and the life is centralised within theastral permanent atom. It has gained an increase of vitality through physicalplane existence, and added colour through astral experience.The final stage for the human atom is its withdrawal [736] from the mentalvehicle. The life forces after this fourfold abstraction are centralisedentirely within the egoic sphere; contact with the three lower planes is stillinherently possible by means of the permanent atoms, the force centres of thethree personality aspects.In each incarnation the life forces have gained through the utilisation of thevehicles,a. An increased activity, which is stored in the physical permanent atom.b. An added colouring, which is stored in the astral permanent atom.c. A developed quality of strength, or purpose in action, which is stored in themental unit.These are wrought into faculty in devachan.Devacha ( 245, 246 [text00028.html#Y_FN245] ) is a state of consciousness,reflecting, in [737] the life of the Personality, that higher state which wecall nirvanic consciousness, and which is brought about by egoic action. It isbut a dim reflection in the separated units (and therefore tinged withselfishness and separative pleasure) of the group condition called nirvanic. Inthis high state of consciousness each separate identity, though self-realising,shares in the group realisation, and therein lies bliss for the unit. Separationis no longer felt, only unity and essential oneness is known. Therefore, asmight be naturally deduced, there is no devachan for the savage or littleevolved man, as they merit it not, and have not the mentality to realise it;hence, therefore, the rapidity of their incarnations, and the brevity of thepralayic period. There is little in their case for the Ego, on its own plane, toassimilate in the residue of incarnations, and hence the life principlewithdraws rapidly from out of the mental form, with the resulting impulse of theEgo to reincarnate almost immediately.When the life of the personality has been full and rich, yet has not reached thestage wherein the personal self can consciously co-operate with the ego, periodsof personality nirvana are undergone, their length depending upon the interestof the life, and the ability of the man to meditate upon experience. Later, whenthe Ego dominates the personality life, the interest of the man is raised tohigher levels, and the nirvana of the soul becomes [738] his goal. He has nointerest in devachan. Therefore, those upon the Path (either the probationaryPath, or the Path of Initiation) do not, as a rule, go to devachan, butimmediate incarnation becomes the rule in the turning of the wheel of life; thistime it is brought about by the conscious co-operation of the personal Self withthe divine Self or Ego.(2) The period between egoic Cycles . Herein is hid the mystery of the 777incarnations and concerns the relation of the unit to his group on the egoicplane, prior to the unfoldment of the fifth petal. It concerns man in the periodbetween the savage stage and that of the disciple, when he is an average man butstill in the two Halls. The mystery of all root races lies here, and the egoiccycles coincide with the building of racial forms, and civilisations. A man willreincarnate again and again in the various subraces of a root race until acertain cycle has been covered; then he may undergo a pralayic condition untilin a later (and sometimes much later) root race he will respond to its vibratorycall, and the egoic impulse to incarnate will again be felt. In illustration ofthis, we should bear in mind that the more advanced humanity of today did notincarnate until the fourth root race. These cycles are one of the mysteries ofinitiation, though one of the earlier mysteries, and are revealed at the secondinitiation as they enable the initiate to comprehend his position, to seesomewhat the nature of the karmic impulse, and to read his own record in theastral light.These might be considered the two lesser pralayic periods and concern primarilylife in the three worlds.(3) Next comes the period wherein the man has attained freedom. A man has atthis stage succeeded, under law, in “abstracting” himself, the freed soul, fromout of the matter of the three worlds. He has used and worked with devasubstance and has gained all the vibratory [739] contact possible, and hassecured all the intended “realisations” and “revelations”; he can no longer beheld imprisoned by the devas. He is free until, consciously and willingly, andin another round, he can return as a member of a Hierarchy to continue His workof service for the little evolved humanity of that distant time. As thisconcerns the seven paths of opportunity for a Master we will not deal with ithere. ( 247 [text00028.html#Y_FN247] ) This is the great human pralaya.(4) Planetary Pralaya. Man, after these cyclic happenings, is now a consciouspart of his group, and a vibrant point in a centre in the body of a HeavenlyMan, consciously alive and consciously aware of his place in the great whole.This involves a realisation as to the centre of which he is a point of energy, aknowledge of the type of force he is to transmit, and to manipulate from cosmiclevels, and a conscious relation with the six other centres in the planetaryLife with which he is associated.This period of conscious activity in etheric substance (of which the planetarybody is formed) persists according to the karma of the planetary Lord, for theunit is now consciously associated with planetary karma, and is a participant inthe working out of the will and purpose of the Lord of His Ray. On the higherplanes of the system, this stage persists for the length of the life of ascheme; to which a period of pralaya succeeds that has its beginning towards theend of the seventh round in any scheme or of the fifth if the Law of Persistenceof a scheme is working out through cycles of five. I am [740] here generalisingand speaking in broad terms; the karma of the units differ and a man—accordingto the path he chooses after the fifth initiation—stays and works within his ownscheme, but changes may occur through the following factors:a. Planetary karma.b. The will of the Lord of his Ray.c. Orders emanating from the solar Logos which are conveyed to him afterliberation via the planetary Logos and through the medium of the chohan of hisRay.He is then “abstracted” under a mysterious planetary law which only works oncosmic etheric levels, and is transferred to his destination. If we interpretall the above in terms of energy and of radioactivity and thus avoid the dangersof materialistic interpretation, the meaning will become clearer.(5) The Great Pralaya. This interval comes at the close of every one hundredyears of Brahma, and sweeps into dissolution forms of every kind—subtle anddense—throughout the entire system. It is a period analogous to that dealt withwhen we considered the abstraction of man from his etheric vehicle, and hisability then to function on the astral plane, dissociated from his dual physicalform. Within the system a process similar to that undergone when man withdrawsthe etheric body out of the dense physical vehicle, will be seen towards theclose of the mahamanvantara. It will cover the period wherein the lesser fourRays merge and blend, seeking duality, and their polar opposites. Eventually thefour become two, the two become one, and all are then synthesised into the thirdmajor Ray. The time is not yet, but lies countless aeons ahead. It is the firstappearance of the destroyer aspect in connection with the planetary schemes, andmarks the beginning of the [741] time when the “Heavens will melt with ferventheat,” and the Sun becomes seven suns. (See S. D., II, 746, 747.II, 345.)The microcosmic correspondence can be seen in the following process. Thephysical permanent atom absorbs the entire life force of the physical body, andits inherent heat and light is thereby increased until at the fourth initiationthe seven spirillae are fully vitalised, and vibrant. The internal heat of theatom, plus the external heat of the egoic body wherein it has its place,produces then that which destroys the permanent atom. Temporarily, and justprior to destruction, it becomes a tiny sevenfold sun owing to the radiation andactivity of the spirillae. So with the physical sun of the system; it will in asimilar manner become seven suns, when it has absorbed the life essence of thefully evolved planes, and of the planetary schemes thereon. The ensuingconflagration is the final work of the Destroyer aspect. It marks the moment ofthe highest development of deva substance in the system, the consummation of thework of Agni and his fire angels, and the initiation of Brahma. Atomic substancewill then individualise (which, as we know, is the goal for the atom) and afterthe great pralaya the next solar system will start with the threefold Spiritmanifesting through substance which is essentially distinguished by activeintelligent love. This is necessarily incomprehensible to our fourth roundminds.We have thus considered the various types of pralaya, in so far as they affectthe human unit; each unit finds its ways eventually into one of the cosmicastral centres of the particular cosmic Entity Who is the Lord of his Ray, andtherefore at the great pralaya those human units who have achieved, and who havenot passed to other distant cosmic centres, will find their place there.Before we take up planetary and cosmic pralaya, we might here consider therelationship of the Agnishvattas [742] (who caused the individualisation ofanimal man on this planet), to other and previous cycles of evolution, and whywe have only dealt with them from the point of view of a mahamanvantara, and ofa kalpa. The reason we have not considered specifically the group ofAgnishvattas, Kumaras and Rudras connected with the Earth has been because wehave handled the entire subject from the planetary standpoint, and not from thatof the human family. The student who seeks detailed information as to theAgnishvattas of the Earth chain has but to study the Secret Doctrine. We haveattempted to carry the thought of the student beyond his own tiny sphere to theconsideration of the work of the Manasadevas in the solar system. In everyscheme They have Their place, but in some—as in the Jupiter scheme—They are justbeginning Their work, and in others—as in the Vulcan and Venus schemes—Theirwork is nearly completed. Venus is in her last round, and has nearly developedher fourth kingdom to perfection, or as much as it is possible in the system. Inthe Earth scheme, They are in full tide of work, and only in the next round willThey demonstrate the height of Their activity. They pass cyclically through theschemes and under Law—the Law of Karma for the planetary Logos, for They areessentially concerned with His Life as it actuates His centres. They come into ascheme on a wave of manasic energy from the head centre of the Logos, and in theprocess of passing through his Heart centre three things occur:1. They become differentiated into seven groups.2. They direct Themselves as streams of energy to some particular scheme.3. Their contact with a scheme is that which produces the manifestation of thefourth Creative Hierarchy, and leads to the Monads taking form in the threeworlds.[743] These entities who sacrifice Themselves for the human Hierarchy (and wemust note here the accuracy of the fact that They emanate from the logoic headcentre, or from the will aspect), are the true Saviours who give Their lives forthe good of the race. They stand in relation to the totality of the schemes asthe Occult Hierarchy of any particular planet stands to men upon that planet.During pralaya They are withdrawn (as all else), from manifestation, and returnto a cosmic centre of which the logoic head centre is but a dim reflection; theyreturn the richer for experience.The old Commentary says:“The deva shineth with added light when the virtue of the will hath entered. Hegarnereth colour as the reaper garners wheat, and storeth it up for the feedingof the multitude. Over all this deva host the mystic Goat presideth. Makara is,and is not, yet the link persisteth.”Rounds come and go but (except from the standpoint of a particular planet), theManasadevas are forever present, but their influence is not forever felt.In considering planetary pralaya we might briefly enumerate the followingperiods of quiescence:Between Two Globes in a Chain. This covers the period of abstraction of theseeds of all life, and its transference from one sphere to another. The seedmanu of a globe gathers all the life forces into Himself, as does the Logos atthe close of a system, and as also transpires at the close of a chain, and holdsthem quiescent in His aura. This covers a period of a manvantara, or of one dayof Brahma.Between Two Chains. This covers the period of a mahamanvantara, or of one yearof Brahma.There are many ways of arriving at the greater cycles, but there is no need toconfuse with the intricacies of figures. The ten Prajapatis or Rishis, or [744]the ten planetary Logoi, manifest through Their ten schemes in time and space,the hour of Their appearing differing. Each likewise manifests as does the Logosthrough a septenate and a triad, making again a ten of perfection.Between Two Solar Systems . This covers the period of one hundred years ofBrahma, and through the study of the planetary cycles comprehension of thesegreater cycles may come. Complication comes to the student nevertheless in thefact that two of the schemes cover their cyclic periods in five rounds, whileothers have seven; one scheme has but three rounds, but a mystery is hiddenhere: on the inner round one planet has nine cycles to run before the purpose ofits Lord is completed.Certain lesser periods of pralaya do not concern man at all, but concern theatom of matter as it is released from form of any kind in the subhuman kingdoms.Pralaya is the result of radioactivity carried to a conclusion.(c.) Types of Human Rebirth. In our study of the building of thought-forms andthe agencies for their construction, we have considered:1. The deva substance out of which they are constructed.2. The energy which animates them and its source.3. Their appearance in time and space, or their incarnation.4. Their disappearance or pralaya.5. The constructing entities who in a threefold manner produce these forms,utilising the process of:a . Meditation, which is ever the preliminary to construction.b. Dynamic force, or the positive energy which seizes upon its polar opposite(negative substance), and utilises it. [745]c. The impartation of colour or quality, which moulds that which has beenprepared.d. A secondary vitalisation, which sets in separate motion the thought-form thuscreated.We will now consider the mystery of rebirth, or the incarnation of those liveswhich exist in subtler matter, and yet which seek form according to law, andtouch upon their specific intent on dense physical levels. We can consider thisin connection with the cosmic entities who seek existence on the physical planeof the cosmos, our solar systemic planes, or the reincarnating jivas who aredriven by the Law towards earthly manifestation in order to become fullyconscious, and acquire (by means of sentient existence), added faculty andpower.H. P. B. has said that rebirths may be divided into three classes: (S.D., III,364, 365, 367.45.)a. Those of Avatars.b. Those of Adepts.c. Those of jivas seeking development.To those who are endeavouring to grasp somewhat the mystery of rebirth and itslaws and purpose, and who are confused when considering the mystery of theBuddha, and the secret purpose of that mysterious Entity, the Silent Watcher; tothose who find the problem of understanding the position of the Kumaras andTheir relation to the planetary Logos almost an insuperable one, it might bewise to say: Study and meditate upon the difference existing between the lowerprinciples and the higher three; study and meditate upon the place and positionof these lower principles in the body of the planetary Logos and ponder upon thecorrespondence between:a. The devachan of the reincarnating jiva.b. The nirvana of the Adept. [746]c. The pralaya of a cosmic Entity, such as the Lord of a chain, the Lord of ascheme, and the Lord of a Ray.I say correspondence in its esoteric significance, and do not seek to inferanalogy in detail, but only in purpose and in experience. It may be said of allthree states that they are periods of development, long cycles of meditation,and interludes between stages of activity. Hence the emphasis laid in the Eastand in all occult schools of development upon meditation, for it is the means ofbringing to the unit under development the capacity which will produce:a . Abstraction, or liberation from form.b. Creative power.c . Direction of energy, through an act of the will.d . Future constructive activity.By means of meditation, a man finds freedom from the delusion of the senses, andtheir vibratory lure; he finds his own positive centre of energy and becomesconsciously able to use it; he becomes, therefore, aware of his real Self,functioning freely and consciously beyond the planes of sense; he enters intothe plans of the greater Entity within Whose radiatory capacity he has a place;he can then consciously proceed to carry out those plans as he can grasp them atvarying stages of realisation; and he becomes aware of essential unity. But whena man has thus freed himself from the objects of sense in the three worlds heagain becomes aware of the need of further meditation, and it is this (to man inthe three worlds), inconceivable form of meditation that engrosses the attentionof the Adept, and which is undertaken by Him in two great stages, each precedingthe two final Initiations, the sixth and the seventh. I refer not here only toAdepts who “make the sacrifice,” and choose rebirth for service on the planet,but to all adepts. Freedom to work on any Path must be gained by occult [747]meditation; freedom to escape beyond the ring-pass-not is also thus attained,and likewise the curious state of quiescence which is achieved by Those Who haveoffered for service as the occult Hierarchy in the next round. In Them have tobe stored the psychic seeds of knowledge which will be available in the fifthround; this necessitates for Them an attitude of receptivity to occurrences atthe close of each root-race, when there is, on subtler levels, a gathering in ofpsychic force, and its storing with Those prepared for its reception. Their workis analogous to that of the Seed-Manu, Who Himself works through a septenate asdo these storers of the psychic life-forces.Again for such cosmic Entities as the planetary Logoi periods of meditationtranspire, but these concern Them on the cosmic planes, and only the effects arefelt on this. They meditate in Their physical brains, and therefore in substanceas does man, but the process is carried on in the etheric brain. This should bepondered on, for it holds the mystery hid. Also, the fact that some of theseLords of the Rays are more proficient in meditation than others, and thusachieve differing results which work out in Their schemes, should be carefullyborne in mind.(d.) The Future Coming of the Avatar.THE COMING AVATAR“From the zenith to the nadir, from dawn to fall of night, from the emergenceinto being of all that is or may be to the passing into peace of all that hathachieved, gleameth the orb of blue and the inner radiant fire.From the gates of gold down to the pit of earth, out from the flaming fire downto the circle of gloom, rideth the secret Avatar, bearing the sword thatpierceth.Naught can arrest His approach, and none may say Him nay. To the darkness of oursphere He rideth alone, and on His approach is seen the uttermost disaster, andthe chaos of that which seeketh to withstand. [748]The Asuras veil their faces, and the pit of maya reeleth to the foundation. Thestars of the eternal Lhas vibrate to that sound,—the WORD uttered with sevenfoldintensity.Greater the chaos becometh; the major centre with all the seven circulatingspheres rock with the echoes of disintegration. The fumes of utter blacknessmount upwards in dissipation. The noise discordant of the warring elementsgreets the oncoming One, and deters Him not. The strife and cries of the fourthgreat Hierarchy, blending with the softer note of the Builders of the fifth andsixth, meet His approach. Yet He passeth on His way, sweeping the circle of thespheres, and sounding forth the WORD.* * * * * * *From the nadir to the zenith, from eve unto the Day be with us, from the circleof manifestation to the centre of pralayic peace, is seen the enveloping blue,lost in the flame of achievement.Up from the pit of maya back to the portals of gold, forth from the gloom anddarkness back to the splendour of day, rideth the Manifested One, the Avatar,bearing the shattered Cross.Naught can arrest His return, none can impede His Path, for He passeth along theupper way, bearing His people with Him. Cometh the dissolution of pain, comeththe end of strife, cometh the merging of the spheres and the blending of thehierarchies. All then is re-absorbed within the orb, the circle ofmanifestation. The forms that exist in maya, and the flame that devoureth all,are garnered by the One Who rideth the Heavens and entereth into the timelessAEon.”(From the Archives of the Lodge.)We have touched upon the subject of Avatars and the various classes into whichthey might be divided. We might now enlarge somewhat more upon the methods. Themethods whereby certain cosmic Existences and certain highly evolved Entitiesappear among men to do a specific work might be very inadequately, and cursorilysummarised, as follows:The method of overshadowing.The method of embodying some principle. [749]The method seen in the mystery of the Bodhisattva, or the Christ.The method of direct incarnation.The handicap of words is great, and the above phrases but convey a hint as tothe true meaning. Therein lies safety for the student, for the real significancewould be incomprehensible to him, and would but mislead him and guide him alongthe path of misunderstanding. Until a man is a pledged initiate, he cannotcomprehend the matter. Of these, the most ordinary method is the first. Allthese methods of manifestation will perhaps be better understood by the studentif he interprets them always in terms of force and energy , and if he notes thatdim reflections of the same processes, and faint analogies can be traced amongthe reincarnating jivas. When a man has reached a certain development and can beof service to the world, cases occur when he is overshadowed by a great adept,or—as in the case of H. P. B.—by One greater than an adept. A chela can be acentre through which his master can pour His energy and force for the helping ofthe world, and in certain important crises men have been overshadowed by morethan one of the Great Ones. ( 250 [text00028.html#Y_FN250] ) [750] What occurson lower planes is but a reflection of higher processes, and in this thought maylie illumination. A man is a force centre, either for his Ego, when sufficientlyevolved, or, via his Ego, of his group force; when very highly developed he canconsciously be overshadowed by an exponent of a different type of force, whichblends with his group, or Ray, force, and produces significant results in hislife on earth.Again when an Ego is highly evolved he may choose during any particularincarnation to work paramountly through any one principle among the lower four;when this is the case the man’s life on earth is significantly that of anembodied principle . He seems to strike one note and to sound out one tone. Hiswork is clearly to be seen along one line. He is a fanatic of high degree, butaccomplishes big things for his subrace, even though the physical brain may notbe consciously aware of the egoic impulse. This process has a curious relationto the obscuration, or fading out, of the personality, for the particularprinciple embodied works through a corresponding permanent atom, and itsspirillae become over-rapidly developed, and hence their term of service wearsto a close. This is a fact which is nevertheless taken advantage of when asuperman, or great adept, becomes the embodiment (during a rootrace) of aprinciple; the vestures or sheaths of which the permanent atom is the nucleus(through the innate strength of the developed spirillae) are preserved by theaid of mantric formulas. The vibration is perpetuated for a specific length oftime, and for as long as the vesture or sheath may be required. A hint is hereconveyed which may be of service.Again, when a man has become a disciple he may, if he so wish, remain upon theastral plane and work there, and—at his pleasure, and under the adjustment ofkarma by [751] his Guru—he may take immediate physical birth. A hint as to themystery of the Bodhisattva may be found in these two thoughts, provided thestudent transfers the whole concept to the etheric levels of the cosmic physicalplane, and remembers that on these levels the adept works altogether as a partof a group, and not as a separated Identity, as does the ego in the threeworlds. Therefore, the energy pouring through Him may be:a. That of a particular centre in the body of the planetary Logos in its totalforce.b. That of a particular set of vibrations within that centre, or a part of itsvibratory force.c. That of the energy of a particular principle, either one of His own higherprinciples which He is seeking to bring to bear upon the earth, by takingincarnation for that specific purpose, or the energy of one of the planetarylogoic principles, as it pours through Him via a particular spirilla or lifecurrent in the permanent atom of the planetary Logos.When these types of force are centralised in any particular adept, and He isexpressing simply that extraneous force and nothing else, the effect is shown onthe physical plane in the appearance of an avatar. An avatar is, but an adept ismade , but frequently the force, energy, purpose or will of a cosmic Entity willutilise the vehicles of an adept in order to contact the physical planes. Thismethod whereby cosmic Existences make Their power felt can be seen working outon all the planes of the cosmic physical plane. A striking instance of this canbe seen in the case of the Kumaras, Who, under certain planetary forces, andthrough the formation of a systemic triangle, gave the impulse to the thirdkingdom which produced the fourth by bringing it into conjunction with thefifth. These Kumaras, Sanat Kumara and [752] His three pupils, having achievedthe highest initiation possible in the last great cycle, but having as yet (fromTheir standpoint) another step to take, offered Themselves to the planetaryLogos of Their Ray as “focal points” for His force, so that thereby He mighthasten and perfect His plans on Earth within the cycle of manifestation. Theyhave demonstrated three out of the four methods. They are overshadowed by theplanetary Logos, and He works directly as the Initiator (in relation to man)through Sanat Kumara, and with the three kingdoms in nature through the threeBuddhas of Activity,—Sanat Kumara, being thus concerned directly with the ego onthe mental plane, and His three Pupils being concerned with the other threetypes of consciousness, of which man is the summation. At the moment ofinitiation (after the second Initiation) Sanat Kumara becomes the directmouthpiece and agent of the Planetary Logos. That great Entity speaks throughHim and for one brief second (if one can use such a term in connection with aplane whereon time, as we understand it, is not) the planetary Logos of a man’sRay consciously—via His etheric brain—turns His thought upon the Initiate, and“calls him by His Name.”Again the Kumaras are embodied principles , but in this connection we mustremember that this means that the force and energy of one of the principles ofthe Logos are pouring through Them via that which—to Them—corresponds to theMonad. Through Them, during Their period of incarnation and voluntary sacrifice,the great Prototype of the planetary Logos begins to make His Presence felt, andforce from the constellation of the Great Bear faintly vibrates on earth. Atinitiation, man becomes aware consciously of the Presence of the planetary Logosthrough self-induced contact with his own divine Spirit. At the fifth Initiationhe becomes aware of the full extent of this planetary group influence, and [753]of his part in the great whole. At the sixth and seventh Initiations theinfluence of the planetary Prototype is sensed, reaching him via the planetaryLogos working through the Initiator.The method of direct incarnation was earlier seen when the Kumaras were inphysical form. This only applied to some of Them; Sanat Kumara and His Pupilsare in physical form, but have not taken dense physical bodies. They work on thevital etheric levels, and dwell in etheric bodies. Shamballa, where They dwell,exists in physical matter as do the Kumaras, but it is matter of the higherethers of the physical plane, and only when man has developed etheric visionwill the mystery lying beyond the Himalayas be revealed. Therefore, Sanat Kumarais the planetary logos yet He is not. A reflection of this method of directincarnation can be seen when a disciple steps out of his body and permits hisGuru, or a more advanced chela, to use it.The mystery of the Bodhisattvas (S. D., I, 82, 83.) has been touched upon by H.P. B. and until students have assimilated and studied what she has said, thereis no more to add. Apprehension of truth is ever the factor that calls for freshrevelation.A very interesting period will come about the year 1966 and persist to the endof the century. It is one for which the Great Ones are already making duepreparation. It concerns a centennial effort of the Lodge and of the Personagestaking part therein. Each century sees a centennial effort of the Lodge along aparticular line of force made to forward the ends of evolution, and the effortfor the twentieth century will be upon a larger scale than has been the case fora very long time, and will involve a number of Great Ones. In a similar effortduring the nineteenth century, H. P. B. was concerned, and a fairly large numberof chelas. In the effort immediately ahead, [754] several of the Great Ones areconcerned and the Master of the Masters Himself; in Their “forthcoming” for workthree out of the various methods of appearing mentioned earlier will be seen infull activity, and it is on these three that we might now touch.In the appearing of the Bodhisattva Himself, the mystery of the Bodhisattva willbe seen in its fullest sense, and it is not for us here to enlarge upon it.Suffice it to say that the vestures of the GREAT ONE will be used, but time willshow whether the coming Lord will clothe upon those vestures a physical vehicleat this particular juncture, or whether the astral plane may not be the field ofHis activity. If the student ponders upon the consequences entailed in theappropriation of this vesture, much light upon probable happenings will bethrown. The vestures act in a dual capacity:a. They are very highly magnetised, and therefore have a profound andfar-reaching effect when utilised.b. They act as a focal point for the force of the Lord Buddha and link up thecoming Lord with Him, enabling Him to increase His Own stupendous resources bydrawing upon still higher force centres, via the Lord Buddha.This force will find its expression upon the astral plane, producing vastresults of a quieting nature and bringing, by reflex action, peace on earth. Thetransmutation of desire into aspiration, and the transformation of low desireinto high desire, will be some of the effects, while the result of the forceflowing through will produce profound reactions of the deva denizens of thatplane. Through the vibration thus set up will come the possibility of many (whowould otherwise not do so) taking the first initiation. Later, towards the endof the greater cycle, the coming Avatar will again employ the vestures [755]with all that is entailed thereby, and will take a physical body, thusdemonstrating on the physical plane the force of the Logos in the administrationof the Law. When He comes at the close of this century and makes His power felt,He will come as the Teacher of Love and Unity, and the keynote He will strikewill be regeneration through love poured forth on all. As He will work primarilyon the astral plane, this will demonstrate on the physical plane in theformation of active groups in every city of any size, and in every country,which will work aggressively for unity, co-operation and brotherhood in everydepartment of life—economic, religious, social and scientific.These groups will achieve results now impossible, owing to the retention ofbuddhic force, but later this force will be set loose on earth via the medium ofthe Great Lord, operating as an aspect of the Logos, and as a focal point forthe consciousness and energy of the Buddha.It is this impending probability which is held in mind during the century at theannual recurrence of the Wesak festival. Students would do well to further theends of the occult Hierarchy by a similar concentration at the time of thefestival, thus setting up currents of thought which will have a great appeal inthe occult sense of that term.Indication of the nearing of this event will be seen in the reaction which willbe set up during the next twenty-five years against crime, sovietism, and theextreme radicalism which is now being made use of by certain powers to achieveends contrary to the plans of the Lord. The era of peace will be ushered in by agathering together on earth of the forces which stand for construction, anddevelopment, and by a conscious deliberate banding together of groups in everyland who embody the principle (as far as they can vision it) of Brotherhood.Watch [756] the signs of the times, and be not discouraged over the immediatefuture. The appearance of the Great Lord on the astral plane (whether followedby His physical incarnation or not) will date from a certain Wesak festival atwhich a mantram (known only to those attaining the seventh Initiation) will bepronounced by the Buddha, thus setting loose force, and enabling His greatBrother to fulfil his mission. Hence the gradual recognition of the Wesakfestival, and its true significance in the occident is desirable, andopportunity will be offered to all who are willing to place themselves in theline of this force, and thus become vitalised by it, and consequently availablefor service. The reaction mentioned above, will also become possible through thepressure brought to bear by the present children, many of whom are chelas andsome initiates. They have come in to prepare the way for the coming of His Feet.When the hour strikes (five years prior to the date of His descent) they will bein the full flower of their service and will have recognised their work, eventhough they may not be conscious of that which the future holds hid.When the hour has come (and already a few cases are to be found), many cases ofovershadowing will be seen and will demonstrate in a threefold manner. In allcountries, in the orient and the occident, prepared disciples and highly evolvedmen and women, will be found who will be doing the work along the linesintended, and who will be occupying places of prominence which will make themavailable for the reaching of the many; their bodies also will be sufficientlypure to permit of the overshadowing. It will only be possible in the case ofthose who have been consecrated since childhood, who have been servers of therace all their lives, or who, in previous lives, have acquired the right bykarma. This threefold overshadowing will manifest as:First. An impression upon the physical brain of the [757] man or woman, ofthoughts, plans for work, ideals and intentions which (emanating from theAvatar) will yet be unrecognised by him as being other than his own; he willproceed to put them into action, unconsciously helped by the force flowing in.This is literally a form of higher mental telepathy working out on physicallevels.Second. The overshadowing of the chela during his work (such as lecturing,writing, or teaching), and his illumination for service. He will be conscious ofthis, though perhaps unable to explain it, and will seek more and more to beavailable for use, rendering himself up in utter selflessness to the inspirationof His Lord. This is effected via the chela’s Ego, the force flowing through hisastral permanent atom; and it is only possible when the fifth petal is unfolded.Third. The conscious co-operation of the chela is necessitated in the thirdmethod of overshadowing. In this case he will (with full knowledge of the lawsof his being and nature) surrender himself and step out of his physical body,handing it over for the use of the Great Lord or one of His Masters. This isonly possible in the case of a chela who has brought all the three lower bodiesinto alignment, and necessitates the unfolding of the sixth petal. By an act ofconscious will he renders up his body, and stands aside for a specific length oftime.These methods of overshadowing will be largely the ones used by the Great Lordand His Masters at the end of the century, and for this reason They are sendinginto incarnation, in every country, disciples who have the opportunity offeredthem to respond to the need of humanity. Hence the need of training men andwomen to recognise the higher psychism, and the true inspiration and mediumship,and to do this scientifically. In fifty years time, the need for true psychicsand conscious mediums (such as H. P. B., for instance) will be very great [758]if the Master’s plans are to be carried to fruition, and the movement must beset on foot in preparation for the coming of Him for Whom all nations wait. Inthis work many have their share, provided they demonstrate the necessaryendurance.Naturally, the first group will be the largest, for it does not necessitate somuch knowledge, but more risk is entailed with them than with the others—therisk of a perversion of the plans, and of disaster to the unit involved. Thesecond group will be less numerous, and the last group will involve only ahandful, or two or three in certain countries. In this case, it will be verilytrue that, through sacrifice, the Son of Man will again tread the highways ofmen, and His physical incarnation be a fact. Very few will be thus available forHis use, as the force He carries requires a peculiarly resilient instrument, butdue preparation is being made.Again the method of direct incarnation will be employed by certain of theMasters and initiates through the process of:a. Physical birth.b. Appropriation of a suitable vehicle, or body.c. Direct creation by an act of will. This will be rare.The second, or middle, method will be the one most frequently employed. Six ofthe Masters, as yet quite unknown to the average occult student by name, havealready sought physical incarnation—one in India, another in England, two innorthern America, and one in central Europe, whilst another has made a greatsacrifice, and taken a Russian body in the desire to act as a peace centre inthat distracted land. Certain initiates of the third Initiation have takenfeminine bodies,—one in India will in due time do much toward the emancipationof the women of India, whilst another has a peculiar work to do in connectionwith the animal kingdom which likewise is awaiting the day of His appearing.[759] The Master Jesus will take a physical vehicle, and with certain of Hischelas effect a re-spiritualisation of the Catholic churches, breaking down thebarrier separating the Episcopal and Greek churches from the Roman. This may belooked for, should plans progress as hoped, about the year 1980. The MasterHilarion will also come forth, and become a focal point of buddhic energy in thevast spiritualistic movement, whilst another Master is working with theChristian Science endeavour in an effort to swing it on to sounder lines. It isinteresting to note that those movements which have laid the emphasis sostrongly on the heart or love aspect, may respond more rapidly to the inflow offorce at the Coming than other movements which consider themselves veryadvanced. The “mind may slay” the recognition of the Real, and hatred betweenbrothers swing the tide of love-force away. The three Masters so closely alliedwith the theosophical movement are already making Their preparations, and willalso move among men, recognised by Their Own and by those who have eyes to see.To those of Their chelas on earth who undergo the necessary discipline,opportunity will be offered to work on the astral plane and, should they sochoose, an immediate incarnation, provided they have achieved continuity ofconsciousness. He Who is known as D. K. is planning to restore—via Hisstudents—some of the old and occult methods of healing and to demonstrate:a. The place of the etheric body.b. The effect of pranic force.c. The opening up of etheric vision.It is not permissible to say more in connection with the plans of the GreatOnes. Their appearing will not be simultaneous in time, for the people could notstand the tremendously increased inflow of force, and recognition of Them and ofTheir methods will depend upon the intuition, [760] and the training of theinner senses. They come with no herald, and only Their works will proclaim Them.(e. ) Impulse and Incarnation. Perhaps light upon this very difficult questionof the incarnating jivas, of adepts and of avatars may come if the studentremembers that:1. An ordinary man demonstrates the third aspect of intelligent activity in hispersonality life, and is evolving consciously the second aspect, or the egoicmanifestation on the physical plane.2. An adept in incarnation is demonstrating fully the second aspect as well asthe third, and in his own internal life is in process of evolving the firstaspect, or is endeavouring to bring through the monadic life into consciousactivity on the buddhic plane.3. An avatar demonstrates one of two things, according to his peculiar karma:a. The pure light of the Monad , brought through by means of the perfected Egoand personality on to the physical plane. The line of force extends straightthrough from monadic levels to the physical.b. The light of the Logos Himself in one or other aspect, this being transmittedconsciously via the Monad straight through to the physical plane from theplanetary Logos, or even from the solar Logos Himself.In the first two cases, desire for sentient existence, or desire for service tohumanity, are the factors which produce physical manifestation (one through theforce of evolution itself, the other through a conscious act of the will).Desire for sentient existence is but the latent second aspect seeking expressionby means of the Not-Self, and in the other case the manifested second aspectconsciously utilises form as a means to an end. In the case [761] of all avatarsit is the will aspect which is brought into play, and which producesappearance—either the will of the perfected adept, such as the Buddha Himself,or (as in the case of the true Avatar, Who is, and Who has not achieved) thewill of the planetary Logos or of the solar Logos, taking form for a specificpurpose. It involves a higher display of the creative faculty than thatdisplayed by the Adept in the creation of His body of manifestation, theMayavirupa. ( 252 [text00028.html#Y_FN252] ) The terms “appropriation of aphysical body” and “creation of a physical body” must be extended to include allthe planes of the solar system, and not just our physical plane, the seventhsubplane of the cosmic physical.The causes which combine to produce incarnation, are seen to be three:1. Egoic impulse.2. The activity of the solar and lunar Angels.3. Karma, or the place which antecedent action plays in producing manifestation.We can hardly dissociate them in the consideration of our subject owing to theinnate constitution of the egoic body itself and the factor the indwellingconsciousness plays in producing appearance through an act of will. Let usbriefly, therefore, reconsider what we have learned anent the egoic body and itsconstitution, and then take up the steps followed by the Ego in producingresults in the three worlds.We have seen that on the third level of the mental plane, the egoic lotus isfound and the student should picture it to himself as follows:Concealed at the very centre or heart of the lotus is a brilliant point ofelectric fire of a blue-white hue (the [762] jewel in the lotus) surrounded, andcompletely hidden, by three closely folded petals. Around this central nucleus,or inner flame, are arranged the nine petals in circles of three petals each,making three circles in all. These petals are formed out of the substance of thesolar angels, as are the central three,—substance which is not only sentient asis the substance of the forms in the three worlds and the lunar bodies, butwhich has an added quality of “I-ness” or of self-consciousness, enabling thespiritual unity at the centre (by means of it) to acquire knowledge, awareness,and self-realisation. These nine petals are of a predominant orange hue, thoughthe six other colours are found as secondary colours in a varying degree. Theinner three petals are of a lovely lemon-yellow hue. At the base of the lotuspetals are the three points of light which mark the position of the permanentatoms, and which are the medium of communication between the solar Angels andthe lunar Pitris. By means of these permanent atoms the Ego, according to itsstate of evolution can construct his lunar bodies, acquire knowledge on thelower three planes, and thus buy his experience, and becomes aware. On a higherturn of the spiral, the Monad through the egoic petals, and thus with the aid ofthe solar Angels, acquires knowledge and equally on more exalted levels becomesaware.The light within these permanent atoms has a dull red glow and we have,therefore, all the three fires demonstrating in the causal body—electric fire atthe centre, solar fire enclosing it as the flame encloses the central nucleus oressence in a candle flame, and fire by friction , this latter fire resemblingthe glowing red wick which lies at the base of the higher flame.These three types of fire on the mental plane—meeting and unified in the egoicbody—produce in time a radiation or warmth which streams out from all sides ofthe lotus, and forms that spheroidal shape noted by investigators. [763] Themore fully developed the Ego may be, and the more the petals are unfolded, thegreater the beauty of the surrounding sphere, and the more refined itscolouring.At the early stages after individualisation, the egoic body has the appearanceof a bud. The electric fire at the centre is not apparent, and all the ninepetals are closed down upon the inner three; the orange colour has a dead aspectand the three points of light at the base are just points and nothing more; thetriangle which is later seen connecting the points is not demonstrated. Thesurrounding sphere is colourless and is only to be appreciated as undulatoryvibrations (like waves in the air or ether) reaching barely beyond the petaloutline.By the time the third Initiation is reached, a wondrous transformation hastranspired. The outer sphere is palpitating with every colour in the rainbow,and is of wide radius; the streams of electrical energy circulating in it are sopowerful that they are escaping beyond the periphery of the circle, resemblingthe rays of the sun. The nine petals are fully unfolded, forming a gracioussetting for the central jewel, and their orange hue is now of a gorgeoustranslucence, shot with many colours, that of the egoic ray predominating. Thetriangle at the base is now quickened and scintillating, and the three pointsare small blazing fires, showing to the eye of the clairvoyant as sevenfoldwhorls of light, circulating their light from point to point of a rapidly movingtriangle.By the time the fourth Initiation is reached, the activity of this triangle isso great that it looks more like a wheel in rapid revolution. It has a fourthdimensional aspect. The three petals at the centre are opening up, revealing the“blazing jewel.” At this initiation, through the action of the Hierophantwielding the electric Rod of Power, the three fires are suddenly stimulated by adownflow of electric, or positive force, from the [764] Monad, and their blazingout in response produces that merging which destroys the entire sphere,dissipates all appearance of form, and produces a moment of equilibrium, or ofsuspension, in which the “elements are consumed with fervent heat.” The momentof highest radiation is known. Then—through the pronouncement of a certain Wordof Power—the great solar Angels gather back into themselves the solar fire, thusproducing the final dissipation of the form, and hence the separation of thelife from the form; the fire of matter returns to the general reservoir, and thepermanent atoms and the causal body are no more. The central electric firebecomes centralised in atma-buddhi. The Thinker or spiritual entity stands freeof the three worlds, and functions consciously on the buddhic plane. Betweenthese two stages of quiescent (though self-conscious) inertia and of thatradiant activity which produces a balancing of forces, is a long series oflives.In our consideration of the subject of the reincarnating jivas, we have touchedupon three subjects:a. Avatars, with the intent of disposing of the confusion in the minds ofstudents as to certain types of appearances. In our present study we shall dealonly with the process followed by ordinary men.b. Pralayas, with the intent of arousing in the mind of the student the idea ofinterludes of quiescence dependent upon the intervening periods of activity.c. The appearance of the body egoic and its general conformation, with theintent of awakening the realisation of the student to the fact that evolutionaffects that body also, and not only man’s forms in the three worlds. Theeffects of the process are interdependent, and as the lower self develops, orthe personality becomes more active and intelligent, results are produced in thehigher body. As these effects are cumulative, and not ephemeral [765] as are thelower results, the egoic body becomes equally more active and its manifestationof energy is increased. Towards the close of the evolutionary period in thethree worlds a constant interchange of energy is seen to be taking place; thelower forms become irradiated with light, and reflect the higher radiance; theegoic body is the Sun of the lower system, and its bodies reflect its rays, asthe moon reflects the light of the solar sun. Similarly the egoic Sun,—throughthe interaction—shines with ever greater intensity and glory. On the higherlevels a similar interaction takes place for a brief period between the Monadand its reflection the Ego, but only in the coming solar system will thisinteraction be carried to its logical conclusion.Having, therefore, very briefly dealt with these three topics, we can nowproceed to consider the process followed by the Ego when seeking manifestationin the three worlds. Let us endeavour in our thoughts to interpret all theseprocesses in terms of energy and of force.The old Commentary says:“When the Spark is touched to the four wicks, and when spiritual Fire in itsthreefold essence meets with that which is combustible, the Flame bursts forth.Faint the flicker at the first appearing, and near to death it seems, but thewicks smoulder and glow, and the heat is retained. This is cycle the first, andis called that of the glowing wheel.The flicker grows into a tiny flame and the four wicks burn, but are notconsumed, for the heat does not suffice. The light of these three fires is yetso small that the cave is not illumined. Nevertheless, the flame and theessential heat can be felt by the One Who approaches and watches. This is thesecond cycle, and is called that of the warming wheel.The tiny flame becomes a lighted lamp. The fire flares up, but much smoke isthere, for the wicks are burning fast, and the heat suffices for their quickdestruction. The lamp, set in the midst of darkness, makes the thick blacknessmanifest itself; the light and warmth are felt. This, the third cycle, is calledthat of the lighted wheel.[766] The four wicks and the flame appear as one, and nearly all the smoke isgone, for flame is mostly seen. The cave itself is lighted up, though the lampis yet apparent. Cycle the fourth is called the hour of the flaming wheel.The final cycle comes when even the lamp itself is burned, destroyed through theintensity of heat. The One Who watches, seeing the work accomplished, fans thecentral point of fire and produces a sudden flaming. The wicks are naught—theflame is all. This, so the Sacred Science says, is called the cycle of the wheelconsumed .”Here in the arcane symbology is hid (in terms of energy and of radiant activity)the whole secret of egoic energy, and of impulse making its presence felt in thesubstance of the lower planes; the student should interpret the above sentencesboth macrocosmically and microcosmically. In all manifestation, the originatingimpulse comes from the first aspect which is hidden at the heart of the egoiclotus, but this hidden Identity works under law, and in the earlier stages (thefirst three cycles) the process goes on under the Law of Economy, which is thelaw of substance itself; in the final two cycles this law becomes merged (thoughnot superseded, being still potent) with the Law of Attraction, which is thefundamental law of the divine Self. It is the failure to realise this which hasresulted in the confusion existing in the minds of many metaphysicians as towhich demonstrated first, desire or will, and as to the distinction betweenthem, between impulse and purpose, and between instinct and intention. In theearlier stages man reincarnates under the Law of Economy, and though the willaspect lies back of the process, yet for a long time it is the pull of sensationand its reflex in consciousness, desire, which produces rebirth. Sensation,being a quality in matter or substance, the Self in the beginning identifiesItself with sensation. Later, when the Self is beginning to identify Itself withItself, and to recognise the nature of the Not-Self, the Law of Attraction andRepulsion becomes [767] more active, and conscious will and purpose aredisplayed. Here it should be remembered that a profound difference in time andspace exists between the Logos, or Macrocosm, and Man, the Microcosm. Averageman comes into incarnation through egoic impulse, based on desire and on therelation of the second aspect to the third aspect or of the Self to theNot-Self. He will eventually bring about (through evolution) the revelation ofthe first aspect, and then egoic impulse (based on conscious mental apprehensionof the purpose in view) will be the dominant factor, and will demonstratethrough a definite will to act. In connection with the Logos, the first stagehas been left far behind, and logoic manifestation is based on will and purposeand on conscious intelligent activity. The reason for this is that the Logos,and the planetary Logoi likewise, are on the path of cosmic initiation.Therefore, though the originating impulse comes from the central point, it isnot at first apparent. At the moment of individualisation, the dim outline of aform such as earlier described has made its appearance on mental levels, and(which is a point not as yet recognised by students) it becomes apparent that aperiod on mental levels has transpired given over to a preparation for theimminent event. Through the activity of the solar Angels the twelve petals havegradually taken form, as the point of electric fire at the heart has begun tomake itself felt even though not as yet localised. Then the first three petalstake shape, and close down upon the vibrant point, or “jewel” under the potencyof the Law of Attraction. One by one the nine other petals take shape as thevibrations begin to affect solar substance, the three types of petals being eachunder the influence of one or other of the major Rays; these, in their turn,come under the influence of force from cosmic centres.[768] As earlier said, these petals form a bud, each being closely folded. Onlyfaint vibrations are to be seen pulsating in the bud, just enough to testify toits being a living organism. Shadowy and dim can the ring-pass-not be seen, theencircling limit of the activity of the coming Consciousness. It is an ovoid orsphere, and very small as yet. This process of forming the egoic lotus has goneon silently from the moment that the lower animal man, or the lower fourprinciples, had reached a point where the energy (generated by him) could beginto make itself felt on mental levels. When the fire of the lower preparedsheaths (the threefold fire of substance itself) becomes radioactive, thisnebulous appearance on the third subplane of the mental plane begins to beorganised, as the result of the downward pull of the higher by the lower, and asthe response of the Spirit aspect to the radiations, or attraction, of matter.But individualisation as we understand it is not yet effected. This process ofradioactivity on the part of the lower, and of a downflow of energy from thehigher, covers a long period wherein the solar Angels are working on Their Ownplane and the lower Pitris are also working on theirs; one group is producingthe nucleus of the egoic body, and the other the receptacle for the life of God,or the Monad in the three worlds.Then comes a set time in the life of the planetary Logos wherein His centresbecome active in a particular manner; this is coincident with the incarnation ofthe Monads, and their descent into the three worlds. A systemic triangle isformed (for ever the three produce the seven), and through this setting loose ofthreefold energy, the work of the solar and lunar Pitris is co-ordinated, andthe three permanent atoms are appropriated by the jiva concerned, and appear atthe base of the egoic lotus. Individualisation has taken place and the work ofat-one-ment is completed; the fourth kingdom [769] in nature is a “faitaccompli;” the Monad has clothed itself in material sheaths, and the selfconscious unit appears on the physical plane. If all that H. P. B. has to sayanent the first three rounds of our Earth scheme is read as dealing with theperiod of condensation of the causal body upon the mental level, and as coveringthe time leading up to the appearance in the fourth round of man as we now havehim, some light may be thrown upon this difficult matter.The egoic lotuses can be seen grouped together, and each of them forms part of agroup. These groups in their turn form part of a vaster lotus which embodies theconsciousness of a still greater Entity whose “jewel” may be found on the secondsubplane. All these in their turn may be divided into seven fundamental groups.These seven groups or aggregates of egoic lotuses form the seven types ofconsciousness of those Entities Who are the seven centres of force for our ownplanetary Logos. These seven in their turn will be synthesised on higher levelsinto the three higher centres, till the entire energy and force which theyrepresent is gathered up, and absorbed by the centre corresponding to thehighest head centre of the planetary Logos. Each Logos embodies one type ofcosmic energy. Each of His centres embodies this type of energy in one of itsseven differentiations. Each of these seven in turn manifests through egoicgroups, and these again are composed of those points of energy we call Egos.These multitudes of egoic groups form a radiant interlocking whole, though allare diverse and differing, both as to their point of development, and theirsecondary colouring. Just as the petals in the egoic lotus of the incarnatingjivas unfold in differing order and at different periods, so the egoic groupsalso unfold diversely as to time and sequence. This produces a wonderfulappearance. Again just as the Master can (by [770] studying the group or largerlotus of which He is a part), ascertain the condition of the human units who goto its constitution, so the planetary Logos can ascertain through consciousidentification (note the term) the condition of the various groups through whomHis work must be accomplished.It will now be apparent to the student that the appearance of the incarnatingjivas on the physical plane will be governed by three things:First of all, on impulse based on the will-purpose of the Life animating theaggregate of groups on any subray, or one of the seven larger groups.Second, on impulse based on the will, tinged by desire, of the Life animating aman’s egoic group.Third, on impulse, based on the desire of the Ego for physical planemanifestation.As identification of a man with his group becomes matured the desire impulsebecomes modified until it is eventually superseded by group will. If these factsare pondered upon it will be apparent that Egos come into incarnation thereforenot singly but according to group urge, and thus collectively. This is the basisof collective karma, and of family karma. The individual urge, which is, ofcourse, a reaction to group urge, is the result of personal karma. Hence, thoughwe may by these reflections, have thrown some light upon this question ofreincarnation, we have nevertheless said much to increase the magnitude of thequestion, and its complexity. Average man is confined to the use of the physicalbrain, and is, therefore, unable to think in group terms.This egoic impulse in any group or any group unit makes itself felt as apulsation, or access of energy, emanating from the central point. This centralactivity is produced by the action of the planetary Logos working through thegroups in His centres, and according to the [771] centre under stimulation sowill the groups concerned be affected. Beyond mentioning this fact, we cannotenlarge, for the subject is stupendous, and beyond a man’s comprehension; it isonly necessary for him to appreciate his dependence in this matter upon theplanetary Logos.From the group centre, therefore, emanates an urge to renewed activity, and thisspreads throughout the group lotus until the units who respond to thatparticular ray vibration occultly “awaken.” All this time (as far as the jivasare concerned) this aspect of force has been that of the first aspect, and haspassed from the central points to other central points. The positive nuclei ineach case are affected by this flashing forth of electric fire, or energy. Eachpoint concerned responds by a primary contraction followed by an outgoing orexpansive display of energy. Each Identity concerned proceeds to sound a WORD.This sound expands into a mantram and the solar angels vibrate in response.There is a point of interest to be noted here.a . The first aspect works through a Word of Power.b . The second aspect works through mantric combinations.c. The third aspect works through mathematical formulas.Having sounded the Word the first aspect, represented by the electric fire atthe centre of the lotus, sinks back into quiescence, and becomes an abstractionas far as the self-conscious unit is concerned. The work has been begun, thenecessary vibration has been set up, and the whole process then proceeds underlaw. The solar angels have begun their activity, and until their work hasreached a very high stage, the Spirit aspect must become, in the causal body, ananalogy to the Silent Watcher. As the solar Angels continue sounding out themantram which is the basis of their work, the lunar Pitris respond [772] tocertain sounds in that mantram (not to all by any means at first) and gather outof those sounds the formula under which their work must proceed. So the Word isthe basis of the mantram, and the mantram is the basis of the formula.At each incarnation, finer forms are required, and the formulas therefore growmore complicated, and the sounds on which they are based become more numerous.In time, the formulas are completed, and the lunar Pitris respond no more to thesounds or mantrams chanted on the mental plane. This is indicative of the stageof perfection, and shows that the three worlds have no more a downward pull forthe jiva concerned. Desire for lower manifestation and experience has no moresway, and only conscious purpose is left. Then, and only then, can the trueMayavirupa be constructed; the Master then sounds the mantram for Himself, andbuilds without formulas in the three worlds. At the time too that man begins totread the Probationary Path, the mantrams of the solar Angels begin to die down,and slowly (as the petals of the inner circle open up) the true Word emergesuntil the three enshrining petals burst open, and the central spark is revealed.Then the Word is fully known, and mantrams and formulas have no further use.Thus is the beauty of the scheme revealed. When the planetary Logos isconcerned, the Word sounded on cosmic levels is being resolved into mantrams onthe cosmic etheric planes, for He is in a position to create consciously onthose levels; He works nevertheless through formulas on the dense physicalplanes of His scheme, our three worlds of endeavour.To return to the reincarnating jivas: When the initiatory impulse has beengiven, the vibration thrills through the petals, and activity starts in those ofthem which respond to the note of that Word. The solar Angels direct thevibration, and the mantram for that particular [773] type of Ego is begun.Finally the vibration reaches the mental unit at the base of the lotus bud, andthe lunar Pitris are called into activity. They begin to work out their formulasfor the particular type of vehicle which is required.(f.) Activity of the Pitris. The joint activity of the solar and the lunarPitris ( 253 [text00028.html#Y_FN253] ) in the process pursued by thereincarnating Ego is our next subject of consideration. The Ego, driven bydesire for physical experience, has made the initial move and a vibration,emanating from the centre of the lotus bud, has reached the lotus petals, andhas consequently vibrated in deva substance, or in [774] matter vitalised by theAgnishvattas. As they are galvanised into activity (according to the groupaffected) the vibration is increased, and a dual sound is emitted. This dualsound is the basis of the mantram upon which the Ego’s cycle of incarnation isfounded. The vibration, pulsating through the outer circle of petals (for thetwo inner circles and the three central petals are not as yet responsive)arrives at the triangle formed by the three permanent atoms, and vivifies thethree lower spirillae, causing a slight response in the fourth, and leaving thehigher three yet dormant. In each round one of the spirillae has been ‘created,’and in this fourth round (through the creation of the fourth spirilla) thefourth or human kingdom can come into being. The word ‘creation’ must beoccultly understood, and means the appearance in active manifestation of someform of energy. Only in the next round will the fifth spirilla be an activefunctioning unit in a sense incomprehensible now.Students should bear in mind that this applies primarily to the humanityindividualised on this globe, and was also equally true in the earlier chain;units, however, which come into this fourth or Earth Chain from the earlier onesare much ahead of earth’s humanity, and their fifth spirilla is awakening intoorganised activity in this round. All in Nature overlaps.When therefore this vibration from the central Will has arrived at the atomictriangle it is an indication that the entire lotus is turning its forcedownwards, and for the period of manifestation the flow of egoic energy istowards the lower, and consequently away from the higher. There is at this stagevery little turning of egoic energy in the direction of the Monad, for it hasnot yet generated enough force, and is not as yet radioactive towards the Spiritaspect. Its activities are primarily internal and self-centred for the greaterpart of the time, or are directed towards arousing the permanent atoms, [775]and not towards the unfolding of the petals. This should be carefully borne inmind.The work of the solar Angels is of a triple nature:(1.) Directing the vibration towards the atomic triangle. Here a veryinteresting fact must be borne in mind. The three permanent atoms, or the threepoints of the triangle, do not always hold the same relative position as regardsthe centre of the lotus, but according to the stage of development so will bethe position of the atoms, and so will be the apprehension of the inflowingforce. In the earlier stages, the physical permanent atom is the first toreceive the inflow, passing it through its system to the astral permanent atomand the mental unit. This force is circulated four times around the triangle(this being the fourth round) until the mental unit is again contacted and theenergy becomes centralised in the fourth spirilla of the mental unit. Then andonly then do the lunar Pitris begin their work, and commence the co-ordinationof the substance which will form the mental sheath, next working with the astralbody and finally with the etheric body.At a later stage in the evolution of man (the stage wherein the average man isnow) the astral permanent atom is the first contacted, and the energy circulatesthrough it to the other two. At the stage of advanced intellectual man, themental unit takes the primary place. In this case there is now the possibilityof the alignment of the three bodies which will later be an accomplished fact.The fifth spirilla in the lower two atoms increases its vibration. As we know,there are only four spirillae in the mental unit and the moment that that is infull activity, the co-ordination of the antaskarana becomes a possibility.Changes are now taking place in the egoic lotus, and the petals are unfolding,that unfoldment being partially dependent upon the vibration in the spirillaeand their awakening.[776] The student should bear in mind the fact that as soon as the mental unithas become the apex of the atomic triangle a condition is brought about whereinforce in the future will enter the three atoms simultaneously through the threeunfolded petals of the outer circle, and the man has therefore reached a verydefinite stage in evolution. The direction of force, and its application to theatoms is the work of the solar Pitris. As evolution proceeds, their work in thisconnection becomes more complex, for the petals are unfolding, and the triangleis revolving more rapidly.(2.) Pronouncing the mantram which will make possible the 777 incarnations.Each of the figures in this triplicity stands for:a. A cycle of egoic manifestation.b . A particular sound which will enable the Ego to express some subray of thisegoic ray.c . The three circles of petals which will unfold as the result of incarnation.d. The particular group of manasadevas who form the causal body of the Egoconcerned.The mantric sounds are therefore based on these figures, and through the mantram(which grows in volume, depth and number of sounds involved as time elapses) theforce is directed, the petals concerned are stimulated into activity, and thelunar Pitris become aware of the work to be done in preparation for anyincarnation.(3.) Building into the causal body that which is required for its completion.In the early stages this work is comparatively small but as the third stage ofdevelopment is reached, and the man is demonstrating character and ability,their work is rapidly increased, and they are kept fully occupied in the work ofperfecting the egoic body, in expanding the egoic consciousness, if metaphysicalterms are preferred. All [777] this is accomplished by means of the materialfurnished by the lower self. When that lower Personality becomes graduallyradioactive, these radiations are attracted to the positive ego, and areabsorbed into its nature through the activity of the solar Angels.These three activities are the main work of the solar Pitris where man isconcerned. Where the group, and not the individual, is concerned, their worklies along the line of adjusting the egoic units in their groups, and of makingthem group conscious, but this is only possible towards the final stages ofevolution when the work of the highest group of Agnishvattas is in order. Themiddle group who form the nine petals are always the most active. They work inconnection with the lower group who are the direct transmitters of energy to theatomic triangle, receiving it from the middle group. More of their work it isnot possible to detail, for the work of the Agnishvattas is vast and intricate,and differs also in the various schemes in certain particulars. Those who areworking in the Uranus, the Neptune, and the Saturn scheme work somewhatdifferently to those functioning in the Venus, the Vulcan, the Mars, theMercury, the Jupiter, the Earth and the exoteric Saturn scheme, and so do theManasadevas of the inner round. We should note here that we again have atriplicity of groups, representing a triplicity of force, and herein lies ahint. In the central list of schemes the middle and lower group of Agnishvattasare active. In the others the higher group and middle group hold sway as theseplanets are the most occult and sacred in manifestation, and are concerned onlywith egos who are on the Path, and who are therefore group-active. In connectionwith Uranus, Neptune and Saturn, this might be expected as they are thesynthesising planetary schemes, and provide conditions suitable only for thevery advanced stages. They are the “reaping” planets.[778] Much confusion in connection with Egos exists in the minds of our studentson account of their failure to realise that (as H. P. B. has pointed out) (S.D., I, 41, 83.) the Secret Doctrine is primarily concerned with the planetaryscheme of our Earth, and has little to impart anent the other schemes, and theirmethods of evolving self-consciousness. The general procedure on the mentallevels is the same, but as each scheme embodies one particular type of force,the peculiarity of that force will colour all its evolution, and the work of theAgnishvattas will correspond. It is not possible to state what is the peculiarcolouring of the Ray which is embodied in our scheme, as it is one of the mostsecret of the mysteries revealed at initiation, but students must bear in mindthat in the fundamentals laid down here we are not dealing specifically with ourscheme.A great deal has been said in modern occult literature anent the processfollowed in the perfecting of those Egos who choose to remain with the Hierarchyof our planet, and their methods of development (through chelaship toadeptship). But nothing practically has been imparted anent the many egos whoreach a certain high stage of evolution in our scheme and who are thentransferred to one of the three synthesising schemes, passing first to thescheme which is the polar opposite to ours, and from thence to the synthesisingscheme. They are numerically more than those who remain within the Earth scheme.Whichever may be the synthesising scheme to which they are attracted, it marksand initiates their start upon one of the three cosmic paths. The work of theManasadevas is carried on throughout the entire system, and a constantcirculation transpires, and a constant transmission of energy, and of forceunits embodying that energy, goes on throughout the entire system. Thistransmission becomes possible in any scheme when the [779] fourth or humankingdom becomes radioactive; it really marks the setting in of the period ofobscuration. Venus is a case in point. Metaphysically stated, it marks the pointwhen the Logoi begin to dissociate Themselves from Their dense physical bodies,or from the three worlds of human endeavour.The three groups of Agnishvattas concerned with the evolution of man on themental level have each a specific function, as we have already seen, and thelowest of the three deal primarily with the transmission of force or energy tothe three permanent atoms. In the dual sounding of the egoic mantram by thelowest of the three groups changes are brought about and the lunar Pitris (whoconcern themselves with the lower three vehicles) enter upon their work, the keybeing given to them by the solar Angels.These lunar Pitris embody the substance of man’s lower bodies, just as the solarPitris sacrifice themselves to give him his egoic body, and his consciousness. (255, 256, 257 [text00028.html#Y_FN255] ) They are substance in its dual aspect,and the Lunar Pitris in their higher grades are the positive energy of atomicsubstance, and in their lower are the negative [780] aspect of the samesubstance. They might be considered, in connection with man , as triple in theirranks:a. The highest group of all receives the energy from the higher levels, andensouls the spirillae of the three permanent atoms.b. The second group, being the positive energy that attracts, builds and formsthe body of man on the three planes.c. The lowest group are the negative aspect of energised substance and thematter of the three sheaths.In connection with the solar system they embody the Brahma aspect, being theproduct of earlier cycles wherein conscious activity was achieved, butself-consciousness was only arrived at by certain cosmic entities who passedthrough conscious substance, and gave to it that potentiality which will enableatomic substance—after many kalpas—to develop self-consciousness. In connectionwith a planet, they are called by a mysterious name which may not be revealed,as it conceals the mystery of the scheme which preceded ours, and of which oursis a reproduction. There are Pitris who work in connection with a planet, andwith a solar system as well as those working in connection with the humankingdom. They embody the energy of substance as demonstrated in a system, ascheme and a human cycle.There are also in connection with our peculiar Earth scheme, those lunar Pitriswho reached their present stage of activity in the moon chain. They are devagroups but (unlike the Agnishvattas) they have not passed through the humanstage; for them it has yet to be achieved, and their present experience inconnection with the human Hierarchy has that end in view. It should beremembered that it is a fundamental law in occult development that any life canonly give out that [781] which it has possessed, and possession of the varyingattributes of consciousness from that of the atom up to the consciousness of asolar Logos, is the result of long cycles of acquirement. The solar Pitris,therefore, could give to man his consciousness; the lunar Pitris could give tohim the instinctual consciousness of his vehicles. In their aggregate in all thekingdoms of nature, on this planet and elsewhere, they give to the planetaryLogos and to the solar Logos the sumtotal of the form consciousness of Theirrespective bodies. This is the case in every scheme in the system, but in theEarth chain a peculiar condition of affairs was brought about through theplanetary failure coincident with the moon chain; this is the cause of thepresent balancing of forces on this chain. The fourth chain in every scheme seesthe work of the solar Pitris in connection with man begun. It sees also thePitris of his sheaths in activity through the impulse given by the solar Angels.The matter of those sheaths has passed through three chains and three rounds andis vibrant to a note which is tuned to the....To word it otherwise, the thirdcan be clearly sounded, and is followed naturally by the fifth, or the dominant.The simultaneous sounding of the third and the fifth, basing it upon theplanetary keynote, produces the effect of a threefold chord, or a fourth tone, acomplex sound. I am here dealing with the chord of the human hierarchy as awhole. Within the hierarchy there is again diversity, based upon thehierarchical chord, and this produces the many egoic chords and notes; theseproduce in their turn objective manifestation.We can now trace the progress of egoic energy as it passes down from theabstract levels to the permanent atoms. On each plane the work is threefold, andmight be tabulated as follows:1. The response within the permanent atom to the vibration set up by the solarPitris; to word it otherwise: [782] the response of the highest group of lunarPitris to the chord of the Ego. This definitely affects the spirillae of theatom, according to the stage of evolution of the Ego concerned.2. The response of the substance to the atomic vibration upon the particularplane involved. This concerns the second group of Pitris, whose function it isto gather together the substance attuned to any particular key, and to aggregateit around the permanent atom. They work under the Law of Magnetic Attraction,and are the attractive energy of the permanent atom. On a tiny scale eachpermanent atom has (to the substance of a man’s sheaths) a position relative tothat which the physical sun holds to the substance of the system. It is thenucleus of attractive force.3. The response of the negative substance concerned and its moulding into thedesired form through the dual energy of the two higher groups of Pitris. Somethought of the unity of this threefold work has been given in thedifferentiation of the substance of any plane into:a. Atomic substance.b. Molecular substance.c. Elemental essence.This differentiation is not entirely accurate, and a truer idea of theunderlying concept might be conveyed if the word “energy” took the place of“substance and essence.” This third group of Pitris is really not correctlytermed Pitris at all. The true lunar Pitris are those of the first and highestgroup, for they embody one aspect of the intelligent will of Brahma, or ofGod-in-substance. The third group are literally the lesser Builders, and areblind incoherent forces, subject to the energy emanating from the two highergroups. Occultly these three groups are divided into the following: [783]a. The Pitris who see, but touch nor handle not.b. The Pitris who touch but see not.c. The Pitris who hear but neither see nor touch.As they all have the gift of occult hearing, they are characterised as the“Pitris with the open ear”; they work entirely under the influence of the egoicmantram. If these differentiations are studied a great deal may become apparentanent a very important group of deva workers. They are a group who only comeinto manifestation as a co-ordinated triplicity in the fourth round in order toprovide vehicles for man; the reason for this lies hid in the karma of the sevenLogoi, as They energise the fourth, fifth and sixth Hierarchies. In the earlierround in each scheme these three groups attain a certain stage of necessitatedgrowth, and embody the highest evolution of the substance aspect. Only thehighest and most perfected of the atoms of substance find their way into thevehicles of man,—those which have been the integral parts of the higherevolutionary forms.(g.) The Work of Form-building. This work of form-building proceeds underdefinite laws, which are the laws of substance itself; the effect is the samefor human, planetary and solar vehicles. The different stages might beenumerated as follows: 1. The Nebulous . The stage wherein the matter of thecoming sheath begins to separate itself gradually from the aggregate of planesubstance, and to assume a nebulous or milky aspect. This corresponds to the“fire-mist” stage in the formation of a solar system and of a planet. The Pitrisof the Mist are then active as one of the many subsidiary groups of the threemajor groups.2. The Inchoate. Condensation has set in but all is as yet inchoate, and thecondition is chaotic; there is no definite form. “The Pitris of the Chaos” holdsway, and are characterised by excessive energy, and violent activity, for thegreater the condensation prior to co-ordination [784] the more terrific are theeffects of activity. This is true of Gods, of men, and of atoms.3. The Fiery. The internal energy of the rapidly congregating atoms and theireffect upon each other produces an increase of heat, and a consequentdemonstration of the spheroidal form, so that the vehicle of all entities isseen to be fundamentally a sphere, rolling upon itself and attracting andrepulsing other spheres. “Pitris of the Fiery Spheres” add their labours tothose of the earlier two and a very definite stage is reached. The lunar Pitrison every scheme, and throughout the system, are literally the active agents inthe building of the dense physical body of the Logos; they energise thesubstance of the three planes in the three worlds, the mental, the astral andthe dense physical planes of the system. This needs much pondering upon.4. The Watery. The ball or sphere of gaseous fiery essence becomes still morecondensed and liquefied; it begins to solidify on its outer surface and thering-pass-not of each sheath is more clearly defined. The heat of the spherebecomes increased and is centralised at the core or heart of the sphere where itproduces that pulsation at the centre which characterises the sun, the planet,and the various vehicles of all incarnating entities. It is an analogous stageto that of the awakening of life in the foetus during the prenatal stage, andthis analogy can be seen working out in the form-building which proceeds onevery plane. This stage marks the co-ordination of the work of the two highergroups of lunar Pitris, and the “Pitris of the Dual Heat” are now intelligentlyco-operating. The heart and brain of the substance of the slowly evolving formare linked. The student will find it interesting to trace the analogy of this,the watery stage, to the place the astral plane holds in the planetary andsystemic body, and the alliance between mind and heart which is hidden in theterm “kama-manas.” One [785] of the profoundest occult mysteries will berevealed to the consciousness of man when he has solved the secret of thebuilding of his astral vehicle, and the forming of the link which exists betweenthat sheath and the astral light in its totality on the astral plane.5. The Etheric. The stage is not to be confined to the building of the physicalbody in its etheric division, for its counterpart is found on all the planeswith which man is concerned in the three worlds. The condensation and thesolidification of the material has proceeded till now the three groups of Pitrisform a unity in work. The rhythm set up has been established and the worksynchronised. The lesser builders work systematically and the law of Karma isdemonstrating actively, for it should be remembered that it is the inherentkarma, colouring, or vibratory response of the substance itself which is theselective reaction to the egoic note. Only that substance which has (throughpast utilisation) been keyed to a certain note and vibration will respond to themantram and to the subsequent vibrations issuing from the permanent atom. Thisstage is one of great importance, for it marks the vital circulation throughoutthe entire vehicle of a particular type of force. This can be clearly seen inrelation to the etheric body which circulates the vital force or prana of thesun. A similar linking up with the force concerned is to be seen on the astraland the mental planes. “The Pitris of the Triple Heat” are now workingsynthetically, and the brain, the heart and the lower centres are co-ordinated.The lower and the higher are linked, and the channels are unimpeded so that thecirculation of the triple energy is possible. This is true of the form buildingof all entities, macrocosmic and microcosmic. It is marked by the activeco-operation of another group of Pitris, termed “The Pitris of Vitality” inconnection with the others. Group after group co-operate, [786] for the threemain bodies are distributed among many lesser.6. The Solid. This marks the final stage in actual form building, and signifiesthe moment wherein the work is done as regards the aggregating and shaping ofsubstance. The greater part of the work of the lunar Pitris stands nowaccomplished. The word “solid” refers not solely to the lowest objectivemanifestation, for a solid form may be ethereal, and only the stage of evolutionof the entity involved will reveal its relative significance.All that has been here laid down as to the progressive stages of formconstruction on every plane is true of all forms in all systems and schemes, andis true of all thought-form building. Man is constructing thoughtforms all thetime, and is following unconsciously the same method as his Ego pursues inbuilding his bodies, as the Logos follows in building His system, and as aplanetary Logos uses in constructing His scheme.A man speaks, and a very diversified mantram is the result. The energy thusgenerated swings into activity a multitude of little lives which proceed tobuild a form for his thought; they pursue analogous stages to those justoutlined. At this time, man sets up these mantric vibrations unconsciously, andin ignorance of the laws of sound and of their effect. The occult work that heis carrying on is thus unknown to him. Later he will speak less, know more, andconstruct more accurate forms, which will produce powerful effects on physicallevels. Thus eventually in distant cycles will the world be “saved,” and notjust a unit here and there.In connection with this building of man’s sheaths certain interesting points ofmanifestation occur which might be dealt with now, leaving the student to workout the correspondences in relation to the system and the planet, and givingonly general indications which may be of use to him in his conclusions.[787] In all the work of form-building, certain very vital occasions occur whichconcern the Ego even more than the sheaths themselves, though the reflex actionbetween the lower personal self and the higher is so close as to be well nighinseparable.The moment wherein the Ego appropriates the sheath. This takes place only afterthe fourth spirilla is beginning to vibrate, and the period differs according tothe power of the ego over the lower self. In connection with the dense physicalvehicle, an analogy can be seen when the Ego ceases from his work ofovershadowing, and at some period between the fourth and seventh year makes hiscontact with the physical brain of the child. A similar occurrence takes placein connection with the etheric vehicle, the astral, and the mental.The moment wherein the energy of the Ego is transmitted from one sheath to alower one. It is often overlooked that the path of incarnation is not a quickone, but that the Ego descends very slowly and takes possession gradually of hisvehicles; the less evolved the man, the slower is the process. We are dealinghere with the period of time which transpires after the Ego has made the firstmove towards descent, and not with the time which elapses between twoincarnations. This work of passing on to a plane for purposes of incarnationmarks a definite crisis, and is characterised by the exertion of the will insacrifice, the appropriation of the substance in love, and its energising intoactivity.The moment wherein the particular type of force with which any particular sheathis energised is appropriated. This brings the sheath concerned:a. Under the influence of the egoic ray,b. Under the influence of a particular subray of the egoic ray,c. And through that influence,— [788]Under certain astrological influences,Under certain planetary radiations,Under the influences of certain force currents, emanating from certainconstellations.These three events have a very interesting analogy in connection with the workof the Logos in the construction of His physical body, the solar system, andalso in certain correspondences which can be seen embodied in facts dealt withat the first three Initiations.From the standpoint of the lower self, the two most vital moments in the work ofthe reincarnating Ego, are those in which the mental unit is re-energised intocyclic activity, and in which the etheric body is vitalised. It concerns thatwhich links the centre at the base of the spine with a certain point within thephysical brain via the spleen. This is dealing purely with the physiologicalkey.We might now touch upon a very interesting point concerning the dense physicalbody, dealing therefore with that which is not considered a principle either inthe macrocosm or the microcosm. As we know, man is essentially mental man, andastral man; then the two take to themselves an etheric sheath for purposes ofobjective work. That is the true lower man, these two in the etheric body. Butlater—in order to know even on the lowest plane of all—man takes to himself acoat of skin, as the Bible expresses it, and puts on (over his etheric body)that outer illusory form we know so well. It is his lowest point of objectivityand his direct “imprisoning.” This appropriation of a dense sheath by the Ego issubject to a very peculiar piece of karma connected with the four Kumaras, orHeavenly Men, Who form the logoic Quaternary. In the schemes which concern thelogoic Triad (or those of the three major Rays or Heavenly Men) dense physicalincarnation is not the appointed [789] lot, and man functions in his lowestmanifestation in etheric matter.This appropriation of the lowest body is distinguished in several ways from theapproach to the other sheaths. For one thing, there is no permanent atom to bevitalised. The physical plane is a complete reflection of the mental; the lowestthree subplanes reflect the abstract subplanes and the four etheric subplanesreflect the four mental concrete planes. The manifestation of the Ego on themental plane (or the causal body) is not the result of energy emanating from thepermanent atoms as a nucleus of force but is the result of different forces, andprimarily of group force. It is predominantly marked by an act of an exteriorforce, and is lost in the mysteries of planetary karma. This is equally true ofman’s lowest manifestations. It is the result of reflex action, and is based onthe force of the group of etheric centres through which man (as an aggregate oflives) is functioning. The activity of these centres sets up an answeringvibration in the three lowest subplanes of the physical plane, and theinteraction between the two causes an adherence to, or aggregation around, theetheric body of particles of what we erroneously term “dense substance.” Thistype of energised substance is swept up in the vortex of force currents issuingfrom the centres and cannot escape. These units of force, therefore, pile upaccording to the energy direction around and within the etheric sheath till itis hidden and concealed, yet interpenetrating. An inexorable law, the law ofmatter itself, brings this about, and only those can escape the effect of thevitality of their own centres who are definitely “Lords of Yoga” and can—throughthe conscious will of their own being—escape the compelling force of the Law ofAttraction working on the lowest cosmic physical subplane.An interesting analogy (accurate on general lines [790] though in detail not soapparent) exists between the building of the antaskarana on mental levelsbetween the mental unit and the manasic permanent atom (whereby the Path ofLiberation is travelled, and man set free) and the opening up of the channelbetween the centre at the base of the spine and the brain and thence to the headcentre. Through this latter channel man escapes out of the dense physical body,and continuity of consciousness (between the astral and the physical planes) isreached. In the one case, through right direction of force, the etheric web nolonger forms a barrier; it is destroyed and the man is fully conscious in thephysical brain of what transpires on the astral plane. In the other case, thecausal body also is eventually destroyed through the right direction of force.We will not here take up the specific work of building upon the scaffolding ofthe etheric body the dense physical form. It has been sufficiently dealt with inother books. We will only want to touch upon two more points which are ofinterest in this consideration of the work of the lunar Pitris in building man’sbody.In connection with the building of the dense body, it should be stated that itappears as a human form, much in the nature of a cross within the ovoid of theother spheres. It is notably of a fivefold nature:Head.Two Arms.Two Legs.According to the position assumed by the man, he is seen as a symbol of thecross and is then fourfold (the two legs being considered as one lower limb) or,if separated, as fivefold, and has been then considered as the symbol of thefive-pointed star. This fivefold nature of the dense physical body is broughtabout through the fact that only five centres primarily are really active inaverage man [791] up to the third Initiation; all are there, and all arevitalised, but only five in this fivefold normal evolution are dominant. Theforce emanating from these five, therefore, sweeps the dense substance into aclose aggregation. As two of the centres are not functioning as actively as theother five, an ovoid is not formed as in the case of the etheric, astral andmental sheaths. The fivefold shape of physical man is the result of the fivefolddirection of force currents from five centres.It might be interesting also to point out that the interaction of the energy ofthe solar Pitris and of the lunar Pitris produces a very definite effect uponthe lower group of lunar Pitris, and is one of the means whereby they willeventually reach the stage at which the solar Pitris are. This (if fullyrealised by man) will bring him to a very careful control of his sheaths, and toa close attention to the direction in which his force or energy is turned. He isresponsible for the work of aiding in the evolution of substance, being himselfa manasaputra.(h.) Incarnation and Karma . In resuming our consideration of the processpursued by the reincarnating Ego, it is necessary to point out that the entiresubject radically concerns energy , and that according to the place in evolutionof the unit of force involved, so will the length of time required for theprocess be brief, or the reverse. In the early stages, the initiatory impulse isheavy and slow, and the matter required for the sheaths is of a correspondingly“low” grade, that is, it is of low vibratory capacity, and the time elapsingbetween the first vibration outwards on the mental plane, and the coordinationof the dense physical body is a long one. Later on, the vibration becomes morepowerful and the effects therefore are more rapidly felt. At the close ofevolution, when the human unit is upon the Path and consciously controlling hisdestiny, and working off [792] karma, the intervals intervening between twoincarnations are brief or not as the man may choose in the interests of the workto be done, and according to his intention to achieve liberation from form. Itmust also be remembered that as the evolutionary process proceeds, the egoicactivity calls out response not only from substance in the three worlds, butalso from the formless levels of the system. The response will be felt finallyon monadic levels. Then, after a moment of equilibrium, the effect of the rhythmis felt entirely on the higher planes, and leaves the lower.The word “moment” is used here in its occult significance to specify a period oftime, and must be considered as a period relative to a day or year of Brahma.One of the secrets of initiation is concerned with the apprehension of cycles,and with their duration, and the following terms have to be appreciated, theirduration recognised, and their antithesis (an intervening pralaya) dulyconsidered before a man is considered a true occultist.a. 100 years of Brahma An occult century. The period of a solar system. b. Oneyear of Brahma The period of seven chains, where the seven planetary schemes areconcerned. c. One week of Brahma The period of seven rounds in one scheme. Ithas a chain significance. d. One day of Brahma The occult period of a round. e.One hour of Brahma Concerns interchain affairs. f. One Brahmic minute Concernsthe planetary centres, and therefore egoic groups. g. One Brahmic momentConcerns an egoic group, and its relation to the whole.These are the greater periods of time, and when their significance iscomprehended, much that is now obscure [793] will be revealed. As yet, it isonly to initiates that the true figures are given, the figures in the SecretDoctrine , such as the 100 years of Brahma, strike the general average but itmust be ever remembered that in considering the figures where a scheme, forinstance, is concerned, much latitude has to be allowed for individual planetarykarma, and idiosyncrasy.The following points are worthy of consideration when upon this subject, anddeal with some interesting factors.All the planetary Rishis are not equally “long-lived,” in the occult sense ofthe term, and the seven planetary Logoi of the seven sacred planets are atdifferent stages of evolution; Their vibratory response, therefore, differs,producing varying effects in time.The three major planetary schemes (Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn) have not, asyet, received their fullest stimulation, and will not do so until the “energy ofthe sacred seven” has been transferred to Them. Figures, therefore, as regardstheir duration and persistence are not in order.The figures for the planets concerned with the “inner round” differ as to lengthof time but not as to space location from those of other planets.The true figures in connection with any planetary scheme and its occult activityare not ascertainable by the man who cannot be trusted with the significance ofthe other planetary bodies (of great number) within the solar ring-pass-not. Theentire solar sphere is full of such bodies, characterised by the same featuresas are the seven and the ten, and each of them in some degree has an effect uponthe whole. Figures, therefore, cannot be considered as final until the effect ofthe lesser planetary bodies upon their immediate neighbours is known, and theextent of their planetary radiation has been gauged. There are more than 115 ofsuch bodies to be reckoned with, and all are at varying stages of vibratory[794] impulse. They have definite orbits, they turn upon their axis, they drawtheir “life” and substance from the sun, but owing to their relativeinsignificance, they have not yet been considered factors of moment. Thisattitude of mind will change when etheric vision is a fact, and the reality ofthe existence of an etheric double of all that is in manifestation will berecognised by scientists. This fact will be demonstrated towards the close ofthe century, and, during the early part of the next century a revolution inastronomical circles will occur which will result in the study of the “ethericplanets.” As these bodies are organs of energy, permeating the dense form, thestudy of the interaction of solar energy, and the occult “give and take” ofplanetary bodies will assume a new significance. Certain planetary bodies (bothgreater and lesser) are “absorbers,” others are “radiators,” while some are inthe stage of demonstrating a dual activity, and are being “transmuted.” Allthese circumstances require to be considered by the initiate who is dealing withcycles.Figures also must be computed when the effect upon the planets of what arecalled “asteroids” is known. This is much greater than exoteric science has sofar admitted, but the significance of this must eventually be interpreted interms of energy and on etheric levels.Another factor in computation which must also be considered is the effect of thevarious moons upon any planetary scheme, and the true meaning of the eighthsphere in connection with dense substance. Every moon is occultly a “point ofcorruption,” or that which is passing off in noxious gases. The transmutation ofthe form has been proceeded with in their case to a point where all thatrepresents vital energy has left, all solar life has passed off, no remnants ofpranic energy remain, and that which is to be seen is simply the decay of thephysical body,—a decay which is proceeding on etheric levels as well as [795] onphysical. The decay of a moon has as great an evil effect upon all that contactsit as a decaying body on earth has upon its surroundings. It is occultly“offensive.” This will be more truly apprehended when the etheric double of ourmoon is studied. As the moon becomes small through the process ofdisintegration, its effect upon the Earth will be correspondingly lessened, andthis stage will be paralleled by a consequent greater freedom from evil impulseof the sons of men. Better conditions among the animals will be another resultabove all else, and the dying out of that which is noxious in the animalkingdom. By the time the seventh round is reached, the evil effect of the thenmoon (which will have to all intents and purposes practically disappeared) willbe finished. During the fifth round, men will discover how to neutralise anyremaining effects through scientific achievement and knowledge of the necessarysounds and mantrams, and thus much evil will be offset. The etheric moon isincluded in these remarks. The greatest effect of moon conditions is to be seenworking out predominantly in the terror, and present distress in the animalkingdom. (Bible. Romans, 8:22.)A further factor in cyclic computation lies in the effect of the following starsand constellations upon our system and upon any particular scheme within thesystem:a. The Great Bear.b. The Little Bear.c. The Pole Star, especially where our planet is concerned.d. The Pleiades.e. The constellation of Capricorn.f. Draco.g. Sirius.h. The various constellations and stars of the Zodiac.[796] The mystery is hidden in esoteric astrology, and until the subject ofenergy working through the etheric body, of radioactivity, and of thetransmutation of all bodies from a lower state into a higher is bettercomprehended, the true mystery of the “influence” of these various bodies uponeach other will remain at its present stage—an unrevealed secret. If theradiatory effect of a human being or of a group of human beings upon each otheris as yet practically an unknown thing from the standpoint of practical science,so the occult effect of these greater forms upon each other remains unknown.Science recognises certain effects, leading and tending to the general coherenceof the universe, just as the general laws of the social order among men aretheoretically apprehended, but the true scientific realisation ofenergy-radiations emanating from the etheric bodies of all these suns and groupsof suns, and from all these planets and groups of planets is little understood.Their atomic activity is recognised, but that department of their being, whichfinds its correspondence in “animal magnetism” in man, is little realised, whilethe even more potent factor of the magnetic radiation of their astral bodies istotally uncalculated, nor is it admitted. All these factors have to be allowedfor in any consideration of the factor of time and cycles, and the true esotericknowledge is not to be gained by the study of figures by the lower mind. Itcomes as the result of the intuition and is stimulated at initiation.All that has here been pointed out, can be applied equally (though in a veryfinite sense) to the ego and its cycles, and also equally, considerations otherthan the purely “personal” will enter into its time periods. The influence ofother groups and of other units, the effects of radiation from other rays, andof certain types of force as yet unrevealed, and thus outside our consideration,are concerned with its appearing, with the duration of its [797] manifestation,its subsequent obscuration, and final pralayic interval. As the Ego has timeperiods corresponding to those of Brahma, and its “100 years” and its “777incarnations” have a solar analogy, so equally groups of Egos differ as to time,just as the planetary schemes are analogous in evolution but differ where theirperiods are concerned. The Law of Periodicity is one, but as it is based uponinitial impulse, and upon the rhythmic beat of the “central heart” or the“central sun” of any organism (solar system, planetary scheme, planetary chain,egoic group or individual egoic life) the true nature or “family” of any suchorganism must be ascertained before cyclic pronouncements can be made with anyhope of approximate accuracy. This was why H. P. B. sought to emphasise the needof studying the “astral family” and occult heredity of any person, for in theastral is to be found the clue to the “egoic family or group.” With this cluethe student can then ascertain the characteristics of his group on egoic levels,its place among other egoic groups, and eventually his ray or group centre. Astime elapses, the true study of heredity and esoteric transmission will open up,and the whole fabric of thought built up around such modern expressions as:a. Consanguinity or blood tiesb. Physical heredityc. Atavismd. Intermarriagee. Family relationshipsf. The family unitg. Soul matesh. Divorce and many other termswill be shifted to higher planes, and will be recognised and used in connectionwith soul relationships. They are, as yet, but a faint realisation on thephysical plane of [798] certain inner relations, which are seeking outerresponse. When all aggregates of ideas are interpreted in terms of force andenergy, in terms of attraction and repulsion, or the vibratory response of unitsto each other, and of aggregates of units to other groups, we shall have theclearing up of many problems and a simplification of life. Men will be true totheir group affiliations, and the present misgrouping and mismating willgradually, through knowledge, die out.We can now take up the consideration of karma in its relation to the act ofreincarnation. As we are well aware, the law of karma is the most stupendous lawof the system and one which it is impossible for the average man in any way tocomprehend, for, if traced back along its central root and its manyramifications, one eventually reaches the position where causes antedating thesolar system have to be dealt with, and this point of view can only be usefullygrasped by a high initiate.This great law really concerns, or is based on causes which are inherent in theconstitution of matter itself and on the interaction between atomic unitswhether we use this expression in connection with an atom of substance, a humanbeing, a planetary atom or a solar atom.We might express it also in saying that the will aspect or initiatory impulse isprimarily that which produces cause, which is cause itself. It should beremembered ever that cause involves the idea of duality, i.e., that whichinitiates, and that which is produced simultaneously by the initiation. The twoideas are inseparable, yet nevertheless the second idea in its most abstractconnotation must not be considered literally as an effect ; true effect involvesa third idea. Some appreciation of the problem may be gleaned by a considerationof phenomena which ever involves this dual initiatory cause and its objectiveeffect: [799]a. Spirit-matter in dual activity produces the objective universe.b. Electric fire and fire by friction when brought into contact produce solarfire; it flashes forth from darkness, yet a darkness which is potent withenergy.c. Will-desire is the cause of incarnation; the will-to-be reacting on substance(whose main quality is desire or responsiveness to sensation) produces the formsthrough which the central Life or Existence seeks expression.d. Ideas and thought-matter together produce thoughtforms.If the student considers these points, it will become apparent that it is notpossible for him to do more than study the effects produced by the juxtapositionof the pairs of opposites; he cannot dissociate them in his mind and deal withSpirit per se , or with matter per se any more than the atom of substance inman’s physical body can dissociate itself from that body, and consider itselfindependently of form influences. All atoms are always controlled by thefollowing factors, just as a man in the body of a planetary Logos, and aplanetary Logos within His greater Whole will be equally controlled by the samebasic principles:The influence and quality of the organ or unit in which it finds a place. In thehuman atom this means his group force or influence.The life influence of the entire physical body of which any atom is a corporatepart. In the human atom this means the influence of the particular centre inwhich his egoic group has a place, and the type of energy which it embodies.The life influence of the desire or astral body , the strongest karmic agencywhich has to be considered. [800] In the human atom, this involves the influenceof the three centres in the body of the Heavenly Man which form any specific“force triangle,” and which have much to do with the liberation of groups ofEgos from manifestation.The life influences of the mental body , or of that principle which imposes uponthe atom the quality of activity in form, which governs the reaction of the atomto its group life, and which enables the quality of its life to be demonstrated.In the human atom this concerns those causes which are incident to a man’s Ray,or literally the influence of the life of the planetary Logos as He functions asa self-conscious Life on His Own plane, as He works out His Own plans, andconsequently sweeps into activity the cells of His body as mere incidents whereHe (the basic central life) is concerned.The life impulse of the Thinker functioning in the causal body who—though agreat abstraction or the Absolute where the cellular life is concerned—isnevertheless a potent and active factor in the imposition of rhythm upon theatom in every body. In the human atom, this brings in the influence of the lifeof the solar Logos, for that Life imposes rhythm upon every human atom in thesystem, and does so through the agency of substance and its inherent quality,sensation.In these thoughts, we have but approached the study of karma from a fresh angle,and endeavoured to show the sources of the “influences” which play upon allatomic lives.The atom likewise is controlled by its own “esse,” or by its own inherent natureor vibration, which was the quality of matter itself before it was aggregatedinto a solar system, and which was the vibratory activity produced through therhythmic life of an earlier solar system. [801] This is equally true of allatoms of all grades, but only in connection with the atom of substance, and tosome degree with the human atom, is it in any way possible to ascertain thepredisposing causes. Until the mystery of the Great Bear is revealed and isknown as it is, and until the influence of the Pleiades is comprehended, and thetrue significance of the cosmic triangle formed bya. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear,b. The seven planetary Logoi of our solar system,c. The seven Pleiades or Sisters,is revealed, the karma of the seven sacred planets will remain unknown. All thatwe can see is its working out in the solar system. The intricacy of the wholesubject will be apparent when it is borne in mind that not only do these threegroups form a cosmic triangle, but that within that triangle many lessertriangles have to be studied. Any one of the seven Rishis with one of ourplanetary Logoi and one of the seven Sisters may form a subsidiary triangle, andall must thus be studied.In connection with the karma of the solar Logos, the subject is even moreabstract and incomprehensible. It lies hidden—not in the sevenconstellations—but in the three constellations which concern the three bodies ofHis Personality and which in themselves are but manifestations of a central LIFEpast our concept and our recognition. It concerns the manifestation in time andspace of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID, and Whose relationship to thesolar Logos finds a faint analogy in that of the planetary Logos to man, thehuman unit. It profits not to extend the thought any further.We are but seeking to emphasise the fact of the interdependence of all atoms andforms, to lay stress upon the reality of the variety of influences which playupon all [802] that is manifesting, and to call attention to the fact of thekarma of the past aeons, kalpas and that unknowable period in which theinitiatory impulses were set up which are still persisting, and which God, manand atoms are still working out and off. Influences or vibrations, calling forthresponse, play upon every form and atom in the solar system and all that can bepredicated of them is that they tend to develop consciousness of some kind,impose certain rhythms according to that conscious response, and produceaggregations or group activity.The liberation from karma about which would-be occult students so glibly talk isafter all but the freeing of the atom from its own personal problem (the problemof response to unitary sensation), and its conscious acquiescence in groupresponse and work. It marks the dissociation of the human atom from the rhythmimposed upon him by the lower “influences” which find their channel of approachthrough his vehicles, or lunar bodies, and his consequent willing recognition ofthe will-impulse of his greater whole, or the life of the egoic group—a centrein the planetary body. It involves atomic control, but involves also conscioussubjection to the karma of the Heavenly Man. Man is no longer the slave of therhythm of matter per se , but controls it in the three worlds of his endeavour;he is still nevertheless controlled by the group karma of the planetary centre,by its influence, life and vibratory impulse. The same can be predicated of aHeavenly Man, and of a solar Logos.We might, in closing, express the same thought in terms of fire, rememberingthat words only limit and confine the thought, and that the main reason for thismode of approach is to bring pictorially before man some aspects of the centralidea.“Electric fire, or will-impulse” in conjunction with “fire by friction” produceslight or “solar fire.” Electric fire is force or energy of some kind, and hencein itself [803] is fundamentally an emanation. “Fire by friction” is substancewith the quality of heat as its predominant characteristic; it is latent heat orsensation. Both these ideas, therefore, convey the idea of duality. An emanationmust have its originating source, and heat is but the result of friction, and isnecessarily dual. Both these concepts involve facts long antedating the solarsystem, and hidden in the Universal Mind. All that we can scientificallyascertain is the nature of that which is produced by their approximation, andthis is solar fire or light. These thoughts may make clear somewhat thesignificance of the number five, esoterically considered. Electric fire, beingan emanation is essentially dual in concept, and so is fire by friction; theytogether produce solar fire, and thus the esoteric fifth.It will be apparent that when a man speaks of karma, he is dealing withsomething much wider than the interplay of effect and cause within the sphere ofhis own individual routine. He is, in all things, governed by causes originatingin the aggregate of lives which form his egoic group, by the aggregate of groupswhich form one petal in a centre of a Heavenly Man, by force or purposecirculating through a triangle of centres, and by the life energy or purposefulwill of the planetary Logos Himself. Finally he is governed by the will of thesolar Logos as it demonstrates itself in initiatory activity. Beyond this weneed hardly go, but enough has been said to show that every human atom is underthe dominance of forces outside his own consciousness, which sweep him andothers into situations from which there is no escape, and which are to himincomprehensible.This has been at no time better illustrated than in the event of the late warand in present world conditions; these are effects of causes having their originin the renewed activity of a certain planetary triangle, and in the vibrationset up by our planetary Logos on the moon-chain, [804] and which had a faintbeginning in an earlier solar system. This vibration impinged primarily uponcertain atoms and groups of atoms in His body, principally those composing thehuman and animal kingdoms, and produced the apparently dire results which wehave been witnessing. So great was the effect of His energy, that the vegetablekingdom was somewhat (though not so much) affected, and the mineral kingdom feltthe effect in a startling manner, far more than the vegetable kingdom and almostas much as the animal. Here we have a setting of circumstances outside human andeven group control, which illustrates the helplessness of man in certainconditions, and which serves to bring in factors apparently apart from theindividual vibration of the fourth kingdom.Nevertheless, within limits, man definitely does “control his destiny,” and caninitiate action which produces effects recognisable by him as being dependentupon his activity along a particular line. He does, on a miniature scale, repeatthe procedure of the Logos on a vaster scale, and thus is the arbiter of his owndestiny, the producer of his own drama, the architect of his own home, and theinitiator of his own affairs. Though he may be the meeting place of forcesoutside his control, yet he can utilize force, circumstance and environment andcan turn them, if he so will, to his own ends.The working out of karmic law in a man’s own life might be broadly divided intothree divisions, in each of which a different type of energy is demonstrating,producing effects upon the lower and higher bodies of a definite nature.In the very early stages, when man is scarcely more than an animal, thevibratory activity of the atoms of his three sheaths (and of the lowestprimarily) governs all actions on his part. He is the victim of the vibratoryactivity of physical substance, and much that occurs is the [805] consequence ofthe interaction between the Ego and its lowest manifestation, the physicalsheath. The centre of attention is the physical body and only faintly are thetwo subtler bodies responding. The egoic impulse is slow and heavy, and thevibration is directed to producing response between the egoic consciousness andthe atoms of the physical body. The physical permanent atom is more active thanthe other two. It is the aspect of “fire by friction” which is fanned by theegoic breath, with a triple object in view:a. Co-ordinating the physical body.b. Increasing the resistance of the etheric web, a work which was only carriedto the desired point by the middle of the Atlantean root-race.c. Bringing certain of the lower centres to the necessary stage of expression.The heat of the atoms in the bodies is increased during this stage, and theiratomic life co-ordinated, while the triangle between the three permanent atomsbecomes a demonstrable fact and not a faint indication.During the second stage, the law of karma or karmic influence (through theinevitable reflex action produced by the increased activity of the sheaths)turns its attention to the working out of desire, and its transmutation into thehigher aspiration. Through experience, the pairs of opposites are recognised bythe Thinker, and he becomes no longer the victim of the vibratory impulses ofhis physical body; the factor of intelligent choice becomes apparent. The manbegins to discriminate between the pairs of opposites, choosing ever in theearly stages that which appeals most to his lower nature and that which hebelieves will bring him pleasure. The centre of the attention of the Ego is theastral body, and it becomes so closely co-ordinated with the physical body thatthe two form one united expression of desire. The mental body [806] remainscomparatively inactive at this stage. The love nature of the Ego is in processof being developed, and this stage is the longest of the three. It deals withthe evolution of the petals of the egoic lotus, and with the blending of solarfire and of fire by friction. Reflex action between the lower and the higherduring this middle period produces three effects, which will be seen, ifcarefully studied to convey much information anent the working out of the law ofKarma. These three effects are:1. The development of the astral permanent atom with a concurrent stimulation ofthe physical permanent atom, and thus the growth and evolution of the twosheaths concerned.2. The co-ordination of the threefold man through the innate vitality of theastral body and its effect upon the mental and the physical. This is thekama-manasic period, and as this body is the only complete sphere in thethreefold lower man, it is the most powerful body inherently for it embodies (asdoes the solar system) the heart aspect, or embryonic love nature, which it isthe object of macrocosmic and microcosmic evolution to develop.3. Finally the unfoldment of the nine egoic petals in three stages.In the working out of the law we must therefore note that man is first of allthe victim of the impulses of dense substance or of the brahma aspect, and thusrepeats rapidly the evolutionary process of the preceding solar system; in thesecond stage he is the victim of desire, or of his own love nature.In the third stage, the law of karma works through a man’s mental nature, andawakens in him recognition of the law, and an intellectual apprehension of causeand of effect. This is the shortest stage but is also the most powerful; itconcerns the evolution of the three inner [807] petals shielding the “jewel,”and their ability to disclose at the right moment that which lies hidden. Itcovers the period of the evolution of advanced man, and of the man upon thePath. In connection with the human family it covers the first half of the nextround, prior to the great separation. Electric fire is beginning to make itsradiations felt, and the will or purpose of the Ego is now consciously realisedupon the physical plane. The three permanent atoms form a triangle of light, andthe petals of the lotus are rapidly unfolding. When the will and purpose of theEgo are realised by man in his waking consciousness in the physical brain, thenthe law of karma in the three worlds is becoming neutralised, and man is on theverge of liberation. He has exhausted the initial vibration, and there is noresponse within his sheaths to the threefold vibration of the three worlds; hestands freed from the three kingdoms and the fourth.d. On the building of the Causal Body.We enter now upon one of the most vitally practical parts of our Treatise onFire, that which deals with the building of the causal body, or body ofmanifestation of the Ego. It concerns the work of the solar Angels, or the trueself-conscious Identity, man. If the student has in any way apprehended thegeneral trend of the earlier pages, he will now be in a condition of mind whichwill enable him to interpret all that is said in terms of energy, or of thatvibratory activity which is produced by the three major phases of electricalphenomena, the union which produces that divine manifestation called Man, or,when the aggregated units are considered, the human kingdom.(a) Introductory remarks. We have studied somewhat the constitution of theTriangles, or Pitris, Who, through self-sacrifice, endow man withself-consciousness, building his egoic vehicle out of Their own essence. We[808] have touched briefly upon the lunar Pitris, who endow man with his lowersheaths and principles through which the energy of the solar Lords may makeitself felt, and we shall now proceed to study three things:First, the effect of the higher energy upon the lower bodies, as it graduallymakes itself felt during the evolutionary process, and thus simultaneously“redeems” man in an occult sense, and also “elevates” the lunar Pitris.Second, the effect of this energy on the mental plane in the development andunfoldment of the egoic lotus.Third, the awakening to activity of the central Life within the lotus. Thisactivity demonstrates in a twofold manner:a. As the realisation by the man on the physical plane within the physical brainof his divine nature, resulting in a consequent demonstration of divinity uponearth, prior to liberation.b. As the conscious activity of the individual Ego on the mental plane inco-operation with its group or groups.In the first case, we have the effect of the egoic life upon its sheaths, andtheir subsequent control, and in the second case we have the self-awakening ofthe egoic unit on its own plane; in the third case, we have a group realisation,or the entrance by the unit into the consciousness of the Heavenly Man.It will not be possible to do more than indicate broad general lines ofdevelopment. The subject of egoic evolution cannot be fully comprehended untilafter initiation, but it is felt now by the Teachers on the inner side that themain principles had better be given out at once in view of the unexpecteddevelopment (since the opening of this century) of two great sciences:The Science of Electricity. The investigations of scientists [809] have beengreatly stimulated by the discovery of radium, which is an electrical phenomenonof a certain kind, and by the knowledge this discovery brought of theradioactive substances; the development of the many methods of utilisingelectricity has also greatly aided. This science has brought man to thethreshold of a discovery which will revolutionise world thought on thesematters, and which will eventually solve a great part of the economic problem,thus leaving many more persons free for mental growth and work. This expansionof knowledge can be looked for before one hundred and fifty years havetranspired.The Science of Psychology. The psycho-analytic theories which (though indicativeof progress) are yet tending in a wrong direction, may prove disastrous to thehigher development of the race unless the true nature of the “psyche” iselucidated. When the public mind has apprehended, even cursorily, the followingbriefly stated facts, the trend of popular education, the object of politicalscience, and the goal of economic and social endeavour will take a new andbetter direction. These facts might be summed up in the following postulates:I. Man is in essence divine. ( 259 [text00028.html#Y_FN259] ) This has ever beenenunciated throughout the ages, but remains as yet a beautiful theory or belief,and not a proven scientific fact, nor is it universally held. [810]II. Man is in fact a fragment of the Universal Mind, or world soul, (S. D., I,Proem., pp. 42-44.) and as a fragment is thus partaker of the instincts andquality of that soul, as it manifests through the human family. Therefore, unityis only possible upon the plane of mind. This, if true, must lead to thetendency to develop within the physical brain a conscious realisation of groupaffiliations on the mental plane, a conscious recognition of grouprelationships, ideals and goal, and a conscious manifestation of that continuityof consciousness which is the object of evolution at this time. It will furtherproduce the transference of the race consciousness from the physical plane tothe mental, and a consequent solving through “knowledge, love, and sacrifice” ofall present problems. This will bring about emancipation from the presentphysical plane disorder. It must lead to the education of the public as to thenature of man, and the development of the powers latent within him—powers whichwill set him free from his present limitations, and which will produce in thehuman family a collective repudiation of the present conditions. When meneverywhere recognise themselves and each other, as divine self-conscious units,functioning primarily in the causal body but utilising the three lower vehiclesonly as a means of contact with the three lower planes, we will have government,politics, economics and the social order readjusted upon sound, sane and divinelines.III. Man in his lower nature, and in his three vehicles, is an aggregate oflesser lives, dependent upon him for their group nature, for their type ofactivity, and collective response, and who— [811] through the energy or activityof the solar Lord—will themselves later be raised, and developed to the humanstage.When these three facts are understood, then and only then will we have a rightand just comprehension of the nature of man.Again, this realisation will bring about three changes in the thought of theage:(1) A readjustment of the medical knowledge of man , resulting in a truerunderstanding of the physical body, of its treatment, and of its protection, andthus producing a juster apprehension of the laws of health. The aim of thephysician will then be to find out what it is in a man’s life which ispreventing egoic energy from flooding every part of his being; to find out whatlines of thought are being indulged in which are causing that inertia of thewill aspect which is so conducive to wrongdoing; to ascertain what it is in theemotional body which is affecting the nervous system, and thus obstructing theflow of energy from the love petals of the egoic lotus (via the astral permanentatom) to the astral body, and from thence to the nervous system; to discoverwhat is the hindrance in the etheric body which is preventing the right flow ofprana, or of solar vitality to every part of the body.It is essential that in days to come medical men should realise that disease inthe physical body is incidental to wrong internal conditions. This is alreadybeing somewhat considered but the whole question will remain but a beautifultheory (even though an incontrovertible one in view of the achievements ofmental scientists and of the various faith healers) until the true nature of theego, its constitution, its powers, and its field of influence are dulyapprehended.This revelation will come when medical men accept this [812] teaching as aworking hypothesis, and then begin to note, for instance, the powers ofendurance shown by the great souls of the earth, and their capacity to work athigh pressure, and to remain practically immune from disease until (at the closeof a long life of usefulness) the Ego deliberately chooses to “die-out” ofphysical existence. It will come when the medical profession concentrates uponpreventative action, substituting sunshine, a vegetarian diet, and theapplication of the laws of magnetic vibration and vitality for the presentregimen of drugs and surgical operations. Then will come the time when finer andbetter human beings will manifest on earth. When also physicians learn thenature of the etheric body, and the work of the spleen as a focal point forpranic emanations, then sound principles and methods will be introduced whichwill do away with such diseases as tuberculosis, debility, malnutrition and thediseases of the blood and of the kidneys. When doctors comprehend the effect ofthe emotions upon the nervous system, they will turn their attention to theamelioration of environal conditions, and will study the effects of theemotional currents upon the fluids of the body, and primarily upon the greatnerve centres, and the spinal column. When the connection between the densephysical and the subtler bodies is a fact established in medical circles, thenwill the right treatment of lunacy, of obsessions, and of wrong mentalconditions be better comprehended, and the results more successful; finally,when the nature of egoic force, or of energy is studied, and the function of thephysical brain as the transmitter of egoic intent is better comprehended, thenthe coordination of man’s entire being will be studied, and illness, debilityand disease, will be traced to their just cause, and will be treated through thecause and not just through the effect.(2) The entire social world of thought will apply itself to the understanding ofthe emotional nature of [813] humanity, to the group relationships involved, andto the interaction between individuals and other individuals, between groups andother groups. These relationships will be interpreted wisely and broadly and aman will be taught his responsibility to the lesser lives which he ensouls. Thiswill produce a just direction of individual force, and its utilisation for thestabilisation, the development, and the refining of the substance of thedifferent vehicles. Men will also be taught their definite responsibility underlaw to their own individual families. This will bring about the protection ofthe family unit, and its scientific development; it will cause the eliminationof marital troubles, and the abolition of abuses of different kinds, soprevalent now in many family circles.Responsibility to the community in which a man is placed will likewise beemphasised. Men will be taught the true esoteric meaning of citizenship—acitizenship based upon egoic group relations, the law of rebirth, and the realmeaning of the law of karma. They will be taught national responsibility, andthe place of the community within the nation, and of the nation within thecomity of nations. Men will finally be taught their responsibility to the animalkingdom. This will be brought about in three ways:1. Man’s truer understanding of his own animal nature.2. A comprehension of the laws of individualisation, and the effect of theinfluence of the fourth, or human, kingdom upon the third, or animal, kingdom.3. The work of an Avatar of a lesser order Who will come in the beginning of thenext century to reveal to man his relationship to the third kingdom. His way isbeing prepared by the many who in these days are developing public interestthrough the [814] various societies for the benefit and protection of animals,and through the many stories to be found in books and current periodicals.We are told by H. P. B. (S. D., III, 580.) that the sense of responsibility isone of the first indications of egoic control, and as more and more of the humanfamily come under egoic influence, conditions will be bettered slowly andsteadily in every department of life.(3) In the educational world an apprehension of man’s true nature will bringabout a fundamental change in the methods of teaching. The emphasis will be laidupon teaching people the fact of the Ego on its own plane, the nature of thelunar bodies, and the methods of aligning the lower bodies so that the Ego cancommunicate direct with the physical brain, and thus control the lower natureand work out its purposes. Men will be taught how, through concentration andmeditation, they can ascertain knowledge for themselves, can develop theintuition, and thus draw upon the resources of the Ego. Then will men be taughtto think , to assume control of the mental body, and thus develop their latentpowers.In the above few remarks are indicated very briefly and inadequately the resultswhich may be looked for from a true understanding of the essential nature ofman. It has been written in view of the necessity these days of a statement asto the real or inner man, and as to the laws of the kingdom of God. That innerman has ever been known to be there, and the “kingdom within” has ever beenproclaimed until H. P. B. came and gave out the same old truths from a newangle, giving an occult turn to mystic thought. Now comes the opportunity forman to realise the laws of his own being, and in that realisation those whostand on the verge of intuitional apprehension of knowledge and those ofscientific bent who are willing to accept these truths as a working [815]hypothesis to be utilised as a basis for experiment until proven false, willhave the chance to solve the world problems from within. Thus will the Christprinciple be manifested upon earth, and thus will the Christ nature bedemonstrated to be a fact in nature itself.The value to the public thought of a true explanation of the evolution of theEgo, and its gradually developing power on earth is very great. There are twoways in which man may view this matter, both of which provide food formeditation, and well merit serious consideration. Both of them have beensomewhat dealt with by thinkers of many schools of thought, and hence do notrequire any lengthy elucidation. The problem may be regarded as one calling forthe elevation of the inner consciousness of the human unit (functioning in thephysical body) to the higher levels of the mental plane, and therefore involvesa raising or expansion of his waking consciousness till it becomes aware of thishigher life. This is the way of mystical approach, and many instances of itssuccessful accomplishment can be studied in the lives of the mystics of allages. By sheer devotion and strenuous application, and by a severe discipliningof the physical body, the mystic effects his entrance into the heart centre ofhis little system, and his life becomes irradiated by the beams of his owncentral sun—the egoic light divine. The problem may again be regarded as one inwhich the effort of the man is concentrated in an attempt to bring down into thephysical brain consciousness, and thus on to the physical plane, the life andpower and energy of the inner centre, the Ego. This involves necessarily ascientific apprehension of the laws of being, and a recognition of the dualnature of the Self. It involves a devotion to the work of bringing about adomination of the lunar lords through the radiant control of the solar Lord.This is the occult method. It is the method of studying the constitution ofthose entities who form the [816] fourfold lower nature, the personality, and aclose investigation of those divine Essences Who build the body of the Ego orhigher self. To this must be added a severe application of the laws of nature tothe individual problem.What is proposed in this Treatise is to follow the latter method, as the aim isto make clear the rationale of the process.(b) The evolution of the petals. The building of the causal body is the resultof dual energy, that of the lower self with its reflex action upon the higherunit, and that of the natural energy of the self as it makes its direct impressupon the substance of the egoic lotus. It should here be remembered that, subtlethough the material may be, the egoic lotus is as truly substance of aparticular vibration as is the physical body, only (owing to its rarity)physical plane man regards it practically as nonsubstantial. It is in fact, asearlier pointed out, the result of the dual vibration of the fivefold Dhyanis orGods in conjunction with the fourfold Quaternary, or the Pitris of the lowervehicles. Through a conscious effort of the planetary Logoi, these Dhyanis andlower Pitris are brought into a close relationship. This produces (upon thethird subplane of the mental plane) a ninefold vibration or whorl in the gaseousmatter of the plane—for this is the cosmic gaseous subplane—which, after acertain period of persistence, assumes the form of a nine-petalled lotus. Thislotus is folded over in bud shape upon the central point, or heart of thelotus—that spark of electric fire which by its action or innate vitality workingupon the substance of the lotus, attracts to itself sufficient of that substanceto form three inner petals, which closely shield the central spark; these arenevertheless of the same substance or essence as the nine other petals. Thestudent must be careful not to materialise his concept too much and it mighttherefore be wise for him to viewCHART VIII - THE EGOIC LOTUS AND THE CENTRES - COSMIC PHYSICAL PLANE[Image00014.jpg][818] this manifestation from other angles and employ other terms to express thesame idea. For instance, the body of the Ego may be viewed in the following fourways:As nine vibrations, emanating from a central point, which, in its pulsation orradiations produces three major vibrations of great force pursuing a circularactivity around the centre; the nine vibrations pursue a diagonal path untilthey reach the periphery of the egoic sphere of influence. At this point theyswing around, thus forming the well-known spheroidal form of the causal body.As nine petals of a lotus, radiating from a common centre, and hiding withinthemselves three central petals, which conceal a central point of fire. Theradiations from the tip of each petal are those which cause the illusion of aspheroidal shape.As nine spokes of a wheel , converging towards a central hub, which is in itselfthreefold, and which hides the central energy or dynamo of force—the generatorof all the activity.As nine types of energy which produce definite emanations from a threefold unit,again itself an outgoing from a central unit of force.For all purposes, the second definition will be the one of the most use to us inour attempt to picture the constitution, nature, method of development and trueevolution of the Ego, functioning in the causal body.In terms of fire, the same truths may be expressed as follows, and this shouldbe carefully pondered upon by the student of this Treatise:1. Electric fire Spirit Will aspect Jewel in the lotus. 2. Solar fireConsciousness Love aspect The nine petals. 3. Fire by friction SubstanceActivity aspect The three permanent atoms.[819] In electric fire , the Monad is represented in its threefold nature, andstands for that type of manifestation which will be brought to its highest stageof development in the next solar system.In solar fire , these solar Pitris in their ninefold formation represent andmake possible the unfolding of the consciousness of the Monad through the mediumof the Ego in the three worlds of human evolution.In fire by friction , the lunar Pitris are represented and constitute the lowerself, the personality, or those vehicles by means of which the Ego in turn is toacquire experience on the lower planes.Yet these three are one in manifestation within the egoic auric egg, and theinterchange of energy and vitality proceeds steadily. Spirit uses the Soul, orthe Ego, as a vehicle of enlightenment, and the Ego uses the lower Quaternary asits medium of expression. The evolution of Spirit can really therefore bedivided into three stages:First. The stage in which the lunar Pitris function primarily, and prepare thelower sheaths for occupancy. The lower vibrations control, and “fire byfriction” is that which warms and nourishes to the practical exclusion of allelse.Second. The stage in which the solar Pitris gradually become predominant, inwhich the egoic consciousness is developed. The sheaths are occupied by theThinker, are gradually controlled by him, are bent to his will and purpose, andare eventually discarded. The middle vibrations control and solar fireirradiates; it lights up in due course of evolution the lower sheaths; itgradually increases its heat, and eventually aids in the destruction of theforms.Third. The stage in which electric fire is revealed, and through the intensityof its blaze puts out the other fires. The lunar Pitris have fulfilled theirwork, the solar Pitris [820] have developed the self-conscious unit, man, andthe monad (having utilised both) discards both, and withdraws into itself, thistime plus the gain of material existence, and plus developed love-wisdom.In terms of the old Commentary, the truth is thus stated:“The Lord of Life Himself sits at the heart and watches. The Lords of solar firepursue their task and sacrifice themselves to the lunar Lords of all the lowerplanes. They die, but resurrect. They pass without, and come again. Yet the Lordof Life sits still.The lunar Lords begin to die; their power begins to wane with each successivecycle. The solar Lords shine forth in triumph and consign the fourfold ones tofire,—the fire which burns and dissipates the form.Many times the work repeats itself; the cycles wax and wane, until the daytriumphant when the solar Lord acclaims himself and knows himself the ruler.The Lord of Life then turns Himself, and arises in His might. He consumes thesolar Lords, and they perish as did the lunar Lords. He speaks a Word; the firedescends. The blaze bursts forth. Gone is the lower fire through the flame ofsolar burning, gone is the middle fire through the intensity of fire fromHeaven.Naught remaineth save a threefold flame of violet, indigo and yellow. THATdisappears. Then darkness reigns. Yet the Lord of Life persists, thoughinvisible.”As we know, the egoic lotus consists of three circles,—each circle beingcomposed of three petals, and all shielding the inner bud where hides the jewel.It is with the evolution of these petals that we are concerned, with theirformation, their vitalisation, their nurturing, and eventual unfoldment. It willbe useful for the student at this stage to remember that we are primarilydealing with the development of the second aspect in man, the love-wisdomaspect, and are only secondarily considering the third aspect, that of activitywhich finds its energising centres in the three permanent atoms.[821] These three circles of petals are called in the esoteric terminology:1. The “outer knowledge” triad, or the lords of active wisdom.2. The middle “love” triad, or the lords of active love.3. The inner “sacrificial” triad, or the lords of active will.The first is the summation of experience and developed consciousness; the secondis the application of that knowledge in love and service, or the expression ofthe Self and the Not-Self in reciprocal vibration; and the third is the fullexpression of knowledge and love turned toward the conscious sacrifice of all tothe furthering of the plans of the planetary Logos, and to the carrying out ofHis purposes in group work. Each of these three groups of petals come under thedefinite guidance of three groups of Agnishvattas, who form them out of theirown substance and who in essence are the threefold Ego during its manifestation.Through them flows the force and coherent energy of those mysterious Entitieswhom (when considering the human family as a whole) we call—a . The Buddhas or Lords of Activity.b. The Buddhas or Lords of Compassionate Love.c. Buddhas of Sacrifice, of Whom the Lord of the World is, to man, the bestknown exponent.Through these three groups flows that threefold energy which, on the mentalplane, finds its medium of expression in connection with the human kingdom, inthe three groups of Agnishvattas or solar Pitris above referred to. These groupsform the substance of the three circles of petals, and each group has also aspecial influence upon the particular petal belonging to their especial scale ofvibrations. For the sake of clarity, we might tabulate the various petals sothat the student may [822] get a clearer comprehension of the conformation ofhis own causal vehicle, and some idea of the various triangular relationships:I. The outer “knowledge” triad:a. Petal 1 Knowledge on the physical plane. Colours: Orange, green and violet.b. Petal 2 Love on the physical plane. Colours: Orange, rose and blue. c. Petal3 Sacrifice on the physical plane. Colours: Orange, yellow and indigo.These three petals are organised and vitalised in the Hall of Ignorance, butremain unopened and only begin to unfold as the second circle is organised.II. The middle “love” triad:a. Petal 1 Higher Knowledge applied through love on the physical and astralplanes. Colours: Rose, and the original three. b. Petal 2 Higher intelligentlove on the physical and astral planes. Colours: Rose and the correspondingthree. c. Petal 3 Loving intelligent sacrifice on the physical and astralplanes. Colours: Rose and the same three.These three petals preserve the fundamental orange but add the colour rose inevery petal, so that four colours are now seen. These petals are organised andvitalised in the Hall of Learning , but remain unopened. The outer tier ofpetals simultaneously unfolds till it is open entirely, revealing the secondcircle; the third remains shielded. [823]CHART IX - THE EGOIC LOTUS - COSMIC GASEOUS SUBPLANE[Image00015.jpg][824] III. The inner “sacrificial” triad:a. Petal 1 The Will to sacrifice through knowledge on the mental plane, and thusintelligently to dominate the entire threefold lower man. Colours: Yellow andthe four colours, orange, green, violet and rose. b. Petal 2 The will tosacrifice through love on the mental plane, and thus to serve. Colours: Yellowand the four colours, orange, violet, rose and blue. c. Petal 3 The uttersacrifice of all forever. Colours: Yellow, orange, rose, blue and indigo.In the mystery of these subsidiary colours and of the gradual shining forthwithin the lotus of five colours in any one petal at one time, is veiled themystery of the five Kumaras. (S.D., I, 483.) The student who seeks thesignificance of the preponderance of orange and of rose is approaching thesecret of the two Kumaras Who fell. More it is not possible to say, but thecolours hold the esoteric key to this great occurrence. This inner circle ofpetals is organised and vitalised in the Hall of Wisdom , and simultaneously themiddle circle unfolds, so that two rows of petals are duly opened, and only thethird remains to be unclosed. This final opening is effected during the periodof treading the stages of the Path of Initiation, and in this round it ishastened by the rites of initiation and by the strenuous and abnormal efforts ofthe man himself, aided by the electrical work of the Initiator, wielding the Rodof Power.Though we have thus divided off the different stages of development, we have butdealt with the general average, gathering our facts from the records to which wehave access and which are grouped in relation to this subject into the threegroups, related to:a. The Monads of power.b . The Monads of love.c. The Monads of activity.The student must remember that according to these groupings, so will be thetendency of the petals to unfold. For instance, in the case of the majority ofmen, being [825] Monads of Love, the love petals are more easily awakened, forlove is the nature of the present manifestation and the line of love in somedirection (low, high, or spiritual) is the line of least resistance for themany. Yet the Monads of activity are numerous and influential and the firstpetal in each ring is for them the easiest to unfold. For both groups the“knowledge” petal is the first opened, owing to the inherent nature of theManasadevas themselves, and their basic vibration. For all, sacrifice is thehardest, for it involves ever the two factors of intelligence andlove,—intelligent knowledge and a love that goes out to that which must be savedthrough sacrifice.In these three circles of petals lies concealed another clue to the mystery ofthe 777 incarnations. The figures do not convey an exact number of years, butare figurative and symbolical; they are intended to convey the thought of threecycles of varying duration, based upon the septenary nature of the manifestingmonad.First. The 700 incarnations . These concern the unfoldment of the outer circle.This is the longest period. The initial vibration is slow and heavy, andmillenia of lives have to elapse before the interchange of energy between theEgo and its reflection, the personal self (the lower threefold man) is such thatthe consciousness of the man occultly “awakens” in the Hall of Learning. Foradvanced man at this time these incarnations took place upon the moon chain andin some cases upon certain planets connected with the inner round. This is thecircumstance which necessitated his “coming-in” during the Atlantean root-race.Men of this type refused to incarnate earlier, as the bodies were too coarse;this was the cyclic reflection (on the lowest plane) of the refusal of theMonads to incarnate at the dawn of manvantaric opportunity. No real “sin” wascommitted; it was their privilege to discriminate, and this refusal has its[826] bearing upon conditions upon Earth, being the basis of the great classdistinctions which—in every land—have been so fruitful of trouble and theesoteric foundation of the “caste” system, so abused now in India. The problemof labor and capital has its roots in the subjective distinction between“equipped and unequipped” Egos, between those units of the human family on earthwho have passed out of the Hall of Ignorance, and those who are yet groping inits dark and gloomy corridors; between those Egos who are only “bud” Egos, andthose who have organised the outer circle of petals, and whose petals are readyto open up.The idea of a septenate of centuries must be carefully pondered upon, and asever in all occult matters, the idea of triplicity must be also borne in mindwith a synthesising period, which is a summation of the triple coordination:3 periods of 3 tens . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 90 years.1 synthesising period . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years. 100 years. This seven times repeated . . . . . . . . . . 7 years.700 years.Each cycle (again figurative cycles) leaves one of the petals more vitalised,and has a definite effect on each.Second. The 70 incarnations. These concern the unfoldment of the middle circle.Much may be learned from a consideration of the occult significance involved inthe sending out of their followers by any initiate (such as the Christ) ingroups of seventy, going two and two. These seventy incarnations primarilyeffect the development of love in the personal life, the evolution of the astralnature, based on the recognition of the pairs of opposites, and theirequilibrising in love and service.This cycle covers the period passed by the man in the [827] Hall of Learning andhas its correspondence in the Atlantean root-race and its conflict between theLords of the Dark Face and the Brotherhood of Light. Within the life of eachindividual, a similar conflict wages during this period, ending with the finalkurukshetra or battle-ground which earns for the man the right to tread theProbationary Path, and eventually the privilege to stand before the Portal ofInitiation. Again the numerical significance of the numbers must be studied;this time they are hid in the number ten, or three cycles of three lesserperiods, each making nine, and one synthesising period, leading up to theconsummation of one period within the greater cycle; this is signified by theten of relative perfection. (S. D., I, 214; II, 393, 445, 446.) ( 263[text00028.html#Y_FN263] ) The interplay between kamic impulse and manasicenergy has produced a realisation within the consciousness of the Ego of that[828] which he has learned within the two Halls; the outer circle of petals isunfolded, and the central ring is ready to open.Third. The 7 incarnations. These are those passed upon the Probationary Path.This is an interesting period in which certain things are effected which mightbe described in the following terms:The two outer rings of petals are stimulated in a new and special sense throughthe conscious act of the probationary disciple. Much of the work hitherto hasbeen pursued under the ordinary laws of evolution and has been unconscious. Nowall that changes as the mental body becomes active, and two of the will petalsare co-ordinated, and one “awakes” vitality and unfolds.The fire or energy from these two rings begins to circulate along the atomictriangle and when this is the case it marks a very momentous epoch; a dual workhas been consummated in the personal lower life and in the egoic:a. The permanent atoms have the four lower spirillae fully active (two groups oftwo each) and the fifth is in process of arousement into equal activity. Thetriangle is in circulatory action but has not yet achieved its full brightnessnor its rotary or fourth dimensional revolution.b. The two circles of petals are “awake,” one being wide open and the other onthe verge of opening.Thus in the life of the probationer two aspects of the divine life are makingthemselves apparent, and though as yet much remains to be done, neverthelesswhen the inner circle of petals is awakened—through the instrumentality of thecurious and abnormal process of initiation—the remaining aspect will be broughtinto similar prominence, and produce the perfected man in the three [829]worlds. Thus is the work of the Solar Pitris consummated.The fact of the abnormality of the process of initiation must here beemphasised.Initiation is in the nature of a great experiment which our planetary Logos ismaking during this round. In earlier and perhaps in later rounds the wholeprocess will follow natural law. In this round and on this chain, our planetaryLogos on His high level is what is esoterically called “sitting for yoga,” andis definitely undergoing certain processes of training in order to stimulate Hiscentres. This fact is being taken advantage of by the Hierarchy on Earth toproduce certain results in the races under Their guidance. The whole process isoptional, and a man may—if he so choose—follow the normal process, and takeaeons of time to effect what some are choosing to do in a briefer period,through a self-chosen forcing process.At the termination of the 777 incarnations, a man passes through the door ofinitiation and enters upon a brief synthesising process, or a final period inwhich he garners the fruits of the experience in the two first halls, andtransmutes knowledge into wisdom, transforms the shadow of things seen into theenergy of that which is, and achieves the final liberation from all the lowerforms which seek to hold him prisoner. This period of initiation itself isdivided into seven stages, but only five of these concern the evolution of theEgo, just as the five Kumaras concern primarily the evolution of Humanity in thesystem and on this planet. Thus again we have the four exoteric Kumaras, of Whomtwo fell, and the three esoteric, of whom One gathers the life forces of thefour exoteric, making with Them the five above mentioned. The student must studythis question from the point of view of energy or life force, considering itfrom the aspect of polarity and of the mystic marriage, from [830] thecomprehension of the real meaning of the sex relation, of the meeting andmerging of the pairs of opposites, and the work of the one who synthesises whereevery type of energy is concerned. For instance:a. The Ego synthesises or gathers in the life forces of the fourfold lower man.b. The Mahachohan’s Ray on Earth synthesises the life forces of the lower four.This Ray is the third subray of our planetary Ray.c. The third major Ray of the solar system blends the minor four.d. The fifth Kumara blends and unites in Himself the work of the lower four.The reflection of all this in the Microcosm can be studied by the man whounderstands how the physical body is the vehicle of all the principles.By the time the third Initiation is taken, the inner circle of petals is openedand the full-blown lotus in all its beauty can be seen. At the fourth Initiationthe inner bud bursts open through the effect of the electrical force of the Rod,which brings in the power of the synthetic ray of the solar system itself; theinner jewel is thus revealed. The work has been accomplished; the energyresident in the permanent atoms, has vitalised all the spirillae whilst theperfected force of the lotus, and the dynamic will of the central spark arebrought into full and united activity. This brings about a threefold display ofvital force which causes the disintegration of the form and the followingresults:a. The permanent atoms become radioactive , and their ring-pass-not is thereforeno longer a barrier to the lesser units within; the electronic lives in theirvarious groups escape, and return to the eternal reservoir. They form substanceof a very high [831] order, and will produce the forms of those existences who,in another cycle, will seek vehicles.b. The petals are destroyed by the action of fire, and the multiplicity of devalives which form them and give to them their coherence and quality are gatheredback by the solar Pitris of the highest order into the Heart of the Sun; theywill be directed outward again in another solar system.The atomic substance will be used for another manvantara, but the solar Pitriswill not again be called upon to sacrifice themselves until the next solarsystem when they will come in as planetary Rays, thus repeating upon monadiclevels in the next system what they have done in this. They will then be theplanetary Logoi.c. The central Life electric returns to its source, escaping out of prison andfunctioning as a centre of energy on planes of cosmic etheric energy.We have endeavoured above to convey a general idea of the evolutionary processin connection with the Ego, and its progression under karmic and cyclic law. Ifthe student ponders upon these two laws it will become apparent to him that bothmight be summed up under the generic term of the Law of Rhythm . Allmanifestation is the result of active energy producing certain results, andexpenditure of energy in any one direction will necessitate an equal expenditurein an opposite. This in terms of the Ego and its life experience brings aboutthree stages:First. The stage wherein the energy manifested acts outwardly. The Self becomesidentified with its sheaths. This is the strictly personal stage.Second. The stage wherein adjustment under law is being sought, and the Self isneither entirely identified with its sheaths, nor identified entirely withItself. It is [832] learning to choose between the pairs of opposites. This isthe period of the fiercest strife and turmoil, and the battlefield wherein theadjustment has to be made; it is the laboratory period wherein enoughtransmutative force is generated by the disciple to carry him to the oppositeextreme of the earlier stage,—that stage wherein the energy will manifest withinand not without.Third. The stage wherein the energy of the Ego is centred at the heart of thecircle, and not in the periphery, being applied from thence through theconscious effort of the Ego in group service. The pull of the lower nature issuperseded, and the attraction of that which is higher even than the Ego isfelt. The earlier process has then to be repeated on a higher turn of thespiral, and monadic energy begins to work upon the Ego as the egoic worked uponthe personality. The Monad, which has been identifying Itself with the Ego (itsouter manifestation) begins again to seek its own true centre “within theHeart,” and on the higher levels results affecting distribution and conservationof energy may again be seen.It is necessary to emphasise this procedure because it is important that alloccultists should learn to interpret and to think in terms of energy and offorce, in contradistinction to the sheaths or instruments employed. The mystichas recognised this “force” factor, but has only worked with the positive forceaspect. The occultist must recognise and work with three types of force, orenergy, and therein lies the distinction between his work and that of themystic. He recognises:1. Positive force Or that which energises. 2. Negative force Or that which isthe recipient of energy; that which acts or assumes form under the impact ofpositive force. 3. Light, or harmonic force That which is produced by the unionof these two. The result is radiant energy, and is the result of theequilibrising of the two others.[833] These three aspects of energy have been called, as has been often said:a. Electric fire positive energy Father. b. Fire by friction negative energyMother. c. Solar fire radiant energy Sun or Son.Each of these two last aspects demonstrates within itself in a dual manner, butthe effect is a unified whole as regards the great Unity in which they aredemonstrating.The problem of the devas may be somewhat better understood if it is rememberedthat they in themselves embody the two types of energy. For instance, the solarPitris are the substance of the egoic bodies and groups, and the medium ofexpression for the Spirit aspect, for Spirit manifests by means of soul. Thelunar Pitris, who form the personal lower self, being the aggregate of the lowersheaths, are energised and used by the solar Lords. These solar Angels again arein many groups and express within their own ranks a dual energy, both positiveand negative. There is the positive life of the egoic lotus which co-ordinates,preserves, and actuates the petals, and there is also the energy of the petalsubstance itself, or the negative aspect which is swept by the positive force ofthe greater solar Lords into living whorls or wheels which we symbolically call“petals.” There is a close analogy in connection with the planetary Logos, andthe solar Logos between prana, the life force which animates the etheric body ofman, and by means of that [834] force coheres the dense physical body, and thatsynthesising life force of the Logos which animates every atom on every plane ofthe system. If this is meditated upon, and the fact of all our planes being theetheric and dense manifestation of the solar Logos is realised, then the placeplayed by the solar Angels may become somewhat elucidated, and their relation tothe planetary Logos and to the solar Logos may become also clearer.We must not only study them in connection with ourselves and with our effort toidentify ourselves with the solar Lords of the lunar Pitris, but must recognisealso:a. The solar Angels of a planetary scheme.b. The solar Angels of the solar system.c. The lunar lords of the scheme and system.The word “lunar” is here an anachronism and is technically inaccurate. The moonor moons in any scheme are systemic effects, and are not causes. In certainplanetary relationships, they are considered causes, but in connection with oursolar system they are not. Yet also, in connection with a system, there existcosmically certain bodies in space which have as definite an effect upon thesystem as the moon has upon the earth. This is something as yet unknown andincomprehensible to metaphysicians, scientists and astronomers. War wagescosmically as yet between the systemic “lunar” lords, and those Entities who areanalogous to the solar Lords on cosmic levels. Until our students extend theirconcept to include in their calculations the logoic astral and mental bodies asthe Logos seeks to express emotion and mind on the physical plane (through Hisphysical body, a solar system) they will not progress far towards the heart ofthe solar mystery. Until the force of the cosmic lunar Lords is sought for, thefact of there being entire constellations beyond our solar system in process ofdisintegration in time and space in a manner similar to [835] the disintegrationof the moon will not be known nor the effects of this traced. Eventually oursolar system will pass into a similar state. The true mystery of evil ( 265[text00028.html#Y_FN265] ) lies here, and the true reality of the “War inHeaven” must here be sought. Similarly it must be remembered that planetaryschemes pass into obscuration and “die out,” through the withdrawal in all casesof the positive life and energy and of the electric fire which is the animatingprinciple of every system, scheme, globe, kingdom in nature, and human unit.This produces again in every case the dying out of the “solar radiance,” or ofthe light produced by the commingling of the negative and positive energy. Allthat is left in every case again is the habitual energy of the substance uponwhich, and through which, the positive energy has had such a remarkable [836]effect. This negative type of force gradually dissipates, or disperses itself,and seeks the central reservoir of energy. The spheroidal form is thusdisintegrated. This can be seen working out now in the case of the moon, and thesame rule holds good for all bodies. We might word it otherwise:—The solar Devas(or radiant energy) return to the central Heart or to the source which breathedthem out. This leaves the lesser deva substance dependent upon its own internalheat, as it involves the withdrawal of that which built substance into form.This deva substance is of many kinds and perhaps the consequent procedure can bemore clearly understood if we say that as the form breaks up the lesser buildersand devas return to their group soul. Certain of them, those who form the bodiesof the fourth kingdom in nature, and who are therefore the highest kind ofsubstance through which consciousness can manifest in the three worlds, are onthe road towards individualisation,—they are nearer the human stage than thesubstance of the three other kingdoms. They occupy a place in the deva evolutionanalogous to that which a man holds in the human kingdom (note that I saykingdom, not evolution) who is nearing the Path. The goal for the devas (belowthe rank of solar Pitris) is individualisation, and their objective is to becomemen in some future cycle. The goal for a man is initiation, or to become aconscious Dhyan Chohan, and in some distant cycle to do for the humanity of thatage what the solar Pitris have done for him, and make their self-consciousexpression a possibility. The goal for a solar Pitri is, as said earlier, tobecome a logoic Ray. ( 266 [text00028.html#Y_FN266] )[837] To return to the matter which we were considering:—Just as the moon is adeterrent or malefic force where the Earth is concerned, and productive of evil“influences,” so all such disintegrating bodies are equally destructive. Suchbodies exist within the solar ring-pass-not, ( 267 [text00028.html#Y_FN267] )unrecognised as yet, and disintegrating constellations (of which there are manyin the universe, unknown and unrecognised by scientists) have an equally maleficeffect upon our system, and upon all that passes into their sphere of influence.There is one such constellation, situated between the lesser Dipper and oursystem, and another, interrelated with the Pleiades and our system which stillhave a profound effect upon the physical body of the solar Logos.The above paragraph is specifically worded thus because the effects are felt inthe lowest sheath of all, and are responsible for much that is ignorantly termed“black magic.” These two constellations have run their cycles and are“dissolving.” Some of their life force and energy has been transferred to oursolar system, [838] just as the lunar life force was transferred to our earth,and this it is that is the cause of much cyclic evil. The process of decay andthe evil emanations induced still have power to influence forms which areresponsive to what was for them an earlier vibration. The substance of theseforms is magnetically linked with the decaying body, much as the etheric doubleis connected with its dense sheath, and effects are therefore manifested.Purificatory fire is the only cure for this magnetic corruption, and this isbeing utilised freely by the planetary Logoi in Their schemes, and by the solarLogos in the system.PURIFICATORY FIRE“The fire burned low. A dull red glow slumbered within the Heart of Mother. Itswarmth was scarcely felt. The first and second of the inner lines throbbed withthe burning, but the rest were cold.The Sons of God looked down from the innermost centre. They looked, then turnedaway Their gaze and thoughts to other spheres. Their hour had not yet come. Theelemental fires had not prepared the altar for the Lords. The sacrificial firewaited in its high place and the steady glow beneath increased.The fire burned clearer, and the first and second slowly lighted up. Their glowbecame a line of brilliant fire yet the five remained untouched. The Sons of Godagain looked down. For one brief second They thought upon the Mother, and asThey thought the third caught fire. Swiftly They looked away for the form as yetrelayed to Them no call. The heat was latent and no outer warmth ascended toTheir place.The aeons passed. The glow increased. The Spheres took form, but dissipatedrapidly, lacking coherent force. They passed. They came again. Action incessant,noise and fire and smouldering heat characterised Their cycles. But the Lhas inTheir high heaven spurned this elemental work and gazed within Themselves. Theymeditated.* * * * * * * * * *The glow became a steady burning and tiny flames were seen. The first, thesecond, and the third became three lines of fire and one triangle wasconsummated. Yet the four are seen quiescent [839] and respond not to the heat.Thus do the cycles and the elemental lives pass and repass, and their workcontinues.The forms are set, yet brief their span. They move not, yet they pass. The hourhas come for the great awakening. They pass no longer down but mount.This is the interlude for which the Lhas in Their high place have waited. Theymay not enter yet the forms prepared, but feel Their hour approaching. Theymeditate anew, and for a minute gaze upon the myriad threefold fires until thefourth responds.The sixty seconds passed in dynamic concentration produce forms of triple kind,three sets of forms, and myriads in the three. The Heart of Mother contracts,and expands with these sixty fiery breaths. The lines become allied, and cubesare formed, shielding the inner fire. The altar is prepared, and four squarestands. The altar glows, red at the centre and warm without.* * * * * * * * * *The altar flames. Its heat mounts up, yet it burns not, nor is consumed. Itsheat, which has no flame, reaches a higher sphere; the Sons of God for a briefperiod warm Themselves, yet approach not nearer to it until the passing ofanother cycle. They await the hour, the hour of sacrifice.The solar Lords, taking the Word as sounded by the Sons of God, arise in thefierceness of their solar life and approach the altar. The four lines glow andburn. The sun applies a ray; the solar Lords pass it through Their substance andagain approach the altar. The fifth line awakens and becomes a glowing point,and then a dull red line, measuring the distance ‘twixt the altar and the OneWho watches.The fivefold fire dynamic begins to flicker and to burn. It lights not yetwithout; it simply glows. The aeons pass away, the cycles come and go.Steadily the solar Lords sacrifice Themselves; They are the fire upon the altar.The fourth provides the fuel.* * * * * * * * * *The Sons of God still watch. The work nears its final consummation. The EternalLhas in Their high place call each to each, and four take up the cry: “The fireis burning. Does the heat suffice?” [840]Two answer to each other: “‘The fire is burning; the altar is well-nighdestroyed. What happens next?’” “Add to the fire with fuel from Heaven. Breatheon the blazing fire and fan its flame to utter fierceness.”Thus the command goes out from One Who watches, silent hitherto, throughcountless aeons. They send forth breath. Something prevents the passage of thebreath. They call for aid. One makes His appearance Who has not yet been seen.He lifts His hand. The one, the two, the three, the four and five merge into oneand mingle with the sixth. The flame mounts up, responding to the breath. Thefinal disappearance of the cube is needed and then the work stands forth.”From the archives of The Lodge.(c ) The Names of the Egoic Lotuses. We might consider briefly the work offorming the egoic lotus on its own plane; this is as the result of the work ofthe Agnishvattas, after its segregation in space, and the formation of itsring-pass-not. We have touched upon the remotest and earliest stages. One pointwe have not yet emphasised but which is of interest to the thoughtful student.This is the fact of the difference existing between the egoic bodies owing totheir varying stages of development. For instance, up till the middle of theAtlantean rootrace (S. D., I, 196.) (when the door of individualisation wasclosed), Egos were to be seen at many differing stages from the newly organised“buds,” representing freshly individualised men, to the highly developed causalbodies of the different disciples and initiates, who were superintending theevolution of the race. Now the egoic bodies might be grouped from theevolutionary standpoint as follows:On the third subplane of the mental plane:Bud egos . Our planetary scheme, being at the midway point in its evolution,there are therefore no unopened “buds” strictly speaking. All the egoic lotuseshave at least one petal open. All the lotuses are organised, but there are vastdifferences among those of small development, [841] showing forth in thebrilliancy of the permanent atoms, and in the stage of petal unfoldment.Brahmic lotuses in which the first or knowledge petal is fully unfolded. Theyare so called as they represent on the physical plane the fully activeintelligent unity, the man of small mental development, the lowest type ofworkers, agriculturists, and peasants on every continent. They are also called“third class creators,” as they express themselves only through the act ofphysical creation on the physical plane, and their function is largely toprovide vehicles for those of their own group.The lotuses of Brahman , in which the second petal is showing signs of openingand the second aspect in its lowest manifestation is showing signs ofdemonstration. They stand as representing certain groups of Egos from certainplanetary schemes, notably Jupiter and Venus, who are a grade higher than theclass above, but which have as yet a long way to go. They are called “secondclass creators,” for though they demonstrate on the physical plane in the act ofphysical creation, yet they are more swayed by love than by animal instinct asin the first case. They are to be found incarnating at this time in the Orient,particularly in India and in the Latin countries, and just lately in America.Primary lotuses. These are a group of special interest brought in under theinfluence of the Lord of the fifth Ray, and therefore fundamentally allied tothe energy which is the special manifestation in this system and the basis ofall achievement, that is, manas. They were quiescent during the Atlanteanroot-race but have come in during the fourth and fifth subraces of thisrootrace. They are a group a good deal more advanced than the earlier classesbut need much to develop the second petal. With them the first and the thirdpetals in the first circle are opening, but the middle petal is yet shut. Themiddle tier also shows no signs of vitality. Owing [842] to conditions in theiremanating planet, their development has been one-sided, and hence their enteringon a wave of energy into this scheme in order to “round” themselves out, as itis called. They may be seen in the purely intellectual selfish scientific type.They are responsible for much of the advanced application of mechanical scienceto the needs of men, and for the introduction of certain types of machinery;they work largely in connection with the energy of the mineral kingdom. By thisit must be inferred that the solar Lords who embody this type are linked with agroup of lunar Lords who respond magnetically to the devas of the mineralkingdom. Their work for the race has at present a deleterious effect, but whenthe second petal is opened, the wonders then to be achieved by them in lovingservice along their own particular line will be one of the factors which willregenerate the fourth kingdom. They will achieve emancipation in the fifthround, four fifths of them passing on to the Path and one fifth set back foranother cycle.Lotuses of passion or desire. They are so called because their fundamentalnature is embodied love in some one or other form. The bulk of the Monads ofLove are among this large group and they are to be seen incarnating in the bulkof the well-to-do, kindly people of the world. They are divided into fivegroups, of whom three individualised upon this planet, and two were the verylatest to individualise upon the moon chain. They have two petals unfolded andthe third is for them at this time the object of their attention. Many maysucceed in unfolding it before the seventh rootrace of this round but the bulkof them will unfold it in the second rootrace of the next round, and will standready before the close of the round to pass on to the probationary path, havingunfolded one tier of petals, and organised the second. All these lotuses of thefirst circle are divided into groups but interplay goes on between them; energyin any centre [843] produces reflex energy in another. It must be rememberedthat in closing the door in Atlantean times to the animal kingdom, and theconsequent temporary cessation of the forming of any more “bud lotuses” theeffect was dual, in directions other than the human or the animal. It was theresult of the internal decision on the part of the planetary Logos to turn Hisattention away from the act of creation on the systemic mental plane to the workof progressive evolution. This caused a cessation of certain types of activity,producing a quiescence in certain of His centres, and an increased activity inothers. It also had an effect upon the solar Angels, and consequently upon theHeart of the solar system from whence they are drawn. Floods of energy orstreams of force from the heart of the sun (the subjective Sun) were arrestedand directed elsewhere, while the Pitris already active began to centre theirattention upon the work begun, and temporarily new beginnings were out of order.It must not be forgotten here that the work of the solar Pitris from their pointof view, is not primarily the evolution of man, but is the process of their owndevelopment within the plan of the solar Logos. The evolution of the human raceis, for them, but a method.Perfected men are in the councils of the planetary Logos of their particularray; the solar Pitris are in the council of the solar Logos. (269[text00028.html#Y_FN269] )It might be of value here if we temporarily stopped our consideration of theegoic groups and briefly tabulated the evolutions, remembering that in thistabulation, the planes of differentiation alone are concerned; on the plane ofthe unmanifest or of the subjective, only unity is known. It must again beremembered that the term “unmanifest” is one of relative importance only, andconcerns man’s apprehension of all that is. To the solar Logos the planes of theunmanifest are objective. Man has not as yet achieved etheric vision, and theetheric[844] TABULATION VILives Goal 1. Planetary Logoi - The major Three. Cosmic liberation; the finalcosmic Initiations. 2. The minor four planetary Logoi Cosmic Initiation, or thefirst four Initiations. 3. The informing Lives of a planetary globe Manus of acosmic chain. Not a seed manu, but a periodical manu of lesser degree. Thisinvolves an unrevealable mystery, connected with certain Hierarchies of color.4. The informing life of a kingdom in nature Transference in one of threedirections: a. To the line of the solar Pitris. b. To Sirius, as a karmicadjuster. c.

To followany of the paths earlier enumerated. Those who become solar Pitris, being thebulk of humanity, return to Sirius to be breathed out again into activity. 7.The lunar Pitris To become men. They will in their higher grades pass directlyinto the animal evolution of the next cycle and so eventually individualise.Their three higher grades will become animal-men, and the lower four willcontribute to the quaternic forms of the men of the next creation. 8. The animalevolution Human kingdom. 9. The vegetable evolution The animal kingdom. 10. Themineral evolution The vegetable kingdom. 11. The four higher grades of lesserBuilders on all planes They will form the manifested double or form of thatmysterious third evolution of the next system; that is, the etheric body of theplanetary entity. This mysterious life is as yet an unfathomable mystery and onewhich will not be revealed till the final one of the triplicity of solar systemsof our solar Logos. 12. The three lower grades of the lesser Builders Thephysical body in its densest form of the planetary entity.[845] subplanes are to him as yet unmanifest. The solar Logos has cosmic ethericvision fully developed, and because He is on the cosmic Path all is known andfully revealed to Him within the solar System.It might here be noted that the planetary Entity is the sumtotal of all theelemental lives of the lesser Builders functioning as, or forming, the substanceof any particular globe in physical objectivity. The mystery of the wholesubject lies hidden in three things:First, the fact that our three planes, physical, astral, and mental, form thedense body of the solar Logos, and are therefore not considered as formingprinciples.The second fact is that the lesser “lives” or the elemental essence are the“refuse” of an earlier system, and react to inherent impulses so powerfully thatit was only possible to control them through the dynamic will of the Logos,consciously applied. The word “refuse” must be interpreted analogically, and asis understood when it is said that man gathers to himself in each freshincarnation matter to form his dense physical body which is tinged with theearlier vibrations of preceding incarnations. These “lives” have been graduallydrawn in during the entire mahamanvantara as it became safe and possible tocontrol and bend them to the will of the greater Builders. Much of the earlierenergy-substance in systemic construction has been passed on into thatforce-matter which we call that of the lunar Pitris, and its place has graduallybeen taken by this type of energy, gathered in from the greater sphere in whichour Logos has place. The twelve evolutions are after all but the twelve types ofenergy, manifesting ever in three groups of forces, and again as one group whensynthesised during the process of manifestation. They are fourfold ininteraction, and have a systemic ebb and flow about which little is known.Third, the fact of the coming into incarnation of the [846] informing “life” ofthis low grade substance, who is an entity from a point in the Heavens which maynot be mentioned: He embodies influences of a manasic nature, but manas at itsvery lowest vibration. Perhaps some idea of this may be gathered if it is statedthat there is a resemblance between this vibration, or this energising life, andthe basic vibration of the solar system preceding this one. We must rememberthat our basic vibration was the result of the evolutionary process of theentire earlier system. This entity has the same analogous relation to the devaevolution as the mysterious “bridges” which baffle scientists, and which arefound between the vegetable and the animal kingdom, and the mineral and thevegetable; they are neither the one nor the other. On a large scale, this “life”or the informing entity of the lower life of the physical plane of the solarsystem is neither a full exponent of the subconscious life of the earliersystem, nor of the elemental life of this; only in the next system will be seenthe manifestation of a form of consciousness of a type at present inconceivableto man. Esoterically he is stated to have “neither sight nor hearing”; he isneither deva nor human in essence. He is occultly “blind,” utterly unaware; heis capable only of movement, and resembles the foetus in the womb; that which iscoming to the birth only the next greater cycle will reveal. The mystery of themoon (S. D., I, 172, footnote.) or of the “divine lunatic” is connected somewhatwith the revelation (through the premature compassion of our planetary Logos) ofthe life of this nature, informing the dense globe of the moon chain. On Hishigh level, pity awoke in the heart of the planetary Logos for certaininvolutionary existences within the moon chain, and (like the Buddha on a lesserscale and at a much later date) compassionate zeal brought the karmic resultswith which we are still concerned. The “beast” must be driven back [847] for hisown good to run his cycle, hidden in his den and confined within safe limitsuntil the dawning of a new system brings him conscious opportunity.More we may not say. It must be remembered that the mysteries of existence areas yet but little cognised by man. In cases where profound mysteries lie, man isoften totally unaware of it; and frequently man remains blind and deaf where nomystery is but only revelation for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.When man has penetrated to those secrets which lie behind the lower kingdoms innature, when he has solved the problem of the constitution of the interior ofthe Earth, and has from there worked his way back to knowledge of the working ofthe involutionary path and the lives which tread that path, then and then onlywill he begin to realise the strangeness of that which lies beyond his ken.One further hint may be given, which will serve to throw a beam of light uponthe problem for those who are ready, and will add to the confusion of thenon-intuitive:—From the standpoint of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID, toWhom our solar system is but a centre (which centre being one of the threetruths revealed at the seventh Initiation)a. System I was characterised by the organisation of a centre, and themysterious life we have been speaking about was produced by the “lowestvibration of the centre.” b. System II is characterised by the activity in threedimensions of this centre, and the evolution of three types of consciousness,deva, human and subhuman, in all their many grades and hierarchies. It is theperiod of the balancing of the forces in the centre. c. System III will becharacterised by the fourth dimensional activity of the centre, and the twelvetypes of evolution will become four types of force.[848] This is next to impossible for man to understand and will seeminexplicable, but this hint is imparted in order that man may realise theinterdependence of the various systems, and the place they hold in a greaterscheme; the intent is not to give the student uncorrelated facts of no apparentuse to him. Without the premise of our position within a vaster scheme, man’sdeductions will remain inaccurate.We will now proceed with our enumeration of the groups of Egos according totheir characteristics, but it might be wise to deal first with a problem whichmay be in some minds and see if it is not capable of solution. Two problems comebefore the mind of the thoughtful student; one concerns the position (inconnection with any particular planetary scheme) of those vast groups of Egos,which are embodied by Lives, emanating from any one of the seven Rays, andassociated with any of the various schemes. The other deals with the effectproduced by the “coming-in” of Egos on the mental plane which are not “bud”Egos, but are possibly very fully developed, such as disciples and initiates.These thoughts may be clarified if certain statements are made relating to themental plane, and which will serve as indications as to the direction in whichthe solution of these problems may be sought.The mental plane is, as H. P. B. has pointed out, the vastest of all the planeswith which we are concerned. It is the key plane of the solar system. It is thepivotal plane upon which the great Wheel turns. It is the meeting place of thethree lines of evolution and has been for this reason esoterically termed “thecouncil chamber of the Three Divinities.” On this plane, the three Persons ofthe logoic Trinity meet in united work. Below two Persons may be seenassociated; above another duality functions, but only on this plane do the Threemake an at-one-ment.[849] All the Logoi of the differing schemes are expressing Themselves upon thisplane. There are certain schemes in the system which find their lowestmanifestation on this plane, and have no physical body such as the Earth, andthe other dense planets. They exist through the medium of gaseous matter, andtheir spheres of manifestation are simply composed of the four cosmic ethers andthe cosmic gaseous. But all the great Lives of the solar system do possessbodies of our systemic mental matter, and therefore on that plane communicationbetween all these Entities becomes a possibility. This fact is the basis ofoccult realisation, and the true ground for the at-one-ment. Matter of theabstract levels of the mental plane enters into the composition of the vehiclesfor all these greater Existences and through the medium of this energisedsubstance each can get en rapport with each, no matter what Their individualgoal of attainment may be. The units, therefore, in Their bodies can equally getin touch with all other Egos and groups once they have achieved theconsciousness of the mental plane (causal consciousness) and know the varyinggroup “keys,” the group tones and colors.It will consequently be apparent to the careful student that in this fact liesthe true relationship between the various groups of Egos, no matter what degreeof evolution, or what ray and in which scheme they may be. The basic truth hereinvolved may be better grasped if the following occult phrases are studied:“Within the Hall of Ignorance kama-manas rules . The man, weighed down by muchmisplaced desire, seeks for the object of his heart’s attention within the murkyhalls of densest maya. He finds it there but dies ere garnering all thelonged-for fruit. The serpent stings him, and the joy desired recedes from outhis grasp. All seeking thus the selfish fruits of karma must each despise eachother; hence strife and greed, ill-will and hatred, death and retribution,karmic invocation and the thunderbolt of vengeance characterise this Hall. [850]Within the Hall of Learning intellect rules and seeks to guide. Desire of ahigher kind, the fruit of manas and its use, supplants the lower kamic urge. Manweighs and balances, and in the twilight Halls of Intellection seeks for thefruit of knowledge. He finds it but to realise that knowledge is not all; hedies upon the open field of knowledge, hearing a cry beat on his dying ears:Know that the knower greater is than knowledge; the One who seeks is greaterthan the sought.Within the Hall of Wisdom the Spirit rules; the One within the lesser onesassumes supreme control. Death is not known within these halls, for its twogreat gates are passed. Discord and strife both disappear and only harmony isseen. The knowers see themselves as One; they recognise the field whereinknowledge grows as Brahmic dissonance and differentiation. Knowledge they knowas method, an instrument of purpose utilised by all and just a germ of eventualrecognition. Within this hall union of each with each, blending of one and all,and unity of action, goal and skill marks every high endeavor.”If these words are pondered on, it will be realised that true union exists inthe realisation that the greater life ever includes the lesser, and that eachexpansion of consciousness brings man closer to this realised Oneness.Therefore, if one might venture to express an abstraction and a state ofconsciousness in terms of time and space, and through the limitation oflanguage, it might be stated that on egoic levels, or on the three highersubplanes of the mental plane, there exists a channel of communication, based onsimilarity of vibration and oneness of endeavour, between every one of theplanetary schemes, within the solar ring-pass-not. Here, and here alone (asregards the three worlds and the human kingdom), becomes possible theestablishing of egoic relationships and the transmission of thought substancebetweena. Units and egoic groups.b. Groups and other groups. [851]c. Greater groups with still greater or with lesser ones.d. Egos in one planetary scheme with those in another.The Ah-hi, the greater Builders, ( 271 [text00028.html#Y_FN271] ) Who are theLords working out the will of the solar Logos, mainly use two planes forcommunication with each other and with Their cohorts:First, the second plane, where They communicate by means of a spiritual mediumincomprehensible to man at present.Second, the mental plane, where They communicate with all lesser lives by meansof a type of mental telepathy.The “coming-in” of advanced Egos from the inner round, or from other planetaryschemes, or from subtler spheres where they have been in pralaya awaitingopportunity is produced in a triple manner and is the result of a tripleactivity. It is caused by an understanding between the planetary Logos of ascheme, and a brother planetary Logos whereby an exchange is effected. Thestudent must here think in terms of force and energy, of magnetic interactionand the conscious transmission of energy out of the body of the planetary Logos,via centres or a centre, into the body of another planetary Logos. The causehere is the will or purpose, the object is sensation, and the method is forcetransference. Exactly the same understanding lies back of the coming in of egosfrom the inner round, only this time the energy is sent forth by certainexistences (working in connection with any planetary Logos) who are the“custodians of the inner circle.” This touches upon a mystery and deals with thecoming-in of high Egos, of Avatars, of Buddhas, [852] of masters, of initiates,and of disciples, and of all who have to wait for group, and not individual,urge for the fulfillment of cyclic karma on a large scale, and whose “wheels”are controlled by cosmic forces and not by purely systemic forces.Another factor might be termed the karmic results of seeds sown in days longpast, and hidden in the mysteries of the earlier system, scheme, or chain as thecase may be. All these three groups of manifestation follow karmic impulse, andthis impulse it is which controls the time period, and method of the appearancein any group of planetary egos, of newly born lotus buds, or of lotuses whichare termed “mystically transplanted.” These latter are probably of a high degreeof unfoldment. This is possible in individual cases and in the case of entiregroups.A third factor has to do with the transference of Egos or lotuses from onesphere of activity to another and this necessarily produces conditions callingfor the appearance of similar centres to take their place. Energy transmittedmust be supplied from elsewhere, and this is another predisposing factor for theappearance of egoic lotuses in any scheme. The law of the conservation of forceholds good on any plane.This whole question of the transference of egoic lotuses from any one scheme toanother, or from chain to chain, on the mental plane is one of very realintricacy, and cannot be elucidated to the unpledged disciple. Only thesegeneral indications are in any way possible.It must also be remembered in connection with our planet that Egos appear inthose groups whose lotuses are not produced as the result of the Law ofAttraction working between the animal kingdom of the globe and the higherTriads, but which are Egos who have individualised elsewhere, and who thereforecome in with their petals already organised, and perhaps with several [853]petals unfolded. This has necessarily a profound effect both upon the groups inwhich they appear, and upon the type of man who will make his appearancesubsequently in physical plane incarnation. This is touched upon in the SecretDoctrine when the question of the early teachers and divine kings who occupiedthe ill-favoured bodies of the early humanity, is broached. (See early part ofS.D. Vol II.) ( 273 [text00028.html#Y_FN273] )To continue with our consideration of egoic groups: It might be briefly statedthat the egoic groups in connection with our planet may be roughly groupedaccording to the stage of lotus organisation, as follows:a. Egos who were produced through the individualisation process in Lemuriandays. They are the true Earth humanity, along with the second group.b . Egos who have individualised during the Atlantean root-race until the doorwas shut.c. Egos who have “come-in” from the moon chain and who are much more evolvedthan the earth humanity.d. Egos who have been swept in since Atlantean days to take the place of thoseEgos who have achieved liberation, and whose causal bodies have disappeared, orwhose lotuses have “died out” leaving a vacuum in force substance which must besupplied and filled. They usually come in from one of two schemes:1. From the scheme embodied by the polar opposite of our planetary Logos.2. From that scheme which is allied with these two in forming a systemictriangle. [854]These cases are necessarily rare at present but will become more frequent asmore and more of the human race take the fourth Initiation.e. Certain rare Egos or lotuses from schemes not enumerated in the abovetriplicity. They are usually only brought in so that they may perfect certaindevelopments in their own nature, to carry out experimental work in connectionwith the deva kingdom, or to produce certain group results desired by theplanetary Logos. They frequently do not descend into dense physical incarnationbut work primarily on mental and astral levels, returning to their own sphereseventually for the final stages of liberation.All these lotuses in their myriad differentiations have specific effects uponeach other on mental levels, and these effects are as yet utterly unrealised byman. Nevertheless, they are the basis of the true psychology, and the grounds ofall true activity. The student would do well to ponder upon the effect anyadvanced Ego would be likely to have upon:a. Other Egos in his group.b. The solar Pitris who are the substance of the group.c. The lunar Pitris, who are linked with the solar Pitris through the permanentatoms.We have enumerated above certain classifications of groups of Egos to be foundon the causal levels of the mental plane, so as to give students some idea ofthe vastness of the subject, and the complexity of the problem. It must beremembered that on the third subplane of the mental plane there is no individualseparation such as we find when in physical manifestation, but neverthelessgroup separation is to be seen. These groups are far too many to enumerate indetail. We have outlined and named five of the larger groups as catalogued under[855] one scheme of tabulation in the Hall of Records. Other methods ofenumeration exist, and even under the one here used, these five groups are eachsubdivided into ten groups, and these again are broken up into lesser units, allof them being known and portrayed under certain symbols.When we come to the second subplane of the mental plane (the plane whereon theegoic bodies of advanced humanity, of disciples, and of initiates are found) themethod of grouping will be according to:a. Ray.b. Subray.c. Department (whether under the Manu, the Mahachohan or the Bodhisattva on ourearth scheme or their analogies on other schemes).d. The Master’s group.These egoic lotuses are all organised, and have a number of petals unfoldedwhilst some are in the final stages of development.They have also been grouped under the following three heads:Lotuses of revelation. Those in which the “jewel” is just about to be revealed.Lotuses with perfume. Those whose occult “smell” or aroma is permeating theirenvironment. They are those Egos who have not yet completely unfolded the finaltier of petals, but whose lives are of magnetic force in the three worlds, andwhose careers are distinguished by altruistic service.Radiant lotuses, or those whose light is beginning to shine forth as lights in adark place.They are grouped also according to primary colour, to subsidiary colouring,according to key or tone, and one tabulation is entirely numerical. It might beof interest [856] to the student if we here pointed out that in the Hall ofRecords in connection with the human Egos certain of the records undersymbological terminology keep a minute account of the following facts concerningeach unit:The lunar record. This deals with all the lower vehicles and forms, employed bythe human Monads and concerns itself with:a. Their rate of vibration,b. Their type,c. Their key number,d . The particular group of lunar Lords who are concerned with those bodies,e. The detailed history of the elemental lives who construct the bodies.This information is employed by the karmic official responsible for theproduction of a new set of vehicles at each incarnation, in order to assist theworking out of karma. The history of the lunar bodies is stored up in thepermanent atoms.The solar record. This deals with the more permanent egoic vehicle, and concernsitself with:a. The rate of vibration.b. The history of the petal unfoldment.c. The history of any particular group of solar Angels concerned with theformation of the lotus.d. The activity of the deva substance out of which the lotus is constructed.e. Group relationships.This information is used by the Master Who has made Himself responsible for thestimulation and the growth of any particular series of Egos, and also byadvanced Egos who are consciously working with their group.The consciousness record. This concerns the response of the indwelling Entity toits surroundings. It deals [857] with the utilisation of knowledge by theknower, and is in many ways the most intricate and the most lengthy of therecords.These records are mostly used by the Lord of the World and His pupils toascertain information in connection with the planetary centres. They arearranged in such a way that the entire record of any group, however vast andextensive, is embodied in seven sheets of symbols, each containing forty-ninesymbols. These sheets are changed and corrected once every seven years, and areprecipitated on astral matter by an effort of will by the Chohan responsible forthe particular group involved.(d.) The Petals and the Etheric Centres . It remains now to point out the closeconnection between the unfoldment of the petals in the egoic lotuses and theetheric centres in man. It is through the centres that psychic energy flows.Students should carefully bear in mind the two following facts: First, theetheric body is vitalised, as we know, by prana. Pranic energy is the stimulatorof animal activity, and of physical plane development. Its effect is primarilyupon the atoms of the physical body and it has a triple effect upon thesubstance of the physical body:a. It preserves the animal health of the body.b. It constructs and builds in the body, through its energy and force currents,what is needed to replace the daily wear and tear.c. It is the medium whereby man comes into physical touch with his brother man.Physical magnetism is largely, even if not wholly, dependent upon prana.The etheric centres are the force vortices formed in etheric matter by astralimpulse, transmitted via the [858] astral centres. These astral centres in theirturn are the transmitters of still higher energy, and thus the statement istechnically true that the etheric centres are the source of man’s psychicenergy, and are therefore affected by the unfoldment of the petals. Every petalis in its turn a type of force centre, and the energy emanating from it affectsthe etheric centres, and produces every type of psychic energy of the true kind.The energy flowing from the Ego is but little felt in the early stages ofdevelopment. Man follows his allotted path through animal and racial instinct,and can be safely left to the stimulation emanating from his group centres, andto the ordinary driving force inherent in form, and to the earlier life waves.It is only when he has reached a comparatively advanced stage (in comparisonwith that of animal man) that egoic or psychic force pours through his centresin such a way as to produce results in consciousness—of these he will eventuallybecome profoundly aware within his physical brain. I do not here refer to theordinary animal psychism displayed by the higher animals, and found amongcertain of the post Lemurian races. This is a type of consciousness inherent inthe atoms, and is a constituent part of the “soul of the world.” It isunconscious and uncontrolled and has no part in this teaching. I refer to theconscious psychism which is displayed by advanced humanity, by disciples andinitiates of all grades. This kind is the result of the pouring in of egoicenergy through the etheric centres (mainly through five of them) in such a waythat the consciousness of the physical brain becomes aware of it, and also awareof:a. Its purpose,b. Its technique,c. The effects produced within the lower self of the man himself and also uponothers, [859]d. His ability to employ it or not as he may desire. It is under his control.The centres with which the student is concerned are, as we know, four in number:a. The head,b. The heart,c. The throat,d. The base of the spine.These are the only ones which should receive consideration. His work is totransfer the force or energy out of the two lower—the spinal and the solarplexus—into the three higher. It is presumed that he has already transferred, oris in process of transferring, the energy of the generative organs into thecentre of desire, the solar plexus, with the aim in view of guiding it stillhigher to the throat centre. The splenic centre, being the vehicle of prana, isspecially developed under evolutionary law, and its energy is not transferred toanother centre, but is consciously diffused. When its correspondence in the headcentre is awakened, this becomes the organ of occult healing; through it thehealer (by an act of will), absorbs prana and vitality from the ethers, and thenbreathes it out again upon the object to be healed by an act of compassionatehealing.In connection with the etheric centres, we should note the fact that the majorhead centre is twofold in structure, and consists of a lotus of ninety-sixpetals between the eyebrows, and of a twelve-petalled lotus at the top of thehead, with ninety-six petals in a subsidiary whorl. The significance of thesefigures is profound. In every case the figure twelve is met with, showing adefinite relation to the basic psychic lotuses on egoic levels. Twelvemultiplied by eight stands for the twelve petals in each case, while in thefigure eight lies hidden the idea of duality: [860]a . The four of the quaternary,b . The four of the egoic auric egg (the three aspects, and the ring-pass-not.)We must note also, that the idea of twelve in connection with the centres isfound in three of them:a. The higher head centre,b. The secondary head centre,c . The heart centre.If the student studies this condition, and links up the idea of the three tiersof petals in the twelve-petalled lotus, he may find illumination. More it is notpossible to give at this stage.It is only when the etheric centres—the two head centres and the heartcentre—are fully active with their twelve petals completely unfolded that thecentral circle of petals in the egoic lotus (the fourth or inner circle)unfolds. The significance of the four circles in the egoic lotus, and the eightcircles of twelve petals each in the etheric lotuses on the mental plane is ofgreat importance.The centres with which man has to deal are necessarily five at this stage owingto the following facts, which must be studied if a man desires to awaken hiscentres according to plan, and if he wishes safely to follow along the line ofthe true psychic unfoldment:The fact that the energy starts from the fifth plane, the mental, where man isconcerned,The fact that it is through the agency of the fifth principle that man canconsciously work at his own unfoldment,The fact that the path of evolution is for man a fivefold one, covering the fiveplanes of human unfoldment; and is divided into five stages as regards the Ego,The fact that although this is the second solar system from the standpoint ofthe egoic cycles of the Logos, [861] or His second major egoic cycle, yet it isthe fifth when viewed from another angle, that of the lesser cycles. Itcorresponds to the fifth period in human evolution, that in which man treads thePath. The Logos is now treading the cosmic Path.The fact that the fifth spirilla is in process of awakening. This has to beeffected before the interplay of energy between the egoic lotus and the ethericcentres becomes so powerful as to awaken man’s physical brain, and cause him tobecome aware of the inner currents. This takes place usually when the fifthpetal is organised.This whole question can also be viewed in a larger manner from the standpoint ofthe five Kumaras. It must be remembered that the aggregate of the ethericcentres of any particular group of men form the force centres or minute “energyunits” in the larger petals of their group centre. These again form petals insome particular planetary centre, and the aggregate of these petals form thoselarger centres of energy which we call “planetary centres.” These in their turnform centres of force for the Logos.Yet the mystery in connection with this is so profound that unless the studentcarefully guards himself from too mathematical and material a concept, he willgo astray. The etheric centres of man are not on the same plane as the ethericcentres of a planetary Logos. His centres are on the plane of the fourth cosmicether, the systemic buddhic plane, and it is only when man has taken the finalinitiation that his energy becomes incorporated into that of the planetarycentre on its own plane. The etheric centres of the planetary Logos aretransmitters and transmuters of force, and bear the same relation to Him as dothe physical centres to a human being. All the dense physical centres, such asthe mouth, for instance, [862] are transmitters of some type of energy arisingin the human brain or will.The understanding of force, of force transmission, and of the effects ofliberated force upon the higher planes is the secret of occult knowledge. Forceor energy flows in from the Ego. It works through the etheric centres andproduces results on the three planes, varying according to the age of the soul.As yet, through lack of alignment, this egoic force does not reach the physicalbrain as fully as it later will, but it does reach the astral centres, and isfrequently the cause of much of that lack of emotional control everywhere to beseen. The astral substance is as yet insufficiently organised, and when arousedby egoic energy moves violently. Astral substance is played upon by two counterstreams of force: first, the egoic, and secondly, that vibration set up throughcountless ages on the physical plane, which is latent in substance itself, andis the result of an earlier solar system. This it is which produces the violentaction and reaction to be seen in every life.It is not possible to give more data concerning the unfoldment of the petals andtheir connection with the etheric centres. Three hints of practical import anentthis stupendous subject may however be given which, if duly pondered upon, maycarry illumination to those who are ready.The first is that the etheric centres become active in a fourth dimensionalsense (or become wheels turning upon themselves) when the aspirant has compliedwith certain details.He must work upon the unfoldment of the fifth and sixth petals, or the final twoin the second circle and must endeavour to bring about two things in connectionwith his threefold lower nature: [863]a. He must align his three bodies so that there is a direct channel of contactformed between the Ego and the physical brain.b. He must strive to bring about a stabilisation of both the astral body and themind, and must aim at that emotional equilibrium which is produced by theconscious “balancing of forces.”He must study the laws of transmutation and be a student of that divine alchemywhich will result in a knowledge of how to transmute the lower force into thehigher, of how to transfer his consciousness into the higher vehicles, and ofhow to manipulate energy currents so that his own nature is transformed. He willthen become a channel for the light of the Ego, and for the illumination ofbuddhi to pour through for the saving of the race, and the lighting of those whostumble in dark places. He must demonstrate the laws of radioactivity in his ownlife on the physical plane. His life must begin to radiate, and to have amagnetic effect upon others. By this I mean he will begin to influence thatwhich is imprisoned in others, for he will reach—through his own powerfulvibrations—the hidden centre in each one. I do not mean by this the physical ormagnetic effect that many quite unevolved souls have upon others. I refer tothat spiritual radiation that is only responded to and realised by those whothemselves are becoming aware of the spiritual centre within the heart. At thisstage the man is recognised as one who can speak occultly “heart to heart.” Hebecomes a stimulator of the heart centre in his brother, and one who arouses meninto activity for others.The second hint is that as the aspirant becomes progressively radioactive, andas the energy of the inner God demonstrates more and more through the lowerpersonality, the “heat radiations” become so powerful that very definite resultsare produced of a personal, and also [864] of an environal, nature. A few ofthese results might be enumerated as follows:The etheric web, separating the lower physical consciousness of the brain fromthe astral plane begins to undergo a lengthy process of destruction, and thefirst “rents” in the web occur. It is through these that the student becomesaware of the inner planes, becomes conscious in the physical brain of the innerhappenings, and can (if a disciple) make his contacts with his Ego and (via thatego) with his Guru. (spiritual teacher) This marks a very important development.The higher head centre increases its activity and becomes capable of receivingflashes of illumination from the higher planes. This happens only occasionallyat first but with increasing frequency as the years progress, and the “rents”become more numerous.The various triangles become vivified and proceed to increased activity in duegeometrical progression, whilst the centre between the shoulder blades, theconverging point for certain fires, becomes active. This marks a definite stagein the process of transferring the fires into the higher centres. Roughlyspeaking, this period of the transference of the heat or energy of the lowercentres into the higher may be divided into two parts: first, that in which thecentres in the lower part of the body (those below the diaphragm) aretransferred into the centres in the higher part of the torso. These centres inthe torso are three in number, the heart, the throat, and the centre between theshoulder blades. We must here note that the throat centre is situated in thelower part of the throat, and properly belongs to the torso and not to the head.It should also be stated here that the centre between the shoulder blades is nota “sacred” centre, but is of a temporary nature, and is created by the aspiranthimself during the process of transference.[865] The second stage is that in which the energy of the lower six centres:a. The throat,b. The heart,c. The solar plexus,d. The spleen,e . The organs of generation,f. The base of the spine,are—in due order according to a man’s ray and subray—transferred into thecorrespondences within the head centre. These seven head centres are thereflection in the microcosm of those “mansions prepared in the Heavens” whichreceive the sevenfold energy of the monad. These are the chambers prepared bythe lower energy which are to be the recipients of “soul or the higher psychicenergy.”The final hint which can be given, may be summed up in the words that as theaspirant progresses, ( 275 [text00028.html#Y_FN275] ) he not only balances thepairs of opposites, but the secret of his brother’s heart becomes revealed tohim. He becomes an acknowledged force in the world, and is recognised as one whocan be depended upon to serve. Men turn to him for assistance and help along hisrecognised line, and he begins to sound forth his note so as to be heard notonly in human but in deva ranks as well. This he does, at [866] this stage,through the pen in literature, through the spoken word in lecturing andteaching, through music, painting and art. He reaches the hearts of men in someway or another, and becomes a helper and server of his race.Two more characteristics of this stage might here be enumerated.The aspirant has an appreciation of the occult value of money in service. Heseeks nothing for himself, save that which may equip him for the work to bedone, and he looks upon money, and that which money can purchase, as somethingwhich is to be used for others and a means to bring about the fruition of theMaster’s plans as he senses those plans. The occult significance of money islittle appreciated, yet one of the greatest tests as to the position of a manupon the probationary path is that which concerns his attitude to and hishandling of that which all men seek in order to gratify desire. Only he whodesires naught for himself can be a recipient of financial bounty, and adispenser of the riches of the universe. In other cases where riches increase,they bring with them naught but sorrow and distress, discontent and misuse.At this stage also the aspirant’s life becomes an “instrument of destruction” inthe occult sense of the term. Wherever he goes the force which flows through himfrom the higher planes, and from his own inner God, produces at times peculiarresults upon his environment. It acts as a stimulator of both the good and theevil. The lunar Pitris who form the bodies of his brothers and his own body arelikewise stimulated, their activity is increased, and their power greatlyaggravated. This fact is used by Those Who work on the inner side to bring aboutcertain desired ends. This it is also which oft times temporarily causes thedownfall of advanced souls. They cannot stand the force pouring into them, orupon them, [867] and through the temporary over-stimulation of their centres andvehicles they go astray. This can be seen working out in groups as well as inindividuals. But, inversely, if the lunar Lords of the lower self have beenearlier subjugated and brought under control, then the effect of the force andenergy contacted is to stimulate the response of the physical brainconsciousness and the head centres to egoic contact. Then the otherwisedestructive force becomes a factor for good and helpful stimulation, and can beused by Those Who know how, to lead men on to further illumination.All these stages have to work out on all the three lower planes and in the threebodies; this they do according to the particular Ray and subray. In this fashionthe work of the disciple is carried forward, and his testing and trainingcarried out until the two circles of petals are unfolded, and the third isorganised. Thus he is brought, through right direction of energy and wisemanipulation of force currents, to the Portal of Initiation, and graduates outof the Hall of Learning (276 [text00028.html#Y_FN276] ) into the great Hall ofWisdom—that Hall wherein he gradually becomes “aware” of forces, and powers,latent in his own Ego and egoic group. It is the Hall wherein he gains the rightto use the force of the egoic group, for he can now be trusted to wield it onlyfor the helping of humanity. After the fourth Initiation, he becomes a sharerin, and can be trusted with some part of the energy of the planetary Logos andthus be enabled to carry forward the plans of that Logos for evolution.[868] (e.) Initiation and the Petals. In considering the connection of thepetals and their unfoldment through initiation, there is little which it ispermissible to give out at this time for the information of the general public.All that is possible is to give certain statements, containing:a. Hints as to the right direction of the energy,b. Suggestions as to the basic mysteries which man has to solve,c . Indications as to certain correspondences,d. Practical points for constructive thinking.Students must remember that the aim of all truly occult teachers is not to giveinformation but to train their pupils in the use of thought energy. It willtherefore be apparent why this method of instruction is the one invariably used.It is the method which involves the dropping of a hint on the part of theTeacher, and the correlation perhaps of certain correspondences, coupled with asuggestion as to the sources of light. It involves, on the part of the pupil,the following recognitions:a. That the hint may be worth following.b. That meditation is the pathway to the source of light, and that the hintdropped is the “seed” for meditation.c. That facts, ill-assorted and uncorrelated, are menaces to knowledge and nohelp.d. That every aspect of truth, progressively grasped, has to be assimilated, andwelded into the experience of the student.e. That unless the correspondences agree in an atomic, personal, planetary andcosmic fashion, they are not to be trusted.f. That much information is withheld until the student is a disciple, and stillmore until he is a pledged initiate. The reason for this is to be found in the[869] fact that all knowledge concerns energy, its application, and its use ormisuse.Let us now continue with our consideration of the petals and Initiation.Each of the three circles of lotus petals is closely connected with one of thethree Halls. This has been earlier referred to. Much of the work connected withthe first tier of petals is part of the experience in the Hall of Ignorance. Theact of organising and preparing for unfoldment is the most important stage, andthat with which man is the most concerned. The act of petal opening is ofbriefer duration, and is produced by the pouring in of solar heat or fire, andthus bringing about a fresh access of energy. This is produced in our earthscheme through the co-operation of the Mahachohan, of the Chohan of a man’segoic group, and the particular Ego concerned.The following tabulation may be found helpful:I. Knowledge Petals. First circle.a. Organised in the Hall of Ignorance.b. Guided by the force and energy of the Mahachohan.c. The third group of solar Pitris affected.II. Love Petals. Second circle.a. Organised in the Hall of Learning.b . Guided by the force of the Bodhisattva.c . The second group of solar Lords affected.III. Will or Sacrifice Petals. Third circle.a. Organised in the Hall of Wisdom.b. Guided by the force and energy of the Manu.c . The first group of solar Angels affected.At the stage which we are considering (that of the organisation and unfoldmentof the first tier of petals), the egoic influence felt at the beginning is butsmall, but when the three petals become sufficiently active and alive throughthe energy accumulated and stored up in the [870] ego during the activities ofthe personal life, a form of initiation then takes place which is a reflection(on a lower plane) of the great manasic initiations. The energy in the outercircle of petals causes it to spring apart from the next circle, and to unfold.This threefold energy becomes interactive and a very definite stage is thusreached. This series of initiations is seldom recognised within the physicalbrain consciousness owing to the relatively inchoate stage of the bodies, andthe unresponsiveness of the brain matter. Yet they are nevertheless initiationsof a definite though less important character, and they involve primarily thedisplay (within the personal life of the man) of an intelligent recognition ofhis group relationships on earth. This recognition is frequently selfish incharacter, as, for instance, that which the union worker displays, but it isindicative of group interplay.A similar process takes place when the second circle of petals is organised andready for unfoldment. This time the World Teacher, the Master and the Egoconcerned are co-operating, for these smaller initiations deal with the lovenature, with astral or emotional organisation, and with the recognition (by theman in his personal life) of some form of unselfish love, and of a love for someobject, person or ideal which leads to altruistic endeavor, and to the negationof the lower self.This brings us to the third group of petals or to the unfolding of the will orsacrifice petals, based on intelligent purpose and pure love. The force in thisgroup calls in a different factor, that of the Manu, as well as the force of theBodhisattva, and the desired effect is produced through the full co-operation ofthe fully awakened Ego, aided by his own Master (if he is evolving in a cyclewherein hierarchical effort for humanity takes the form it does in this presentone), and the Manu. Eventually (after the second Initiation) the Lord of theWorld comes [871] in as a factor,—the Lord of world power, fully expressingitself in love.Speaking generally, therefore, it might be stated that egoic groups in whom theknowledge petals are being organised and unfolded come under the primaryinfluence of the Mahachohan; those in whom the love aspect, or the second circleof petals, is opening come under the primary influence of the Bodhisattva, withthe knowledge unfoldment paralleling the work; whilst those in whom the thirdtier is being opened come under the energy direction of the Manu, with the twoother types of force co-ordinated. It will be apparent to the careful readerthat in this fact lies hid the secret of why the Mahachohan holds office longerthan either of His two Brothers, holding it as He does for an entire worldperiod. The key to these cycles lies hid in the following thoughts: theBodhisattva and the Manu change more frequently and pass on to other work owingto the fact that They each embody one type of triple force, whereas theMahachohan is the focal point for five types of energy, each in its turn triplein nature.In each case of petal unfoldment, certain types of force are generated, dealtwith, assimilated, and used, at first unconsciously and finally with fullintelligence.In the Hall of Ignorance the force of the energy of Brahma (the activity andintelligence of substance) is that mostly dealt with, and the man has to learnthe meaning of activity based on:a. Inherent energy,b. Absorbed energy,c. Group energy,d. Material energy or that which is hidden in physical plane matter.In the Hall of Learning the disciple becomes aware of, and uses the energy of,the second aspect in form-building, in social relations, in family and othergroup affiliations. [872] He comes to the true recognition of sex and itsrelations but as yet views this force as something to be controlled and notsomething to be consciously and constructively utilised.In the Hall of Wisdom the initiate comes to the knowledge of the first greataspect of energy, the dynamic use of will in sacrifice, and to him is thencommitted the key to the three fold mystery of energy. Of this energy in itsthreefold aspect he became aware in the other two halls. At the third, fourthand fifth Initiations the three keys to the three mysteries are given to him.The key to the mystery sensed in the first Hall, the mystery of Brahma, ishanded to him and he can then unlock the hidden energies of atomic substance.The key to the mystery of sex, or of the pairs of opposites, is thrust into hishand, and he can then unlock the hidden forces within all forms. The key to themystery of sacrifice and to the secret of the Silent Watchers in the cosmos isrevealed to him, and he learns to unlock the hidden energies of the will aspect.The dynamo of the solar system is shown to him, if it might so be expressed, andthe intricacies of its mechanism revealed.The following are the three basic mysteries of the solar system:1. The mystery of Electricity. The mystery of Brahma. The secret of the thirdaspect. It is latent in the physical sun.2. The mystery of Polarity, or of the universal sex impulse. The secret of thesecond aspect. It is latent in the Heart of the Sun, i.e., in the subjectiveSun.3. The mystery of Fire itself, or the dynamic central systemic force. The secretof the first aspect. It is latent in the central spiritual sun.These three mysteries which we have touched upon above, come in a peculiar senseunder the jurisdiction of [873] certain great Lords or Existences, and They havemuch to do with the revealing of the mystery to those prepared initiates Whocome under Their influence during the final stages of the Path.The mystery of electricity has three keys, each of which is held in the hands ofone of the Buddhas of Activity. Theirs is the prerogative to control theelectrical forces of the physical plane, and Theirs the right to direct thethree major streams of this type of force in connection with our present globe .These three streams are concerned with atomic substance, out of which all formsare constructed. In connection with our chain there are three mysteriousEntities (of whom our three Pratyeka Buddhas are but the Earth reflections) Whoperform a similar function in connection with the electrical forces of thechain. In the scheme , the planetary Logos has also three co-operatingExistences Who are the summation of His third Aspect, and who perform thereforework similar to that performed by the three aspects of Brahma in the solarsystem. The mystery of this threefold type of electricity is largely connectedwith the lesser Builders, with the elemental essence in one particularaspect,—its lowest and most profound for men to apprehend as it concerns thesecret of that which “substands” or “stands back” of all that is objective. In asecondary sense it concerns the forces in the ethers which are those whichenergise and produce the activities of all atoms. Another type deals with theelectrical phenomenon which finds its expression in the light which man hassomewhat harnessed, in the phenomena such as thunder storms and themanifestation of lightning, with the aurora borealis, and in the production ofearthquakes and all volcanic action. All these manifestations are based onelectrical activity of some kind, and have to do with the “soul of things,” orwith the essence of matter. The old Commentary says: [874]“The garment of God is driven aside by the energy of His movements, and the realMan stands revealed, yet remains hidden, for who knows the secret of a man as itexists in his own self-recognition.”The mystery of electricity deals with the “garment” of God, just as the mysteryof polarity deals with His “form.”In the mystery of Polarity , we have three different types of force manifestingand thus it is apparent that the two mysteries deal with the six forces. Thesethree types of force are manipulated by the Buddhas of Love. They, through Theirsacrifice, concern Themselves with the problem of sex, or of “magnetic approach”on all the planes. The Buddha of Whom we speak and Who contacts His people atthe full moon of Wesak, is one of the three connected with our globe , havingtaken the place of One Who passed on to higher work in connection with the Chain, for the same hierarchical grading is seen as in connection with the Buddhas ofAction. One group might be considered the divine Carpenters of the planetarysystem, the other the divine Assemblers of its parts and the Ones Who, throughthe magnetic influence They wield, unite the diversities and build them intoform.The present ideas anent Sex must be transmuted and raised from the existinglower connotation to its true significance. Sex—in the three worlds—has to dowith the work of the lunar Pitris and the solar Lords. It signifies essentiallythe form-building work in substance, and its energising by the spiritual aspect.It signifies the elevation of the material aspect through the influence ofSpirit as the two together perform their legitimate function in co-operation andthus—by their mutual union and blending—produce the Son in all His glory. Thismethod of interpreting it is equally true of all the Existences manifesting onany plane, systemic and cosmic. Certain [875] factors enter into the thought ofsex which might be enumerated as follows:a. Mutual attraction,b. Complementary suitability,c. Instinctual appeal,d. Approach, and recognised co-operation,e. Union,f. The next stage is the temporary importance of the material aspect, that ofthe Mother, the feminine aspect,g. The withdrawal into a temporary retirement of the Father,h. The work of creating the Son,i. The evolution and growth of the Son, both materially and in consciousness,j. Emancipation of the Son from his Mother, or the liberation of the soul atmaturity from matter,k. Recognition by the Son of the Father and his return to that Father,The final result of all these successive stages being that all the three aspectshave performed their functions (their dharma) on the physical plane and allthree have demonstrated certain types of energy.The Father aspect manifests in giving the initial impulse or the positiveelectrical demonstration which is the germ of the created Son, and Whose Life isembodied in the Son. The occult significance of the words of the Christ inanswer to the cry “Lord, show us the Father” is little appreciated. “He that hasseen Me has seen the Father, for I and my Father are One,” He said. (Bible. JohnXIV, 8.)The Mother , or the negative aspect, builds and nourishes, guards and cherishesthe Son through the ante-natal, and the infant stages, and stands around Himduring later stages, giving of the energy of her own body and activity inministry to His need.[876] The Son, the combined energy of Father and of Mother, embodies both typesand all the dual sets of qualities, but has a character all His Own, an essencewhich is His peculiar nature, and an energy which leads Him to fulfil His Ownends and projects, and which will eventually cause Him to repeat the process ofproducing,—1. Conception,2. Creation,3. Conscious growth,as did His Father.When we reach the mystery of Fire , we are concerned with that mysteriousextra-systemic energy which is the basis of both the activity of Mother and theLife of the Son. The Son in very deed “becomes His Mother’s husband,” as say theancient Scriptures. This is but an enigmatical phrase unless interpreted interms of the combination of energy. Only when the Son has reached maturity andknows Himself as essentially the same as the Father can He consciously performHis Father’s function, and produce and perpetuate that which is needed for thesustaining of cosmic generation.The electricity of substance, the electricity of form, and the electricity ofLife itself must blend and meet before the true Man (whether Logos, or humanbeing) realises himself as creator. Man at this stage knows somewhat of theelectricity of substance, and is coming to the belief as to the electricity ofform (even though as yet he calls it magnetism) but as yet he knows nought ofthe electrical reality of life itself. Only when the “jewel in the Lotus” isabout to be revealed, or the third circle of petals is about to open up, doesthe initiate begin to have a realisation of the true meaning of the word “life”or spirit. The consciousness has to be fully awakened before he can everunderstand that great energising something of which the other types of energyare but expressions.[877] There are only two more points to be considered in connection with thepetals and initiation.First, it should be noted that the words “knowledge, love and sacrifice” meanmuch more occultly than the apparent significance of the terms. Each circle ofpetals stands for one of these three ideas, and each circle again embodies thesethree aspects of existence in a greater or lesser degree. These three conceptsare the modes of expression of the three great qualities which (from thestandpoint of the Past, the Present and the Future) characterise the natures ofall the manifesting entities—Gods, men and devas. From the standpoint of thecentral factor in manifestation, man, it should be realised that knowledge wasinherent in the previous solar system, and is the faculty of which he has toavail himself. It is there available for his use. It is the hidden energy of theplanetary Logos which he has to learn to focus through his physical brain, andthus apply.Love is the faculty inherent in the present. It is the hidden energy of theplanetary Logos of which he must avail himself and focus in his heart centre andthus apply.Sacrifice is the faculty which will be his in the future, which he willintelligently focus through the highest head centre and thus apply. It isdependent upon his development of consciousness, and therefore upon hisrecognition of the esoteric purpose of his group, and of the planetaryexistences. As it involves what is termed “a solar and lunar act of abnegation”it involves, therefore, a due comprehension of solar and of lunar energy, and abringing of both these two groups to a stage of co-operative activity. Itconcerns, therefore, the nature of the Jewel in the lotus, and it is only whenthe three sacrifice petals in the three tiers are unfolded that this particulartype of energy is released. The lunar Lords of the three bodies have beencontrolled, and their vibration synchronised, so that the great act of sacrificefinds them ready [878] for the final process of renunciation. The solar Lords,in their three major groups, are equally ready for the final sacrifice, whichinvolves the “rupture between the sun and the moon” as it is called. Thisresults in the breaking of the magnetic link between the true man, and thevibratory sensitive substance of which his three world bodies are made. The needfor incarnation is no longer felt, the chains of karma are broken, and the manis liberated. The “lunar Lords return to their own place” or—as the Christianexpresses it—”Satan is bound for a thousand years,” (Bible. Rev. XX, 2. ) thismeaning only that pralayic peace is the lot of these entities until the returnof manvantaric opportunity.The final sacrifice involves also the disappearance of the lower triangle, orthe severing of the connection between the three permanent atoms in the lowerpart of the causal body or egoic lotus, and the central unit of energy. Theenergy of these atoms is set loose through the intense heat produced by theunion of the three fires and is reabsorbed into the general reservoir ininterplanetary space. The fiery triangle is lost sight of in the general blaze,and the deva essences who temporarily formed it cease their activity.Again, the solar Angels complete their initial sacrifice by a final one, andoffer themselves upon the fiery altar. The causal body is completely destroyed.The four lower groups of solar Pitris return to the heart of the subjective sun,or to that inmost centre of the system from whence they came, whilst the threehigher groups are carried (by the force and energy generated in the fieryfurnace and blaze, and through the stimulation produced by the blazing forth ofthe central jewel) straight to the central spiritual sun, there to abide untilanother kalpa calls them forth to sacrifice Themselves, this time as planetaryLogoi. The student must bear in mind that [879] in thinking of the Pitris, hemust ever think in group terms. The Pitris who formed the egoic body of a humanbeing do not—alone and isolated—form planetary Logoi. The forty-nine groups ofsolar fires concerned in the great work are those spoken of, and they become theforty-nine planetary Logoi in connexion with seven solar systems. In them is hidthe mystery of the three who become the sixteen—united or synthesised by theseventeenth—a correspondence upon cosmic levels of the seven with the eighthsphere. This must remain practically an insoluble mystery to man at present.The four groups who found their way to the Heart of the system will reappear asthe four planetary Logoi who are the twenty-eight and who thus produce thepossibility of the ten of perfection in another series of manifesting systems.The seven types of solar energy find the “path of return” to their centralemanating source; by the disruption of the tie between them and the lunar lords(who are esoterically spoken of as “dead or dying on the field of battle”) thegreat sacrifice is consummated, and they are free to return in triumph.The occult significance of these words in connection with the energy standingbehind and working through all appearance might be expressed as follows:Knowledge (279 [text00028.html#Y_FN279] ) is the right apprehension of the lawsof energy, of the conservation of force, of the sources of [880] energy, of itsqualities, its types and its vibrations.It involves an apprehension of:a. The different key vibrations.b. The centres whereby force enters.c. The channels along which it circulates. [881]d. The triangles and other geometrical figures which it produces duringevolution.e. The cycles and the ebb and flow of energy in connection with the differenttypes of planetary manifestation, including all the kingdoms of nature.f. The true significance of those force aspects which we call “periods ofpralaya” and those we call “periods of manifestation.” It also involves a rightrealisation of the laws of obscuration.All this the man has been learning in the various Halls through practicalexperience, involving pleasure and pain; these, in the final initiations, bringhim to a realisation not only of the existence of these forces but of how towield and manipulate them. This is knowledge: to rightly direct force currents,first in the three worlds of human endeavour, and then in the solar system.Love is the right apprehension of the uses and purposes of form, and of theenergies involved in form-building, the utilisation of form, and the eventualdissipation of the superseded form. It involves a realisation of the Laws ofAttraction and Repulsion, of the magnetic interplay between all forms, great andsmall, of group relationships, of the galvanizing power of the unifying life,and the attractive power of one unit upon another, be it atom, man, or solarsystem. It involves an understanding of all forms, form purposes, and formrelationships; it concerns the building processes in man himself, and in thesolar system; and it necessitates the development of those powers within manwhich will make him a conscious Builder, a solar Pitri of a coming cycle. This[882] is one of the great revelations at initiation: the unveiling to theinitiate of the particular cosmic centre whence emanates the type of force orenergy which he, the initiate, will be concerned with when he becomes in duecourse of time a solar Pitri, or divine manasaputra to coming humanity. Hence hemust have, not only knowledge, but the energy of love likewise to enable him toperform the function of linking the higher three and the lower four of a futurerace of men at some distant period, thus permitting of their individualisingthrough the sacrifice of his own fully conscious middle principle.Sacrifice involves even more than what has been already pointed out. It involvesthe following factors:a. Knowledge of the purposes and intentions of the planetary Logos,b. Realisation of the particular and peculiar type of energy, and of the qualityof his own Ray Lord,c. Comprehension of the different groups of existences who are participating inplanetary evolution and in solar manifestation,d. A revelation as to certain cosmic enterprises in which our planetary Logos isacting as an intelligent co-operator. Thus is brought in the factor ofextra-systemic force.When all these and other factors are considered, it is evident that the energyset loose in sacrifice to these plans and intentions involves such a vast fieldof comprehending wisdom that it is not possible for the average man ever tosense it. It deals with the purposes and plans of the Silent Watchers over thethree planes—the five, and the seven; it deals with the dynamic force of thegreat Destroying Angels on all the planes, who will eventually—through themanipulation of the three forms of energy—bring to an end all that is. Theseangels are a mysterious group of fohatic Lives Who sound forth the [883]trumpets of destruction, and by means of the notes sounded produce thatshattering which will set loose the energy of forms.The second point is very briefly given. It concerns the innermost circle ofpetals, or that set of three petals, or those three streams of whirling energy,which immediately surround the “jewel in the lotus.” Each of these three petalsis related to one of the three circles, and is organised as each of the threecircles is unfolded. They form, therefore, a synthesis of knowledge, love orsacrifice, and are closely connected through the type of force flowing throughthem with one of the three higher centres of the planetary Logos of a man’sparticular ray. This central unit of threefold force is dealt with in a specificmanner at initiation.At the first, the second, and the third Initiations, one of the three petalsopens up, permitting an ever freer display of the central electric point. At thefourth Initiation, the jewel (being completely revealed) through its blazinglight, its intense radiatory heat, and its terrific outflow of force, producesthe disintegration of the surrounding form, the shattering of the causal body,the destruction of the Temple of Solomon, and the dissolution of the lotusflower. The work of the Initiator in this connection is very interesting.Through the medium of the Rod of Initiation and of certain Words of Power, Hebrings about results of a co-ordinating, transmuting and liberating nature.Through the action of the Rod as wielded at the first two Initiations, the twoouter circles unfold, the energy of the two is set free and the two sets offorce as embodied in the six petals are co-ordinated and become interactive.This stage of petal adjustment succeeds upon that called earlier “unfoldment”and has to do with the simultaneous action of the two tiers of petals. Theinterplay between the two circles is completed, and the circulation [884] of theforce currents perfected. According to a man’s ray and subray, so is the Rodapplied to what might be termed the “key” petal. This of course differsaccording to the unit of force involved. It is of interest to note here that, asthe petal substance is deva substance and as the energy of the petals is theenergy of certain manasadevas (one of the three higher orders of Agnishvattas)the initiate is overshadowed (the word is not entirely satisfactory inexplaining the type of deva service here necessitated, but it must suffice) by agreat deva who represents the equilibrium of substantial vibration which isbrought about by the efforts of the initiate, aided by the adepts who presenthim, and who each represent one of the two polarities of force. This istemporarily stabilised by the Initiator. These three factors,1. The representing deva,2. The two adepts,3. The initiator,form, for a brief second, a triangle of force with the initiate at the centre.Through them circulates the terrific power, the “fire from Heaven,” which isbrought down from the higher triad through the agency of the electrical rod.This application of extra-egoic force is in itself of a threefold nature, assymbolised by the three protective agencies and the threefold nature of the Roditself. It emanates in a primary sense from the planetary Logos of a man’s ray,and proceeds from that one of the planetary centres which corresponds to eitherthe head, heart, or throat centre in a human unit. This energy is applied to thecorresponding tier of petals and to the corresponding petal in a tier accordingto the initiation taken, and according to the primary and secondary ray. A closeconnection can be traced here between the petals and the centres of the ethericlevel of the physical plane, [885] and thus it can be seen how (when thenecessary work is done) it is possible to have a direct transmission of forcefrom the higher planes to the lower in the following order:a. From the logoic centre, or the planetary Logos, to the Monad on its ownplane.b. From that Monad to one of the three tiers of petals, according to the aspector ray concerned.c. From the tier of petals, viewed as a unit, to one of the petals in thecircle, according to the quality and type of force, using the petal as atransmitting agency.d. From the particular petal in which the force is momentarily centred to one ofthe permanent atoms, again according to ray and type of force.e. From the permanent atom via the atomic triangle, and the mental, and astralcentres, to that one of the three higher centres in the etheric bodyparticularly concerned.f. From the etheric centre to the physical brain.We have here put very briefly the process of force transmission from the Monadto man on the physical plane, and hence it will be apparent why the emphasis isso consistently laid upon the necessity for bodily purity (in all the threebodies), and upon the alignment of those bodies so that the flow of force may beunimpeded. The effects of this downflow of force may be viewed in a twofoldmanner, that is, in a material and in a psychic sense.The material effect , or the result of this stimulation upon the forms and uponthe atoms in the forms, is to render them radioactive, or to set loose theenergy of substance. This is the liberating of the energy imprisoned within theform, and concerns the Brahma aspect, and [886] the evolution of matter itself.It affects the lunar bodies, and therefore relates to the lunar Lords or Pitris,causing a weakening of their hold upon the lesser builders, bringing them moreunder the force streams from the solar Angels, and leading to a situation whichwill eventually result in a return of the lunar Pitris of all degrees to thecentral point for force substance. In a psychic sense the result of the downflowis a stimulation of consciousness, and the acquisition (through thatstimulation) of the psychic powers latent in man. His three higher physicalcentres, the pineal gland, the pituitary body, and the alta major centre areaffected, and man becomes psychically aware in the physical brain of the higherinfluences, happenings and powers. According to the ray concerned, so is thecentre affected. The force of the lunar Lords, which has succeeded in keepingthese three organs quiescent, is superseded and the solar Angels pour in theirenergy.All this again is closely connected with the threefold energy of the physicalbody, and produces effects within the spinal column which arouses the kundalinifire at the base of the spine, causing it to mount along the triple spinalchannel, again according to ray and aspect involved. More anent this may nothere be said, as the dangers of a premature knowledge along this line are fargreater than the dangers of ignorance. Suffice it to point out that the fires atthe lower centres,—those below the diaphragm—have, by the time the secondinitiation is reached, usually mounted to the centre between the shoulderblades; at the second initiation they rise as far as the head, and all the firesof the torso are then active. All that remains then to do is to centralise them,to produce the necessary geometrical interplay between the seven head centres,and then to focus them all prior to the final liberation in the highest centreof all. [887]4. The Fire Elementals, The Lesser Buildersa. Introductory.It will be apparent now that in our consideration of the deva Builders, greatand small, of the solar system, we have hitherto practically confined ourselvesto those who are the functioning agents in the three worlds of human endeavour.We have dealt briefly with the Builders on the evolutionary arc, the greaterentities who either have passed through the human kingdom, and therefore haveleft that stage of evolution behind them in earlier cycles, or are at this timethe “solar agents” of human manifestation. All these forms of divine existencerepresent—in their own place—aspects of positive force. We come now to theconsideration of the lesser builders in the three worlds, those who representthe negative aspect of force, being on the involutionary arc, and who are,therefore, the recipients of energy and influences. They are worked upon byenergy, and through the activity of the greater Builders are forced intodifferent directions in space, being built into the differing forms. The energythat works upon them, as is well known, emanates from the second aspect, and intheir totality they form the great Mother.I would call to the attention of all students the fact that these lesserbuilders are literally a “sea of fire” upon which the great breath, or the AUM,takes effect. Each fiery spark, or atom, becomes (through the action of theWord), vitalised with new life, and impregnated with a different type of energy.In the union of the life of atomic substance itself with that which causes theatoms to cohere, and to form vehicles of some kind or another, can be seendemonstrating the “Son of God.” Herein lies the essential duality of allmanifestation; this duality is later supplemented by the life of the One Whosounds the Word. Thus is the cosmic incarnation [888] brought about with thethree factors entering in. This has been sufficiently dealt with in earlierpages.Much that will have to be said will be of a tabulatory nature, and the only wayin which students can check up the approximate accuracy of that which isimparted will be through a careful meditation upon:a. The Law of Correspondences.b. The realisable probabilities.c. The indications in occult literature of a corroborative nature.Students should remember that we are dealing with involutionary substance, oratomic matter. This atomic matter is living substance, each atom being a tinylife palpitating with the vitality of the third Logos. These lives, beingnegative energy, are responsive to their polar opposite, and can (under the Lawof Attraction and Repulsion) be built into forms which are the expression of thesecond aspect. Eventually the forms themselves become in their turn negative,and responsive to still another type of force, becoming recipients of the lifeof the first Logos when the fourth or human kingdom is reached.This Treatise seeks to prove, that in the fourth kingdom the three fires meet:a. Fire by friction, or the negative Brahma Aspect, the third Aspect.b. Solar Fire, or the positive negative Vishnu Aspect, the second Aspect.c. Electric Fire, or the positive Shiva Aspect, the first Aspect.Man in the three worlds, consciously or unconsciously, recapitulates the logoicprocess, and becomes a creator, working in substance through the factor of hispositive energy. He wills, he thinks, he speaks, and thought-forms eventuate.Atomic substance is attracted to the [889] enunciator. The tiny lives whichcompose that substance are forced (through the energy of the thinker), intoforms, which are themselves active, vitalised and powerful. What man builds iseither a beneficent or a maleficent creation according to the underlying desire,motive, or purpose.It is essential that we endeavour to make practical what is here to be imparted,as it is useless for man to study the groups of lesser builders, their functionsand their names, unless he realises that with many of them he has an intimateconnection, being himself one of the great builders, and a creator within theplanetary scheme. Men should remember that through the power of their thoughtsand their spoken words they definitely produce effects upon other human beingsfunctioning on the three planes of human evolution and upon the entire animalkingdom. The separative and maleficent thoughts of man are largely responsiblefor the savage nature of wild beasts, and the destructive quality of some ofnature’s processes, including certain phenomena, such as plague and famine.It is of no value to man to know the names of some of the “army of the voice”unless he comprehends his relationship to that army, unless he apprehends theresponsibility which is his to be a beneficent creator, working under the law oflove, and not impelled to the creative act through selfish desire, oruncontrolled activity.b. Physical Plane Elementals .It should be remembered that the devas we have been considering are theoriginators of impulse, and the manipulators of energy in their own degree, andon their own plane. In connection with them are to be found, therefore, therecipients of force, or the multitude of lives of an elemental nature which formthe sumtotal of the matter of a plane. These are swept on waves of energy,through the impulse of the Breath, and as the result of [890] vibratory action,into all forms as we know them on the physical plane. Therefore, in connectionwith manifestation on the physical plane the devas may be divided into threegroups:1. The transmitters of the will of God, the originators of activity in devasubstance. These are the greater builders in their various groups.2. The manipulators of the initiated energy. These are the myriads of workerswith force who transmit the impulse in their turn to the elemental essence. Theyare the builders of lesser degree, but are on the evolutionary arc as are thefirst group.3. The recipients of force , the sumtotal of the living substance of a plane.These lives are passive in the hands of the builders of greater degree.The three groups to be considered are:1. The elementals of densest matter.2. The elementals of liquid matter.3. The elementals of gaseous matter.We must bear in mind as we study these three groups that we are not concernedwith the transmitters, but with the manipulators and with the recipients ofenergy.The Elementals of Densest Matter. These are the workers and builders which areconcerned with the tangible and objective part of all manifestation. In theirtotality they literally form that which can be touched, seen, and contactedphysically by man. In considering these matters we must never dissociate thevarious groups in our minds in a too literal sense, for they all interpenetrateand blend, in the same manner as man’s physical body is compounded of dense,liquid, gaseous, and etheric matter. Diversity, producing a unity, is everywhereto be seen; this fact must constantly be borne [891] in mind by the occultstudent when studying the subhuman forms of existence. There is a distinctdanger in all tabulations, for they tend to the forming of hard and fastdivisions, whereas unity pervades all.Among the manipulating devas of the lowest level of the dense physical plane areto be found certain subterranean forms of existence, of which hints are to befound in the ancient and occult books. There is to be found in the very bowelsof the earth, an evolution of a peculiar nature, with a close resemblance to thehuman. They have bodies of a peculiarly gross kind, which might be regarded asdistinctly physical as we understand the term. They dwell in settlements, orgroups, under a form of government suited to their needs in the central cavesseveral miles below the crust of the earth. Their work is closely connected withthe mineral kingdom, and the “agnichaitans” of the central fires are under theircontrol. Their bodies are constituted so as to stand much pressure, and they arenot dependent upon as free a circulation of air as man is, nor do they resentthe great heat to be found in the earth’s interior. Little can here becommunicated anent these existences, for they are connected with the lesservital portions of the physical body of the planetary Logos, finding theirmicrocosmic correspondence in the feet and legs of a man. They are one of thefactors which make possible the revolutionary progressive activity of a planet.Allied with them are several other groups of low class entities, whose place inthe scheme of things can only be described as having relation to the grosserplanetary functions. Little is gained by enlarging upon these lives and theirwork; it is not possible for man in any way to contact them, nor would it bedesirable. When they have pursued their evolutionary cycle, they will take theirplace in a later cycle in the ranks of certain deva bodies that are related tothe animal kingdom.[892] It is commonly supposed that all the fairies, gnomes, elves, and likenature spirits are to be found solely in etheric matter, but this is not so.They are to be found in bodies of gaseous and liquid substance likewise, but themistake has arisen for the reason that the basis of all that which can beobjectively seen is the etheric structure, and these little busy livesfrequently protect their dense physical activities through the agency ofglamour, and cast a veil over their objective manifestation. When etheric visionis present then they can be seen, for the glamour, as we understand it, is onlya veil over that which is tangible.Students must at this juncture remember that all dense physical forms, whetherof a tree, an animal, a mineral, a drop of water, or a precious stone, are inthemselves elemental lives constructed of living substance by the aid of livingmanipulators, acting under the direction of intelligent architects. It willimmediately become apparent why it is not possible in any way to tabulate inconnection with this particular lowest group. A beautiful diamond, a statelytree, or a fish in the water are but devas after all. It is the recognition ofthis essential livingness which constitutes the basic fact in all occultinvestigation, and is the secret of all beneficent magic. It is not my purpose,therefore, to deal more specifically with these lowest forms of divine life,except to impart two facts, and thus give indication of the solution of twoproblems which have oft disturbed the average student; these are, first, theproblem as to the purpose of all reptilian life, and, secondly, the specificconnection of the bird evolution with the deva kingdom.The secret of the reptile kingdom is one of the mysteries of the second round,and there is a profound significance connected with the expression “the serpentsof wisdom” which is applied to all adepts of the good law. [893] The reptilekingdom has an interesting place in all mythologies, and all ancient forms oftruth impartation, and this for no arbitrary reason. It is not possible toenlarge upon the underlying truth which is hidden in the karmic history of ourplanetary Logos, and is revealed as part of the teaching given to initiates ofthe second degree.The second great life impulse, or life wave, initiated by our planetary Logos,when brought in conjunction with the first, was the basis of that activity whichwe call evolutionary energy; it resulted in a gradual unrolling, or revelation,of the divine form. The heavenly serpent manifested, being produced out of theegg, and began its convolutions, gaining in strength and majesty, and producingthrough its immense fecundity millions of lesser “serpents.” The reptile kingdomis the most important part of the animal kingdom in certain aspects, if such anapparently contradictory statement can be made. For all animal life can be seenpassing through it during the prenatal stage, or returning to it when the formis in advanced decomposition. The connection is not purely a physical one, butit is also psychic. When the real nature and method of the kundalini, or serpentfire, is known, this relation will be better understood, and the history of thesecond round assume a new importance.The secret of life lies hidden in the serpent stage,—not the life of the Spirit,but the life of the soul, and this will be revealed as the “serpent of theastral light” is truly approached, and duly studied. One of the four LipikaLords, Who stand nearest to our planetary Logos, is called “The Living Serpent,”and His emblem is a serpent of blue with one eye, in the form of a ruby, in itshead. Students who care to carry the symbology a little further can connect thisidea with the “eye of Shiva” which sees and knows all, and records all, as [894]does the human eye in lesser degree; all is photographed upon the astral light,as the human eye receives impressions upon the retina. The same thought isfrequently conveyed in the Christian Bible, in the Hebrew and Christianrecognition of the all-seeing eye of God. The application and value of the hintshere given may be apparent if the subject of the third eye is studied, and itsrelation to the spine, and the spinal currents investigated. This third eye isone of the objects of kundalinic vivification, and in the spinal territory thereis first the centre at the base of the spine, the home of the sleeping fire.Next we have the triple channel along which that fire will travel in due courseof evolution, and finally we find at the summit of the column, and surmountingall, that small organ called the pineal gland, which when vivified causes thethird eye to open, and the beauties of the higher, subtler planes to standrevealed. All this physico-psychical occurrence is possible to man owing tocertain events which happened to the Heavenly Serpent in the second, or serpent,round. These happenings necessitated the formation and evolution of thatpeculiar and mysterious family we call the reptilian. These forms of divine lifeare very intimately connected with the second planetary scheme, being responsiveto energy emanating from that scheme, and reaching the earth via the secondglobe in the second chain. A group of special devas (connected with a particularopen sound in the planetary Word), work with the reptile evolution.It should be noted here that this evolution on the etheric planes has a closereffect upon man than on the physical. If students will apply themselves to theconsideration of these facts, to the investigation of the serpent lore in alllands, mythologies and scriptures, and if they will link up all this knowledgewith that concerning those heavenly constellations which have a serpentappellation (such as, for instance, the Dragon), much [895] illumination maycome. If the intuition suffices, knowledge may then be imparted which will makeclearer the connection between the physical bodies with their centres, and thepsychic nature.The bird kingdom is specifically allied to the deva evolution. It is thebridging kingdom between the purely deva evolution and two other manifestationsof life.First. Certain groups of devas who desire to pass into the human kingdom, havingdeveloped certain faculties, can do so via the bird kingdom, and certain devaswho wish to get in communication with human beings can do so via the birdkingdom. This truth is hinted at in the Christian Bible and Christian religiousrepresentations by angels or devas being frequently represented as having wings.These cases are not many, as the usual method is for the devas gradually to workthemselves towards individualisation through expansive feeling, but in the caseswhich do occur these devas pass several cycles in the bird kingdom, building ina response to a vibration which will ultimately swing them into the humanfamily. In this way they become accustomed to the use of a gross form withoutthe limitations, and impurities, which the animal kingdom engenders.Second. Many devas pass out of the group of passive lives in the effort tobecome manipulating lives via the bird kingdom, and before becoming fairies,elves, gnomes, or other sprites, pass a certain number of cycles in the birdrealm.Why the two above events occur will not be apparent to the casual reader, norwill the true connection between the birds and the devas be accurately realisedby the occult student unless he applies himself to the consideration of the“bird or swan out of time and space,” and the place that birds play in themysteries. Herein lies for him the clue. He must remember likewise the fact thatevery life of every degree, from a god to the most [896] insignificant of thelesser devas, or builders, must at some time or another pass through the humanfamily.As H. P. B. has pointed out, (S. D., Section X, Vol. I, 384, 435; II, 306.)birds and serpents are closely connected with wisdom, and therefore with thepsychic nature of God, of men, and of devas. The study of mythology shouldreveal certain stages and relationships which will make this matter clearer.The Elementals and Lesser Devas of Liquid Matter. A very interestingillustration of the interpenetration of all the living matter of creation can beseen in connection with the atmosphere surrounding our planet. In it is to befound:a. Moisture, or those living essences which are the liquid elementals.b. Gaseous substance, or those lives which are linked to all fiery essences,being volatile and the result of heat.c. Etheric matter, or the lowest orders of the devas of the ethers.This major triplicity, when in conjunction, produces that which we breathe, andthat in which we live and move and have our being. To the thoughtful student theair is full of symbology, for it is a synthesis, and that which bridges thehigher and the lower strata of manifestation.We must centre our attention first upon those lives which constitute thesumtotal of all that is watery, and liquid throughout manifestation, and indealing with this we must remember that we are concerned with the most occult ofinvestigations, and with matters which are very closely connected with man’sevolution.The many groups of the water devas of the manipulatory class have been roughlygrouped by mythological writers, under the terms undines, mermaids, and other[897] expressions, but their diversity is great, and this will be necessarilyapparent when it is remembered that the sumtotal of water upon the earth(oceans, seas, rivers, lakes and streams), far exceeds the dry portion, or land,and every drop of moisture is in itself a tiny life, fulfilling its function andrunning its cycle. The mythic forms above referred to are but those myriad livesbuilt into a form through which an evolutionary deva is seeking expression.The extreme interest of this subject might be expressed under certain statementswhich will give the student some idea of the close attention which should, andeventually will be paid to this subject of the deva lives of waterymanifestation. As said above, the aggregate of these lives is greater than theaggregate of those lives which form the sum total of solid earth as weunderstand the term, even though they do not exceed the number of lives whichform the gaseous portion of manifestation; this gaseous portion is found in theatmosphere, interpenetrating dense matter, and filling in a large degree theinterior caverns of the planet. The microcosmic resemblance to the great Life ofthe planet is seen in the fact that both forms are but outer sheaths orframeworks, sheltering an inner “vault”; both forms are hollow, both have theirnegative and positive extremities, their poles, so to speak, and internally muchproceeds affecting the outer evolutions.One of the most occult of the planets, Neptune, presides over the “devas of thewaters”; their presiding deva Lord, Varuna, the Raja of the astral plane, beingan emanation from that planet. Students will find it of profound interest tostudy the close interaction therefore between:1. The sixth plane, the astral plane, and the sixth subplane of the physicalplane, the liquid subplane. [898]2. The sixth subplane of each plane in the solar system, and their relation toeach other.Herein will be found one reason why men of a relatively low type of physicalbody, and having an astral body with some sixth subplane matter in it areresponsive to higher things and have a spiritual aspiration. The influenceemanating from the sixth subplane of the buddhic plane calls out a reciprocalresponse from the sixth subplane matter in other bodies, and the sixth principleof buddhi under the Law of Correspondences intensifies that vibration.The name Neptune is one under which the planetary Logos of one of the majorthree schemes is known upon our planet. Certain of His influences and energiesaffect paramountly the deva essence of this sixth subplane matter, reaching themvia the Raja Lord Varuna. This knowledge is of practical value astrologically,for it will enable men to understand the nature of their own physical bodies,and above all of their astral bodies. It is an occult fact that the type ofastral matter in a man’s body decides the quality of the watery substance of hisphysical body. There is, in occultism, no dissociating the physico-psychicnatures, for the latter determines the former. The planet Neptune therefore hasa profound effect and a close connection under the Law of Correspondences withthe sixth, or astral plane, which is the plane of the liquid portion of thelogoic physical body, with the sixth subplane of the physical plane, or with theliquid portion of the human physical body and of the planetary physical body,also with the sixth type of energy or force, or the sixth ray.The major scheme over which Neptune presides forms a systemic triangle of greatinterest for esoteric astrologers with the sixth scheme and one other. This issymbolised in the three pronged trident which the god Neptune [899] is alwaysportrayed as holding, the prongs being literally the symbolic trianglesconnected with each other by three lines of force.This planet has also a vital relation to the sixth logoic principle, or Buddhi,and therefore the sixth principle of man. No man begins to co-ordinate thebuddhic vehicles until he comes under Neptunian influence in some life oranother. When this is the case, his personality horoscope will show Neptunianinfluence dominating somewhere.The Neptunian scheme governs one of the three paths of return, and gathers toitself eventually all those Egos who attain primarily through the manipulationof the sixth type of energy usually called devotion. It is Neptunian influencelikewise which presides over and makes possible the second Initiation, whereinthe initiate produces results in the astral body, and wherein his astral centresare the object of the Hierophant’s attention. This particular type of energyflows through three centres:a. That particular head centre which is linked to the heart centre.b. The heart centre.c. The solar plexus.The planet Neptune, along with the planetary Logos of the sixth ray controls theastral centres in man. This statement involves much esoteric macrocosmicsignificance. When it is remembered that all centres—human and divine—arecomposed of deva essence, the connection between this influence and the devas,and their reflex effect upon man, will immediately become apparent.In the mystery of the sea and the secret of its occult “drying up” orabsorption, will be revealed eventually the significance underlying: [900]a. The sex impulse, macrocosmically and microcosmically interpreted.b. The cessation of desire.c. The direction of fire to the throat centre instead of to the generativeorgans.d. Pralaya and obscuration.e. The meaning of the words “There shall be no more sea” found in the ChristianBible.When meditating upon these thoughts, students will find it well to bear in mindthe fact that Neptune is one of the major or synthesising planets, that it is an“absorbing” or “abstracting” planet, and that it is connected with the processwhereby eventual perfection is demonstrated. The Son is made perfect, and thecosmic incarnation is brought to a close.There is again a very close esoteric connection between the fact lying behindthe Biblical words “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,”(Bible. Gen., 1:2.) and the ordered lawful activity of the Great Mother as sheperforms her work of body-building under the impulse of desire. The truerelation between the astral plane and the physical plane will only becomeapparent as students carefully bear in mind that the astral plane of the solarsystem is the sixth subplane of the cosmic physical plane, and constitutes thesumtotal of the liquid substance of the logoic physical body. When this isrealised, the work of the deva essence takes due place; the factor of desire, orof astral motion, and its reflex action upon the physical body via the sixthsubplane will become apparent, and the Great Mother will be seen activelyengaged, under the influence of desire, in the work of building, nourishing, andproducing that warmth and moisture which make manifestation possible. The Motheris the greatest of the devas, and closely linked [901] with the devas of thewaters, for moisture of some kind or another is an essential to all life.The sixth principle, therefore, or the love aspect (the Christ principle), andthe sixth plane, are connected; there is an interplay of energy between thefourth cosmic ether, or buddhic energy, and the sixth plane, or astral energy.The devas on both these planes belong essentially to groups over which Neptunianinfluence presides, hence the astral plane can, and eventually will, directlyreflect the buddhic.The greater building devas on the second plane of the solar system, the monadicplane or the second cosmic ether, direct the energies of the manipulating devasof the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane.The manipulating devas of the fourth cosmic ether will, in due course ofevolution, work out the plan in objective perfection through the medium of theliving substance of the lesser devas of the liquid or astral plane. When theyhave done this two results will be seen: first, the astral plane will perfectlyreflect the buddhic plane and, secondly, the result of that will be that thephysical plane will produce the exact vehicle needed for microcosmic ormacrocosmic expression through the force of water, or desire.All this is revealed to esotericists in the symbology of the circulatory systemin man. As the blood system, with its two types of channels (arteries and veins)and its two types of builders (the red and the white corpuscles), is studiedfrom the occult standpoint, much will be ascertained of a revolutionary nature.The laws of the path of outgoing, and of the path of return, with the two groupsof deva lives therein concerned, will be apprehended by man. A further hint mayhere be given. In the physical body of man in connection with the circulatorysystem, we find, in the three factors—the heart, the arteries, and the veins—theclue to the three types [902] of devas, and also to the systemic triangle whichthey represent, and further, to the three modes of divine expression. There is aplanetary as well as a systemic circulation, and it is carried on through themedium of deva substance everywhere, macrocosmically as well as microcosmically.The devas of the sixth physical subplane can be divided into three groups, andthese again into seven and into forty-nine, thus corresponding with all groupsin the solar system. These groups (in their essential nature) respond to that“which lies above more than that which lies below,” which is only an occult wayof expressing a relationship of an intimate nature between the devas of fire andthe devas of water, and a negation of a close connection between the water devasand the earth. Occultly expressed, through the action of the fire devas, thewater devas find liberation.The devas of water find for themselves the path of service in their great workof nourishing all the vegetable and animal life upon the planet; the goal forthem is to enter into that higher group of devas which we call the gaseous orfire devas. These, through the action of their fire upon the waters, producethat sequence of evaporation, condensation, and eventual precipitationwhich—through its constant activity—nourishes all life upon the earth. Thusagain can the psychic laws of love be seen at work in the deva kingdom as in thehuman; first, the withdrawal or segregation of the unit from the group (calledindividualisation in man, and evaporation in the water realm). Next,condensation, or the amalgamation of the unit with a newer or higher group, thiswe call condensation for the devas of the waters, and initiation in man;finally, the sacrifice of the group of human or deva atoms to the good of thewhole. So does the law of service and sacrifice govern all the second aspectdivine in all its departments great [903] or small. Such is the law. But in thehuman kingdom, though love is the fulfilling of the law, it is arrived at alongthe path of pain and sorrow, and every true lover and server of humanity isstretched upon the cross until for them the sixth principle dominates, and thesixth type of matter in their bodies is completely subjected to the higherenergy. ( 282 [text00028.html#Y_FN282] ) In the case of the devas, love is thefulfilling of the law without pain or sorrow. It is for them the line of leastresistance, for they are the mother aspect, the feminine side of manifestation,and the easy path for them is to give, to nourish, and to tend. Therefore, thedevas of the waters pour themselves out in service to the vegetable and animalkingdoms, and in the transmutative fires all that holds them on the sixthsubplane will eventually be overcome, and through occult “distillation andevaporation” these devas will eventually form part of the gaseous fiery groupand become those fires which are the basis of the divine alchemy.Speaking generally, it must be remembered that the earth devas of densest matterbecome, in the course of evolution, the devas of the waters, and find their wayeventually on to the astral plane, the cosmic liquid; the devas of the waters ofthe physical plane find their way, through service, on to the gaseous subplane,and then to the cosmic gaseous, becoming the devas of the mental plane. Thisliterally and occultly constitutes the transmutation of desire into thought.The gaseous devas become eventually the devas of the fourth ether, and fromthence in long aeons, find their way to the cosmic fourth ether, the buddhicplane. These three groups are therefore cosmically connected with: [904]1. The cosmic astral plane and the constellation whence emotional and desireenergy originates.2. The cosmic mental plane, and therefore with the constellation Sirius.3. The cosmic buddhic plane, and the constellation of the Pleiades.Thus can the whole process be worked out, if man carefully studies his ownnature, and the law of analogy.The Devas of the Gaseous Subplane . In dealing with the elementals, or lesserdevas, under the manipulatory devas of this extensive group, we are dealing withthe devas of fire, and with the fiery essences of substantial nature which canbe seen manifesting in myriads of forms. Certain of the subdivisions of thisgroup are known to students, such as:The Salamanders , or the fiery lives which can be seen by clairvoyants leapingin the flames of a furnace or of a volcano; this group can be subdivided intofour groups according to color—red, orange, yellow, and violet—the last of whichapproximate very closely to the devas of the fourth ether.The Agnichaitans; this is a term applied to the fiery lives, which are thesumtotal of the plane substance, as seen in the first part of our treatise, andalso to the tiny essences which compose the fires of manifestation. As thenature of physical plane electricity is understood and studied, and its truecondition realised, the reality of the existence of these agnichaitans willstand revealed.As the race becomes clairvoyant, as it surely will in a great degree before theclose of this rootrace, these gaseous devas will stand revealed, and men willrealise that they are working with fiery lives, and that they are themselvesclosely allied to these lives through the fires of their own bodies. Theclairvoyance which is in process [905] of developing in this rootrace isentirely physical, and, under the law, its development is to be anticipated, forthe Aryan rootrace is that one wherein man—in this fourth round—comes to fullself-consciousness. This involves complete physical vision, and the use inperfection of the three physical plane senses of hearing, touch, and sight. Inthe next rootrace, astral clairvoyance will be prevalent, though not universal,and thus contact with the buddhic plane will be more easily achieved. In theearlier rootraces of the next round, the fifth, there will be a recapitulationof the activities of this round, until, in the fifth rootrace, the sumtotal ofthat achieved in this round will be seen. Men will then begin to demonstratemental clairvoyance. Thus the cycles mingle and overlap, in order that no unitof life, however small and unimportant, may fail in opportunity.These agnichaitans of the third subplane come particularly under the influenceof Saturnian energy. They are the great fusers of substance, and it is inconnection with them that the transmutation of metals becomes possible. Theyhave a relationship to the mineral kingdom analogous to that which the waterydevas have to the vegetable and animal. They are, as will be apparent, connectedwith the throat centre of a planetary Logos and of a solar Logos, and it isthrough their activity that the transmission of sound through the air becomespossible. It might surprise students and inventors could they but realise thatthe present rapid growth of wireless communication everywhere is due to theswinging into contact with the human vibration of a group of fiery deva liveshitherto uncontacted.Just as each plane has its seven subplanes, so likewise each subplane can besubdivided, thus making forty-nine fires on every plane, or the three hundredand forty-three fires of the solar system. Herein can be found the clue to themystery of the “fourth between the three” [906] which has at times bewilderedstudents of the occult records. There are several ways of reading these figures,3 4 3, but the only occult method which can be hinted at here, lies in therecognition of the three higher planes, the three lower planes, the fourth planeof meeting between them. This fourth plane has occultly been called “the meetingplace.” When it is remembered that the goal for these gaseous devas is thefourth cosmic ether, or the buddhic plane and that they (in their major andminor groups) are the internal macrocosmic and microcosmic fires, some idea maybe gained as to the true significance of the eventual at-one-ment between thetwo lines of evolution for the goal for man likewise is the buddhic plane.On the third subplane, therefore, in its fifth division of deva essences,certain groups are now being contacted in this, the fifth rootrace; the resultof this contact can be seen in the stimulation of responsive vibration, which isdemonstrated already in the discovery of wireless intercourse and of radium.There will also be seen a paralleling increased vibration of the human spirillaewhich will result, before the end of the round, in the awakening to fullactivity of the fifth spirilla of the human physical permanent atom.Hence the work of the Mahachohan at this time in connection with seventh ray(which is temporarily acting as the synthesis of the five types of energy overwhich He presides), might be summed up as follows:First, He is utilising the seventh type of energy in order to further therecognition by the human unit of the subtler substance of the physical plane.This seventh ray is a primary factor in the production of objectivity. Theenergy of the planetary Logos of the seventh scheme dominates the seventh plane;it is the ray whereon deva substance and Spirit can meet and adapt [907]themselves to each other with greater facility than on any other ray except thethird.Man, at present, is fully conscious, through some one or other of his senses, onthe three lower subplanes; it is intended that he shall be equally conscious onthe four higher. This has to be brought about by the stimulation of the devasubstance which composes his bodies. This will be accomplished through thedynamic will of the transmitting devas as they energise the manipulatory devas,and thus affect the myriads of lesser lives which compose man’s body, and alsoby an increased responsiveness of the indwelling man or thinker to the contactmade upon his body. This increased awareness will be brought about by thearousing of the fifth spirilla, by the unfolding of the fifth petal in the egoiclotus, and by the gradual opening of the third eye through the arousing anduniform activity of five factors: the centre at the base of the spine, the threechannels in the spinal column, and the pineal gland.All these factors involve the activity of deva essence, plus the resultantawareness of the thinker. This will be followed by the conscious use of thenewly-awakened powers. In this manner the close interrelation andinterdependence of the two lines of evolution becomes magnificently apparent.Second, the Mahachohan is working specifically at this time (in co-operationwith the Manu), with the devas of the gaseous subplane; this is in connectionwith the destroying work they are to effect by the end of this rootrace, inorder to liberate Spirit from constricting forms. Volcanic action therefore maybe looked for, demonstrating in unexpected localities, as well as within thesphere of the present earthquake and volcanic zones. Serious disturbance may belooked for in California before the end of the century, and in Alaska likewise.The work of the Mahachohan can also be seen in the [908] effect that the devasof the kundalini fire are producing upon man. These are a peculiar group ofAgnichaitans who have reached a stage of evolution which permits of their beingseparated off from their group into a group connected with a certain fire inman’s bodies. This fire owing to its present activity, and the direction of thatactivity, is responsible for the reaction against physical marriage, and for thedesire evinced by highly evolved men everywhere to evade the marriage relation,and confine themselves to creation upon the mental or astral planes. This is dueto the present inclination of the manipulatory devas of the lower generativeorgans to seek the throat centre, and to function there, utilising the strengthof the kundalini fire to bring this about. All this is under the law ofevolution, but in the interim between cause and justified effect much harm,evasion of the law, and consequent suffering can be seen. Owing, therefore, tothe violent reaction at this time against the safeguarding laws of civilisation,it has been decided that the nature and functions of the devas must be somewhatrevealed to man, and that their place in the scheme of things, and man’s closeconnection and dependence upon them, must be given out. ( 283[text00028.html#Y_FN283] ) At the same time, the means whereby they can becontacted, and the words whereby they can be controlled, will be withheld.Laxness in the marriage relation, due to this particular cause, is only seenamongst the highly evolved and amongst the independent thinkers of the race.Similar laxness amongst the masses, and the low types of humanity, is based upona different reason, and their promiscuity is due to certain developments of theanimal nature in its lowest manifestation. These two causes [909] will bearconsideration by those who have the present needs of civilisation at heart. Theycan then co-operate with the Mahachohan in the work of effecting the verynecessary transfer of force from a lower to a higher centre, and prevent(through knowledge), the incidental license. This will bring about a refusal tobesmirch the great love or sex impulse of nature.The ceremonial ray has been often called “the marriage ritual of the Son,”because upon this ray Spirit and matter can meet and have union. This fact alsoshould be borne in mind during the next one hundred years, for they will seegreat changes in the marriage laws. The present laxity will inevitably bring areaction, and the laws will become more stringent, in order to safeguard therace during a transition period. These laws will not be along the line of makingescape from the marriage relation more difficult, but will take effect at theother end, so to speak; the rising generation will be properly taught andguarded, and indiscriminate, hasty marriage will not be permitted, nor willjuveniles be allowed rashly to enter into the marriage obligation. There is noneed to enlarge further upon this, for in working out their own problems menlearn, and all that those upon the inner side are permitted to do is to give ahint or an indication.Another angle of the Mahachohan’s work at this time is connected with sound ,and therefore with the particular devas whom we are considering. Through themismanagement of men, and their unbalanced development, the sounds of earth,such as those of the great cities, of the manufactories, and of the implementsof war, have brought about a very serious condition among the gaseous devas.This has to be offset in some way and the future efforts of civilisation will bedirected towards the spreading of a revolt against the evils of congested livingand to the dissemination of an impulse of a widespread [910] nature to seek thecountry and wide spaces. One of the main interests in the future will be atendency towards the elimination of noise, owing to the increased sensitivenessof the race. When the energy of water and of the atom is harnessed for the useof man, our present types of factories, our methods of navigation and oftransportation, such as steamers and railway apparatus, will be entirelyrevolutionised. This will have a potent effect not only on man but on the devas.c. The Elementals of the Ethers.We will consider now the etheric levels of the physical plane or the fourhighest subplanes of the physical plane. These etheric levels are but gradationsof physical plane matter of a rarer and more refined kind, but physicalnevertheless. They are termed in most textbooks:1. The first ether, or atomic matter.2. The second ether, or sub-atomic matter.3. The third ether, or super-etheric matter.4. The fourth ether, or simply etheric matter.The fourth ether is the only one as yet recognised by scientists, and is thesubject of their present investigations, little though they may realise it.On the atomic subplane are the permanent physical atoms of all humanity and theappropriated atoms of the deva kingdom. The devas do not develop as do the humanrace. They reincarnate in groups, and not as individuals, though each group iscomposed of units, and has nothing of the nature of the involutionary groupsoul. The group soul on the involutionary path and that upon the evolutionaryare unlike; one is passing on to differentiation and is composed of entitiesanimated by one general life; the other has differentiated, and each entity is aseparate unit of the one life, complete in itself, yet one with the whole.[911] There are many types of life to be contacted on the four etheric levels,but we can only concern ourselves at present with the deva life, rememberingthat the deva evolution is of equal importance to that of the human. These devasare many in number, are of involutionary and evolutionary nature, and of allgrades and types. Ruling over them on the physical plane is the great devaKshiti. He is a deva of rank and power equal to a Chohan of a Ray; He presidesover everything outside the human kingdom upon the physical plane, and He hasfor His council the four subordinate deva lords of the four etheric levels. He,with these subordinate devas, presides over a subsidiary council of seven devaswho handle all that concerns the deva evolution, and the work of the greater andthe lesser builders.The deva Ruler of the fourth, or lowest ether, has delegated a member of Hiscouncil to meet with certain of the Masters at this time for two specificpurposes, first, to see whether the approximation of the two lines of evolution,human and deva, might be now tentatively permitted, and, secondly, to revealsome of the methods of healing and the causes of physical disability which areinherent in the etheric double.Devas of all kinds and colours are found on the physical etheric levels, but theprevailing hue is violet, hence the term so often employed, the “devas of theshadows.” With the coming in of the ceremonial ray of violet, we have theamplification therefore of the violet vibration, always inherent on theselevels, and the great opportunity therefore for contact between the twokingdoms. It is in the development of etheric vision (which is a capacity of thephysical human eye) and not in clairvoyance that this mutual apprehension willbecome possible. With the coming in likewise of this ray will arrive those whobelong thereon, with a natural gift of seeing etherically. Children willfrequently be born who will [912] see etherically as easily as the average humanbeing sees physically; as conditions of harmony gradually evolve out of thepresent world chaos, devas and human beings will meet as friends.As the two planes, astral and physical, merge and blend, and continuity ofconsciousness is experienced upon the two, it will be difficult for human beingsto differentiate at first between devas of the astral plane, and those of thephysical. At the beginning of this period of recognition, men will principallycontact the violet devas, for those of the higher ranks amongst them aredefinitely making the attempt to contact the human. These devas of the shadowsare of a dark purple on the fourth etheric level, of a lighter purple, much thesame colour as violet, on the third etheric level, a light violet on the second,whilst on the atomic subplane they are of a glorious translucent lavender.Some of the groups of devas to be contacted on the physical plane are asfollows:Four groups of violet devas , associated with the etheric doubles of all thatexists on the physical plane. These four are in two divisions, those associatedwith the building of the etheric doubles, and those out of whose substance thesedoubles are built.The green devas of the vegetable kingdom . These exist in two divisions also.They are of high development, and will be contacted principally along the linesof magnetisation. The greater devas of this order preside over the magneticspots of the earth, guard the solitude of the forests, reserve intact spaces onthe planet which are required to be kept inviolate; they defend them frommolestation, and with the violet devas are at this time working definitely,though temporarily, under the Lord Maitreya. The Raja Lord of the astral plane,Varuna [913] and his brother Kshiti, have been called to the council chamber ofthe Hierarchy for specific consultation, and just as the Masters areendeavouring to prepare humanity for service when the World Teacher comes, sothese Raja Lords are working along similar lines in connection with the devas.They are arduous in Their work, intense in Their zeal, but much obstructed byman.The white devas of the air and water who preside over the atmosphere work withcertain aspects of electrical phenomena, and control the seas, rivers, andstreams. From among them, at a certain stage in their evolution, are gatheredthe guardian angels of the race when in physical plane incarnation. Each unit ofthe human family has his guardian deva.Each group of devas has some specific method of development and some meanswhereby they evolve and attain a particular goal.For the violet devas the path of attainment lies through feeling, and througheducating the race in the perfecting of the physical body in its twodepartments.For the green devas the path of service is seen in magnetisation, of which thehuman race knows nothing as yet. Through this power they act as the protectorsof the vegetable plant life, and of the sacred spots of the earth; in their worklies the safety of man’s body, for from the vegetable kingdom for the remainderof this round comes the nourishment of that body.For the white devas the path of service lies in the guarding of the individualsof the human family, in the care and segregation of types, in the control of thewater and air elementals, and much that concerns the fish kingdom.Thus in the service of humanity in some form or another lies attainment forthese physical plane devas. They have much to give and do for humanity, and intime [914] it will be apparent to the human unit what he has to give towards theperfecting of the deva kingdom. A great hastening of their evolution goesforward now coincident with that of the human family.There is another group of devas about which much may not as yet be communicated.They have come in from another planetary scheme, and are specialists in theirparticular line. They have attained, or passed through, the human kingdom, andare of equal rank with certain members of the Hierarchy, having chosen to stayand work in connection with the physical plane evolution. They are not many innumber, being only twelve. Four work in the violet group, five in the greengroup, and two in the white, with a presiding officer of rank equal to a Chohan.The number of the deva evolution is six, as that of man is now five, and as tenstands for perfected man, so twelve stands for perfection in the deva kingdom.This group presides over the three earlier enumerated. Certain subsidiary groupsare found.Under group 1 are found all the elementals working with the etheric doubles ofmen, all the elementals forming the etheric bodies wherein is life, and all theelementals working with the etheric counterparts of so-called inanimate objects.These are named in the order and the importance of their development. The violetdevas are on the evolutionary path; the elementals are on the involutionarypath, the goal for them being to pass into the deva kingdom of violet hue.Under group 2 work the fairies of plant life, the elves who build and paint theflowers, the radiant little beings who inhabit the woods and the fields, theelementals who work with the fruits, vegetables, and with all that leads to thecovering of the earth’s surface with verdure. Associated with them are the [915]lesser devas of magnetisation, those attached to sacred spots, to talismans andto stones, and also a special group to be found around the habitations of theMasters wherever situated.Under group 3 work the elementals of the air and the sea, the sylphs, the waterfairies, and the devas who guard each human being.Here only general hints are given. This list is not complete and does notinclude the grosser elementals, the brownies, and those that inhabit the darkspaces of the earth, the cities and the subterranean spots of the earth’s crust.The devas of the ethers carry on their foreheads a translucent symbol in theform of a crescent moon, and by this they may be distinguished from the astraldevas by those able to see clairvoyantly.As we consider the devas of the ethers, we find that they fall naturally—as faras manifestation is concerned—into two main groups. Each group is represented oneach of the four subplanes, and this grouping must be considered as but onemethod of differentiation out of the many possible. These groups are, first,those devas who are the transmitters of prana to all forms of life; they are agroup of intermediary devas, and may be regarded as the energy providers intheir various differentiations; secondly, those devas who form the ethericbodies of every form in manifestation. These constitute the bulk of the lesserdevas.There are naturally many other organised intelligences in the great Army of theVoice in connection with this primary division of the physical plane, but if thestudent will consider these two groups, and will investigate their relationshipto man and to the Heavenly Man within Whose body they are to be found, he willlearn much which will enable him to comprehend problems hitherto consideredinsoluble, and will find many things [916] revealed which will tend torevolutionise the findings of modern science, and bring about changes in thecare of the physical body.The Devas and Energy. Before we take up the consideration of these two groups itmight be wise here to emphasise the necessity of remembering that when weconsider the etheric levels of the physical plane we are dealing with thoseplanes upon which the true form is to be found, and are approaching the solutionof the mystery of the Holy Spirit and the Mother. In this realisation, and itsextension to include an entire solar system, will come a clarifying of theconnection between the four higher planes of the system and the three worlds ofhuman endeavour. We have, in the macrocosm , the four planes of super-consciouslife, or those four central vibrations which are the basis of the life andenergy of the etheric body of a planetary Logos and of a solar Logos, and thethree planes of conscious and of self-conscious life which form the densephysical vehicle of a Heavenly Man, and of the Grand Man of the Heavens.By a close scrutiny of these conditions in the macrocosm and in the microcosmwill come a comprehension of the reason why the physical vehicle is neverconsidered a principle at all by occultists. The Holy Spirit, the One Whoovershadows and Who implants the germ of life in the waiting acquiescent VirginMother or matter (causing her to awaken and to commence her great work ofproducing the divine incarnation) is a primary factor from the standpoint of thesecond solar system. In a way incomprehensible to modern thinkers, the Mother,or the divine Aspirant to the mysteries of the cosmic marriage, was (in aprevious system) the dominant factor. In this system in connection withsubstance it is the Holy Spirit. The work, therefore, on etheric levels, and theenergy and activity originating therefrom, are the factors that primarily areresponsible on the physical [917] plane for all that is tangible, objective, andmanifested. The accretion of matter around the vital body, and the densificationof substance around the vital etheric nucleus are in themselves the result ofinteraction, and the final interchange of vibration between that which might becalled the residue from an earlier manifestation, and the vibration of thispresent one.It is here—in the relation between positive electrical energy in its fourfolddifferentiation, and the triple negative receptive lower substance—thatscientists will eventually arrive at certain definite deductions and discover:a . The secret of matter itself, that is, matter as we know and see it.b. The key to the process of creation upon the physical plane, and the methodwhereby density and concretion on the three lower levels are brought about.c. The formulas for organic transmutation, or the key to the processes wherebythe elements as we know them can be disintegrated and recombined.Only when scientists are prepared to admit the fact that there is a body ofvitality which acts as a focal point in every organised form, and only when theyare willing to consider each element and form of every degree as constitutingpart of a still greater vital body, will the true methods of the great goddessNature become their methods. To do this they must be prepared to accept thesevenfold differentiation of the physical plane as stated by Eastern occultism,to recognise the triple nature of the septenary manifestation.a. The atomic or Shiva energy, the energy of the first subplane or the firstetheric plane.b . The vital form building energy of the three ensuing etheric levels.c. The negative receptive energy of the three planes [918] of the densephysical, the gaseous, the liquid and the truly dense.They will also eventually consider the interplay between the lower three and thehigher four in that great atom called the physical plane. This can be seenduplicated in the atom of the physicist or chemist. Scientific students who areinterested in these matters will find it worth while to consider thecorrespondence between these three types of energy, and that which is understoodby the words, atoms, electrons, and ions.All that manifests (from God to man) ( 284 [text00028.html#Y_FN284] ) is theresult of these three types of energy or force, of their combination, theirinterplay, and their psychic action and reaction. During the great cycle oflogoic appearance it is the second type of energy which dominates and which isof evolutionary importance, and this is why the etheric body which lies back ofall that is visible is the most important. This is equally true of gods, of menand of atoms.Much time is spent in speculating upon the sources of life, upon the springs ofaction, and upon the impulses which underlie the creative processes. Hithertoscience has worked somewhat blindly and has spent much time investigating thelower three planes. It has dealt principally with the Mother, with the negativereceptive matter, and is only now becoming aware of the Holy Spirit aspect, orof the energy which enables that Mother to fulfill her function, and to carry onher work.Considering the same problem microcosmically it may be pointed out that men areonly now beginning to be [919] aware of the springs of spiritual action, and ofthe sources of spiritual life. The energy of the higher planes is only revealingitself as men begin to tread the Way, and to come under the influence of buddhi,which flows from the fourth cosmic etheric plane.Finally, when scientists are willing to recognise and to co-operate with theintelligent forces that are to be found on etheric levels, and when they becomeconvinced of the hylozoistic nature of all that exists, their findings and theirwork will be brought into a more accurate correspondence with things as theyreally are. This, as has been earlier pointed out, will be brought about as therace develops etheric vision, and the truth of the contentions of the occultistis proved past all controversy.It will have been noted that in the enumeration of these two main groups, we didnot touch upon that great group of Builders who are called esoterically “Thosewho transmit the Word.” I have only dealt with the two groups who constitute the“Army of the Voice.” This is due to the fact that in this section we are onlydealing with that army, or with those builders, great and small, who are sweptinto activity as the Word of the physical plane sounds forth. The “Transmittersof the Word” upon the first subplane or atomic level are those who take up thevibratory sound as it reaches them from the astral plane and—passing it throughtheir bodies—send it forth to the remaining subplanes. These transmitters maybe, for purposes of clarity, considered as seven in number. In their totalitythey form the atomic physical bodies of the Raja Lord of the plane and in apeculiarly occult sense these seven form (in their lower differentiations onetheric levels) the sumtotal of the etheric centres of all human beings, just ason the cosmic etheric levels are found the centres of a Heavenly Man.The connection between the centres and etheric substance, systemic and human,opens up a vast range for [920] thought. The “Transmitters of the Word” on theatomic subplane of each plane are devas of vast power and prerogative who may bestated to be connected with the Father aspect, and embodiments of electric fire.They are all fully self-conscious, having passed through the human stage inearlier kalpas. They are also corporate parts of the seven primary head centresin the body of a solar Logos or planetary Logos.Though connected with the Father aspect, they are nevertheless part of the bodyof the Son, and each of them, according to the plane which he energises, is acomponent part of one or other of the seven centres, either solar orplanetary—planetary when only the particular centre is concerned, systemic whenthat centre is viewed as an integral part of the whole.Each of these great lives (embodying deva energy of the first degree) is anemanation from the central spiritual sun in the first instance and from one ofthe three major constellations in the second instance. Systemically they fallinto three groups: Group 1 includes those transmitters of the Word who are foundon the three lower subplanes of the plane Adi, or the logoic plane. Group 2comprises those great builders who transmit the Word on the three next systemicplanes, the monadic, the atmic and the buddhic. Group 3 is formed of those whocarry on a similar function in the three worlds of human endeavour.Fundamentally they are also emanations from one of the seven stars of the GreatBear in the third instance.In these triple emanatory forces may be found the origin of all that is visibleand objective, and through their agency our solar system takes its place withinthe greater cosmic scheme, and a certain basic cosmic fire is formed. They arethe sumtotal of the head, the heart and the throat centres of the solar Logos,and their correspondences will be found within a Heavenly Man, a human [921]being, and an atom. Hence the scientist, as he discovers the nature of the atom,is putting himself in touch with these three types of solar energy, and isunravelling the central mystery of the system. As the triple nature of the atomstands revealed, so likewise the triple nature of man and of God graduallybecomes proven. The energy of these groups passes through the physical sun, andfrom thence they sound the Word for the particular plane of their specificendeavour.The student must not make the mistake of thinking that these seven greattransmitters are the seven Heavenly Men. They form one half of Their realnature. This is all that can be said of this great mystery, though it might beadded that from another angle of vision, they form but one third of histhreefold divine nature. Man is dual, being Spirit and matter; he is also,during evolution, a triplicity, so it is with a Heavenly Man, and hence themystery.The great Transmitter of the Word on the physical plane, which is the one underour consideration, is the energising factor of the throat centre of Brahma. Aninteresting tabulation of the threefold centres and the three divine aspectsmight here be given which may prove of use to the student, though he shouldcarefully bear in mind that these centres are for the purpose of generating andtransmitting energy.1. The transmitter of energy on the physical plane forms the throat centre inthe body of Brahma, the third aspect.2. The transmitter of energy upon the astral plane forms the heart centre ofBrahma.3. The transmitter of the Word on the mental plane forms the head centre ofthis, the third aspect.These three Raja Lords, devas, or transmitters, form the three centres of logoicforce in the three worlds. They are the lowest energy aspect of Brahma. [922]4. The Transmitter of the Word upon the buddhic plane forms the throat centre ofVishnu, the second aspect. From thence the Word goes forth that builds the densephysical form of a Heavenly Man or of a solar Logos.5. The Transmitter of energy upon the monadic plane forms the heart centre ofVishnu, the second aspect.6. The Transmitter of force upon the atmic plane forms the head centre ofVishnu.This tabulation will be confusing to students unless it is realised that we arehere considering these aspects only as dualities, and are dealing with one ofthe dual parts. It will be apparent that in the Vishnu aspect, for instance,which manifests upon the second plane, the energy of that plane will act as thehead centre to the succeeding planes, and this apprehension, rightly grasped,will clarify the others.The Transmitter of the Word on the first plane of Adi is the embodiment of thethroat centre of a cosmic entity. From this statement will come a justrealisation of our place in the cosmic scheme, and the fundamentally physicalnature of the seven planes of the solar system is also here demonstrated, thenature of Brahma, or the Holy Spirit, becoming apparent.The old Commentary says:“Brahma is One, yet includes His brother. Vishnu is One, yet existeth not apartfrom His brother, younger in point of time yet older far. Shiva is One, andantedates Them both, yet He appeareth not nor is He seen, until They both havecycled through Their courses.”The above sevenfold tabulation can be, under the law of correspondences, appliedequally to every plane, for the transmitters and workers on each plane formsimilar groups. Equally well can man consider this tabulation in connection withhis seven centres, and from a study [923] of the two together he will gainknowledge as to the type of energy which flows through any particular centre.These transmitters likewise can be heard sounding forth the Word with particularforce and power in that planetary scheme which corresponds to their note and iskeyed to their vibration. The planetary schemes, therefore, will fall into asimilar grouping, and this will open up for students a vast field of conjecture.The seven Prajapatis fall into two groups of three, with one dominating.Students will do well to remember in studying the solar system, the planes, theschemes, man and the atom, that the groupings of the lines or streams of energyduring the evolutionary cycles fall naturally into four divisions:1. 1―3―32. 4―33. 3―44. 3―1―3Division 1 can be understood under the law of correspondences when the nature ofthe atomic plane of the solar system, the three cosmic etheric planes, and thethree planes of human endeavour are investigated in connection with each other.Division 2 becomes easier of comprehension when the close relation between thefour cosmic etheric planes and the three lower planes is grasped. This can beilluminated by a study of the four physical ethers and the three lower subplanesof our physical plane.Division 3 finds the clue to its mystery in the constitution of the mentalplane, with its three formless levels, and its four levels of form.Division 4 can be grasped as the student arrives at a comprehension of his ownnature as a spiritual triad, an egoic body and a threefold lower man. He canlikewise approach the first division in a similar manner, and view himself as aprimary force or Monad, a triple secondary [924] force or Ego, and a threefoldlower energy, or personality, remembering that we are here dealing only withcreative energy and with the Brahma aspect of manifestation as it co-ordinatesitself with the Vishnu aspect.The Transmitters of Prana. We have in an earlier section of this treatiseconsidered somewhat the devas who are the transmitters of prana for the ethericbody of man and of the planet. They are the reflection upon the lowest plane ofthe Vishnu aspect of divinity; the seven subplanes of our physical plane reflectin a dim and distorted fashion the three aspects, and are a shadow, dark andunrevealing, of the Godhead. This group of transmitters are responsible forthree principal results, and are active along three main lines.They are the devas who vitalise and produce the energy of all forms of sentientlife. Theirs is the life which pulsates through the etheric body of every plantand animal and of all intermediate forms of life, and which constitutes theraging fire which is seen circulating through all etheric vehicles. Among manyother functions they produce the warmth of the sun and of all bodies; they arethe cause of solar, planetary, and human radiation, and they nourish andpreserve all forms. They occultly mediate between the Father and the Mother oneach plane, whether cosmic or systemic. They originate in the sun, and areclosely related to the logoic and planetary solar plexus, for the evolutionaryprocess, as in all manifestation, is the result of desire, acting upon thecreative faculties and producing that which is objective.They are the devas who energise the myriads of minute lives which build theetheric bodies of all that is seen and tangible, and who are the instigators ofthe creative processes on the three lowest subplanes of the physical plane.Systemically, the devas engaged in this line of activity can be subdivided intotwo groups: [925]a. Those who work on the four higher systemic planes and from thence influencein the three worlds, producing through reflex action the desired results.b. Those who work in the three worlds of human endeavour, producing directlydense physical manifestation.All the etheric devas who transmit energy on the physical plane belong to thesecond division above enumerated, and according to the subplane on which theywork come under the guidance of a greater intelligence on a corresponding plane.There are also the devas who form the attractive force of all subhuman forms,holding the forms of the three lower kingdoms of nature together in coherency,and thus producing the body of manifestation of the great Entity who is thesumtotal of the life of the kingdom, and of the lesser beings who ensouldifferent families and groups within any specific kingdom.The Devas of the Etheric Double . The subject that we are to deal with nowconcerns those devas who are etheric doubles of all that is. It is full ofprofit therefore to the wise student, for it reveals the method whereby allforms materialise upon the physical plane.It is not the purpose of this treatise to trace the materialisation of a form asit originates upon the archetypal planes, through the agency of divine thought,and from thence (through directed streams of intelligent energy) acquiressubstance as it is reproduced upon each plane, until eventually (upon thephysical plane) the form stands revealed at its densest point of manifestation.No form is as yet perfect, and it is this fact which necessitates cyclicevolution, and the continual production of forms until they approximate realityin fact and in deed. The method of form production may be tabulated as follows:[926]FORM PRODUCTION1. Divine thought The cosmic mental plane. 2. Divine desire The cosmic astralplane. 3. Divine activity The cosmic physical plane (our seven systemic planes).First plane .The logoic Breath . . . First plane . . . . The Sound ( 285[text00028.html#Y_FN285] ) AThis is the first etheric appearance of a solar system upon the atomic subplaneof the cosmic physical plane. The seeds of life are all latent. Faculty inheresfrom an earlier solar essence.The logoic Sound . . . .Second plane . . . .The Sound A UThis is the body of the solar system in the second ether. This plane is thearchetypal plane. The seeds of [927] life are vibrating or germinating. Theseven centres of energy are apparent. The one deva Agni is seen as seven. Theform is now potentially perfect.The logoic triple Word..The third plane..The Sound A U M.The body of the solar system in substance of the third etheric plane is seen,and the three function as one. The triple energy of the Logos is co-ordinated,and nothing now can hinder the work of evolution. The three groups of devas areactive, and the archetypal form is in process of materialization.The logoic septenary word - The logoic etheric Centres become active The fourthplane The seven syllabled Word.The etheric body of the solar system is now complete, though it will not beperfected till the end of another manvantara. The greater body of vitality isready to energise the dense physical vehicle. The seven centres with theirforty-nine major petals are vibrant, and consciousness thrills through everyatom in the system.An interlude or period of pause is to be found at this stage of development; init the processes of co-ordination and of stabilisation are carried on; theenergy or the vibration is increased until it becomes possible, by asimultaneous effort, emanating from all the three aspects, to bring intoobjectivity that which is as yet subjective. This is paralleled by man on thephysical plane in the applied effort he has to make to bring through andmaterialise, that which he has conceived and desired. The reason so many peoplefail in materialising their concepts, and hence come to be reckoned as failures,is owing to the fact of their inability to make a co-ordinated applied effort,and thus set in motion substance of the three lower subplanes of the physicalplane. They succeed [928] in bringing their concept through from the mentalplane (as does the Logos on cosmic levels) as far as the fourth etheric level ofthe physical, and there their energy becomes exhausted owing to three things:a. Lack of sustained will or concentration,b. Lack of alignment with the Ego,c. A weakness of co-ordination between the two parts of the physical vehicle.The logoic Phrase - The gaseous body. Fifth plane The plane of the logoicmantram of 35 stanzas.The gaseous form of the solar system now appears, and the energy centres becomeveiled and hidden. Accretion and concretion rapidly proceeds. The three groupsof builders co-ordinate their efforts afresh and a new influx of energy—bearingdevas from the logoic head centre—pours in. The lesser builders respond to thelogoic mantram chanted anew at each manvantara, and the seven streams of energyfrom the seven logoic centres are directed downwards.The logoic Song of Love or Desire - The logoic liquid body. The Sixth plane Apoem in forty-two verses.This song or vibration causes the bringing in of a body of devas from the logoicheart centre to swell the efforts of those already active. The liquid body ofthe solar Logos appears, and the form exists in its six differentiations.Concretion is very rapid, and activity is considerably more violent owing to thegreater density of the accruing substance.The logoic Book of Life Seventh plane Exists in forty-nine chapters.The entire form stands revealed. During evolution it must manifest its purposeand its nature. A third group [929] of devas from the logoic throat centreappear, and cooperate with their brothers. All the fires are burning, all thecentres are active, and every petal, forty-nine in number, on the fourth planeof Buddhi is producing a reflex activity upon the dense physical plane.Men, when occupied in creation of any kind, and in the process of producingforms on earth which embody an idea, work along similar lines. The analogy isperfect.In connection with those human beings who create nothing, but who are only sweptinto activity under the urge of circumstance—and they are the bulk of the humanrace—it should be pointed out that they are a part of the creative activity ofsome greater, and more advanced, entity. As self-conscious evolution proceeds,more and more of the human family will become creators and intelligent workersin connection with deva substance. In the initial stages, therefore, of theirdissociation from a passive attitude, there will be found a revolt against lawand order, a refusal to be governed, and an ability evidenced to follow out anindividual concept at the expense of the group, great or small. This apparentdefect, evolution itself and experience will remedy, and as the consciousnessbecomes alive to higher vibrations the man will become aware of the purpose andplan of the Intelligence of his group. He will awaken to the beauty of that planand will begin to submerge his own interests in the greater, and to co-operateintelligently. The creative power which had before been of a separative naturewill be offered as a willing sacrifice to the greater energy, and his smallplans and ideas will be merged in the greater ones. He will no longer, however,be a passive unit, swept hither and thither by the energy of his group, but willbecome a positive, active potent force, self-immolated through intelligentrecognition of the greater plan.He will become alive to the fact that there are living [930] forces in nature.As the greater energy thrills through him, his own latent powers are awakened.He sees and knows the deva forces and can consequently work with themintelligently. Some he will control and manipulate, with others he willco-operate, and others still he will obey.It is in the realisation of these facts anent deva substance, the power ofsound, the law of vibration, and the ability to produce forms in conformity withlaw, that the true magician can be seen. Herein too lies one of the distinctionsto be found between magicians of the Good Law, and those of the Left-hand Path.A white magician can control and manipulate deva substance, and he proceeds todo it through an intelligent co-operation with the greater builders. Owing tothe purity and holiness of his life, and the height of his own vibration, he cancontact them in some one or other of their grades. The magician of the shadowscontrols and manipulates deva substance on the astral and physical plane and onthe lower levels of the mental plane through the force of his own vibration andknowledge, but not through co-operation with the directing builders. He cannotcontact them, as his character is impure through selfishness, and his vibrationis too low; his power therefore is limited and destructive, yet immense withincertain restrictions.The devas of the etheric doubles fall into two groups. They are those who arethe lesser builders, and who, under direction from the greater builders, formthe etheric doubles of all that can be seen and all that is tangible on thedense physical plane. They exist in vast hosts and are omnipresent; they gatherand build the material needed to form the etheric double of everything, and theydo this under certain laws and work under certain restrictions. They are calledin occult phraseology “the listening devas,” for they are the ones who pick upthat particular note and tone from the transmitters of [931] the physical planesound which is needed to gather the substance for any intended material form.Again, they are spoken of as “having ears but seeing not.” They work in closeco-operation with the elementals of the dense physical body. This second groupare spoken of as the “seeing elementals,” for they exist in matter of the threelower subplanes and can therefore see on the objective plane in the occult sensewhich always implies an analogy between sight and knowledge. The “listeningbuilders” gather the material; the “seeing elementals” take that gatheredmaterial, and build it into any specific form. They exist in many groupsaccording to their point in evolution, and some of them might be tabulated asfollows:1. The builders of the human vehicle.This is the highest group of lesser builders, who are highly specialised. Thesewill be dealt with somewhat in detail later.2. The builders of the forms in the three kingdoms of nature in their twodivisions.First. The builders of the mineral kingdom. These are the workers occultlycalled “the elemental alchemists.” They are in many groups connected with thediffering elements, metals, chemicals, and minerals, and with what are calledactive and radioactive substances. They are the custodians of two secrets, thatof the immetalisation of the Monad, and the secret of the transmutation ofmetals.Second. The builders of the vegetable kingdom. They exist in many groups and aretermed “the surface alchemists” and “the bridging units.” They build the doublesof every form of vegetable life, and just as the “alchemists” of the mineralkingdom are mostly concerned with the action of fire, these other alchemicalworkers are concerned with the liquid action of divine [932] manifestation. Theywork, therefore, in co-operation with the devas of the waters, or liquidsubstance, whilst the earlier mentioned group work with the gaseous devas. Ahint is here conveyed, but greater expansion of the statement is not possible,owing to the danger of the knowledge to be reached. With them is hidden threesecrets: One is concerned with the earlier solar system, or the green solarsystem; another deals with the laws of bridging, or the interaction between thekingdoms of nature, and the third is connected with the history of the secondround; this secret when revealed will make clear why man (under the law) shouldbe a vegetarian and not carnivorous. Scientists are learning already certainthings connected with the second secret, and they may hope, as the knowledge ofthe significance of colour is extended, to glean hints as to the first. Thethird secret will not be indicated more clearly till the sixth race is livingupon earth.Third. The builders of all animal etheric forms. These are a group closelyallied with those who build the human form. They came in force from a reservoirof energy which was kept in a quiescent condition until the physical conditionof any particular scheme warranted their activity. With them came in much thataccounts for the present sad condition, for much of the fear, hatred, anddestructive condition to be found among the animals is caused by their bodiesbeing built, and the work of evolution carried on by the “imperfect gods” (as H.P. B. expresses it) working in imperfect matter as yet imperfectly manipulated.The secret of fear is hidden in the etheric body, and the particular type ofsubstance out of which it may be built.3. The builders of the planetary etheric web.Their work is exceedingly obscure and exists in three divisions: [933]a. The materialisation of the web. This is only perfected by the fourth round,and was purposely hurried in connection with our planet owing to karmicconditions, and under the law of spiritual necessity. A correspondence to thiscan be seen in the case of man himself. The etheric web was very looselyco-ordinated in man at the beginning of the fourth rootrace. Spiritual necessityforced its rapid consolidation, and it is now so constituted that it forms abarrier between the physical and the astral plane.b. The preservation of the planetary web. This will be continued until the sixthround. During this period spiritual evolution proceeds with a certain degree ofplanetary safety, for the web protects from certain solar influences, and actslargely as a sifter and a distributor of solar forces.c. The destruction of the web. This takes place towards the end of planetaryevolution, thus permitting the escape of the imprisoned planetary life and theabsorption of the life essence into its synthesiser. The process of destructioncan only be described in the words perforation and disintegration.4. The builders of the etheric body of the planetary Entity.This great involutionary life must remain for many aeons a mystery. His ethericbody is now in process of building, and only in another solar system will heassume definite physical form. Sufficient energy has not yet been generated topermit of his manifestation objectively. He remains as yet subjective. He hashis solar correspondence. [934]5. The builders of the planetary body.This proceeds under the same law as that of the solar system and of man, but, asin the solar system, it proceeds upon the higher planes. Students are hererecommended to trace the relation between the solar and cosmic planes in thisspecific connection.6. The etheric doubles of all that man creates.These are a special group of etheric builders who, under karma, are forced toact in conjunction with human beings.These are but a few out of the many groups possible to touch upon; it isneedless further to enlarge, as no substantial profit will eventuate from theimpartation of further information. Only the briefest indications can be givenand touched upon. It is neither safe nor advisable as yet to impart to menknowledge anent the workers in etheric matter, which would enable them tocontact them, nor is it wise as yet to link up coherently the scattered factsalready given in different occult books. Science is treading on the borderlandof discovery, and trespassing already into the domain of the building devas.Caution is needed. Yet if the hints given above are studied, if the varioussecrets of the builders are pondered upon, and if the esoteric side of Masonryis carefully and persistently meditated upon, the work of the Great Architectand His many assistants will stand forth in a clearer and a fuller light. Onehint may here be given, forgetting not that the work is twofold:The construction of the tabernacle, or the building of the temporary forms isthe work of the Divine Carpenter, whilst the building of the Temple of Solomon,or the construction of the more permanent structure is the work of theSupervising Architect. One concerns operative, and the other speculative Masonryin the true esoteric significance of the word.[935] The devas who form the etheric doubles of all objects out of their ownsubstance must also be considered. These builders are the sumtotal of allphysical plane substance, and constitute the matter of the etheric levels of thephysical plane. They exist, therefore, in four groups, and each group has acurious karmic relation to one of the four kingdoms in nature:Group. Plane. Kingdom. First One Human Second Two Animal Third Three VegetableFourth Four. MineralThe substance of the highest physical form of a human being is therefore atomic.The Master’s physical body is made of atomic matter, and when He wishes tomaterialise it on the dense physical plane, He forms a sheath of gaseoussubstance upon that atomic matter, perfect in its delineation of all the knownphysical traits. The substance of the highest form of animal body is that of thesecond ether, and herein is to be found a clue as to the relation between allsea and watery forms to the animal. The highest form of body possible for thevegetable form of life is that of the third ether. These facts will bedemonstrated in the seventh round when the present three kingdoms of nature—thehuman, the animal, and the vegetable will objectively exist in etheric matter;that will be for them their densest manifestation. The mineral kingdom will findits highest manifestation in matter of the fourth ether, and this transmutationis already taking place, for all the radioactive substances now being discoveredare literally becoming matter of the fourth ether. The mineral kingdom isrelatively nearing its possible manvantaric perfection, and by the time theseventh round is reached all mineral lives (not forms) [936] will have beentransferred to another planet. This will not be so with the other threekingdoms.The etheric deva substance is acted upon in two ways:It is awakened into a specific activity by the sounding of the physical planeword, and it is built into forms by the lesser builders.It will, therefore, be apparent that it comes under the influence of two typesof force or energy.We will now briefly take up the subject of the work of the devas who build man’setheric and dense physical body. By dividing our thoughts into two sections, wemay be able to cover the ground somewhat more easily, dealing first with thebuilding devas and the microcosm and then with the lesser builders of theetheric levels.d. The Elementals and the Microcosm.Man and the building devas. Man, in the process of evolution, as he pursues themethod of reincarnation, works with four types of builders and three majorgrades of building essence or deva substance.He connects with the transmitting devas who are found in connection with themicrocosm on the fourth subplane of the mental plane, and on the atomicsubplanes of the astral and physical plane. He connects next with the devasconcerned with:1. The mental unit.2. The astral permanent atom.3. The physical permanent atom.He co-operates with the work of the building devas who form the etheric body,and influences the building devas of the dense physical substances, so that thenecessary physical vehicle for his objective manifestation becomes an actuality.These are the four main groups of devas which come under the influence of anyparticular Ego. They unitedly [937] produce the lower man, and bring intomanifestation the Personality, that reflection of the Ego and shadow of theMonad. The three grades of building essence which are built into forms throughthe activity of the above four groups are here briefly recognised as the mentalsubstance, built into the mental body, the astral substance, built into theastral vehicle and the matter of the physical body. These seven groups form, intheir totality, what we might call the Brahma aspect of the microcosm.From another point of view, we may be considered as studying the action of thesolar Angel, or Lord, upon the lunar angels, and the process whereby the solarLord imposes a certain rhythm and vibration upon different aspects of lowermanifestation. Esoterically, this is all hidden in the words of a very ancientwriting, which says:“As the moon revolves, she reflects. As she reflects, she causes response inthat which failed to radiate. These three, the Sun, the Moon, and the Mother,produce that which pursues a tiny cycle, and burns.”The first step of the Ego towards producing a “shadow” is expressed in the words“The Ego sounds his note.” He utters his voice, and (as in the logoic process)the lesser “army of the voice” responds immediately to it. According to the toneand quality of the voice, so is the nature of the responsive agents. Accordingto the depth or height of the note, and according to its volume, so is thestatus or grade of building deva which replies to the call. This egoic noteproduces, therefore, certain effects:It sweeps into activity devas who proceed to transmit the sound. They utter aword.It reaches the listening devas of the second grade who take up the word andproceed to elaborate it into what might be called a mantric phrase. The buildingprocess definitely begins in a sequential threefold manner. The [938] mentalbody begins to co-ordinate in three stages. All the building stages overlap.When, for instance, the co-ordination of the mental body is in its second stage,the first stage of astral concretion begins. This is carried on for seven stages(three major and four minor) which overlap in an intricate fashion. Again, whenthe second stage is reached, a vibration is produced which awakens response inetheric matter on the physical plane, and the builders of the etheric doublecommence their activity. Again the process is repeated. When the second stage ofthe work of these etheric devas is begun, conception takes place upon thephysical plane . This is a very important point to be remembered, for it bringsthe entire process of human birth definitely into line with established karmiclaw. It shows the close connection between that which is subjective and thatwhich is tangible and seen. The building of the physical body proceeds like thatof the three stages during the prenatal period:a. The work of the building devas during the three and a half months prior tothe realisation of life. This period sees the third stage of the building of theetheric body entered upon.b. The building work of the next three and a half months of the gestationperiod.c . The final process of concretion carried on through the remaining two months.Students will here find it interesting to trace out the correspondence in thismethod of producing evolutionary manifestation in a planetary scheme with itsrounds and races, and in a solar system with its manvantaras and greater cycles.In summing up this very cursory outline, the work of the etheric devas does notcease at the birth of the man, but is continued likewise in three stages, whichfind a close analogy in the life period of a solar system.[939] First, their work is directed to the steady increase of the human physicalvehicle, so that it may follow accurately the lines of growth of the two subtlerbodies. This is carried on till maturity is reached. The next stage is that inwhich their work consists largely of repair work, and the preservation of thebody during the years of full manhood so that it can measure up to the purposeof the subjective life. This purpose necessarily varies according to the stageof development of the man. Finally comes the stage when the work of buildingceases. The vitality in the etheric body waxes dim, and the processes ofdestruction begin. The Ego begins to call in his forces. The “sound” becomesfaint and dim; there is less and less volume for the transmitters to pass on,and the initial vibration gets fainter and fainter. The period of obscurationcomes in. First the physical body waxes weak and useless; then the Ego withdrawsfrom the centres, and functions for a few hours in the etheric double. This inturn is devitalised, and so the process is carried on till one by one thesheaths are discarded and the egoic “shadow” is dissipated.The work of the building devas .Let us now consider the work of the building devas on the three planes, dealingwith them in two groups:a. Those who are connected with the permanent atoms.b . Those who are responsible for the building process.The devas of the permanent atoms. This particular group of devas are theaggregate of the lives who form the mental unit and the two permanent atoms.They, as we know, have their place within the causal periphery, and are focalpoints of egoic energy. They are the very highest type of building devas, andform a group of lives which are closely allied to the solar Angels. They existin seven groups connected with three of the spirillae of [940] the logoicphysical permanent atom. These three spirillae are to these seven groups oflives what the three major rays are to the seven groups of rays on the egoicsubplanes of the mental plane. This phrase will bear meditating upon, and mayconvey much information to the intuitional thinker. There is a correspondencebetween the three permanent atomic triads, and the appearance of man in thethird root race. A curiously interesting sequence of the three lines of forcecan be seen in:a. The triads of the involutionary group soul.b. The appearance of triple natured man in the third root race.c. The triads in the causal bodies of any self-conscious unit.These building devas are the ones who take up the sound as the Ego sends itforth through certain of the transmitting deva agencies, and by the vibrationwhich this sets up they drive into activity the surrounding deva essence intheir two groups:a. Those who build the form.b. Those who are built into the form.They only affect those of analogous vibration. The stages of the building of anyof the four forms through which lower man (the Quaternary) functions, followexactly analogous stages to the building of the dense physical body, forinstance, of a planet, or of a solar system. This can be traced all the way fromthe nebulous and chaotic stages through the fiery to the solid, or to therelatively solid where a subtle body is concerned. There is no need for usfurther to enlarge. H. P. B. has outlined these stages in the Secret Doctrine,(I, 279, 280.) and they have been dealt with in an earlier part of thisTreatise.We have dealt at some length already with the work [941] of the transmittingdevas upon the three planes in the three worlds, and with that of the devasconnected with those relatively permanent focal points—the permanent atomswithin the causal periphery. We can now consider the group of builders who,responding to the note of the transmitting agencies and to the initial vibrationof the second group of builders concerned with the triple lower self, begin thework of aggregating and moulding the living substance necessary for egoicmanifestation upon the lower planes.We have seen that the first three stages of the egoic work are:1. The sounding of the appropriate note, which note is indicative of man’s placein evolution, and of the nature of his “psyche,” or Ego.2. The transmission of this note by the solar Angel, and the three groups ofdevas connected with the three permanent atoms.3. The vibration set up within these atoms which is in line with the notesounded, and which becomes so strong as to make itself felt in the surroundingdeva substance, thus awakening response.These may be considered as the three primary stages, and we find demonstrated(in connection with the microcosm) the three factors of sound, colour andvibration, which, under the Law of Analogy, reflect the three aspects of themacrocosm. Here too is found a resemblance to the work of the first threeSephiroths of the Kabbalah,—the primary stage of manifestation finding its dimreflection in the work of the Ego in the three worlds.The second stage now takes place, in which the work of building proceeds untilthe microcosm, man, makes his appearance upon the physical plane. This issucceeded by a third stage of evolution, in which the psychic nature of man isto demonstrate through the medium of the [942] created forms. Then the next twogroups of Sephiroth are seen reproduced in man. He is demonstrated to be ninefrom another angle but we are only concerned in this section with the buildersof the form.These groups of builders are four in number:1. The builders of the mental body.2. The builders of the astral body.3. The builders of the etheric body.4. The builders of the dense physical.Each of these groups can be subdivided into four or seven or three, according tothe plane concerned. Students must remember that matter from the two lowestsubplanes of the physical and of the astral planes are never built into thehuman body as now constituted; it is of too low a vibration, and too coarse agrade for even the lowest type of men on earth at this time. It must be pointedout also that in the average man, the matter of some subplane will preponderateaccording to the depth of his nature and his place on the ladder of evolution.The “builders” of the human body work under the direction of one of the Lords ofKarma from the lowest group. These Lords are to be found in three groups, and aLord out of the third group has the work of superintending the builders of thehuman being on the three planes. Under Him are to be found certain karmicagents, who again are divided into the following groups:1. Three karmic agents responsible to the karmic Lords for the work on the threeplanes.2. Five karmic Lords who work in close connection with the Manus of the variousraces, and who are responsible for the correct building of the varying racetypes.3. Karmic agents responsible for the subrace types of the present time. [943]4. Certain intermediary agents who represent (within these three groups) theseven Ray types.5. Those agents of the good Law who are connected specifically with the work ofthe etheric centres, and their response to the different planetary centres.6. The keepers of the records.These various intelligences manipulate the building forces through the medium ofstreams of energy, which streams are set in motion when the Ego sounds his note.It must be remembered that in more or less degree upon his own plane the Ego isaware of his karma, and of what must be done to promote growth during the comingincarnation. He works, therefore, in connection with these Lords, but is onlydirectly in touch with an agent of the sixth group and of the fourth. Throughthese two the work proceeds as far as the Ego is individually concerned, andthey set in motion for him (after he has sounded his note) the machinery of theLaw.The builders of the human personality again are divided into seven main groups;all devas, just as is the case with the human Monads, come under one or other ofthe seven Rays, and are responsive to one or other of the seven logoic streamsof fiery energy. According to a man’s egoic Ray, so will be the type of devasubstance influenced.These builders work with certain elementals, but it is only upon the physicalplane that any idea can be given as to their nature and work. These elementalsare the little entities who, adhering to the plan as embodied by the builders,blindly construct the fabric of the body, and form the sheaths through which theEgo is to express himself. On the etheric planes they build the real “form” outof etheric substance, and produce the sheath of intricate lines of interlacingfiery strands, which is in [944] reality an extension of the sutratma, or lifethread. As it is woven and interlaced it becomes vitalised with the life energysent down from the Ego, just as Shiva, the Father, gives to the Son the real“bios” or life, while the Mother warms, builds, and nourishes the body. The workof the etheric elementals reaches its primary consummation when the sutratma isconnected with the three centres of the physical nature within the cranium—thepineal gland, the pituitary body, and the alta major centre. Occultly, the mostimportant connection is the entrance of the sutratma into the centre at the topof the head, that through which the life of the etheric body withdraws at themoment of death. This is the vital point. The “thread” of life there, by thetime the seventh year is reached, has divided itself into three branches,reaching out to the three centres. The realisation of this fact will eventuallyprove of much interest to scientists. A good deal of imbecility, or of arresteddevelopment will be found to have its origin in the etheric connection withthese three centres. The etheric web is literally the fine network of fierythreads which spreads itself over the centre, and forms an area of fairly largedimensions. It separates the two bodies, astral and physical. A similarcorresponding area will be found in the solar system. Through it the cosmicforces must pass to the different planetary schemes.The elemental groups of the dense physical plane who are swept into activity bythe builders, are three in number:a. The gaseous elementals.b. The liquid elementals.c. The strictly dense elementals.One group concerns itself with the fiery channels, with the fires of the humanbody, and with the different gases to be found within the human periphery.Another group [945] is to be seen working in connection with the circulatorysystem, and with all the liquids, juices, and waters of the body; whilst thethird is largely involved in the construction of the frame, through the rightapportioning of the minerals and chemicals. A hint in connection with medicineis here to be found; it is occultly true that just as the liquid devas andelementals are closely related to the vegetable kingdom, and both to the planeof the emotions, the logoic liquid body, so the ills of men which affect thecirculatory system, the kidneys, the bladder, and the lubrication of the joints,will find a CURE in vegetable constituents and above all in the right adjustmentof the emotional nature.Several influences other than those mentioned have to be considered when thesubject of the work of these builders of man’s body is under discussion. Notonly are they affected by:a. A man’s note,b. The colour poured forth by the transmitting agents,c. The karmic agents,but they come under:d. Group karma and vibration which will sweep in another group of agencies andbuilders, and thus affect a man’s bodies,e. Racial karma, an extension of the above,f. Forces playing upon the planet from another scheme, or through the formationof a systemic triangle,g. A cosmic triangle of force of some specific kind which may bring in entitiesand energies of any particular scheme incident upon the karma of the planetaryLogos.It will, therefore, be apparent to the student how intricate this subject is andhow truly each man is the outcome of force of some kind—egoic primarily, butalso [946] planetary, and even systemic. Yet withal, no man is ever put intocircumstances which are insurmountable, once he has reached the point where hehas intelligently put himself on the side of evolution, or of God. Prior to thathe may, and will, be driven by the gales of circumstance; the press of group andracial karma will force him into situations necessary for the process ofawakening him to his own innate possibilities. Once he becomes the consciousbuilder himself, seeking to control the forces and builders of his lower nature,and to construct the Temple of Solomon, then he is no longer subject to theearlier conditions. He becomes a ruler, a builder, and a transmitter, until thetime comes when he is one with the solar Angels, and the work of human evolutionis accomplished.What has been said above is very superficial, and only that has been impartedwhich has a profound significance for man at this time. Much must be inferred,and more must be arrived at under the Law of Correspondences. It must ever beborne in mind likewise that our basic conception is one of fiery energy , offorce centres set in motion, and kept in active vibration, by the pulsation ofstill greater centres. Every form is built of fiery atoms, or energetic lives,through the agency of greater lives, and is held in coherent form within thestill greater sheaths,—that greater sheath being to the lesser what themacrocosm is to the microcosm. All these groups of building lives may be dividedinto three groups of energy units, and their nature deduced from the phrases:1. Groups of lives animated by dynamic energy.2. Groups of lives animated by radiant energy.3. Groups of lives animated by atomic energy.These again are the sumtotal of the three fires, electric fire, solar fire andfire by friction. In terms of the cosmic [947] physical plane, thecorrespondence to the systemic plane can be seen in the following tabulation:1. Dynamic energy electric fire atomic subplane. - First etheric substance. -Plane adi. 2. Radiant energy solar fire three cosmic etheric levels. - Logoicetheric body. 3. Atomic energy fire by friction three planes of the threeworlds. - Logoic dense vehicle.Each plane will be found to reflect this order in an interesting manner.III. MAN AS A CREATOR IN MENTAL MATTER1. The Creation of Thought Forms.The subject we are now to deal with cannot be handled too explicitly on accountof the attendant dangers. In the creative processes man is dealing withelectrical phenomena of some kind, with that which is vitally affected by eachthought emanating from him, and with those lesser lives who (aggregatedtogether) form, from certain angles of vision, a source of very real danger toman. We might embody that which can be said in certain statements.a. Much that is to be seen now of a distressing nature in the world can bedirectly traced to the wrong manipulation of mental matter by man; to erroneousconceptions as to the nature of matter itself, and to dangerous conditionsbrought about by the united creative attempts of human beings down thecenturies.Misunderstandings have arisen as to the purpose of the vital fluids of theuniverse and this has added to the distress, as have certain distortions of theastral light, producing a subsidiary or secondary glamour, or reflected [948]light which intensifies the maya already created. This secondary reflection hasbeen produced by man himself in the evolutionary attempt to balance the pairs ofopposites, and has produced a condition which must be surmounted before the trueoccult balancing begins. It might be regarded as the sumtotal of that greatmanifestation (created only by man) called “The Dweller on the Threshold.”One of the greatest impediments upon the Path of Return and one for which man isdistinctly responsible within occult limits are those animated forms which hehas produced ever since the middle of the Atlantean root race when the mindfactor began slowly to assume increasing importance. The selfishness, the sordidmotives, the prompt response to evil impulses for which the human race has beendistinguished has brought about a condition of affairs unparalleled in thesystem. A gigantic thought form hovers over the entire human family, built bymen everywhere during the ages, energised by the insane desires and evilinclinations of all that is worst in man’s nature, and kept alive by thepromptings of his lower desires. This thought form has to be broken up anddissipated by man himself during the latter part of this round before theconclusion of the cycle, and its dissipation will be one of the forces tendingto the production of interplanetary pralaya. It is this piece of creativebungling, if so it might be called, which the Great Ones are occupied indestroying. Under the Law of Karma it has to be dissipated by those who havecreated it; the work of the Masters has to be carried on, therefore, indirectly,and must take the form of illuminating the sons of men in gradually increasingdegree, so that they can see clearly this “Dweller on the Threshold” of the newlife, and the antagonist who stands between the fourth kingdom of nature and thefifth. Every time a son of man stands upon the Probationary Path [949 ] Theirwork is facilitated, for it means that one small stream of life-energy isdirected into new channels, and away from the old stream, which tends tovitalise and feed the evil form, and one more conscious assailant can be trainedto co-operate in the work of destruction. Every time an initiate is admitted tothe Lodge degrees, it means that a new and powerful agent is available for thebringing down of force from higher levels to aid in the work of disintegration.In the comprehension of these two methods of aggressive work (that of theaspirant and the initiate) will come much of vital interest to the carefulstudent of analogy. Here lies the clue to the present problem of evil, and tothe vitality of the hold which the matter aspect has on the spiritual. Thisgigantic thought form, the product of man’s ignorance and selfishness, is keptalive and vitalised in three ways:First, by the aggregate of the evil desires, wicked intentions, and selfishpurposes of each individual man. Every wrong thought, when embodied in speech ormanifested in action on the physical plane, goes to swell the proportions ofthis evil entity.Second, by the fostering care of the brothers of the shadow, and thoserepresentatives of what may be called “cosmic evil” who (under the karma of thefourth or human family, in this fourth round), assume stupendousresponsibilities, make possible the secondary vitalisation of the thought formand produce conditions of such a dire description that under law rapidcrystallisation supervenes, and ultimate destruction becomes possible. Studentswould do well to broaden their concept as to the purpose of evil and the placethe evil forces play in the general scheme.Third, by the energy still extant and the vibration still to be felt which isthe persistence of force from [950] an earlier solar system, and an emanationfrom that which is no longer considered in this solar system to be a principle.These three factors are the main ones to be considered by the Great Ones inTheir work of enabling men to break loose from the influence of thisself-imposed form, to destroy that which they have themselves constructed, andto shake themselves free from the illusion cast by the persistent vampire whichthey have nourished and strengthened for millennia of years.This work of destruction the Great Ones are bringing about in four main ways:(1) By the strength of Their united thoughts and meditations.(2) By the work of the Hierarchy in training and teaching individuals, who thusbreak away from blind group activity, and become conscious centres of force andco-operators in the work of destruction. This work has to be carried on frommental levels. Hence the training of disciples to meditate and work in mentalmatter.(3) By the use of certain mantrams and words which bring in interplanetary forceof the fourth order. This force is then directed towards this distorted creationof the fourth Creative Hierarchy (the fourth or human kingdom) and tends toaugment the work of destruction. Much of this work is carried on by theNirmanakayas.(4) By stimulating the egoic bodies of men so that the solar Angels may carry onwith greater precision and force their conflict with the lunar gods. This is thetrue war in heaven. As the solar Gods ( 287 [text00028.html#Y_FN287] ) descendever [951] nearer to the physical plane, and in their descent assume a steadilyincreasing control of the lunar natures, the thoughts and desires of men areconsequently purified and refined. The solar fires put out the lunar light, andthe lower nature is eventually purified and transmuted. In time the solar Angelsblaze forth in all their glory through the medium of the lower nature on thephysical plane, that lower nature providing fuel to the flames. The hated“Dweller on the Threshold” thus gradually dies for lack of sustenance, anddisintegrates for lack of vitality, and man is set free.b. At present much of the manipulation of mental matter and its direction intoforms of some kind or another emanates from lower levels, and is the result ofpowerful desire based on physical attraction. The desire bodies, and not themental bodies of the majority of men are the most powerful, and set up such astrong vibration (due to the force of two groups of lunar lords) that the thirdgroup of lunar entities who construct the mental body are swept into a willingresponse, and the whole threefold lower nature is immediately engaged in thedire process of feeding the dreaded “Dweller.” This direction of energy followsthe line of least resistance. One of the primary works of the Ego, as we wellknow, is to impose a new rhythm upon his shadow and reflection, the lower man,and it is this imposition which in time deflects energy away from man’sdistorted creation, and brings his vibration into tune with that of his solarAngel.The devas who are the sumtotal of the energy of substance itself care not whatform they build. They are [952] irresponsibly responsive to energy currents, andtheirs is not the problem of dealing with sources of energy. Therefore, theplace of man in the cosmic plan becomes more vital and apparent when it isrealised that one of his main responsibilities is the direction of energycurrents from the mental plane, and the creation of that which is desired onhigher levels . Men, as a whole, are undergoing evolutionary development inorder that they may become conscious creators in matter. This involvesA realisation of the archetypal plan,An understanding of the laws governing the building processes of nature,A conscious process of willing creation, so that man co-operates with the ideal,works under law, and produces that which is in line with the planetary plan, andwhich tends to further the best interests of the race,A comprehension as to the nature of energy, and an ability to direct energycurrents, to disintegrate (or withdraw energy from) all forms in the threeworlds,An appreciation of the nature of the devas, their constitution and place asbuilders, and of the words and sounds whereby they are directed and controlled.When the energy currents of the human family are directed from egoic levelsonly, when desire is transmuted, and the fifth principle awakened and finallyilluminated by the sixth, then and only then will the strength of the impulseemanating from lower levels die out and the “Dweller on the Threshold” (who nowhaunts the human family) likewise die. In other words, when the dense physicalbody of the planetary Logos (composed of matter of the three worlds of humanendeavour) is completely purified and vitalised by the force of the life flowingfrom etheric levels, and when all His centres (formed of human units) are fullyawakened, then will [953] those centres be channels for pure force, and such anentity as the “Dweller” be an impossibility.All that I have here said anent this “Dweller on the Threshold” of the Pathbetween the two great kingdoms, the fourth and the fifth, can be studied by thestudent with a personal application. Facing each earnest aspirant to theMysteries is that vitalised form which he has himself constructed and nourishedduring the course of his previous incarnations, and which represents the sumtotal of his evil desires, motives and thoughts. For ages it has vampirised him,and for ages it has represented that which he has failed to achieve. It affectsnot only himself but also all those units whom he contacts and meets. In itsdestruction he has to pursue methods similar to those followed by the GreatOnes, and through the increasing power of his solar Angel, through the force ofhis Ego, and through a study of law, the knowledge of the power of sound, andthe control of speech, he will eventually bring about its disintegration. Theold Commentary says:“The solar Angel must put out the light of the lunar angels and then for lack ofwarmth and light, that which has served to hinder no longer is.”c. As yet but few of the human family work deliberately and consciously inmental matter only. The energy exerted by men is mostly kama-manasic or desirecoupled with lower mind, with a preponderance, as might be expected, of desireforce. This is to be inferred from the second statement. The whole trend ofevolution is to bring about ability to build in mental matter, and two thingslie ahead of the race:First. The gradual dissipation of the indefinite masses of kama-manasic matterwhich surround practically every unit of the human family, producing a conditionof murkiness and fog within, and around, each aura. Gradually [954] this willclear away, and men will be seen surrounded by clear-cut thought forms,characterised by a distinctive vibration and distinguished by a particularquality incident to a man’s ray and therefore to his type of mind.Second. The aggregate of human thought forms which now are of a personalcharacter, vibrating around each human being as the planets vibrate around thesun, will tend to approximate a group centre. Thought energy, which now emanatesfrom each human being as a comparatively weak stream of an indefiniteconglomeration of mental matter, of no particular character, forming noparticularly distinct forms and persisting in animating those forms for but abrief period, will be directed towards the creation of that desired by the group, and not solely towards that desired by the unit. This is the basis, verylargely, for the antagonism that all constructive thinkers and group workersencounter. The stream of energy which they emanate, and which constructs vitalthought forms, runs counter to that of the masses of men, awakens opposition,and produces temporary chaos. The prominent workers and thinkers of the humanfamily, under the direction of the Lodge, are engaged in three things:a . The imposition of the newer and higher rhythm upon men.b. The dissipation of the murky clouds of half-vitalised indefinite thoughtforms which surround our planet, thus permitting the entry of interplanetaryforce, and of force from the higher mental levels.c. The awakening within men of the power to think clearly, to energise theirthought forms accurately, and to hold in vital form those thought constructionswhereby they may attain their objective, and [955] bring about desiredconditions upon the physical plane.These three objectives necessitate a clear comprehension among such vitalthinkers and workers, of the power of thought; of the direction of thoughtcurrents, of the science of thought building, of the manipulation under law andorder of mental matter, and of the process of thought manifestation through thetwo factors of sound and vitalisation. It involves likewise the ability tonegate or render futile all impulses arising from the lower self which are of acentralised and purely personal aspect, and the faculty of working in groupform, each thought being sent upon the definite mission of adding its quota ofenergy and matter to some one stream which is specific and known. This last isof importance, for no worker for humanity becomes of real assistance until he(consciously and with full knowledge of his work) definitely directs his thoughtenergy towards some particular channel of service to the race.d. In all thought building, therefore, of a high order, men have several thingsto do, which might be enumerated as follows:First, to purify their lower desires so that they are enabled to see clearly inthe occult sense. No man has clear vision who is obsessed with his own needs,actions, and interests, and unconscious of that which is higher and of groupactivity. This clear vision brings about an ability to read, even ifunconsciously at first, the akashic records, and thus ascertain the point ofdeparture for the new and incoming thought impulses, an ability to lose sight ofself interest in group interest, and thus co-operate with the plan, and afaculty that enables him to become aware of the keynote of the race, and awareof the “cry of humanity.”Next, to secure control over the mind. This involves [956] certain importantthings: A realisation of the nature of the mind and brain through concentration,an understanding of the relation which should exist between the physical brainand Man, the real Thinker on the physical plane, an ability, gradually developedonce the mind is brought under control through concentration, to meditate in theoccult sense, and thus bring through the plan from higher levels, ascertain hisindividual share in the plan, and then co-operate in the work of some particulargroup of Nirmanakayas. This is succeeded by a consideration of the laws ofenergy. A man discovers how to build a thought form of a particular quality andtone, to energise it with his own life, and thus have—on mental levels—a smallcreation, the child of his will, which he can use as a messenger, or as a meansfor the manifestation of an idea. Students will do well to consider these pointswith care, if they seek to become conscious operators.Finally, having constructed a thought form, the next thing the servant ofhumanity has to learn is how to send it on its mission, whatever that may be,holding it through his own vital energy in its due form, keeping it vibrating toits own measure, and eventually bringing about its destruction when it hasfulfilled its mission. The average man is often the victim of his own thoughtforms. He constructs them, but is neither strong enough to send them out to dotheir work, nor wise enough to dissipate them when required. This has broughtabout the thick swirling fog of half-formed, semi-vitalised forms in whicheighty five percent of the human race is surrounded.In his work as thought builder, man has to show forth the characteristics of theLogos, the great Architect or Builder of the universe. He has to parallel Hiswork as:The one who conceives the idea.The one who clothes the idea in matter. [957]The one who energises the idea, and thus enables the form to preserve itsoutline and perform its mission.The one who—in time and space—through desire and love, directs that thoughtform, vitalises it continuously, until the objective is attained.The one who, when the desired end has been accomplished, destroys ordisintegrates the thought form by withdrawing his energy (occultly, the“attention is withdrawn,” or “the eye is no longer upon” it), so that the lesserlives (which had been built into the desired form) fall away and return to thegeneral reservoir of deva substance.Thus, in all creative work in mental matter, man is likewise to be seen as aTrinity at work; he is the creator, preserver, and destroyer.e. In all occult work in mental matter which has to manifest upon the physicalplane, and thus achieve objectivity, man has to work as a unit. This infers theability, therefore, of the threefold lower man to be subordinated to the Ego, sothat the dynamic will of the Ego may be imposed upon the physical brain.The method of the man on the physical plane who is engaged in conscious work inmental matter is to be considered in two divisions: first, the initial processof alignment with the Ego, so that the plan, purpose and method of achievementmay be impressed upon the physical brain, and then a secondary process in whichthe man, using the physical brain consciously, proceeds to carry out the plan,construct through will and purpose the necessitated form, and then, having builtand energised the form, to “keep his eye upon it.” This is stating occultly thegreat truth back of all processes of energising. “The eye of the Lord” is muchreferred to in the Christian Bible, and occultly understood, the eye is thatwhich brings power to its servant, the thought form. Scientists [958] arebecoming interested in the power of the human eye, and that faculty of controland of recognition which is everywhere seen as existing will have its scientificand occult explanation when it is studied as an instrument of initiatory energy.Therefore, it will be apparent that a thought form is the result of two types ofenergy:That emanating in the first instance from the Ego on abstract levels.That originating in a secondary sense from the man on the physical plane throughthe medium of the brain.That men do not recognise the first factor as a general rule is that which isresponsible for much that is evil. When the “Science of the Self” has assumeddue proportions men will be careful to ascertain the egoic impulses in allthought process, and to utilise true egoic energy before they begin manipulatingdeva substance, and building forms of deva lives.2. Thought Form Building in the Three Worlds .I have a few more words to say anent this subject of man as a Creator in mentalmatter. The words are addressed to all those students who—through their abilityto concentrate—have developed a certain measure of thought control, and whodesire to understand the process of creation with greater scientific accuracy.We will, therefore, consider two factors in the process of thought-formbuilding:a . That of aligning with the Ego. ( 288 [text00028.html#Y_FN288] )b. The process of impressing the egoic will, on the physical brain, or (to wordit otherwise) the initial utilisation of egoic energy.[959] Let us take them one by one:a. Alignment with the Ego . This, as we know, is only possible to the man whohas reached the Probationary Path, or a certain very definite point inevolution. Through knowledge and practice, the power has been acquired ofautomatically and scientifically utilising the sutratma (or channel) as a meansof contact. When to this ability is added that of utilising with equal ease theantaskarana (or bridge between the Triad and the personality) then we have apowerful agent of the Hierarchy on the earth. We might generalise in thefollowing manner as to the stages of growth and consequent ability to become theagent of ever increasing powers, tapping the resources of dynamic energy in thethree worlds.Lower types of humanity use the sutratma as it passes through the etheric body.Average men utilise almost entirely that part of the sutratma which passesthrough the astral plane. Their reactions are largely based on desire, and areemotional.Intellectual men utilise the sutratma as it passes through the lower levels ofthe mental plane, down through the astral to the physical in its two sections.Their activities are energised by mind and not by desire, as in the earliercases.Aspirants on the physical plane use the sutratma as it passes through the twolower subplanes of the abstract levels of the mental plane, and are beginninggradually to build the antaskarana, or the bridge between the Triad and thePersonality. The power of the Ego can begin to make itself felt.Applicants for initiation and initiates up to the third initiation use both thesutratma and the antaskarana, employing them as a unit. The power of the Triadbegins to pour through, thus energising all human [960] activities upon thephysical plane, and vitalising in ever increasing degree the man’s thoughtforms. The key to the formation of the Mayavirupa is found in the rightcomprehension of the process.If students will study carefully the above differentiations, much light will bethrown upon the quality of the energy employed in thought-form building.In the early stages of alignment, it has to be concisely and carefully broughtabout through concentration and meditation. Later, when the right rhythm hasbeen set up in the bodies, and the purification of the sheaths has been rigidlypursued, the dual activity will become practically instantaneous, and thestudent can then turn his attention to the work of conscious building andvitalisation; his point of concentration will not then be given to theattainment of alignment.Accurate alignment entails,Mental quiescence, or stable vibration,Emotional stability, resulting in limpid reflection,Etheric poise, producing a condition in the head centre which would permit ofthe direct application of force to the physical brain via the centre.b. Physical brain impression. The accurate realisation by the physical brain ofwhat the Ego is seeking to convey concerning the work to be done only becomespossible when two things are realised:Direct alignment.The transmission of the egoic energy or will to one or other of the threephysical centres in the head:The pineal gland.The pituitary body.The alta major centre, or that nerve centre at the top of the spine, where thecranium and the spine make approximate contact. When this congery of nerves isfully developed, it forms a centre of communication between the vital energy ofthe spinal column (the kundalini fire) and the energy of the two head centresabove enumerated. It is the physical correspondence to the antaskarana on higherlevels. [961][Image00016.jpg][962] The pituitary body (in all cases of correct normal development) forms thecentre which receives the threefold vitalisation pouring through the sutratmafrom the lower mental, the astral, and the etheric planes. The pineal glandcomes into activity when this action is enhanced by the pouring through ofenergy from the Ego on its own plane. When the antaskarana is in process ofutilisation the alta major centre is likewise employed, and the three physicalhead centres begin to work as a unit, thus forming a kind of triangle. By thetime the third Initiation is reached, this triangle is fully awakened and thefire (or energy) is circulated freely.It will be apparent, therefore, that man’s ability to create in mental mattergrows as he treads the Path. He needs to remember that (from the angle fromwhich we are studying) we are not considering the power of the Ego to produceforms on the mental plane, but the ability of physical plane man to create uponthe mental plane those vehicles for energy which—when set in motion by hisconscious will—will produce certain specific effects upon the physical plane.This is brought about by egoic energy passed down the sutratma to the physicalbrain, and retransmitted back to the mental plane, plus or minus that which hasbeen gained or lost in the process. The true Adept, through knowledge, conservesall energy while in process of transmission, and augments it with the energycontacted. It is, therefore, the energy of will, plus that of desire, fed by theenergy of the physical brain. Literally, therefore, it is a small resume of thecreative process of the Godhead, being the [963] energy of the three personsunified, and considered from the standpoint of the physical. It is theat-one-ment of the three fires in man, being in fact:a. That much of the fire of spirit, or electric fire, which any particular Egois embodying (relatively little prior to the third Initiation) or is able totransmit, coupled with,b . That much of the fire of the solar Angel (solar fire) or the egoic aspectwhich the Ego is able to transmit. This is but little in average man, a gooddeal in the man on the probationary path, and a full downpour by the time thethird Initiation is reached.c. That much of the fire of substance in its purified state which can penetrate.This is dependent upon the purity of the three sheaths, and in the case of ahighly advanced man is the kundalinic fire as it swells the blaze produced bythe other two.When, therefore, the alignment is corrected, and the physical head centres areawakening, it becomes possible for man to become a conscious creator in mentalmatter.IV. MAN AND THE FIRE SPIRITS OR BUILDERSThis section we will consider in somewhat greater detail than the previous one,as it concerns much of present practical value to man. This will be seenparticularly as we study the effects of speech, and the occult significance ofthe spoken word.1. The Will Aspect and Creation.In a previous division, we dealt somewhat with the transmission of the will ofthe Ego to the physical brain, and we saw how only in those persons who (throughevolutionary development) had the sutratma and the antaskarana connected, andwhose three physical head centres were more or less awakened, was the will ofthe Ego capable of transmission. In the other cases, such as the average man andlittle developed man, the purpose [964] affecting the physical brain emanatedfrom the astral or lower mental levels, and was, therefore, more likely to bethe impulse of some lunar Lord, even if of a high order, than the divine will ofthe solar Angel, who is the true man.a. The condition of the Magician. It is of value to remember that when thephysical head centres are awakened (through alignment of the etheric centres) wehave the very lowest aspect of egoic influence. From these three centres, man onthe Probationary Path, and up to the third Initiation, directs and controls hissheath, and from them spreads that illumination which will irradiate thephysical plane life. By the time the third Initiation is reached, the internaltriangle is in full process of circulatory transmission, and the whole life ofthe Personality is subjected to the will of the Ego. “The Star absorbs the lightof the moon, so that the rays of the Sun may be reflected back” is the occultway of expressing the truth anent this point in evolution. It might be of valuehere also to point out the condition of the etheric centres during this processof direct solar control. Before the three physical head centres awaken, man islargely subjected to force flowing through the four minor etheric centres; laterthe three major centres—the head, the heart, and the throat—begin to vibrate,gradually assuming a greater sweep of activity, till their energy tends tonegate that of the lower centres, to absorb their vitality and deflect thedirection of their vitality, until the three higher wheels are in full fourthdimensional activity. As this proceeds, the three physical head centres begin toawake from dormancy into activity, the effect being felt as follows:a. As the major head centre awakens, the pineal gland begins to function.b. As the heart centre becomes fully alive, the pituitary body enters intoactivity. [965]c. As the throat centre assumes its right place in the process of evolution, thealta major centre vibrates adequately.When the triangle of force that these three physical centres form is incirculatory effect, the greater triangle can be seen in circulation; it thenbecomes a “wheel turning upon itself.” The major etheric centres are in fullaction, and the man is nearing the moment of liberation.In the work of creation, as occultly carried on, all these three physicalcentres have to be utilised, and from a consideration of the subject it willbecome apparent why it has been necessary to deal with them in this order.By means of the pineal gland, ( 289 [text00028.html#Y_FN289] ) the organ ofspiritual perception, man ascertains the will and purpose of the Ego, and fromthence he draws the necessary energy [966] from the higher levels, via the headcentre and the sutratma.By means of the pituitary body , the second element of desire or of theform-building energy, becomes available, and under the law of attraction he canmould, and build in deva substance.When the alta major centre , the synthesis of what might be called nervousenergy, is awake, it becomes possible for him to materialise and activate thedesired form which, through attractive energy, he is in process of constructing.It will be apparent, therefore, why it is that so few people ever constructthought forms which are of constructive lasting benefit to humanity, and alsowhy it is that the Great Ones, (as They work through Their disciples) are forcedto work with groups, being seldom able to find a man or woman whose threephysical head centres are simultaneously active. They frequently have to workwith large groups before the quota of energy supplied to Them for theaccomplishment of Their ends measures up to that necessitated.It will be obvious, likewise, that the disciple’s power for service for humanityis dependent largely upon three things: [967]a. The state of his bodies and their egoic alignment.b. The condition of activity present in the physical head centres.c. The circulatory action of the triangular transmission of force.These factors are again dependent upon others, among which might be enumerated:1. The ability of the disciple to meditate.2. The capacity he displays for bringing through accurately from the subtlerlevels the plans and purposes of which his Ego is cognisant.3. The purity of his motives.4. His power to “hold a state of meditation,” and while in that state begin tobuild the form for his idea, and thus materialise the plan of his Ego.5. The amount of energy he can pour later into his thought form and thus procurefor it a period of existence, or its tiny “day of Brahma.”These subsidiary factors are again dependent upon:a. His place on the ladder of evolution.b. The condition of his bodies.c. His karmic condition.d. The tenuosity of the etheric web.e . The calibre of his physical body, and its relative refinement.It is necessary here to warn the student against the error of making any hard orfast rule anent the sequential order of the development of the physical headcentres, and the vitalisation of the force centres. This process is incidentupon many things, such as the ray upon which the monad may be found, and thenature of the development in the past incarnations. Nature, in all departmentsof her corporate life, parallels her efforts, and overlaps her variousprocesses, and it takes a seer of [968] vast wisdom and experience to stateexactly the stage at which any particular unit of the human family may be. Hethat is wise always refrains from assertion until he knows.Let us now consider:b. The construction, vitalisation, and actuating of the thought form. The Ego,having brought about a condition of receptivity, or of recognition in thephysical brain of the man, and having drawn from him the necessary response, theprocess of building is thereupon begun.This process of physical plane response is based—as is all else in nature—uponthe relation of the polar opposites. The physical centres are receptive to thepositive influence of the force centres. The physical brain is responsive to thepositive influence of the lower nature in the earlier evolutionary stages, or tothe reactions of the substance of the sheaths, the impress of the lunar Lords.It responds in the later stages to the positive influence of the Ego or theimpress of the solar Lord.As is apparent, this building process is divided into three parts, whichoverlap, and assume an appearance of simultaneity. When (as is the case with themajority of the human family) the process is an unconscious one, produced byreflex action and based largely on the accomplishment of desire, all is carriedon with great rapidity, and leads to rapid results—these results being effectiveof accomplishment according to the ability of the man to vitalise and hold incoherent form his idea. Most of the thought forms created by average man areonly relatively effective, and this within great limitations, and having but arestricted radius. When man is learning consciously to create, which he doesthrough the organisation of thought, concentration and meditation, he proceedsmore slowly, for he has two primary things to do before the creative process canbe carried through: [969]a. To contact or communicate with the Ego, or solar Angel.b . To study the process of creation and to make it conform step by step withnatural evolutionary law.The above is necessarily but another way of defining meditation and itsobjective.Later on, when a man is an expert in meditation, the work of thought creationproceeds with ever increasing rapidity, until he surpasses (on a higher turn ofthe spiral) the activity of the earlier unconscious period.Starting, therefore, with the recognition of the egoic intent in the physicalbrain, the man proceeds to build the form for his idea. He begins first toorganise the material required upon the mental plane. It is on that plane thatthe impulse takes to itself its primary form. On the desire or astral plane ,the process of vitalisation is largely pursued, for the length of the life ofany thought form (even such an one as our solar system) is dependent upon thepersistence of desire, and the strength of the desire.On the etheric levels of the physical plane the process of physical concretiontakes place; as the physical vehicle assumes the necessary proportions, thethought form becomes divorced from the one who is giving it form. Any idea ofenough strength will inevitably materialise in dense physical matter, but themain work of its creator ceases when he has worked with it on mental, astral andetheric levels. The dense physical response is automatic and inevitable. Someideas of a large and important nature, which have arisen in the consciousness ofthe Guides of the race, reach full manifestation only through the medium of manyagents, and the dynamic impulses of many minds. A few work consciously, whenthis is the case, at the production of the necessitated [970] form; many moreare swept into activity and lend their aid through the very negativity of theirnatures; they are “forced” to be interested in spite of themselves, and are“swept into the movement,” not through any mental apprehension or “vitaldesire,” but because it is the thing to do. In this may be seen an instance ofthe ability of the Great Ones to utilise conditions of apparent inertia andnegativity (due to little development), and thus produce good results.We will here only deal with the man who is learning consciously to build, andwill not consider the process as pursued by the adept, or the chaotic attemptsof the little evolved. Having grasped the idea, and having with carediscriminated the motive underlying the idea, thus ascertaining its utilitarianpurposes, and its value to the group in the service of humanity, the man hascertain things to do which, for the sake of clarity, we might sum up in certainstatements:He has, first of all, to hold the idea sufficiently long for it to be faithfullyregistered in the physical brain. Frequently the Ego will “get through” to thebrain some concept, some portion of the plan, and yet will have to repeat theprocess continuously over quite a long period before the physical response issuch that the solar Angel can rest assured that it is intelligently registeredand recorded. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that the entire process isgreatly facilitated if the “shadow,” or the man, pursues regular meditation,cultivates the habit of a daily and hourly recollectedness of the higher Self,and before retiring at night endeavours to “hold the thought” of bringingthrough at the time of awakening as much as possible of any egoic impress. Whenthe reaction between the two factors, the Ego and the receptive physical brain,is established, the interplay is reciprocal, and the two are keyed or tuned toeach other, the second stage is entered upon. The idea is conceived.[971] A period of gestation is then pursued, itself divided into various stages.The man broods over the idea; he ponders upon it, thereby setting up activity inmental matter, and attracting to his germ thought the material necessary for itsclothing. He pictures to himself the contour of the thought form, clothing itwith colour, and painting in its details. Hence will be seen the great value ofa true imagination, and its ordered scientific use. Imagination is kama-manasicin origin, being neither pure desire nor pure mind, and is a purely humanproduct, being superseded by the intuition in perfected men, and in the higherIntelligences of Nature.When his will, or the initial impulse is sufficiently strong, and when theimagination, or power of visualisation, is adequately vivid, the second part ofthe gestation period is entered upon, and the vitalisation by desire is begun.The interplay of mental impulse and desire produce what might be called apulsation in the organising form of the idea, and it becomes alive . It is yetbut nebulous and its tenuosity is great, but it shows signs of organisation andthe outline of its form. Students must remember that this entire process isbeing carried on now during this stage which we are considering from within thebrain. There is thus a definite correspondence to the work of the nineSephiroth:The initial three correspond to the egoic impulse with which we have earlierdealt.The secondary group of Sephiroth find their analogy in the work pursued in thestage we are now dealing with, or the impulse of mind-desire, emanatingconsciously from man’s brain.The work of the final three is accomplished when the thought form, being clothedin mental and astral matter, passes into objectivity on the physical plane.[972] A later stage in the gestation period is pursued when the thought form,being clothed in mental matter, and having become vitalised by desire, takes toitself a layer of substance of astral matter, and is consequently enabled tofunction on the astral plane as well as the mental. Here its growth is rapid. Itshould be carefully borne in mind that the process of building in mental matterproceeds simultaneously, and that the development is now twofold. Here theconscious builder must be careful to hold the balance, and not to letimagination unduly assume too large proportions. The manasic element and thekamic element must be justly proportioned, or else will be seen that too commonmanifestation, an idea wrongly conceived and nurtured, and therefore impossibleof playing its just part in the evolutionary plan, being but a grotesquedistortion.The idea now is reaching a critical stage, and should be ready for theassumption of physical matter and to take to itself an etheric form. When onetheric levels, it receives that final impulse which will lead to what may becalled its “actuating,” or its reception of that motivating impulse which willlead to its dissociation from its originator, and the sending out to assume1. A dense form.2. A separate existence.It should be remembered that the thought form has now passed from the mentalplane, taken to itself an astral sheath, and likewise is gathering to itself abody of etheric matter. When it has reached this stage its vitalisation isproceeding apace, and the hour of its separated existence is drawing near.This vitalisation is consciously carried out by the man who—according to theoriginal intent or initial impulse—directs to the thought form energy of somekind. This energy is directed from one or other of the three higher centres,according to the quality of the embodied idea, [973] and will be seen pouringtowards the rapidly objectivising idea from the particular centre involved. Wemust not forget that we are considering the thought form of the consciousbuilder. The thought forms of the majority of human beings are energised from nosuch high source, but find their active impulse emanating from either the solarplexus, or the still lower organs of generation.It is this constant stream of emotional or sexual energy which is responsiblefor the chaotic conditions of the present; the balance is not preserved, theinteraction between the two, and the myriads of thought forms consequentlyproduced of a low order and vibration are producing a condition which is goingto require all the efforts of mental workers eventually to negate, offset, andtransmute. These forms, which scarce merit the prefix “thought,” being largelykamic with an admixture of the lowest grade of mental matter, are responsiblefor the heavy, slow vibrating or pulsating fog or cloak which envelops the humanfamily, and which produces much of the present evil, crime and mental lethargy.People are mainly polarised in the astral body, as we know, and the lowercentres are the most active; when an atmosphere or environment of thought-formsof a low key and vitalised by all the baser forms of astral energy is coupled tothis, it will become apparent how stupendous is the task of lifting humanity toa clearer, purer and better atmosphere, and how easy it is for the lower aspectsand appetites to flourish and to grow.As the vitalisation is pursued and the energy is poured from one or other of thecentres into the thought-form, the conscious builder begins to extend thisinfluence in order to send it forth from him to perform its mission, whateverthat may be, to make it occultly “radiant” so that its vibrations will emanate,and make themselves felt, and finally to make it magnetic, so that something[974] in the thought form will call forth response from other thought forms orfrom the minds it may contact.When these three objectives have been reached, the life of the form itself isnow so strong that it can pursue its own little life cycle and fulfil its work,being only linked to its creator by a tiny thread of radiant substance, which isa correspondence to the sutratma. All forms have such a sutratma. It links aman’s bodies to the inner Identity, or to that magnetic current which, emanatingfrom the true Identity, the solar Logos, connects the Creator of the solarsystem with His great thought form by a stream of energy from the centralSpiritual Sun to a point in the centre of the physical Sun.As long as the attention of the creator of any thought form, great or small, isturned towards it, that magnetic link persists, the thought form is vitalised,and its work carried on. When the work has been accomplished, and thethought-form has served its purpose, every creator, consciously orunconsciously, turns his attention elsewhere, and his thought formdisintegrates.Hence the occult significance of all the processes occultly involved in sight,can be seen. As long as the eye of the Creator is upon that which is created,just so long does it persist; let the Creator withdraw “the light of hiscountenance” and the death of the thought form ensues, for vitality or energyfollows the line of the eye. When, therefore, a man, in meditation, considershis work and builds his thought form for service, he is occultly looking, andconsequently energising; he begins to use the third eye in its secondary aspect.The third or spiritual eye has several functions. Amongst others, it is theorgan of illumination, the unveiled eye of the soul, through which light andillumination comes into the mind, and thus the entire lower life becomesirradiated. It is also the organ through which pours the directing energy [975]which streams out from the conscious creating adept to the instruments ofservice, his thought-forms.The little evolved do not, of course, employ the third eye for the stimulatingof their thought forms. The energy used by them in the majority of casesoriginates in the solar plexus, and works in two directions, either via theorgans of generation, or through the physical eyes. In many people these threepoints—the lower organs, the solar plexus, and the physical eyes—form a triangleof force, around which the stream of energy flows before going out to theobjectivised thought form. In the aspirant, and the man who is intellectual, thetriangle may be from the solar plexus, to the throat centre and thence to theeyes. Later, as the aspirant grows in knowledge and purity of motive, thetriangle of energy will have the heart for its lowest point instead of the solarplexus, and the third eye will begin to do its work, though as yet veryimperfectly.Just as long as the “Eye” is directed to the created form, the current of forcewill be transmitted to it, and the more one-pointed the man may be the more thisenergy will be centralised and effective. Much of the ineffectiveness of peopleis due to the fact that their interests are not centralised but very diffuse,and no one thing engrosses their attention. They scatter their energy and areattempting to satisfy every wandering desire, and to dabble in everything whichcomes their way. Therefore, no thought they think ever assumes a proper form, oris ever duly energised. They are consequently surrounded by a dense cloud ofhalf-formed disintegrating thought forms and clouds of partially energisedmatter in process of dissolution. This produces occultly a condition similar tothe decay of a physical form, and is equally unpleasant and unwholesome. Itaccounts for much of the diseased condition of the human family at this time.Failure in thought creation is due also to the fact that [976] the laws ofthought are not taught, and men do not know how, through meditation, to createthose children of their activity to carry on their work. Results on the physicalplane are much more quickly achieved through scientific thought creation thanthrough the directly physical plane means. This is becoming more realised, butuntil the race has reached a point of greater purity and unselfishness, the moredetailed explanation of the process must necessarily be withheld.Another reason for creative ineffectiveness is owing to the currents whichemanate from the majority of people being of such a low order that the thoughtforms never reach the point of independent action, except through cumulativegroup work. Until matter of the three higher subplanes of the astral andphysical planes finds its place in the thought form, it has to be energisedprincipally by mob energy. When the higher substance begins to find its way intothe form, then it can be seen acting independently, for the individual Ego ofthe man concerned can begin to work through the matter—a thing beforeimpossible. The Ego cannot work freely in the personality until third subplanematter is found in his bodies; the correspondence consequently holds good.Once the thought form has been vitalised and its etheric form is completed or“sealed” as it is called, it can attain the dense physical form if desired. Thisdoes not mean that the individual thought forms of every man take densesubstance upon the etheric, but they will eventuate in activity upon thephysical plane. A man, for instance, is thinking a kindly thought; he has builtit up and vitalised it; it is objective to the clairvoyant and exists in ethericmatter close to the man. It will, therefore, find physical expression in an actof kindness or a physical caress. When the act is over, the caress consummated,the interest of the man in that particular thought form fades out and it dies.Similarly with a crime—the [977] thought form has been built up and inevitablyit will find its physical expression in some deed of one kind or another. Allactivity of every kind is the result:a . Of thought forms built consciously or unconsciously.b. Of self-initiated thought forms or of the effect of the thought forms ofothers.c. Of responsiveness to one’s own inner impulses, or of responsiveness to theimpulses of others, and therefore to group thought forms.It will be apparent, therefore, how vital is this matter, and how influenced menand women are by the thought forms they themselves create, or the mentalchildren of other men.c. The occult significance of speech . The old Scripture saith: “In themultitude of words there wanteth not sin,” (Bible. Prov. 10:19.) because in atide of words at this stage of man’s evolution, many are spoken purposelessly orfrom motives which (when analysed) will be found to be based purely in thepersonality. The greater the progress that is made along the path of approach tothe Mysteries, the greater the care that must be taken by the aspirant. This isnecessary for three reasons:First, owing to his stage in evolution, he is able to enforce his words in amanner which would surprise him could he but see on the mental plane. He buildsmore accurately than the average men, his subsequent thought-form is morestrongly vitalised, and it performs the function whereon it is sent by the“Sound” or speech with greater precision.Second, any word spoken and consequent thought-form built (unless along thehigher path and not based on personality impulses) is apt to cause a barrier ofmental matter between a man and his goal. This matter or separating wall has tobe dissipated before further [978] advance can be made, and this process iskarmic and unavoidable.Third, speech is very largely a mode of communication on the physical levels; onthe subtler levels whereon the worker stands, and in his communications with hisfellow workers and chosen co-operators it will play an ever lessening part.Intuitive perception and telepathic interplay will distinguish the intercoursebetween aspirants and disciples, and when this is coupled with a full trust,sympathy and united effort for the plan we will have a formation wherewith theMaster can work, and through which He can pour His force. The Master worksthrough groups (large or small) and the work is facilitated for Them if theinterplay between units of the group is steady and uninterrupted. One of themost frequent causes of difficulty in group work and consequent arrest of theinflow of force from the Master temporarily is based on misuse of speech. Itbrings about a clogging of the channel for the time being on the mental plane.I mention these three factors for this question of group work is of vitalimportance and much is hoped from it in these days. If in any organisation onthe physical plane the Masters can get a nucleus of even three people whomutually interact (I choose the word deliberately) and who disinterestedlyfollow the path of service, They can produce more definite results in a shorterspace of time than is possible with a large and active body of people who may besincere and earnest but do not know the meaning of trust in, and co-operationwith each other and who guard not the gate of speech.If a man succeeds in understanding the significance of speech, if he learns howto speak, when to speak, what is gained by speech, and what happens when hespeaks, he is well on the way to achieving his goal. The person [979] whoregulates his speech rightly is the person who is going to make the mostprogress. This has ever been realised by all leaders of occult movements. Thatmost occult order of Pythagoras at Crotona, and many other of the esotericschools in Europe and Asia had a rule that all neophytes and probationers werenot permitted to speak for two years after entering the school and when they hadlearned to keep silence for that period, they were given the right to speak, forthey had learned a specific reticence.It might be of value here if students realised that every good speaker is doinga most occult work. A good lecturer (for instance) is one who is doing work thatis analogous on a small scale to that done by the solar Logos. What did He do?He thought, He built, He vitalised. A lecturer, therefore, segregates thematerial with which he is going to build his lecture and which he is going tovitalise. Out of all the thought matter of the world he gathers together thesubstance which he individually seeks to use. Next he copies the work of thesecond Logos in wisely building it into form. He constructs the form, and thenwhen it is constructed, he finishes up by playing the part of the first Personof the Trinity putting his Spirit, vitality and force into it so that it is avibrant, living manifestation. When a lecturer or speaker of any kind canaccomplish that, he can always hold his audience and his audience will alwayslearn from him; they will recognise that which the thought form is intended toconvey.In everyday life when the student speaks, he is doing just the same thing, onlythe trouble frequently arises that in his speech he constructs something that isusually not worth while and vitalises it with the wrong kind of energy, so thatthe form, instead of being a constructive, vital, helpful force, is adestructive one in the world. If we study the various cosmologies of the world,we shall [980] see that the process of creation was carried on by the means ofsound or speech or the Word. We have it in the Christian Bible, “In thebeginning was the Word, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him andwithout Him was not anything made that was made.” (Bible. John I.) Thus,according to the Christian teaching, the worlds were made by the Word of God.In the Hindu Scriptures we will find that the Lord Vishnu, Who stands for thesecond Person of the Trinity, is called “The Voice.” He is the great Singer Whohas built the worlds and the universe by His song. He is the Revealer of thethought of God Who has constructed the universe of solar systems. Just as theChristian speaks about the great Word, the Word of God, the Christ, so the Hinduspeaks of Vishnu, the great Singer, creating by means of His song.In physical plane manifestation, we are known by our speech; we are known by ourreticence, by the things we say, and by the things we leave unsaid and arejudged by the quality of our conversation. We think of people in terms of whatthey say, because their words disclose the type of thought-matter in which theywork and the quality of energy or life which they put behind their words. To thevarious solar Logoi of the vast constellations that are apparent when we scanthe starry heavens, the quality of the Logos of our solar system is seen throughthe medium of that great thought form He has built by the power of His speech,and which is energised by His particular quality of love. When God speaks, theworlds are made and at this present time He is only in process of speaking. Hehas not yet concluded what He has to say, and hence the present apparentimperfection. When that great divine phrase or sentence which occupies Histhought is brought to a close, we [981] will have a perfect solar systeminhabited by perfect existences.Through speech a thought is evoked and becomes present; it is brought out ofabstraction and out of a nebulous condition and materialised upon the physicalplane, producing (could we but see it) something very definite on ethericlevels. Objective manifestation is produced, for “Things are that which the Wordmakes them in naming them.” Speech is literally a great magical force, and theadepts or white magicians, through knowledge of the forces and power of silenceand of speech, can produce effects upon the physical plane. As we well know,there is a branch of magical work which consists in the utilisation of thisknowledge in the form of Words of Power and of those mantrams and formulae whichset in motion the hidden energies of nature and call the devas to their work.Speech is one of the keys which opens the doors of communication between men andsubtler beings. It gives the clue to the discovery of those entities who arecontacted on the other side of the veil. But only he who has learned to keepsilent, and has arrived at the knowledge of the times to speak can pass thisveil and make certain esoteric contacts. Magic consists, we are told in theSecret Doctrine, in addressing the Gods in Their own language; therefore, thespeech of average man cannot reach Them.Therefore, those who seek to learn the occult language, those who yearn tobecome aware of the words which will penetrate to the ears of those who stand onthe other side, and those who seek to utilise the formulae and phrases whichwill give them power over the Builders, have to unlearn their previous use ofwords and to refrain from ordinary methods of talking. Then the new languagewill be theirs and the new expressions, words, mantrams and formulas will beentrusted to their care.[982] The laws of speech are the laws of matter and students can apply the lawsgoverning physical plane substance to their use of words, for it concerns themanipulation of matter on other levels. Speech is the great medium whereby wemake apparent the nature of the little system we are constructing—that system ofwhich each human unit is the central sun, for under the Law of Attraction hedraws to himself that which he needs.2. The Nature of Magic. ( 292 [text00028.html#Y_FN292] )We have considered somewhat at length the building of thought forms, and haveseen that the process pursued by man is analogous to that pursued by thethreefold Logos in the creation of the solar system. We are to deal now withthat great department in occultism which is usually termed magic. The man whomasters the esoteric significance of what is here said will take his place inthe ranks of those entitled to call themselves the “Brothers of White Magic.”The subject is too immense to be more than briefly touched upon, for it covers[983] the entire range of endeavour in the field of material construction.We must deal first with the mental attitude of man as he faces the work ofcreation, and his ability to bring through, via the mental body, the purpose ofthe Ego, thereby impressing the building agents on the mental plane with acertain rate of rhythm, and a certain vibratory activity. This is the primefactor which results (on the physical plane) in direct egoic activity. We mustalso bear in mind, that in the consideration of this matter we are not dealingwith the every day work of average man, but are speaking of the organisedcreative work, under law and rule, of the advanced man. We thereby set astandard and emphasise the ideal towards which occult students should strive.We must also consider the work of the wise magical student upon the astralplane, whereon, through purified desire and sanctified emotion, he providesthose equilibrised conditions and those stable vibrations, which will permit ofthe transmission without hindrance to the physical plane via the physical brainof the man, of the vibratory activity emanating from the Ego, and of thecirculatory action of the higher force. Hence (if a remark of a practical naturemay be interpolated for the average student) the cultivation of emotionaltranquillity is one of the first steps towards the achievement of the neededequipment of the white magician. This tranquillity is not to be achieved by aneffort of the will which succeeds in strangling all astral vibratory activity,but by the cultivation of response to the Ego, and a negation of all response tothe inherent vibration of the astral sheath itself.We will take up the work of force transmission on the physical plane via theetheric centres and the physical brain, studying somewhat the effect of sound asit is emitted unconsciously in everyday speech, and consciously [984] in theordered regulated words of the true worker in magic. ( 293[text00028.html#Y_FN293] )In this connection, therefore, owing to the vital practical value of thissection, and to the dangers attendant upon a comprehension of these matters bythose who are as yet unready for the work of conscious manipulation of force, itis proposed to impart the necessary teaching under the formula of “Rules ofMagic,” with certain elucidating comments. In this way, the magical work isfully safeguarded, and at the same time sufficient is imparted to those who havethe inner ear attentive, and the eye of wisdom in process of opening.a. Black Magicians and White. Much is said among occult students these daysanent white and black magic, ( 294 [text00028.html#Y_FN294] ) and much that issaid is without force, or truth. It has [985] been truly said that between thetwo types of workers, the line of demarcation is so slight as to be difficult ofrecognition by those who, as yet, merit not the term “knower.”The distinction between the two exists in both motive and method, and might besummed up as follows:The white magician has for motive that which will be of benefit to the group forwhom he is expending his energy and time. The magician of the left hand pathever works alone , or if he at any time co-operates with others, it is with ahidden selfish purpose. The exponent of white magic interests himself in thework of constructive endeavour in order to co-operate in hierarchical plans, andto further the desires of the planetary Logos. The Brother of Darkness occupieshimself with that which lies outside the plans of the Hierarchy and with thatwhich is not included in the purpose of the Lord of the planetary Ray.The white magician, as has been earlier said, works entirely through the greaterDeva Builders, and through sound and numbers he blends their work, and thusinfluences the lesser Builders who form the substance of their bodies, andtherefore of all that is. He works [986] through group centres and vital pointsof energy, and from thence produces, in substance, the desired results. The darkbrother works directly with substance itself, and with the lesser builders; Hedoes not co-operate with the forces which emanate from egoic levels. The lessercohorts of the “Army of the Voice” are his servants, and not the directingIntelligences in the three worlds, and he therefore works primarily on theastral and physical planes, only in rare cases working with the mental forces,and only in a few special cases, hidden in cosmic karma, is a black magicianfound working on the higher mental levels. Yet the cases which are there to bediscovered are the main contributing causes of all manifesting black magic.The Brother of Light works ever through the inherent force of the second aspectas long as he is functioning in connection with the three lower planes. Afterthe third Initiation, he works increasingly with spiritual energy, or with theforce of the first aspect. He impresses the lower substances, and manipulatesthe lesser building lives with the vibration of love, and the attractivecoherency of the Son, and through wisdom the forms are built. He learns to workfrom the heart, and therefore to manipulate that energy which streams from the“Heart of the Sun” until (when he becomes a Buddha) he can dispense somewhat theforce emanating from the “Spiritual Sun.” Therefore, the heart centre in theBrother of the right hand path is the transmitting agency for the buildingforce, and the triangle he uses in this work isa. The centre in the head which corresponds to the heart.b. The heart centre itself.c. The throat centre.The Brothers of the left hand path work with the forces of the third aspectentirely, and this it is which [987] gives them so much apparent power, for thesecond aspect is only in process of reaching its vibratory consummation, whereasthe third aspect is at the height of its vibratory activity, being the productof the evolutionary processes of the preceding major solar system. He works fromthe throat centre almost entirely, and manipulates primarily the forces of thephysical sun. This is the reason why he achieves many of his ends through themethod of pranic stimulation or of pranic devitalisation, and why, also, most ofhis effects are carried out on the physical plane. He works, therefore, througha. The centre in the head corresponding to the throat centre.b. The throat centre.c. The centre at the base of the spine.The white magician works always in co-operation with others, and is himselfunder the direction of certain group Heads. For instance, the Brothers of theWhite Lodge work under the three great Lords and conform to the plans laid down,subordinating Their individual purposes and ideas to the great general scheme.The black magician usually works in an intensely individualistic way, and can beseen carrying out his schemes alone, or with the aid of subordinates. He brooksusually no known superior, but is nevertheless frequently the victim of agentson higher levels of cosmic evil, who use him as he uses his inferiorco-operators, that is, he works (as far as the bigger purpose is involved)blindly and unconsciously.The white magician, as is well known, works on the side of evolution or inconnection with the Path of Return. The black brother occupies himself with theforces of involution, or with the Path of Outgoing. They form the greatbalancing force in evolution, and though they [988] are occupied with thematerial side of manifestation and the Brother of Light is concerned with theaspect of soul or consciousness, they and their work, under the great law ofevolution, contribute to the general purpose of the solar Logos, though (andthis is of tremendous occult significance to the illuminated student) not to theindividual purpose of the planetary Logos.Finally, it might be briefly said in connection with the distinctions betweenmagicians that the magician of the Good Law works with the soul of things. Hisbrothers of darkness work with the material aspect.The white magician works through the force centres, on the first and fourthsubplanes of each plane. The black magician works through the permanent atoms,and with the substance and forms concerned. The white magician utilises in thisconnection the higher three centres. The black magician uses the energy of thelower three centres (the organs of generation, the spleen, and the solar plexus)synthesising their energy by an act of the will and directing it to the centreat the base of the spine, so that the fourfold energy is thence transmitted tothe throat centre.The white magician uses the kundalini force as it is transmitted via the centralspinal channel. The black magician uses the inferior channels, dividing thefourfold energy in two units, which mount via the two channels, leaving thecentral one dormant. Hence it will be apparent that one works with duality andthe other with unity. On the planes of duality, therefore, it is apparent whythe black magician has so much power. The plane of unity for humanity is themental plane. The planes of diversity are the astral and the physical. Hence theblack magician is of more apparent power than the white brother on the two lowerplanes in the three worlds.The white brother works under the Hierarchy, or under the great King, carryingout His planetary purposes. [989] The dark brother works under certain separatedEntities, unknown to him, who are connected with the forces of matter itself.Much more could be given in this connection, but what is here imparted sufficesfor our purpose.b. The Source of Black Magic. In touching upon this point, we are trespassinginto the realms of the mystery and the domain of the inexplicable. Certainstatements can, however, be made here which, if pondered upon, may throw alittle light upon this dark subject.First. It should be remembered that the whole subject of planetary evil (andstudents must distinguish carefully between planetary and cosmic evil) lies hidin the individual life cycles and in the history of the Great Being who is theplanetary Logos of the Earth. Therefore, until a man has taken certaininitiations and thus achieved a measure of planetary consciousness, it isuseless for him to speculate upon that record. H. P. B. has touched, in theSecret Doctrine , (III, 62; Section 6, page 67.) upon the subject of “theimperfect Gods,” and in these words lies the key to planetary evil.Second. It might briefly be said that, as far as our humanity is concerned, theterms planetary evil and cosmic evil might be interpreted thus:Planetary evil arises from certain relations existing between our planetaryLogos and another planetary Logos. When this condition of polar opposition isadjusted, then planetary evil will cease. The adjustment will be brought aboutthrough the mediation (occultly understood) of a third planetary Logos. Thesethree will eventually form an equilateral triangle, and then planetary evil willcease. Free circulation will ensue; planetary obscuration will become possible,and the “imperfect Gods” will have achieved a relative perfection. Thus will thekarma of the manvantara, or secondary [990] cycle, be adjusted, and so muchplanetary karmic evil be “worked off.” All the above must be interpreted in itsesoteric sense and not its exoteric.Cosmic evil from the standpoint of our planet consists in the relation betweenthat spiritual intelligent Unit or “Rishi of the Superior Constellation” as Heis called (who is the informing Life of one of the seven stars of the GreatBear, and our planetary prototype) and one of the forces of the Pleiades. (S. D., II, 579-581.) Students need here to remember that the “seven sisters” areoccultly called the “seven wives” of the Rishis, and that the dual forces(resultant from that relationship) converge and play through that one of theplanetary Logoi who is the Logos of any particular planet, and is the“reflection” of any specific Rishi. In this relation, at present lacking perfectadjustment, lies hid the mystery of cosmic evil as it makes itself felt in anyparticular planetary scheme. Again, when the heavenly triangle is dulyequilibrated, and the force circulates freely througha . One of the stars of the Great Bear,b. The Pleiad involved,c. The planetary scheme concerned,then again cosmic evil will be negated, and a relative perfection achieved. Thiswill mark the attainment of primary perfection, and the consummation of thegreater cycle.Cyclic evil, or tertiary evil, lies hid in the relation between the globes inany particular scheme, two of them ever being in opposition until equilibrisedby force emanating from a third. Students will only apprehend the significanceof this teaching as they study the pairs of opposites in their own cycles, andthe equilibrising work of the Ego.A fourth type of evil growing out of the above finds [991] its main expressionin the sorrows and troubles of the fourth or human kingdom, and will find itssolution in two ways: by the balancing of the forces of the three kingdoms (thespiritual or fifth kingdom, the human, and the animal), and secondly, by thenegation of the attractive power of the three lower kingdoms (the mineral, thevegetable, and the animal, who thus form one unit), by the spiritual kingdom,utilising the fourth or human kingdom. In all these cases, triangles of forceare formed which, when balanced, procure the desired end.Black magic is spoken of as making its appearance upon our planet during thefourth root race. (S. D., I, 451, 452; II, 221, 234, 519.) It should be borne inmind here that this means strictly in connection with the fourth kingdom and itsconscious use by wrongly developed men. The forces of evil of the planetary andcosmic kind have been present since manifestation set in, being latent in thekarma of the planetary Logos, but human beings began consciously to work withthese forces and to use them for specified selfish ends in this round during thefourth root race.Black magicians work under certain great Entities, six in number, who are spokenof, for instance, in the Christian Bible as having the number 666. (Bible. Rev.13:18.) They came in (being cosmic, not systemic) on that stream of forceemanating from cosmic mental levels which produced the three worlds of humanendeavour. Students should remember here the fact that the three lower planes ofour solar system are not considered as embodying a cosmic principle, for theyform the dense physical body of the Logos, and the dense physical body is notconsidered a principle. There is an occult significance in the expression“unprincipled.” These entities are the sumtotal of the substance of the threelower subplanes of the cosmic physical plane (our three lower systemic [992]planes), and it is under them that the black magicians are swept into activity,often unconsciously, but rising to power as they work consciously. ( 299[text00028.html#Y_FN299] )In the early stages of human unfoldment all men are unconscious black magicians,but are not occultly “damned” thereby. As evolution proceeds they come under theforce of the second aspect, and the majority respond to it, escaping from themeshes of the black magicians, and coming under the force of a different number.The few who do not do so in this manvantara are the “failures” who have tocontinue the struggle at a later date. A tiny percentage wilfully refuse to“pass on,” and they become the true “black magicians.” For them the end is everthe same, first, severance of the Ego from the Monad, entailing a wait for manyaeons until another solar system has its being. In the case of the “failures”the Ego severed itself from the personality or lower self, entailing a setbackfor a lesser period, but still having opportunity within the system. Second, acycle of existence, spent in unlimited evil, and dependent upon the vitality ofthe severed egoic body and its innate persistence. These are the ordinary “lostsouls” spoken of in the Secret Doctrine. ( 301 [text00028.html#Y_FN301] ) Ifstudents will study these conditions, and will extend the same concept to anearlier and more matured solar system, they will get [993] some light upon theproblem of the origin of evil in this solar system.c. Conditions for White Magic. In considering the factors requiring adjustmentprior to undertaking the work of magic, we are dealing with that which is ofeminently practical value. Unless students of magic enter upon this pursuitfortified by pure motive, clean bodies, and high aspiration, they are foredoomedto disappointment and even to disaster. All those who seek to work consciouslywith the forces of manifestation, and who endeavour to control the Energies ofall that is seen, need the strong protection of purity. This is a point whichcannot be too strongly emphasised and urged, and hence the constant injunctionsto self control, comprehension of the nature of man, and devotion to the causeof humanity. The pursuit of magical investigation is dangerous in three ways.If a man’s bodies are not sufficiently purified and their atomic vibration isnot sufficiently high, he is in danger of over-stimulation when brought incontact with the forces of nature, and this inevitably entails the destructionand disintegration of one or other of his bodies. At times it may entail thedestruction of two or more, and when this is the case, it involves a definitesetback to egoic unfoldment, for it requires, in such cases, a much longerinterval between incarnations, owing to the difficulty of assembling the neededmaterials in the sheaths.Further, unless a man is strengthened in his endeavour by right motive, he isliable to be led astray by the acquisition of power. Knowledge of the laws ofmagic puts into the hands of the student powers which enable him to create, toacquire, and to control. Such powers [994] are fraught with menace to theunprepared and unready, for the student can, in this case, turn them to selfishends, use them for his own temporal material advancement, and acquire in thisway that which will feed the desires of the lower nature. He takes, therefore,the first step towards the left hand path, and each life may see him progressingtowards it with greater readiness, until (almost unconsciously) he will findhimself in the ranks of the black masters. Such a state of affairs can only beoffset through the cultivation of altruism, sincere love of man, and a steadynegation of all lower desire.The third danger which menaces the unwary student of magic lies in the fact thatwhen he tampers with these forces and energies he is dealing with that which isakin to his own lower nature. He, therefore, follows the line of leastresistance; he augments these energies, thereby increasing their response to thelower and to the material aspects of his nature. This he does at the expense ofhis higher nature, retarding its unfoldment and delaying his progress.Incidentally also, he attracts the attention of those masters of the left handpath who are ever on the lookout for those who can be bent to their purposes,and he becomes (unwittingly at first), an agent on the side of evil.It will be apparent, therefore, that the student has need of the followingqualities before he undertakes the arduous task of becoming a conscious Masterof Magic:Physical Purity. This is a thing not easily to be acquired, but entailing manylives of strenuous effort. Through abstinence, right continence, clean living,vegetarian diet, and rigid self-control, the man gradually raises the vibrationof his physical atoms, builds a body of ever greater resistance and strength,and succeeds in “manifesting” forth in a sheath of greater refinement.Etheric Freedom. This term does not convey all that [995] I seek to impart, butit suffices for need of a better. The student of magic who can safely undertakethe enterprise, will have constructed an etheric body of such a nature thatvitality, or pranic force and energy, can circulate unimpeded; he will haveformed an etheric web of such tenuosity that it forms no barrier toconsciousness. This is all that can be said on this subject, owing to the dangerinvolved, but it suffices for the conveyance of information to those who arebeginning to know.Astral Stability. The student of magic aims, above all, to purify his desires,and so to transmute his emotions that the lower physical purity and the highermental responsiveness and transmutative power may equally be available. Everymagician has to learn the fact that, in this solar system, during the cycle ofhumanity, the astral body is the pivotal point of endeavour, having a reflexeffect on both the other sheaths, the physical and the mental. He, therefore,aims at transmuting (as has often been said) lower desire into aspiration; atchanging the lower cruder colors which distinguish the astral body of averageman, for the clearer, purer tones of the spiritual man, and of transforming itsnormal chaotic vibration, and the “stormy sea of life,” for the steady rhythmicresponse to that which is highest and the centre of peace. These things heeffects by constant watchfulness, unremitting control, and steady meditation.Mental Poise. These words are used in the occult sense, wherein the mind (as itis commonly understood) becomes the keen steady instrument of the indwellingthinker, and the point from which he can travel onwards to higher realms ofcomprehension. It is the foundation stone whence the higher expansion can beinitiated.Let not the would-be student of magic proceed in his investigations and hisexperiments until he has attended to these injunctions, and until the whole bentof his thought is towards their manifestation and their demonstration [996] inhis every day life. When he has so worked, ceaselessly and untiringly, and hisphysical plane life and service bear witness to the inner transmutation, then hecan proceed to parallel this life with magical studies and work. Only the solarAngel can do the work of the white magician, and he effects it through thecontrol of the lunar angels and their complete subjugation. They are arrayedagainst him, until, through meditation, aspiration, and control, he bends themto his will and they become his servants.This thought brings us to the vital and real distinction between the whitebrother and the brother of darkness, and in this summation we will conclude thepresent discussion and proceed with the rules.The worker in white magic utilises ever the energy of the Solar Angel to effecthis ends. The dark brother works through the inherent force of the lunar lords,which are allied in nature to all that is objective. In an old book of magic,hidden in the caves of learning, guarded by the Masters, are the followingconclusive words, which find their place in this Treatise on Fire through theirvery appropriateness:“The Brothers of the Sun, through the force of solar fire, fanned to a flame inthe blazing vault of the second Heaven, put out the lower lunar fires, andrender naught that lower ‘fire by friction.’“The Brother of the Moon ignores the sun and solar heat; borrows his fire fromall that triply is, and pursues his cycle. The fires of hell await, and lunarfire dies out. Then neither sun nor moon avails him, only the highest heavenawaits the spark electric, seeking vibration synchronous from that which liesbeneath. And yet it cometh not.”3. Fifteen Rules for Magic.These rules will necessarily be of an esoteric nature, and the student will needto remember that the terminology is in the nature of a blind, which ever carries[997] revelation to those who have the clue, but tends to perplex and tobewilder the student who as yet is unready for the truth. I would also remindthe student to bear in mind that all that is here imparted concerns “whitemagic,” and is given from the standpoint of the solar Angel, and of solar Fire.Bearing these two points in mind the student will find much in these rules toproduce eventual internal illumination. We will divide them into three groups ofaphorisms or occult phrases; of these, the first will concern itself with thework of the magician on the mental plane, with his manipulation of solar energy,and his ability to sweep the Builders into co-operation with his purposes.The second group will carry the work on down to the plane of desire, and ofvitalisation, and will convey information as to the balancing of the pairs ofopposites, and their equilibrising, so that eventual manifestation becomespossible.The third group of rules will deal with the physical plane, with thetransmission of force:a . Through the centres,b . Through the brain,c. Through the physical plane itself.a. Six Rules for the Mental Plane. Certain of the laws of speech will be given,and the significance of colour and of sound will appear beneath the exotericform of the phrasing to those whose perception suffices.RULE I. The Solar Angel collects himself, scatters not his force, but inmeditation deep communicates with his reflection.The significance of this rule is easily to be seen. The white magician is everone who, through conscious alignment with his Ego, with his “Angel,” isreceptive to his plans and purposes, and therefore capable of receiving thehigher impression. We must remember that [998] white magic works from abovedownwards, and is the result of solar vibration, and not of the heating impulsesemanating from one or other of the lunar Pitris; the downflow of the impressingenergy from the solar Pitri is the result of his internal recollectedness, hisindrawing of his forces prior to sending them out concentratedly to his shadow,man, and his steady meditation upon the purpose and the plan. It may be of useto the student if he here remembers that the Ego (as well as the Logos) is indeep meditation during the whole cycle of physical incarnation. This solarmeditation is cyclic in nature, the Pitri involved sending out to his“reflection” rhythmic streams of energy, which streams are recognised by the manconcerned as his “higher impulses,” his dreams and aspirations. Therefore, itwill be apparent why workers in white magic are ever advanced, and spiritualmen, for the “reflection” is seldom responsive to the Ego or the solar Angeluntil many cycles of incarnation have transpired. The solar Pitri communicateswith his “shadow” or reflection by means of the sutratma, which passes downthrough the bodies to a point of entrance in the physical brain.RULE II. When the shadow hath responded, in meditation deep the work proceedeth.The lower light is thrown upward; the greater light illuminates the three, andthe work of the four proceedeth.Here the work of the two, the Ego on its own plane, and its instrument in thethree worlds, is shown as linked and co-ordinated. As we well know, the mainfunction of meditation is to bring the lower instrument into such a condition ofreceptivity and vibratory response that the Ego, or solar Angel, can use it, andproduce specific results. This involves, therefore, a downflow of force from theupper levels of the mental plane [999] (the habitat of the real Man) and areciprocal vibration, emanating from Man, the Reflection. When these twovibrations are attuned, and the interplay is rhythmic, then the two meditationsproceed synchronously, and the work of magic and of creation can proceedunimpeded. It will, therefore, be apparent that the brain is the physicalcorrespondence to the force centres upon the mental plane, and that thevibration has to be consciously set up by the man when meditating. When this iseffected, the man can be a conscious creator, and the work proceeds therefore ina triple manner; the force circulates freely via three points of centralisedactivity:First. From that circle of petals in the egoic lotus which the Ego chooses touse, or is in a position to use. This is conditioned by the objective in view,and the state of egoic unfoldment.Secondly. The centre in the physical brain which is active in meditation. Thisis also conditioned by the man’s point in evolution, and the particular goal inmind.Thirdly. The centre of force generated by the man upon the lower mental plane,as he proceeds to form the necessitated thought form, and to sweep into activitythose builders who can respond to the vibration sent forth. This is likewiseconditioned by the strength of his meditation, the fullness of the note sentforth by him, and the strength of his initiated vibration.Hence, the first thing the solar Angel does is to form a triangle, consisting ofhimself, the man on the physical plane, and the tiny point of force which is theresult of their united endeavour. It will be of value to students of meditationto ponder upon this procedure, and to study the correspondence between it andthe work of the solar Logos as He created “the Heavens and the Earth.” The[1000] Highest and the lowest aspects met, spirit and matter were brought intocontact with each other; the consequence of this interplay was the birth of theSon, or the great solar thought form. In the three worlds, man, the lesserDeity, within his limits, proceeds along analogous lines. The three who areillumined by the light of the One are the three persons of the lower Triad, themental body, the astral body, and the physical body. They, with the Illuminator,make the “Four” referred to, and thus becomes apparent the microcosmicTetraktys.The two rules above form the esoteric basis of all meditation, and need to becarefully studied if results are to be achieved.RULE III. The Energy circulates. The point of light, the product of the laboursof the Four, waxeth and groweth. The myriads gather round its glowing warmthuntil its light recedes. Its fire grows dim. Then shall the second sound goforth.The white magician, having, through meditation and conscious purpose, formed afocal point of energy upon the mental plane, increases the vibration throughstrenuous concentration; he begins then to visualise in detail the form he isseeking to build; he pictures it with all its component parts, and sees “beforehis mind’s eye” the consummated product of the egoic meditation as he hassucceeded in bringing it through. This produces what is here called “thesecondary note,” the first being the note emanating from the Ego on its ownplane, which awakened the “reflection” and called forth response. The vibrationbecomes stronger, and the note sounded by the man on the physical plane ascendsand is heard upon the mental plane. Hence, in all meditation that is [1001] ofoccult value, the man has to do certain things in order to aid in bringing aboutthe results.He tranquilises his bodies in order that there be no impediment to the egoicintent, and listens for the “Voice of the Silence.” He responds then to thatVoice consciously, and broods over the imparted plans.He then sounds the Sacred Word, taking up the note of the Ego as he believes hehears it, and sending it forth to swell the egoic sound, and to set in motionmatter on the mental plane. He (synchronously with this sounding) visualises theproposed thought form which is to embody egoic purposes, and pictures it indetail.We must not forget that we are here dealing with those conscious meditations,based on knowledge and long experience, which produce magical results on thephysical plane. We are not dealing here with those meditations which have fortheir purpose the revelation of the inner God, and the bringing in of theilluminating fire of the Ego.When this process is proceeding under rule and order, the focal point of energyon the lower mental plane gains in strength; its light or fire makes itselffelt; it becomes, in the occult sense, visually objective, and attracts theattention of the lesser builders througha. Its radiation or warmth,b. Its active vibration,c. Its sound or note,d. Its light.The elemental workers of responsive capacity are gathered and swept into theradius of the force, and begin to gather around. The intended form begins to beapparent, and tiny life after tiny life takes its place in its construction. Theresult of this “coherency” is that the inner light becomes veiled, itsbrilliancy dimmed, just as the inner light of the Ego in its shadow, or thoughtform, man, is similarly dimmed and hidden. [1002]RULE IV. Sound, light, vibration, and the form blend and merge, and thus thework is one. It proceedeth under the law, and naught can hinder now the workfrom going forward. The man breathes deeply. He concentrates his forces, anddrives the thought-form from him.Here we have a very important piece of work of magic dealt with, and one that islittle considered and known. The force used by the Ego in the work of forcingthe man to carry out His purpose has been dynamic will, and the petal, or energycentre, employed has been one of the will petals. The man has, up till now, beendriven by egoic will, but has blended with this much of the energy of theattraction aspect (desire or love) thereby gathering to himself on the mentalplane, the material needed for his thought form. He has succeeded so far that onthe concrete levels of the mental plane is to be seen a form in mental matterwhich is coherent, alive, vibrant, and of a desired nature. Its internalactivity is such that its persistence for the length of time necessary to ensureachievement of the egoic purpose is assured; it stands ready to be sent forthupon its mission, to gather to itself material of a denser nature upon theastral plane, and to achieve greater consolidation. This is brought about by anact of will emanating from the man, and he gives the living form power “to breakloose.” It is exactly at this point, fortunately for the human race, that themajority of magical investigators fail in their work. They build a form inmental matter, but do not know how to send it forth, so that inevitably it willfulfill its mission. Thus many thought forms die a natural death on the mentalplane owing to the inability of the man to exert the will facultyconstructively, and his failure to understand the laws of thought-formconstruction. Another factor is his lack of knowledge [1003] of the formulawhich releases the elemental builders from their surroundings, and forces themto cohere within the periphery of the thought form for as long as the thinkerdesires.Finally, they die owing to the incapacity of the man, which prevents him holdinga meditation long enough, and formulating his ideas clearly enough to bringabout ultimate materialisation.Men are, as yet, too impure and too selfish to be trusted with this knowledge.Their thought forms would be constructed in order to be sent on selfish missionsand for destructive ends, and until they are more spiritual, and have gainedcontrol over their lower nature, the magical words which galvanise intoseparated activity the form in mental substance will not be available for theiruse.It might be asked how it is that men do achieve their ends, throughconcentration and visualisation, and do manage to send forth thought forms whichreach their objective. In two ways this can be brought about:First. By an unconscious recollection of methods and formulas known and used inAtlantean days, when the magical formulas were public property, and men producedresults through the pronouncement of certain sounds. They did not achieve theirends through mental ability, but principally through a parrot-like capacity torepeat mantrams. These are, at times, hidden in the subconscious nature, and areused unwittingly by the man who is feeling strongly enough.Second. Through the thoughts and ideas of the man fitting in with the plans andpurposes of those who do know, either on the path of white or black magic. Thenthey utilise the form with its inherent force and galvanise it into activity,and a temporary separate identity, thus sending it forth to accomplish itspurpose. This accounts for many of the apparently phenomenal results achieved byselfish or by incompetent (though good) thinkers.[1004] The magical words are only communicated under the seal of secrecy, to menworking under the Brotherhood of Light, to initiates, and to pledged chelas,owing to the great danger involved. Occasionally, too, they are ascertained bymen and women who have brought about a condition of alignment with the Ego, andare, therefore, in touch with the inner centre of all knowledge withinthemselves. When this is so, the knowledge is safe, for the Ego ever works onthe side of law and righteousness, and the words being emanated by the Ego are“lost in His sound” (as it is occultly termed) and will not be remembered by thephysical brain when not under the influence of the solar Angel.The six rules for the mental plane are necessarily brief, owing to the fact thatthe plane of mind is as yet an unknown land to the majority,—unknown in so faras its conscious control is concerned. These two remaining rules concern, in thefirst case, the brother engaged in white magic, and in the second the thoughtform he is constructing.RULE V. Three things engage the solar Angel before the sheath created passesdownward: the condition of the waters, the safety of the one who thus creates,and steady contemplation. Thus are the heart, the throat, and the eye, alliedfor triple service.The focal point of energy that the man, the magician, has now created upon themental plane, has reached a vibratory activity which makes it certain thatresponse will be called forth from the matter required for the providing of thenext, and denser sheath. This vibration will result in an aggregation of adifferent type of divine life-substance around the central nucleus. The form,occultly, is made to be sent forth, to descend, to [1005] fly as a bird forthupon its mission, and a critical moment is near for the magician. One of thethings the magician has to see to is that this form which he has constructed,and which he holds linked to him by a fine thread of animated substance (acorrespondence on a minute scale of the sutratmic thread whereby the Monad orthe Ego holds in connection its “form of manifestation”) shall neither die forlack of vital sustenance nor return to him with its mission unfulfilled. Whenthis latter catastrophe is the case, the thought form becomes a menace to themagician, and he becomes the prey of that which he has created. The devas whoform the body of the idea which has failed in its purpose form a drain upon hisvital force. He, therefore, sees to it that the motive or desire lying back ofthe “idea,” now clothed with its first sheath, retains its pristine purity; thatno trace of selfish intent, no perversion of the initial purpose of the solarAngel has been permitted to bring in an unworthy vibration. This is what ismeant by attending to the “condition of the waters.” As we well know, waterstands for matter, and the substances of the astral plane which are now underconsideration are of prime importance in all form-building. According to thesubstance used and the nature of the Builders who respond to the note of theform in mental matter, will the purpose be accomplished. This is the mostimportant stage in many ways, for the astral body of any form conditions:a . The nature of the physical vehicle.b. The transmission of force from the next highest plane.Provided the man on the physical plane can hold the purpose steady, and refuseto permit its distortion by the influences and vibrations emanating from thelower man, then the “devas of kama” can carry on their work. [1006] I wouldremind students at this juncture that any thought form necessarily finds its wayinto greater streams of force or energy, emanating from advanced thinkers ofevery grade, from the planetary Logos downward, and according to its nature andmotive so the work of evolution is assisted or retarded. It is in thisconnection that the Nirmanakayas work, manipulating streams of thought energy,vitalising the forms created by men, and thus carrying on the work ofconstruction or destruction. They have to use that which exists; hence thenecessity for clear thinking. Having “purified” the waters, or safeguarded hisdesires, the thinker next proceeds (through the use of certain words which areimparted to him by the solar Angel) to protect himself from the devas ofelemental nature with which he is purposing to work. On the mental plane, thenature and vibration of the solar Angel proved sufficient protection, but he isnow proposing to work with the most dangerous elementals and existences in thethree worlds. ( 302 [text00028.html#Y_FN302] )These protective formulas are sounded forth by the thinker, in conjunction withthe solar Angel, at the moment the thought form is ready to receive its astralsheath. The mantram deals with the forces which impel activity in theAgnisuryans, and starts a stream of protective energy from one of the heartpetals of the Egoic lotus. This circulates through the throat centre of the man,and sets up a circulatory stream of energy around him which automaticallyrepulses the devas who might (through their blind unintelligent work) menace hispeace. These two matters attended to—desire adjusted and the identityguarded—both the solar Angel and the worker in magic maintain an attitude ofcontemplation, [1007] or that profound condition which succeeds that calledmeditation.In contemplation, the inner eye is fixed upon the object of contemplation, andthis produces (unconsciously in most cases) a steady stream of energy which isfocussed upon the objective, producing vitalisation and activity. It is thebasis of the “work of transmutation,” for instance, when the human substance istransmuted into solar substance. The Ego contemplates his lunar bodies, andgradually the work is accomplished. When his reflection, man, has reached apoint in evolution where he can meditate and contemplate, the work is morerapidly accelerated, and transmutation proceeds with rapidity, particularly onthe physical plane. In the work of thought-form building, the man, incontemplation, pursues the work of energising and vitalising. It might here besaid that the eye is the great directing agency. When the third eye is used,which is the case in contemplation, it is the synthesiser and director of tripleenergy; hence the powerful work performed by those in whom it is functioning.The third eye only begins to function when the third circle of egoic petals isbeginning slowly to unfold.If students will study the effect of the human eye on the physical plane, andthen extend the concept to the work of the interior Thinker, as he utilises thethird eye, they will get an interesting light upon the subject of thoughtcontrol. The old Commentary says:“When the eye is blind, the forms created revolve in circles and fulfill not thelaw. When the eye is open, force streams forth, direction is assured,fulfillment is certain, and the plans proceed under law; the eye which is bluein color, and the eye which sees not red, when open, produce that which isintended with great facility.”The final rule is contained in the words: [1008]RULE VI. The devas of the lower four feel the force when the eye opens; they aredriven forth and lose their master.The egoic energy, transmitted via the physical brain, is directed now to thework of sending forth the form, so that it may clothe itself in astral matter.The eye of the Thinker opens, and repulsing vitality streams forth. More neednot be said here, for until the eye is functioning, it is not possible for mento comprehend the nature of the energy which they will then wield or direct.b. Five Rules for the Astral Plane. Before we take up the consideration of thesecond set of “Rules for Magic,” I would like to make a few remarks anent the“eye of the Magician,” to which reference has been earlier made. One of thefundamental rules back of all magical processes is that no man is a magician orworker in white magic until the third eye is opened, or in process of opening,for it is by means of that eye that the thought form is energised, directed andcontrolled and the lesser builders or forces are swept into any particular lineof activity. Among the coming discoveries, and among the next revelations ofmaterialistic science will be one which will concern itself with theforce-directing faculty of the human eye, alone or collectively, and this willindicate one of the first stages towards the rediscovery of the third eye, orthe “Eye of Shiva.” Shiva is, as we know, one of the names for the first greatlogoic aspect, and under that name is hidden much of esoteric moment. Shivastands for:a. The Will aspect,b. The Spirit aspect,c. The Father in Heaven,d. The directing purpose,e. Conscious energy,f. Dynamic intent,[1009] and in the consideration of these phrases the innate faculties of thethird eye will become apparent.The “Eye of Shiva” in the human being has its position, as is already known, inthe centre of the forehead between the two physical eyes. (S. D., I, 77; II,297,309, 316.)It is not to be confounded with the pineal gland, which is distinctly a physicalcentre or gland. The third eye exists in etheric matter, and is an ethericcentre of force, being made of the substance of the ethers, whereas the pinealgland is formed of matter of the three lower subplanes of the physical plane.The latter, nevertheless, has to be functioning more or less before the “Eye ofShiva” becomes in any degree active, and it is this fact that has led writers ofoccult books in the past purposely to confound the two, in order to protect theknowledge.The third eye is formed through the activity of three factors:First, through the direct impulse of the Ego on its own plane. During thegreater part of evolution the Ego makes its contact with its reflection,physical plane man, through the centre at the top of the head. When man is morehighly evolved, and is nearing or treading the Path, the indwelling Self takes amore complete grasp of its lower vehicle, and descends to a point in the head orbrain which is found approximately in the centre of the forehead. This is itslowest contact. It is interesting here to note the correspondence with theevolution of the senses. The three major senses and the three first todemonstrate in order are, hearing, touch, sight. For the greater part ofevolution, hearing is the guiding impulse of human life through egoic contactwith the top of the head. Later, when the Ego descends a little lower, theetheric centre which is active in connection with the pituitary body, is added,and man becomes responsive [1010] to subtler and higher vibrations; the occultcorrespondence to the physical sense of touch awakens. Finally, the third eyeopens and the pineal gland simultaneously begins to function. At first, thesight is dim, and the gland is only partially responsive to vibration, butgradually the eye opens fully, the gland is fully active, and we have the “fullyawakened” man. When this is the case, the alta major centre vibrates and thenthe three physical head centres are functioning.Second, through the co-ordinated activity of the major head centre, the manypetalled lotus above the top of the head. This centre directly affects thepineal gland, and the interplay of force behind the two (the correspondence, ona tiny scale, of the pairs of opposites, spirit and matter), produces the greatorgan of consciousness, the “Eye of Shiva.” It is the instrument of wisdom, andin these three centres of energy we have the correspondence of the three aspectswithin the head of man.1. Major head centre Will Aspect Spirit Father in Heaven 2. Pineal glandLove-Wisdom aspect Consciousness Son 3. Third eye Activity aspect Matter MotherThe third eye is the director of energy or force, and thus an instrument of thewill or Spirit; it is responsive only to that will as controlled by theSon-aspect, the revealer of the love-wisdom nature of gods and man, and it istherefore the sign of the white magician.Third, the reflex action of the pineal gland itself.As these three types of energy, or the vibration of these three centres, beginto contact each other, a definite interplay is set up. This triple interplayforms in time a vortex or centre of force, which finds its place in the centreof the forehead, and takes eventually the semblance of an eye looking outbetween the other two. [1011] It is the eye of the inner vision, and he who hasopened it can direct and control the energy of matter, see all things in theEternal Now, and therefore be in touch with causes more than with effects, readthe akashic records, and see clairvoyantly. Therefore, its possessor can controlthe builders of low degree.The “Eye of Shiva,” when perfected, is blue in colour, and as our solar Logos isthe “Blue Logos” so do His children occultly resemble Him; but this colour mustbe interpreted esoterically. It must be remembered also that prior to the finaltwo Initiations (the sixth and seventh), the eye of the white magician, whendeveloped, will be coloured according to the man’s ray—again esotericallyunderstood. More anent this question of colour may not be communicated.According to the colour, so will be the type of energy manipulated, but here itmust be borne in mind that all magicians work with three types of energy:a. That which is the same as their own Ray,b. That which is complementary to their own type of force,c. Their polar opposite,and they work, therefore, either along the line of least resistance, or throughattraction, and repulsion.It is through the medium of this “all-seeing eye” that the Adept can at anymoment put Himself in touch with His disciples anywhere; that He can communicatewith His compeers on the planet, on the polar opposite of our planet, and on thethird planet which, with ours, forms a triangle; that He can, through the energydirected from it, control and direct the builders, and hold any thought form Hemay have created within His sphere of influence, and upon its intended path ofservice; and that through his eye by means of directed energy currents He canhelp and stimulate His disciples or groups of men in any place at any time.[1012] The pineal gland is subject to two lines of stimulation: First, thatwhich emanates from the Ego itself via the etheric force centres. This downflowof egoic energy (the result of the awakening of the centres through meditationand spirituality of life), impinges upon the gland and in the course of yearsgradually increases its secretion, enlarges its form, and starts it into a newcycle of activity.The second line of stimulation affecting the pineal gland is that which is theconsequence of the discipline of the physical body, and its subjugation to thelaws of spiritual unfoldment. As the disciple lives a regulated life, avoidsmeat, nicotine and alcohol, and practises continence, the pineal gland becomesno longer atrophied, but resumes its earlier activity.More cannot here be given but enough has been indicated to give the student foodfor thought.In meditation, by the sounding of the word, the student awakens response in themajor head centre, causes reciprocal vibration between it and the physical headcentre, and gradually co-ordinates the forces in the head. Through the practiceof the power of visualisation, the third eye is developed. The forms visualised,and the ideas and abstractions which are, in the process, mentally clothed andvehicled, are pictured a few inches from the third eye. It is the knowledge ofthis which causes the Eastern yogi to speak of “concentration upon the tip ofthe nose.” Behind this misleading phrase a great truth is veiled.In proceeding with the “Rules for Magic,” we will take up those concerned withthe second set, which deal with the form-building impulses, and those attractivetendencies which are the basis of physical plane manifestation. We haveconsidered certain rules which deal with the work of the solar Angel, who (inall true magical work of any kind), is the active agent. We have [1013]considered the rules whereby He constructs a thought form upon the mental plane,or that germ body which will (through accretion and vibratory sound), take toitself other forms.RULE VII. The dual forces on the plane whereon the vital power must be sought,are seen; the two paths face the Solar Angel; the poles vibrate. A choiceconfronts the one who meditates.Upon the astral plane the thought form must now function, and a body must beprovided so as to make this possible. The energy of desire enters it, and “hewho meditates” has to energise the form with one of two types of force before itpasses into objectivity. Upon the action taken depends the construction of theetheric body, and the consequent physical manifestation. This point is butlittle realised by the average thinker, but the parallel with his own lifeexperience is exact, as is the correspondence with the cosmic process. The“nature of the deva” (as it is called), enters in, and upon the quality of itslove nature, and the specific type of that which is the object of love willdepend the nature of the thought form. If the deva, or solar Angel, is as yet inlove with manifestation, and has a desire for objective existence, thusidentifying himself voluntarily with substance, there ensues the phenomenon ofreincarnated physical life. If the deva, or solar Angel, is no longer attractedby matter, then there is no identification, and objective life is no longer thelaw of his existence. He identifies himself then with quality, or energy, andbecomes an expression of the divine attributes. Objectivity may then ensue as avoluntary offering to the good of the group or planetary existence, butidentification with the separated form is no longer the case. The human vehiclethen created is as much a thought form in this case as any other particularisedidea, and [1014] the greatest act of conscious magic is to be seen. All othermagical creations are subsidiary to this. Through manipulation of negative andpositive energy, thus bringing them to the point of equilibrium before informingthem, the perfected body of the Adept is formed. All magical work on the astralplane has to be along the line of equilibrising activity, and the distinctivenature of this type of work on the three planes in the three worlds might besummed up as follows:On the mental plane, the positive force of the solar Angel drives the substanceneeded into the correct form.On the astral plane, the equilibrising force of the solar Angel gathers theneeded material and energy from all directions and builds it into the necessaryastral sheath.On the physical plane the negative force of the solar Angel is all that isneeded to gather the desired etheric substance. By this I mean the form has nowachieved a vitality and distinction of its own, so that no aggressive actionemanating from the egoic centre is required to continue the work. The note andvibration of the form itself suffices.RULE VIII. The Agnisuryans respond to the sound. The waters ebb and flow. Letthe magician guard himself from drowning at the point where land and water meet.The midway spot which is neither dry nor wet must provide the standing placewhereon his feet are set. When water, land and air meet there is the place formagic to be wrought.It will be noted that in this rule, no mention is made of the fourth element,fire. The reason for this is that the magician has to accomplish the stupendoustask of generating the needed fire at this triple “meeting place.” This is oneof the most occult and most puzzling of the [1015] rules. Some light is thrownon it by the following three sentences from the old Commentary:“When the fire is drawn from the inmost point within the heart the waterssuffice not to subdue it. Like a stream of flame it issues forth, and traversesthe waters, which disappear before it. Thus the goal is found.”“When the fire descends from the One Who watches above, the wind suffices not toblow it out. The very winds protect, shield and aid the work, guiding thefalling fire unto the point of entrance.”“When the fire emanates from the mouth of the one who thinks and sees, then theearth sufficeth not to hide or kill the flame. It feeds the flame, causing agrowth and magnitude of fire which reaches to the narrow door of entrance.”Under this symbology much is hidden anent the life-giving energy, the centressymbolised to focalise it, and to drive it forth, and the place the varioustypes of receptive matter play in the magical work. As is ever the case in allwhite magic, the activity of the solar Angel is the primary factor and the workof the man upon the physical plane is regarded as secondary; his physical body,and the work engendered therein, being frequently referred to as “fuel and itswarmth.” This needs careful remembering, and will give the clue to the necessityof egoic alignment, and to the problem of the extinction of certain workers inmagic, who were “destroyed by their own fire” or energy. The discreet magicianis one who sees to the readiness of his lowest vehicle to carry the firewherewith he works, and this he accomplishes through discipline and strictpurity.The magician guards himself from “drowning” or from coming under the influenceof the water or astral elementals, through a knowledge of certain formulas, anduntil these sounds and mantrams are imparted and known, it is not safe for theman on the physical plane to attempt magical creation. These formulas are threein number: [1016]First , those which blend the two notes, add a third, and thus call intoactivity the builders of the astral plane, the Agnisuryans, in some one or otherof their grades. These are based on the initiatory sound of the Ego, anddistinguish between it and the sound of the note of the builders and lives ofthe tiny thought form already formed. The formula is chanted on a basis of thesethree notes, variation of tone and note, though not of formula, producing thetypes of forms.Second, those which are of a purely protective nature, and which, through aknowledge of the laws of sound as they are known in connection with water (orthe astral plane), place a vacuum between the magician and the waters, as wellas between him and his creation. This formula is based on the sounds connectedwith air as well, for it is through placing around himself a protecting shell ofair atoms, esoterically understood, that the magician guards himself from theapproach of the water builders.Third, those which, when sounded, produce two results: the sending forth of theperfected creation, so that it may take to itself a physical body, and next, thedispersal of the building forces, now that their work is completed.This last set of formulas is of exceeding interest, and were they not sopowerful the magician might find himself cumbered with the produce of histhought, and the prey of a vital form, and of certain “devas of the waters” whowould never leave him until they had completely drained from him all the “watersof his nature,” absorbing it into their own nature, and producing his astraldeath. The curious phenomenon would then be seen of the Ego or solar Angel beingincarnated in the mental sheath, yet separated from the physical body, owing tothe occult “drowning” of the magician. There is nothing left for the Ego to dothen but to snap the sutratma [1017] or thread, and sever all connection withthe lowest sheath. This lowest sheath then may persist for a short time,according to the strength of the animal life, but more probably death wouldimmediately ensue. ( 304 [text00028.html#Y_FN304] ) Several magicians haveperished thus.RULE IX. Condensation next ensues. The fire and waters meet, the form swells andgrows. Let the magician set his form upon the proper path.This rule is very briefly summed up in the injunction: Let desire and mind be sopure and so equally apportioned and the created form so justly balanced that itcannot be attracted towards the destructive or “left-hand” path.RULE X. As the waters bathe the form created, they are absorbed and used. Theform increases in its strength; let the magician thus continue until the worksuffices. Let the outer builders cease their labors then, and let the innerworkers enter on their cycle.One of the fundamental concepts which is grasped by all magical workers, is thatboth will and desire are force emanations . They differ in quality andvibration, but are essentially currents of energy, one forming an initial vortexor centre of activity, being centrifugal, and the other being centripetal, andthe main factor in the accretion of matter into a form around the centralvortex. This can be seen demonstrating in an interesting way in the case of theegoic lotus, where we have the will aspect forming the “jewel in the lotus,” orthe inner [1018] centre of electrical energy, and the desire or love aspectforming the egoic lotus itself, or the form which hides the centre. The analogyin all form building holds good for gods, men and atoms. The solar system is(from the higher cosmic planes), seen as a vast blue lotus, and so on down thescale; even the tiny atom of substance can be so considered. The distinctionbetween these various lotuses exists in the number and arrangement of thepetals. The solar system is literally a twelve-petalled lotus, each petal beingformed of forty-nine lesser petals. The planetary lotuses differ in each scheme,and one of the secrets of initiation is revealed when the number of the petalsofa. Our earth planet,b. Our planetary polar opposite,c. Our complementary or equilibrising planet,is committed to the initiate. Armed with this knowledge, he can then work outcertain formulas of magic which enable him to create in the three spheres. It isthe same basic concept which governs thought form building, and which enables amagician of white magic to produce objective phenomena on the physical plane. Heworks with the two types of energy, will and desire, and their equilibrising iswhat leads to the balancing of the pairs of opposites, and the subsequentrelease of energy-substance in the formation of the physical plane structure.The magician has to know the following facts:The formulas for the two aspects of logoic energy, will and desire. This isliterally apprehension of the note and formula of the Brahma or substanceaspect, and the note and formula of the Vishnu, or building aspect. One heascertains because he has mastered matter; the other is revealed to him when hehas achieved group consciousness.[1019] The formula for the particular type of energy substance which he isseeking to employ. This will have relation to that particular petal in the solarlotus from which the desired force emanates.The formula for the particular type of energy which is transmitted to him viaone or other of the three circles of petals in his own egoic lotus.The formula for the particular petal in a circle of petals with which he maychoose to work. All these concern primarily the will aspect, as far as thethought form to be produced is concerned , for the magician is the will, orpurpose, or spirit behind the objective phenomenon which he is in process ofproducing.The formula which sweeps into activity (and thus produces a form), thoseAgnisuryans who are energised by any particular aspect of solar force. Where thetwo forces are brought into contact, the form is produced, or the third energycentre appears or manifests:a. The energy of the will aspect.b. The energy of the desire or love aspect.c. The energy of the consequent thought form.There is no contradiction here to the occult teaching that Father and Mother, orSpirit and Matter, when brought into contact, produce the Son. The difficultywhich students have to surmount consists in the true interpretation of the threeterms: Mother—Matter—Moisture (or the waters).In creation, the three vibratory spheres:1. The dense physical Mother Matter, 2. The etheric Matter Holy Spirit, 3. Theastral Moisture Water,work as a unit, and in the occult teaching, during the earlier stages ofcreation, must not be separated or distinguished apart. On the path ofinvolution, if the subject may be approached from a different angle, and thus[1020] somewhat clarify, distinctions are made, and on the path of evolution, orof return, they are, as we well know, surmounted; on the middle point ofequilibrium, as on our globe, for instance, confusion ensues in the mind of thestudent owing to the occult fact that the various formulas are being employedsimultaneously, the thought-forms are at all stages of construction, and theensuing chaos is terrible.The rule which we are commenting upon may be interpreted as stating that in themagical work, the energy of the waters becomes paramount, and desire for theform and the fulfilment of its objective increases. This takes place after thewill energy has formed the central nucleus by being brought into contact withthe desire force. The magician, through desire (or strong motive), increases thevitality of the form until it is so powerful and intense in its own separatedlife that it is ready to go forth on its mission upon the physical plane. Thebuilding devas who have been impelled to construct the form out of the myriadsof elemental lives available, have completed their work, and now cease fromconstructing; this particular type of energy no longer drives the lesser livesin any specific direction, and the final cycle of work upon the astral plane isentered upon. This is summed up in the next rule.RULE XI. Three things the worker with the law must now accomplish. First,ascertain the formula which will confine the lives within the ensphering wall;next, pronounce the words which will tell them what to do and where to carrythat which has been made; and finally, to utter forth the mystic phrase whichwill save him from their work .The embodied idea has now form and shape upon the astral plane; but all is asyet in a state of flux, and the lives are only held in place through the fixedattention [1021] of the magician, working through the greater builders. He must,through knowledge of certain magical phrases, make the work more permanent andindependent and fix the place of the vitalising elements within the form, andgive them an impetus that will result in more settled concretion. Havingaccomplished that, he becomes, if it might so be expressed, an agent of Karma,and sends forth the dual thought form (clothed in mental and astral matter), tofulfil its mission, whatever that may be. Finally, he has to take steps toprotect himself from the attractive forces of his own nature, which mighteventuate in his holding the thought form so closely within the radius of hisown influence that it would be rendered useless, its own inherent energyneutralised, and its purpose negated.They might also produce such a powerful, attractive force that he would draw theform so closely to himself that he would be forced to absorb it. This can beharmlessly accomplished by the man who knows how, but results, nevertheless, ina waste of energy which is forbidden under the Law of Economy. With the majorityof men, who are oft unconscious magicians, many thought forms are malicious ordestructive, and react back upon their creators in a disastrous manner.c. Four Rules for the Physical Plane. In the magical work of form creation, wehave carried the thought form down from the mental plane where the solar Angelinitiated the work, through the astral, where the equilibrising work was done,to the physical plane, or to the etheric levels. Here the work of producingobjectivity is carried forward, and here the worker in magic is in criticaldanger of failure should he not be cognisant of the forms and mantrams by whichthe new group of builders can be reached, and the gap between the astral planeand the gaseous subplane of the physical be bridged. It might be useful here toremember that in the work of creation [1022] the white magician avails himselfof the current Ray influence. When the third, fifth and seventh rays are inpower, either coming in, at full meridian, or passing out, the work is mucheasier than when the second, sixth or fourth are dominant. At the present time,the seventh Ray, as we know, is rapidly dominating, and it is one of the easiestof the forces with which man has to work. Under this Ray it will be possible tobuild a new structure for the rapidly decaying civilisation, and to erect thenew temple desired for the religious impulse. Under its influence the work ofthe numerous unconscious magicians will be much facilitated. This will eventuatein the rapid growth of unconscious psychic phenomena, in the spread of mentalscience, and the consequent ability of thinkers to acquire and to create thosetangible benefits they desire. Nevertheless, this magic of the unconscious orselfish kind leads to karmic results of a deplorable nature, for only those whowork with the law and who control the lesser lives through knowledge, love andwill, evade the consequences entailed on those who manipulate living matter forselfish ends.The white magician utilises solar forces . As the planet passes around the sundifferent types of solar energy are contacted, and expert knowledge is requiredto utilise the influences in due time, and to have the form so constituted thatit can respond at the needed hour to the differentiated energy.He manipulates planetary force of a triple nature:a. That which is the product of his own planet, and the most easily available.b. That which emanates from the polar opposite of our planet.c. That which can be felt originating from that planet which forms, with ourearth and its opposite, the esoteric triangle.[1023] Students need here to remember that we are now dealing with ethericmatter and vital energy, and are therefore concerning ourselves with thephysical plane and all that is included in that term. They need likewise toremember that the magician (as he is working on the plane of objectivity) is ina position to use his own vital forces in the work of thought form creation, butthis is only possible and permissible when he has reached the point in evolutionwhere he is a channel for force and knows how to draw it within himself,transmute it, or combine it with the forces of his own body, and then transmitit to the thought form which he is in process of constructing. Much of interestwill open up before the thinker who extends this idea to the planetary Logos andHis work of form creating.With these few preliminary remarks, we can now continue with the Rules of Magicfor the physical plane.RULE XII. The web pulsates. It contracts and expands. Let the magician seize themidway point and thus release those “prisoners of the planet” whose note isright and justly tuned to that which must be made.It is necessary for the magician here to remember that all that takes place uponthe earth is to be found within the planetary etheric web. The worker in whitemagic, being an occultist, deals in universals, and starts his magical work onthe confines of the physical etheric sphere. His problem is to locate thoselesser lives, within the web, who are of the right order to be built into theproposed thought vehicle. Such work can necessarily only be done by the man who,through the severance of the confining web of his own etheric web, can reach outto that which is consciously recognised by him as the planetary vital body. Onlyhe who is free can control and utilise those who are prisoners . This is anoccult axiom [1024] of real moment, and much of the failure undergone bywould-be workers in magic is to be traced to the fact that they themselves arenot free. The “prisoners of the planet” are those myriads of deva lives who formthe planetary pranic body, and are swept in on the floods of vital forceemanating from the physical sun.RULE XIII. The magician must recognise the four; note in his work the shade ofviolet which they evidence, and thus construct the shadow. When this is so, theshadow clothes itself, and the four become the seven.This means literally that the magician must be in a position to discriminatebetween the different ethers, and to note the special hue of the differentlevels, thereby ensuring a balanced building of the “shadow.” He “recognises”them in the occult sense; that is, he knows their note and key, and is aware ofthe particular type of energy they embody. Enough emphasis has not been laidupon the fact that the three higher levels of the etheric planes are invibratory communication with the three higher planes of the cosmic physicalplane, and they (with their ensphering fourth level) have been called in theoccult books “the inverted Tetraktys.” It is this knowledge which puts themagician in possession of the three types of planetary force and theircombination, or the fourth type, and thus releases for him that vital energywhich will drive this idea into objectivity. As the different types of forcesmeet and coalesce, a dim shadowy form clothes itself upon the vibrating astraland mental sheath, and the idea of the solar Angel is attaining definiteconcretion.RULE XIV. The sound swells out. The hour of danger to the soul courageousdraweth near. The waters have not hurt the white creator and naught could drownnor drench him. Danger from fire and flame [1025] menaces now, and dimly yet therising smoke is seen. Let him again, after the cycle of peace, call on the solarAngel.The work of creation assumes now serious proportions, and for the final time thebody of the magician is menaced by destruction. The “shadow” having been formed,it is now ready to take to itself a “fiery” or gaseous body, and it is thesefire builders who menace the life of the magician, and this for the followingreasons.Firstly, because the fires of the human body are closely allied to the fireswith which the magician seeks to work, and should these latent fires of the bodyand the latent fires of the planet be brought into too close juxtaposition, thecreator is in danger of burning and destruction.Secondly, the Agnichaitans, being allied to the “fire devas” of the mentalplane, have much power, and can only be controlled properly by the solar AngelHimself.Thirdly, on this planet the planetary fires are not as yet dominated by solarfire, and are very easily driven into the work of destruction.The solar Angel must, therefore, now again be invoked. This means that themagician (when his “shadow” is completed, and prior to the final stages ofconcretion) must see to it that his alignment with the Ego is just andunimpeded, and the communicating currents in full play. He must literally “renewhis meditation,” and make direct contact afresh before proceeding with the work.Otherwise, the fires of his own body may get out of control, and his ethericbody suffer in consequence. He, therefore, fights fire with fire, and draws downsolar fire for his protection. This was not necessary on the astral plane. Forthe magician, the moments of the greatest danger in the work of creating are atcertain junctures on the astral plane, where he is in danger of occult drowning,and at the transition from etheric levels [1026] to the planes of tangibleconcretion, when he is menaced by “occult burning.” In the one case, he does notcall on the Ego, but stems the tide by love and the equilibrising powers of hisown nature. In the latter case, he must call in that which represents the willaspect in the three worlds, the impulsive, dynamic thinker or solar Angel. Heaccomplishes this by means of a mantram. No clue can be given to this, owing tothe powers it confers.RULE XV. The fires approach the shadow, yet burn it not. The fire sheath iscompleted. Let the magician chant the words that blend the fire and water.Little can here be said in interpretation of these words, beyond a reference tothe general sense. The gaseous sheath is created, and the hour for the formationof the sheath for the sixth subplane, the liquid, is near. The two must blend.This is the moment of the greatest danger, as far as the thought form itself isconcerned. Earlier dangers have menaced the magician. Now the form he iscreating must be protected. The nature of the danger is hinted at in the words:“Where fire and water meet apart from chanted sound, all dissipates in steam.The fire ceases to be.” This danger is hid in the karmic enmity existing betweenthe two great groups of devas. These groups can only be united by the mediator,man.It might be asked of what use the fifteen rules for magic communicated above maybe. Naught, as yet, as far as practical work is concerned, but much where innerintellectual development is desired. He who meditates and broods over theserules in the light of what has been earlier communicated anent the devas andbuilding forces, will arrive at an understanding of the Laws of Construction inthe macrocosm, which will avail him much, and save him much time when themagical work and formulas are put in his hands."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION E - MOTION ON THE PLANE OF MIND[1027] I.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKSWe have now concluded our consideration of thought forms, having viewed thewhole universe (including man) as an embodied thought, and having dealt with theability [1028] of man himself to create forms for the clothing of his ideas.We now return once more to the realm of technicalities, and to the morescientific part of our thesis. I use the word “scientific,” for that which willbe said concerns that which is proven and known to occultists, and deals withfacts . The modern fact of the modern scientist is his approximation of a part,and often an infinitesimal part, of some greater whole, and even then itconcerns only the most objective part of manifestation, for that which is theessence is not regarded as a reality at all by them as it is by the real occultknower. That which we see and can touch is but an effect of inner underlyingcauses. The occultist does not concern himself with effects, but only with theiroriginating cause. The modern scientist, therefore, is not as yet occupyinghimself with causes, and during the past only approached the realm of theseinitiatory impulses when he began to comprehend the energy aspect of matter, andto consider the nature of the atom. When he can pass more directly in histhoughts to the discussion and consideration of the etheric substratum whichunderlies the tangible, then and only then will he be entering the domain ofcauses, and even in this case, only those physical causes which underlie thegrossly objective; he will not really have ascertained the vital impulses whichproduce Being. Yet a great step will have been made for, under the Law ofAnalogy, he will then be in a position to comprehend some of the major secretsof solar manifestation; for the planes of our solar system constitute, as weknow, and as this Treatise seeks to demonstrate, the seven subplanes of thecosmic physical plane.It is apparent to all careful students of this Treatise on Fire that in thissection we are concerned with:First, that mode of activity which distinguishes the Vishnu aspect of Deity, orthe motion of the Divine Manasaputras. [1029] This involves, therefore, aconsideration of the effects of this motion:a . Within the planetary schemes, Their bodies.b. Upon the atoms or “Points” in those bodies, the human and deva Monads.Second, that impulse which is the basis of the Law of Periodicity, and whichresults in the cyclic incarnation of all Beings. This impulse manifests in threecycles or in three turns of the wheel of Being.a . The activity which produces involution, or the submergence in matter of Lifeor Spirit.b. The activity which produces the equilibrium of these two forces, matter andSpirit, or manifestation, or the processes of evolution.c . The activity which withdraws the central energy from out of the responsiveform and produces obscuration.Third, that activity which causes the interplay—attraction and consequentrepulsion—between all atoms, from the great cosmic atom, a solar system, to thetiny atom of the chemist or the physicist. This activity, therefore, may beviewed as:a. Inter-cosmic, or affecting constellations.b. Inter-planetary, or affecting the schemes.c. Inter-chain, or affecting the chains.d. Inter-globular, or producing an interchange of force between the globes ofthe chains.e. Inter-sectional, or affecting the transference of force between the fivekingdoms of nature.f. Inter-human, or relating to the interplay between the various human units.g. Inter-atomic, or the passage of force from one atom to another atom.Students need here to remember that we are concerned with the energy or activitywhich produces forms, and, [1030] therefore, with the forces which tend tocoherence, to concretion, and to the stabilisation of the work of the builders.If they but realised it, the key to much that is connected with the productionof forms, or of the Son, the second aspect, is contained in the abovetabulation, for all nature holds together, and the life of any scheme, globe,kingdom, or atom, becomes in turn the animating principle of another scheme,globe, kingdom, or atom. Everything in the solar system is in a state of flux,as is everything in the universe, and the vital energy circulates, as the bloodor the nervous energy of the body circulates, throughout the entire system. Thisis the basis of the occult fact that all in nature, for instance, will be, is,or has been, through the human kingdom. ( S. D., I, 215, 242, 295.) Under thistype of solar activity, the ultimate good is attained by the method ofinterplay, interchange, and in mutual attraction and repulsion.It would be advisable here if students would study that which was communicatedin the early part of this treatise upon motion upon the physical and astralplanes. Under the Law of Analogy, much will be noted as necessarily translatedon to the higher plane, and to be transmuted into the energy of theform-building impulse. We will consider what we have to say in this sectionunder the following heads:1. The nature of this motion . . . . spiral cycling2. The results of its activity. These results can be viewed as four subsidiarylaws or adjuncts to the major law of Attraction, and may be called:The Law of Expansion.The Law of Monadic Return.The Law of Solar Evolution.The Law of Radiation.[1031] It will, therefore, be apparent that, as we consider these laws, we aredealing with matters that concern:The process of initiation.The life of the divine pilgrims upon the upward arc.The impulse which produces the Son, and which drives Him to gain experiencethrough the medium of the solar system.Magnetism, or Divine Alchemy.3. The turning of the wheel,a. The solar wheel,b. The planetary wheel,c. The human wheel.This will involve our taking up the consideration of the orbital paths of thesevarious spheres, their centres, inter-play and intercommunication, and of forcetransference, and will bring out the concept that all spiral-cyclic activity isnot the result of the rotary action of matter itself, but of an impulseemanating from without any particular atom, and therefore extraneous to it.4. Motion, or the form-building impulse latent in:a. The mental sheath itself, both cosmically and humanly considered.b. The causal body of the macrocosm and the microcosm.c. The centres, divine and human.5. The effects of the united activity of the sheath, the centres, and the causalbody as it produces:a. Periodic manifestation.b . The linking of the triangles.c. The relation between the throat centre, the alta major centre, and the mentalcentre, macrocosmically and microcosmically considered. [1032]II. THE NATURE OF THIS MOTIONAs we well know, the nature of the motion on the plane of matter is rotary .Each atom of matter rotates on its own axis, and each larger atom, from thepurely physical standpoint, likewise does the same; a cosmic atom, a solarsystem, a planetary atom, and a human atom, man, can be seen equally rotating atdiffering degrees of velocity upon their own axis or around their own pole. Whenwe arrive at the plane of mind, and have to consider the activity of the secondaspect of divinity, that which builds and holds the forms in coherent form, andwhich is the basis of the phenomenon we call time (literally, the awareness ofthe form), a different type of force or motion becomes apparent. This type ofenergy in no way negates or renders useless the atomic rotary type, but involvesit, and yet at the same time it brings the atoms of all degrees under theinfluence of its own activity, so that in every form which is in manifestation,the two types are manifested. I would here remind the student that we areprimarily considering the force of the second aspect as it concerns the humanand superhuman kingdoms, or as the Manasaputras and their various groups areconcerned. On the involutionary arc, the Vishnu force is likewise felt, butuntil the nature of the group soul is more apprehended, and the quality of theLife who informs each of the subhuman kingdoms of nature is known with greateraccuracy, it will profit us more to deal with force as it affects the humanbeing, the planet on which he may be found, and the system in which that planetis playing its part.The activity of the second aspect has been called spiral-cyclic , which initself involves the concept of duality. This activity is the cause of all cyclicevolution, and has been called in the occult phraseology “the activity ofBrahma’s year.” It is that which brings about the [1033] periodical appearingand disappearing of all existences, great or small. It is intimately linked withthe will aspect of Divinity, and with the Lipika Lords of the highest degree andits origin is, therefore, difficult for us to comprehend. Perhaps all that canbe said about it is that it is largely due to certain impulses which (as far asour solar system is concerned) can be traced to the sun Sirius. These impulsesfind their analogy in the impulses emanating in cyclic fashion from the causalbody of man, which impulses bring about his appearance upon the plane of mayafor a temporary period. A hint may here be given to the earnest student; in thethreefold Ego (the lives who form the central bud, the lives of the petals, andthe triple group of lives who form the three permanent atoms) is seen acorrespondence to the three groups of Lipika Lords who are the karmic cause ofsolar manifestation, and who control its periodic manifestation. These threegroups are related to Their guiding Intelligences on Sirius.The Law of Periodicity is the effect produced by the amalgamation of these twotypes of force with a third. The two types of force or energy are the activityof the first Aspect, the logoic will or purpose, and the energy of the secondaspect. This purpose is hidden in foreknowledge of the Logos and is completelyhidden even from the Adept of the fifth Initiation. The Adept has achieved acomprehension of the purpose of the Son, and for Him there remains the problemto recognise the purpose of the Father. The one is the impulse behind theforward movement of all life, and the other the impulse behind its cyclicactivity, and this is called spiral-cyclic. When this blended dual force isbrought in touch with the rotary activity of matter itself, we have the tripleactivity of the Ego, for instance, which is rotary-spiral-cyclic, and that whichresults in the stimulation of the self-contained atom, in the periodicalemergence of form, and in the [1034] steady, though slow, progress towards agoal. We might, for the sake of clarity, differentiate the effects thus:1. Rotary activity The internal activity of every atom viewed as a unity, theactivity of Brahma or the Holy Spirit, perfected in the first solar system. Itis unified individual consciousness... “I am.” 2. Cyclic activity The activityof all forms, viewing them from the aspect of consciousness, and of time. It isunified group consciousness... “I am That,” the activity of Vishnu in process ofbeing perfected in this the second solar system. 3. Spiral activity Theinfluence which impresses all forms, which emanates from their greater centre,and which merges itself a little, a very little, with the two other modes ofmotion, being practically lost sight of in the stronger vibration. It is theactivity which will be perfected in the third solar system, and is the Shivaform of motion, and the unified consciousness of all groups. It is theconsciousness which proclaims “I am That I am.”One of the primary things the occult student should remember when consideringthe nature of spiral-cyclic activity, is that it has two effects.First, it is an attractive force, gathering the rotating atoms of matter intodefinite types and forms, and holding them there as long as necessity demands.Secondly, it is itself gradually dominated by another and higher vibration, andthrough its spiralling progress through matter it sweeps those formssystematically nearer and nearer to another and stronger point of energy.These effects are to be seen clearly demonstrated in man’s evolution in theapproach he makes uniformly through the cycles to the centre of thespiral-cyclic energy, [1035] and subsequently to the still more impressivepoint, that of his “Father in Heaven.” The Angel first attracts animal man;cyclically He actuates the material sheaths, thus giving them coherence, andever swings them into closer relation to himself. Later, as the momentum isincreased, the man is swung more definitely into relation with the monadicaspect, until that higher rhythm is imposed upon him. This is equally true of aplanetary Logos, and of a solar Logos.The spiral-cyclic force demonstrates, as might be expected, in seven ways; ofthese, the three major methods of demonstration are symbolised in the Rod ofInitiation of Sanat Kumara. The Rod most frequently recognised by men is that ofthe Hierophant, the Bodhisattva, which consists of the straight central serpentwith the two others entwined around it, thus picturing, among other things:a. The three outpourings,b . The three worlds,c. The spinal column and its channels,or those main factors with which the initiate concerns himself. He has tounderstand somewhat the nature of matter and what is occultly involved in thatexpression, his own triple constitution, the three worlds in which he has toplay his part, and the instrument which he has to use. This rod of theBodhisattva is surmounted by a diamond which is not as great a diamond as the“Flaming Diamond” of the first Kumara, but is of rare beauty. At the time ofinitiation when the electrical forces are tapped, this diamond revolves on itsaxis, picturing the rotary nature of atomic matter.The Rod of Sanat Kumara is far more intricate, and instead of the central Rod,or Serpent, standing on the tip of its tail, all the three serpents areinterwoven in a spiral fashion, and the Flaming Diamond which surmounts [1036]it is of such radiance that the effect is produced of a spheroidal aura, castaround the interlaced serpents, typifying the form-building nature of the Vishnuactivity.According to the initiation taken, a reflection will be seen from a part of theinterlaced serpents, and the illusion will be created that the diamond iscycling up and down between the summit, and the irradiated portion.At the same time, each serpent revolves upon itself, and likewise cycles aroundits neighbor, producing an effect of extraordinary brilliance and beauty, andtypifying rotary-spiral-cyclic force.The seven types of spiral-cyclic energy are suggestive of the nature of theplanetary Logoi which they represent, and produce, therefore, the distinctionswhich exist between men; they are accountable for the nature of cycles, and thisis a point oft overlooked. Students discuss the periods of the emergence of theRays, setting arbitrary dates, such as 2500 years, for the manifestation of anyparticular ray. One ray does pass through its cycle in that length of time, butonly one, the others being either longer or shorter. The difference has a greateffect upon the egoic cycles, and is responsible for the length of time betweenincarnations. Some Egos cycle through their incarnations and their pralayas veryrapidly; others spend untold aeons, and hence it is impossible to say that thereare even “averages” connected with the appearance of Egos on the astral plane,for instance. This fact has bearing upon the statement of H. P. B. anent theLodge effort each one hundred years. Under the particular type of cyclic forceemanating from the Lodge, the high water mark of its activity is to be foundonce in every seven cycles. All that originates on that Ray is controlled byspiral-cyclic efforts based upon the number 10 and its multiples, and findingits highest cyclic vibration, as it happens, during the last [1037] quarter ofeach century. What our more modern students are apt to forget in this connectionis that this activity is but the demonstration of one type of force out of sevenpossible and that it concerns primarily that group of adepts who are on thatparticular line of energy, and will necessarily affect greatly all disciples andpeople on a similar line. At the same time, the work it initiates is endorsed bythe Lodge as a whole, for it is part of the force emanation of the planetaryLogos. It is naturally of great importance owing to the fact that thisray-energy is that of one of the three major Rays; but it will be, in theequilibrising process, balanced by analogous cyclic emanatory activity from thetwo other major Rays.It might be added here that when this is recognised it will become apparent thatthe revolutionising scientific discoveries which can be traced down thecenturies, such as the formulation of the Law of Gravitation, the circulation ofthe blood, the ascertainment of the nature of steam, the discovery by man ofthat form of electrical phenomena which he has harnessed, and the more recentdiscovery of radium, are in their own department (that of the Mahachohan),analogous to the effort made during the last quarter of each century tostimulate the evolution of men through a further revelation of some part of theSecret Doctrine . Newton, Copernicus, Galileo, Harvey, and the Curies are, ontheir own line of force, lightbringers of equal rank with H. P. B. Allrevolutionised the thought of their time; all gave a great impulse to theability of man to interpret the laws of nature, and to understand the cosmicprocess, and only those of circumscribed vision will fail to recognise the unityof the many force impulses emanating from the one Lodge.These cycles will not coincide, for they are not all similar to the one hundredyear spiral. Some idea as to the Mahachohan’s cycle of emanatory impulses may be[1038] gathered by considering the dates of the foremost scientific discoveriessince Plato’s time; the cycles of the second ray may also be averaged by asummary of the appearances of the great Teachers down the ages.The force emanations from the Manu, or those of the first Ray, are easily tracedwhen the races are considered, and this has been done in the recognition of theraces and subraces. What is oft overlooked is that each of these rays of energydemonstrates constructively , through the form-building agencies, anddestructively through the ability of the force to destroy prior to building.Thus the cycles can be viewed from two angles.It is at this point that students in one branch of our theosophical movementmust recognise the fact that just as H. P. B. came forth on a cyclic tide ofenergy to destroy the limiting forms to be found in the world of science andreligion, so his work must fit in with other force emanations, such as theconstructive work of the second ray in conjunction with the energy of theseventh at this time.When students learn to blend the one hundred year cycles of the first type ofenergy with the equally powerful impulses from the second Ray and the third, weshall then have a cessation of many controversies. No great impulse will comefrom the Lodge along the line of the first Ray of Will or Power till the closeof a century. One such impulse along another line of force came when thediscovery of the nature of the atom was arrived at through the study ofelectricity, and of radioactive substances, and an impulse from the secondaspect is imminent. It is not safe for students with limited vision to dogmatiseanent this question of cycles. Apart from the cyclic impulses continuously goingforth, overlapping and superseding, and intermingling with each other, there aremany which we might call lesser impulses (and the cycle of one hundred years towhich H. P. B. refers [1039] is but one of the lesser impulses. There is a onethousand year cycle of greater moment). There are vaster cycles, of 2500 years,of 7,000 years, of 9,000 years, of 15,000 years, and many others which onlyadvanced initiates know of or can follow; these can break in upon any of thelesser impulses, and can be seen appearing, unexpectedly, as far as averageman’s knowledge is concerned, and yet they are but the returning impulses set incyclic motion perhaps thousands of years ago.H. P. B. is right in his affirmation as far as the impulse of the first ray isconcerned; but his followers are not right, in so far as they overlook andnegate the six other types of impulses, of equal or of more importance, whichmay emanate cyclically from the Lodge, and which will meet with response fromthose who vibrate to that particular type of energy.III. RESULTS OF ITS ACTIVITY.These results can be studied in four ways, considering each as a subsidiary Lawof the basic Law of Attraction and Repulsion. All motion is the result literallyof the impact, or intercourse, between atoms, and there is no atom anywherewhich escapes this force. In the case of rotary motion, which governs theactivity of the atom of substance, the impulse emanates from within thering-pass-not, and is produced by the impact of the positive charge upon thenegative charges. This is true of all atoms, cosmic, solar, individual,chemical, and so forth.When, however, the effect of the rotation of the atom is so strong that itbegins to affect other atoms outside its individual ring-pass-not, anotherinfluence begins to make itself felt, which draws together, or dissipates, thosecontacting coalescing atoms. Thus forms are built under the impulse ofaggregated forces of some one kind, and these forms in turn produce effects onother cohering atomic forms, until the rhythm is built up, and a vibration[1040] instigated which is a continuation of the rotary motion of the individualatoms, and the modification produced on them by their group activity. Thiscauses progression and simultaneous rotation. The movement forward is modifiedconsiderably by the internal atomic activity, and this it is which causes thatmotion we call spiral cyclic. It demonstrates in all forms as a tendency torepeat, owing to the backward pull of the rotating atoms, and yet is offset bythe strong progressive impulse of the form activity. Students can work this outin connection with:The planetary Logos , as He manifests through the rounds, each one of which, inits earlier stages, recapitulates all that has previously occurred.Man, in the ante-natal period, in which he runs through the various stages ofdevelopment.Spiritual man, as he creates that which will destroy the “Dweller on theThreshold.”This spiral-cyclic activity, which is distinctive of all forms, can perhaps becomprehended more practically if we study it as an expression of four laws,taking each one briefly in turn:1. The Law of Expansion .This law of a gradual evolutionary expansion of the consciousness indwellingevery form is the cause of the spheroidal form of every life in the entire solarsystem. It is a fact in nature that all that is in existence dwells within asphere. ( 306 [text00028.html#Y_FN306] ) The chemical atom is spheroidal; man[1041] dwells within a sphere, as does the planetary Logos and the solar Logos,this sphere being the form matter takes when its own internal activity, and theactivity of the form are working in unison. It requires the two types offorce—rotary and spiral-cyclic—to produce this. Scientists are beginning torecognise this more or less, and to realise that it is the Law of Relativity, orthe relation between all atoms, which produces that which is called Light, andwhich, in its aggregated phenomena, forms that composite sphere, a solar system.The motion of the constellations external to the solar sphere is responsible forits form in conjunction with its own rotary motion in space. As the wave lengthsof the light from the constellations, and their relation to the sun are betterunderstood, and as the effect of those wave lengths or light vibrations (whichare either attractive to, or repulsive to, the sun) are understood, much will berevealed. Little has as yet been grasped as to the effect [1042] thoseconstellations in the heavens (which are antagonistic to the solar system), haveupon it, and whose wave lengths it will not transmit, whose rays of light do notpierce (if it might be expressed in so unscientific a manner) through the solarperiphery.We are told in the Secret Doctrine that “the seven solar Rays dilate to sevensuns and set fire to the whole cosmos.” (S. D., II, 72.) This it is whichproduces that final burning which ushers in the great pralaya, and brings to anend the logoic incarnation. It is produced under this Law of Expansion, andcauses that eventual merging and blending of the seven sacred planetary schemeswhich marks the achievement of the goal, and their eventual perfection.In occult literature this term “Law of Expansion” is limited to the discussionof the seven Rays, and to the subject of the planetary initiations. When dealingwith the expansions of consciousness of the human being, and his initiations, wegroup them under the second “Law of Monadic Return.”Students should here remember that we are dealing with the expansions ofconsciousness of a planetary Logos through the medium of:a . The chains.b . The rounds.c. The kingdoms of nature.d. The root races.It should be remembered that the consciousness He is in process of developing isthat of the absolute will and purpose of the solar Logos, as it is theexpression of the desire of the cosmic Logos.( 308 [text00028.html#Y_FN308] )Therefore, the expansions might be grouped as follows: [1043]1. The solar Logos expands His consciousness to include the desire of the cosmicLogos.2. The planetary Logos expands His consciousness to measure up to the will andpurpose of the Solar Logos.3. The Lords of the Chains are working at the desire consciousness (the lovenature) of the planetary Logos.4. The informing Lives of the globe in the chain are working at the intelligentconsciousness of the planetary Logos.This can be worked out in connection with a globe in a chain (such as ourearth-chain) in the following manner.The Lord of the world, the planetary Logos, in physical incarnation, works atHis own peculiar problem, the bringing through (into physical manifestation uponthe planet) of the purpose or will of the solar Logos in any particular scheme.This He does through meditation.The totality of Dhyan Chohans of the fifth or spiritual kingdom are occupiedwith the working out into active manifestation of the will and purpose of theplanetary Logos.The human family, or the fourth kingdom, is seeking to make manifest the desire,or love nature, of the planetary Logos.The three subhuman kingdoms have for objective the [1044] manifesting of theintelligent nature of the planetary Logos.All this done under the Law of Expansion, by the method of spirallingprogression, cyclic growth, rotary repetition, and the summation of each greaterspiral is the expansion of the consciousness into that of the sphere whichenclosed the lesser ovoid, and the escape of the life imprisoned in the sphere.It is merged in its greater whole. As the fires of the sphere concerned blazeup, the “fire by friction” which produces rotary motion, and “solar fire,” whichis the basis of the spiral-cyclic activity, blend and merge. The ring-pass-notof the confining spheroidal wall is negated, and a blaze results.The old Commentary expressed this as follows in connection with the planets, andit is equally, though relatively, true, of the atom of substance, or the solaratom:1. “The life pulsates, and the pole performs its function. The sphere revolvesin many cycles. As it revolves it senses other spheres, and seeks to know theirsecret.2. They meet each other. They seek a greater intimacy or reject with hatred anymore approach. Some pass away; others return and marry. They know each other.They spiral through their courses hand in hand. Through union the fires blazeup, the two become the one, and live again in their Son, who is the Third.”Through the study of these significant words students may learn somewhatconcerning “polar affinity,” the “Marriage in the Heavens,” the transference ofthe germs of life from the male attractive planet to the negative and receptiveone, and finally, at a later period, the absorption of the life of the twoplanets by a third planet, who is called occultly “the Son.” This refers to thesynthesising planet which forms the apex of the solar triangle.In summing up the effect of the union of individual atomic rotary motion and thespiral cyclic activity of all [1045] atomic groups, it is necessary to pointout, therefore, that the following units are affected.The essential individual atom. Its evolutionary progress towardsself-determination is brought about by the effect of its group activity, or themotion of the form modifying its own inherent action.The atomic form , likewise an atomic unit, rotating on its own axis andinfluenced and driven towards the centre of force of a higher macrocosm by theactivity of its embracing kingdom.The human atom, self-determined and individual, yet driven progressively forwardby the influence of its group, or the potent activity of the Heavenly Man inWhose body it is the cell.The planetary atom , equally self-determined, a composite of all planetarygroups, rotating on its own axis, yet conforming to the cyclic-spirallingaction, induced by the activity of the greater sphere in which it finds itsplace.The solar Atom , also an individualised Life, the Son in incarnation, throughthe medium of the Sun, pursuing its own inherent cycle, yet spiralling in cyclicfashion through the heavens, and therefore, progressing through the effect ofthe extra-cosmic active Lives who either attract or repulse it.These are the main sets of atomic groups, but there are many intermediate formsupon which it is not possible as yet to touch. All in nature affects that whichit contacts, and these effects work either asa. Attractive or repulsive impulses.b. Retarding or accelerating impulses.c . Destructive or constructive impulses.d. Devitalising or stimulating impulses.e. Energising or disintegrating impulses.Yet all can be expressed in terms of negative and positive [1046] force,manifesting as rotary or spiral activity. The lesser cycle can, from certainangles of vision, be regarded as appertaining to the rotary activity of certainatomic forms, and the greater cycles, which are so much more difficult for manto follow, as relating to the spiral action of the enclosing Life of the greatersphere. Every atom is part of a greater whole, even the solar atom is not aseparated Life but a fragment of an immensity of Existence beyond the ken ofman, and which is but dimly cognised by the most advanced Dhyan Chohan.2. The Law of Monadic Return .Here it is possible to study the Monad from the cyclic and energetic standpoint,and divorce our minds temporarily from that aspect of manifestation we call thehuman, or man.In considering the “Divine Pilgrim” we can study him as demonstrating in theform of:a. Three focal points of energy or force.b. Three fires, each producing a definite effect, and each in turn producingeffects upon each other.In relation to a solar system, these three fires on the cosmic planes arecalled: ( 309 [text00028.html#Y_FN309] ) [1047]1. The central spiritual sun (essential).2. The sun (subjective), called ‘the heart of the sun.’3. The physical sun (objective).and the same thought can be carried through the monadic manifestation. The threemonadic centres are distinguished by different types of energy:1. Monadic—dynamic energy electric impulse pure fire. 2. Egoic—magnetic energyradiatory impulse solar fire. 3. Personal—individual energy rotary impulse fireby friction.The first produces light, the second heat, and the third moisture or concretion.By the interplay of the three types of force which constitute the three monadicaspects, a rhythm is set up which eventuates in the formation of:A ring-pass-not , or ovoidal sphere, wherein the pilgrim is confined, and whichcontains within itself three major centres of force, corresponding toa. The three major logoic centres when the subjective or force side of existenceis contemplated.b . The three permanent atoms if the purely objective side is in question.A cyclic pulsation , which is the cause of every evolutionary impulse.[1048] These evolutionary impulses may be regarded as three in number for asolar system, or for a Monad:There is the impulse which drives every atom to self-determination, and is thesecret of the phenomenon called individualisation. It is largely the forcecalled Brahma.There is the impulse which forces the individual atom towards groupdetermination, and is the secret of the phenomenon termed “Initiation,” or theprocess of passing out of the human or self-determined individualised Life intothe higher kingdom. It is the sum total of the force of Vishnu, the secondaspect, and produces the higher states of consciousness.There is finally the impulse which forces the planetary groups, the sum total ofall atoms and forms, to a conscious realisation of the nature of theall-enclosing group, the solar atom.The Monad, acted upon by the Heavenly Man, intelligently forms hisring-pass-not. There his work ceases from the purely monadic standpoint; theinherent life of the atomic matter thus constituted produces the laterphenomena. The rotary life of the atoms, and their interplay, modified by theLife of the planetary group, or Heavenly Man, pursued through long aeons, causesthe phenomena of the various involutionary stages up to the point where certainof the atoms have evolved to the consciousness of animal-man. All through thisinconceivable period (that is, in connection with our earth sphere) themilliards of atomic lives have pursued their courses, energised by the Life ofthe Monad, as it pulsates through the medium of the monadic heart on thespiritual plane; and equally they have responded to the larger rhythm of theHeavenly Man. This it is which has produced graded concretion, and broughtanimal-man to the stage where the upward pull of the Monad itself began to befelt. At the same time, the Monad on its [1049] own plane began to respond tothe self-engendered energy of the lower form, the two rhythms contacted,individualisation occurred and the pilgrim manifested in his true nature.Then—as far as concerns the Monad—progressive life forward begins. It is trulycyclic, repetitive and spiralling. At first the action, or the interplay betweenthe rotary lower atomic form, and the influence of the Monad, is lethargic, slowand heavy, and the form retards the action of the Monad, and its heavy vibrationtends to offset the higher. Gradually, as the sweeping spirals play their part,the higher vibration makes itself felt, and the activity, or motion, is morebalanced, but lighter. Thus the cycles run until the higher rhythm or vibrationis so dominant that the influence of the form is negated, and leads to itseventual discarding. Simultaneously with this, the highest rhythm of all makesitself felt, leading to increased activity upon the highest planes, andproducing in time a negation of the sheath life of the Ego. As the oldCommentary again says:“The drops of moisture grow heavier. They break as rain upon the lowest plane.They sink into the clay and cause it to blossom. Thus do the waters cover theearth and all the cycles.Two are the objectives of the fathering drops, and each attained in vastlyseparated cycles; one is to sink and lose itself in the dark soil of earth; theother to rise and merge itself in the clear air of heaven.Between the two vast periods the heat doth play its part.But when the heat grows fierce, and the fires within the earth and beneath thewaters burn hot and flow, the nature of the many drops is seen to undergo achange. They dissipate in steam. Thus doth the heat perform its part.Later again the fire electric flashes forth, and turns the steam to that whichwill permit its passage through the air.”We will now sum up briefly the various vibratory impulses which have a definiteeffect upon the Monad, and which must be borne in mind as we consider theevolution [1050] of the Divine Pilgrim. It is not the purpose of this Treatiseto enlarge upon each distinctive impulse. It but seeks to indicate, leaving tolater individual students the expansion of the imparted ideas.1. Three impulses inherent in the three periodical vehicles, as H. P. B. termsthe three main centres of energy through which the Monad manifests:a. The energy of the monadic ring-pass-not, viewing it as a unit.b. The energy of the causal body, within the monadic periphery.c. The energy of the physical body, the synthesis upon the physical plane of theforce pouring through into manifestation through the three permanent atoms.2. The activity set up in the seven etheric centres of force, the result of theactivity of the seven principles:a. The head centre—esoteric seven with an exoteric three.b. The throat centre.c. The heart centre—an esoteric three and exoteric seven.d. The solar plexus—an esoteric three and exoteric four.e. The organs of generation—an esoteric two.f. The base of the spine—an esoteric unity.3. The inherent activity of every atom in every sheath, which produces therhythm of the sheath.4. The unified activity of every sheath or form which the divine Pilgrim uses.5. The united active motion produced by the unification of the three vehicles,the seven sheaths, the force centres, and the atomic substance.6. The effect produced by the action of the groups karmically allied with thePilgrim. They are: [1051]a . His Ray vibration, his monadic group.b . His subray vibration, or the vibration of the egoic group.c . His personality affiliations, such as his family, racial, and nationalenergy. All of these play upon the sensitive atoms in the various bodies andproduce specific effects.7. The activity or motion initiated and stimulated by the life of any of thethree lower kingdoms in nature,—all of which produce definite results.8. The vibration of the particular planet upon which the monad may be seekingexpression and experience.9. The effect produced in the substance of the sheaths by the influences, orvibrations, of the various planets. This, esoterically understood, is theinfluence of some one or other of the solar centres, as the forces emanatingfrom them play upon the planetary centres and thereby affect the involvedmonadic units. This is hidden in the karma of the Heavenly Man, and when trueesoteric astrology comes into being then more anent this will be given out.Astrology as now studied and taught misleads more than it helps, andastrological students are as yet learning but the a-b-c of this stupendoussubject, and are occupied with the exoteric fringes of that great veil which hasbeen wisely thrown over all planetary lore.10. Another form of energy which must ever be considered is that of theplanetary Logos, as He pours His force through some one chain or some one globeupon the groups of evolving human units. This—from the human standpoint—cannotas yet be calculated, as it is dependent upon the occult “turning of theattention” by the planetary Logos in meditation upon any centre in His bodycorporate. It is, of course, all under cosmic law, but beyond the realisation ofman. It involves cognisance [1052] of the planetary individual purpose, which isnot revealed until the later initiations.11. The inherent energy of the solar atom itself has likewise a rhythmic effectupon the individual Monad, and though it only reaches the monad via the greatercentres of Existence yet it has its effect upon one and all. This is anotherfactor not sufficiently recognised.12. Finally, the energy of the greater life (in which our solar system but formsa part) has to be reckoned with, and the impulses emanating from the cosmicLogos, the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID reach the monadic lives and producestimulation or retardation according to the nature of the cosmic ideation. Theseare necessarily entirely outside the ken of average man and are only touchedupon as no tabulation would be complete without them.13. There is also to be borne in mind the play of energy which emanates from anyone of those “Twelve signs of the Zodiac” with which astrology concerns itself.This type of force is primarily concerned with planetary stimulation, with theplanetary Logoi, and is hidden in Their cyclic karma,—a karma which of coursewill incidentally involve those monads and devas which form Their bodies andcentres.14. We must not ignore the three great waves of energy which sweep cyclicallythrough the entire solar system from:a. The seven stars of the Great Bear. The strength of these vibrations dependsupon the closeness of the connection and the accuracy of the alignment betweenany particular Heavenly Man and His Prototype. The mystery here is profound; itis connected with the stage in evolution of the “imperfect gods” and theobjective of the planetary deities. [1053]b. The Seven Sisters, or the Pleiades, and from that one in particular who isoccultly termed “the wife” of the planetary Logos whose scheme will eventuallyreceive the seeds of life from our planet, which is not considered a sacredplanet, as has before been stated.c. The sun Sirius.There are other streams of energetic force which have an effect upon the Pilgrimeverywhere, but the above enumeration will serve to show the complexity of thesubject and the vastness of the scheme of evolution. All these vibratoryemanations pass through the sphere cyclically; they come and go, and accordingto their presence or their non presence and according to the stage of evolutionof the emanating Existence will depend the phenomenal character of all life,will depend the nature of any specific period, and the quality of themanifesting Monads. It is the appearance or the disappearance of these waves oflife-force (planetary, inter-planetary, systemic, cosmic and inter-cosmic) whichsweeps into incarnation the divine pilgrims, and which brings about the cyclicmanifestation of such great Lives as the “Silent Watcher” and the “GreatSacrifice”; it is this which causes also the dissolution of a scheme, and itsreappearance, and is responsible for the transportation of the life seeds fromone scheme to another, or from one solar system to another.In this great tide of forces, the Monads are swept along; their aggregate istermed the “force of evolution,” and the life and persistence of the initiatoryBeing sets the term for their duration. Man is but the plaything of the forceswhich gather him up and carry him on, just as the atom, in the human frame isbut the obedient servant of the man’s imposing direction; yet within limits manis the controller of his destiny; within [1054] limits he wields forces andenergies, he manipulates lesser lives and controls lesser centres of energy, andas time slips away his radius of control becomes ever more extensive.The atom controls its own central life; man can control the sets of lives whoform his three bodies; the initiate and the adept are controlling energies ofmany kinds in the three worlds, as the Chohan does on the five planes ofevolution. Thus the plan is carried forward until the Army of the Voice becomethemselves the Sounder of the Words, and the Sounders of the Words become theWord itself.It will, therefore, be apparent, that the “Law of Monadic Return” which we havejust been considering, is the sumtotal of those influences which have a directbearing upon the monadic atoms, which affect its progress cyclically, and whichstimulate it, or retard its activity according to the strength of the initiatinglife. It is only after initiation that the human atom reaches a stage in itsdevelopment where forces and influences begin to be comprehended. When themethods are understood whereby adjustment is consciously made to extraneousforce currents, resistance to retarding forces is initiated consciously and withscientific accuracy, and the man consciously puts himself into line with forceswhich will swing him along on the path of return. There is in this thought noundue complexity or cause for discouragement, for ever the potent force ofelectrical energy will offset the more lethargic vibration of solar fire, andsolar fire itself in due time will negate the effects of “fire by friction.”3. The Law of Solar Evolution.It is, of course, a truism to state that the Law of Solar Evolution is thesum-total of all the lesser activities. [1055] We might consider this point inconnection with the planetary atom, and the solar atom.The planetary atom has, as all else in nature, three main activities:First. It rotates upon its own axis, revolves cyclically within its ownring-pass-not, and thus displays its own inherent energy. What is meant by thisphrase? Surely that the milliards of atoms which compose the planetary body(whether dense or subtle) pursue an orbital course around the central energeticpositive unit. This dynamic force centre must be considered as subsistingnaturally in two locations (if such an unsuitable term is permissible) accordingto the stage, usage, and particular type of the indwelling planetary entity.a. In what corresponds to the head centre in man, if the planetary Logos is ofvery advanced development.b. In the planetary correspondence to the heart centre.The throat centre is, of course, ever vibrant in all the Logoi, as all are fullyintelligent Creators, having perfected this capacity in an earlier solar system.Students should here bear in mind that these centres of force are to be founddepicted in the central Triangles upon the chart on page 373, though noindication is to be found through a study of such triangles as to the relativeattainment of the planetary Logos. Within the chains likewise, will be foundcorresponding centres of energy, and also within the dense physical body of theLogos of any scheme, the physical planet.One such centre is to be found at the North Pole, and two more are locatedwithin the planetary sphere, and frequently the inflow of force or energy tothese internal centres (via the polar centre) results in those disasters we callearthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.There is, as we know, a cyclic shifting of polar inclination, [1056] due to thegradually increasing responsiveness of the planetary Logos to His heavenlyPrototype, whereby influences from the Great Bear draw, or occultly “attract,”the attention of the Logos, and bring Him more into line with a greaterimpulsive Will. This shifting causes disruption in His lower manifestation,which is a condition on the cosmic Path of Initiation analogous to thatundergone by a disciple.The planetary atom revolves upon its axis and comes periodically underinfluences which produce definite effects. These influences are, among others,those of the moon, and of the two planets which lie nearest to it on eitherside—nearer and farther away from the Sun. The moon’s influence is exceedinglystrong, and has a curious resemblance (as far as the physical planet isconcerned) to the “Dweller on the Threshold,” which has such a familiar andpotent effect upon the human atom. The resemblance must not be strained, for itshould be borne in mind that the moon has no effect upon the Heavenly ManHimself, as His stage of evolution negates such a thing, but that the influencefelt is by the planetary Entity the sumtotal of the elemental essences of theplanet. Scientific occult students will learn much anent the planetary schemewhen they consider the influence of the moon’s karmic pull upon the earth,coupled with the effect of the two neighboring planets, occultly understood.Second, the planetary atom also revolves orbitally around its solar centre. Thisis its expression of rotary-spiral-cyclic action, and its recognition of thedivine central magnet. This brings it under the constant impression of otherschemes, each of which produces effects upon the planet. It likewise brings itunder the inflowing streams of energy from what are termed the zodiacalconstellations which reach the planetary scheme via the great centre, the Sun.It will be apparent to any student [1057] who has even slightly developed thepower of visualisation, and has some realisation of the force currents of thesolar system, that all can be regarded as the swirling tide of interminglingcurrents, with numerous focal points of energy demonstrating here and there, yetin no way static as to location.The third activity of the planetary atom is that which carries it through spacealong with the entire solar system, and which embodies its “drift” orinclination towards the systemic orbit in the heavens.The solar atom must be considered as pursuing analogous lines of activity and asparalleling on a vast scale the evolution of the planetary atom. The entiresolar sphere, the logoic ring-pass-not, rotates upon its axis, and thus all thatis included within the sphere is carried in a circular manner through theHeavens. The exact figures of the cycle which covers the vast rotation mustremain as yet esoteric, but it may be stated that it approximates one hundredthousand years, being, as might be supposed, controlled by the energy of thefirst aspect, and therefore of the first Ray. This of itself is sufficient toaccount for varying and diverse influences which may be traced over vast periodsby those with the “seeing eye,” for it causes a turning of varying parts of thesphere to the differing zodiacal constellations. This influence (in connectionwith the planets) is increased or mitigated according to the place of theplanets on their various orbital paths. Hence the immense complexity of thematter and the impossibility for the average astronomical and astrologicalstudent to make accurate computations or to draw accurate horoscopes. Within theHall of Wisdom, there exists a department of which the modern varyingastrological organisations are but the dim and uncertain reflections. The Adeptsconnected with it work not with humanity but concern Themselves specificallywith “casting the horoscopes” (thus [1058] ascertaining the nature of the workimmediately to be done) of the various great lives who inform the globes andkingdoms of nature, with ascertaining the nature of the karmic influencesworking out in the manifestation of three of the planetary Logoi:1. Our own planetary Logos.2. The planetary Logos of our polar opposite.3. The planetary Logos of the scheme which makes with the two above mentioned aplanetary triangle.Beyond that, They may not go. They progress these various horoscopes for thenext stated cycle, and Their records are of profound and significant interest. Iwould conjure students here to refrain from attempting (in years to come) toform cyclic computations of any kind, for as yet the many constellations whichexist only in physical matter of an etheric nature are unknown and unseen. Yetthey are potent in influence and until etheric vision is developed, allcalculations will be full of error. It suffices for man as yet to master his owndharma, to fulfil group karma, and to dominate what is called “his stars.”Like the planetary atom, the solar atom not only rotates on its axis butlikewise spirals in a cyclic fashion through the Heavens. This is a differentactivity to the drift or progressive dynamic motion through the Heavens. Itdeals with the revolution of our Sun around a central point and with itsrelation to the three constellations so oft referred to in this Treatise:The Great Bear.The Pleiades.The Sun Sirius.These three groups of solar bodies are of paramount influence where the spiralcyclic activity of our system is concerned. Just as in the human atom the spiralcyclic [1059] activity is egoic and controlled from the egoic body, so inconnection with the solar system these three groups are related to the logoicSpiritual Triad, atma-buddhi-manas, and their influence is dominant inconnection with solar incarnation, with solar evolution, and with solarprogress.Further, it must be added that the third type of motion to which our system issubjected, that of progress onward, is the result of the united activity of theseven constellations (our solar system forming one of the seven) which form theseven centres of the cosmic Logos. This united activity produces a uniform andsteady push (if it might so be expressed) toward a point in the heavens unknownas yet to even the planetary Logoi.The confines of the Heavens Themselves are illimitable and utterly unknown.Naught but the wildest speculation is possible to the tiny finite minds of menand it profits us not to consider the question. Go out on some clear starlitnight and seek to realise that in the many thousands of suns and constellationsvisible to the unaided eye of man, and in the tens of millions which the moderntelescope reveals there is seen the physical manifestation of as many millionsof intelligent existences; this infers that what is visible is simply thoseexistences who are in incarnation. But only one-seventh of the possibleappearances are incarnating. Six-sevenths are out of incarnation, waiting theirturn to manifest, and holding back from incarnation until, in the turning of thegreat wheel, suitable and better conditions may eventuate.Realise further that the bodies of all these sentient intelligent cosmic, solarand planetary Logoi are constituted of living sentient beings, and the brainreels, and the mind draws back in dismay before such a staggering concept. Yetso it is, and so all moves forward to some unfathomable and magnificentconsummation which will only in part begin to be visioned by us when ourconsciousness [1060] has expanded beyond the cosmic physical plane, and beyondthe cosmic astral until it can “conceive and think” upon the cosmic mentalplane. That supposes a realisation beyond that of the Buddhas who have theconsciousness of the cosmic physical plane, and beyond that of the planetaryLogoi. It is the consciousness and knowledge of a solar Logos.To the occult student, who has developed the power of the inner vision, thevault of Heaven can therefore be seen as a blazing fire of light, and the starsas focal points of flame from which radiate streams of dynamic energy. Darknessis light to the illumined Seer, and the secret of the Heavens can be read andexpressed in terms of force currents, energy centres, and dynamic fiery systemicperipheries.4. The Law of Radiation.It will be found that more time will be given to this expression of divineactivity than to any other in this section, as it is the one of the mostpractical utility. This Law of Radiation is one that is beginning to berecognised by scientists since their acceptation of the radioactivity of certainsubstances, and when they are willing to approximate the occult conception ofthe radiatory, or emanatory condition, of all substances at a specific point inevolution, then they will very definitely approach Reality.Radiation is the outer effect produced by all forms in all kingdoms when theirinternal activity has reached such a stage of vibratory activity that theconfining walls of the form no longer form a prison, but permit of the escape ofthe subjective essence. It marks a specific point of attainment in theevolutionary process, and this is equally true of the atom of substance withwhich the chemist and physicist deal, when working with the elements, as it isof the forms in the vegetable kingdom, the [1061] forms in the animal kingdom,in the human, and, likewise, in the divine.From some angles of vision, it might be regarded as the “true form” (which is tobe understood occultly as the etheric form of energy) making its presence feltin such a way that it becomes apparent even to the scientist. Students shouldhere remember two things:First, that in all occult conclusions, it is the body of energy which is dealtwith and the subjective life back of the form which is recognised as being ofsupreme importance.Second, that the dense objective manifestation, as has been reiteratedfrequently, is not regarded as a principle at all; the occultist deals withprinciples alone.It might be of value here to remind the student also that three things have tobe recognised in all manifestation:First, that the tangible objective exterior, negative, receptive, and occultlyunorganised, is without form and usefulness apart from the inner energy.Second, that the “true form” or the force-vehicle energises and produces thecohesion of that which is unorganised.Third, that the “volatile essence,” or the spiritual essential Life, focusesitself in some one point within the “true form.” ( 310 [text00028.html#Y_FN310])[1062] In studying the subject of radiatory activity, we are dealing with theeffect produced by the inner essence as it makes its presence felt through theform, when the form has been brought to a stage of such refinement that itbecomes possible.When this realisation is applied to all the forms in all the kingdoms, it willbe found possible to bridge the gaps existing between the different forms oflife, and the “elements” in every kingdom, and those unifying radiating centreswill be found. The word “element” is yet confined to the basic substances inwhat is called essential matter, and the chemist and physicist are busy withsuch lives; but their correspondence (in the occult sense of the term) is to befound in every kingdom in nature, and there are forms of life in the vegetablekingdom which are occultly regarded as “radioactive,” the eucalyptus tree beingone such form. There are forms of animal life equally at an analogous stage andthe human unit (as it approaches “liberation”) demonstrates a similarphenomenon.Again, as a planetary scheme nears its consummation, it becomes “radioactive,”and through radiation transfers its essence to another “absorbent planet,” orplanets, as is the case with a solar system also. Its essence, or true Life, isabsorbed by a receiving constellation, and the outer “case” returns to itsoriginal unorganised condition.[1063] Under our consideration of the law of radiation, we will first of alltake up the topic of the cause of radiation.a. The Cause of Radiation. The student will only be able to get a true view ofthis matter if he views the subject in a large way. Two aspects of the matternaturally come before his mental vision, both of which must be dealt with if anyadequate concept of this subject is to be reached,—a subject which has engrossedphilosophers, scientists and alchemists for hundreds of years consciously orunconsciously. We must, therefore, consider:a. That which radiates.b. That which is the subjective cause of radiation.It might be very briefly stated that when any form becomes radioactive, certainconditions have been fulfilled and certain results brought about, whichconditions and results might be summed up as follows:The radioactive form is one which has run through its appointed cycles, throughits wheel of life, great or small, which has been turned with adequatefrequency, so that the volatile life-essence is ready to escape from that formand merge itself in the greater form of which the lesser is but a part. It mustbe remembered in this connection that radiation occurs when the etheric or trueform becomes responsive to certain types of force. Radiation, as it is occultlyunderstood, does not concern itself with the escape from the physical or denseform, but with that period in the life of any living entity (atomic, human ordivine) wherein the etheric or pranic body is in such a state that it can nolonger limit or confine the indwelling life.Radiation comes about when the internal, self-sufficient life of any atom isoffset by a stronger urge, or pull, emanating from the enveloping greaterexistence of whose body it may form a part. This is nevertheless only true whenit is caused by the pull upon the essential [1064] life by the essential life ofthe greater form ; it is not due to the attractive power of the form aspect ofthat greater life. A very definite distinction must here be made. It is thefailure to recognise this that has led so many alchemical students andscientific investigators to lose their way, and thus negate the conclusions ofyears of study. They confuse the impulse of the atom to respond to the vibratorymagnetic pull of the more powerful and comprehensive form with the true esotericattraction which alone produces “occult radiation,”—that of the centralessential life of the form in which the element under consideration may haveplace. It is very necessary to make this clear from the start. Perhaps the wholesubject may be clearer if we consider it in the following way.The atom in a form revolves upon its own axis, follows its own revolution, andlives its own internal life. This concerns its primary awareness. As timeprogresses it becomes magnetically aware of the attractive nature of that whichenvelops it on all sides, and becomes conscious of the form which surrounds it.This is its secondary awareness but it still concerns what we might, for lack ofa better term, call matter. The atom, therefore, has an interplay with otheratoms.Later, the atom in a form becomes aware that it not only revolves upon its axis,but that it also follows an orbit around a greater centre of force within agreater form. This is tertiary awareness, and is caused by the magnetic pull ofthe greater centre being felt, thus causing an urge within the atom which impelsit to move within certain specific cycles. This awareness, esotericallyunderstood, concerns itself with substance or with the true form within theobjective form.Finally, the attractive pull of the greater centre becomes so powerful that thepositive life within the atom (whatever type of atom it may be and in whateverkingdom) feels the force of the central energy which holds it, [1065] along withother atoms, coherently fulfilling their function. This energy penetratesthrough the ring-pass-not, evokes no response from what might be called theelectronic or negative lives within the atomic periphery, but does evoke aresponse from the essential, positive nucleus of the atom. This is due to thefact that the essential life of any atom, its highest positive aspect, is everof the same nature as that of the greater life which is drawing it to itself.When this is felt sufficiently strongly, the atomic cycle is completed, thedense form is dispelled, the true form is dissipated, and the central lifeescapes to find its greater magnetic focal point.Through this process (which is found throughout the solar system in all itsdepartments) every atom in turn becomes an electron. The positive life of anyatom in due course of evolution becomes negative to a greater life toward whichit is impelled or drawn, and thus the process of evolution carries every lifeinvariably through the four stages enumerated above. Within the three lowerkingdoms of nature, the process is undergone unconsciously, according to thehuman connotation of that term; it is consciously passed through in the humankingdom, and in the higher spheres of existence, with an envelopingconsciousness which can only be hinted at in the ambiguous term “self-consciousgroup realisation.”It was in connection with this transmutative process that the alchemists of oldoccupied themselves, but seldom did they reach the stage wherein it was possiblefor them to concern themselves with the response of the two types of positiveenergy to each other, and with the consequent escape of a lesser positive forceto its greater attractive centre. When they did (with a few exceptions) theywere brought up against a dead wall, for though they had succeeded in locatingthe radiating principle in substance, or in the true form, and had managed topierce through (or to negate) both the dense physical [1066] body and theetheric form, yet they had no perception of the nature of the central forcewhich was drawing the life they were concerned with out of its apparentlylegitimate sphere into a new realm of activity. Some few did possess thisknowledge but (realising the danger of their conclusions) refused to put inwriting the result of their investigations.If students will study the laws of transmutation, ( 311 [text00028.html#Y_FN311]) as already apprehended, and above all, as incorporated in the writings ofHermes Trismegistus, bearing this in mind, some interesting results might bebrought about. Let them remember that that which “seeks liberty” is the centralelectric spark; that this liberty is achieved first of all through the resultsbrought about by the activity of the “frictional fire” which speeds up itsinternal vibration; then by the work upon the atom, or the substance of solarfire, which causes:a. Orbital progression,b. Stimulative vibration,c. Awakened internal response,until finally electric fire is contacted. This is true of all atoms: [1067]a. The atom of substance,b. The atom of a form whatsoever it be,c. The atom of a kingdom in nature,d. The atom of a planet,e. The atom of a solar system.In every case the three fires or types of energy play their part; in every casethe four stages are passed through; in every case transmutation, transference,or radiation takes place, and the result of the escape of the central positiveenergy is achieved, and its absorption into a greater form, to be held in placefor a specific cycle by the stronger energy.This process of rendering radioactive all the elements has, as we have seen,occupied students down the ages. The alchemists of the middle ages beginningwith the simpler elements and starting with the mineral kingdom sought to findout the secret of the liberating process, to know the method of release, and tounderstand the laws of transmutation. They did not succeed in the majority ofcases because, having located the essence, they had no idea how to deal with itwhen released, nor (as we have seen) had they any conception as to the magneticforce which was drawing the released essence to itself.To comprehend the law and therefore to be able to work perfectly with it, theexperimenting student must have the ability to release the essence from itsform. He must know the formulae and words which will direct it to thatparticular focal point in the mineral kingdom which stands in the samecorrespondential relation to the mineral monad as the Ego on its own planestands to the man who casts off his physical and true forms through death. Thisinvolves knowledge only committed to the pledged disciple; if chance studentsstumble upon the law, and theoretically know the process, they would do well toproceed no further until they have learned how [1068] to protect themselves fromthe interplay of forces. As we well know, the workers with radium, and those whoexperiment in the world’s laboratories, suffer frequently from loss of limb orlife; this is due to their ignorance of the forces they are dealing with. Theliberated essences become conductors of the greater force which is theirmagnetic centre, because they are responsive to it, and it is this force whichproduces the distressing conditions sometimes present in connection withradioactive substances. Every radioactive atom becomes, through this conductivefaculty, a releasing agent; and they consequently cause what we call burns.These burns are the result of the process of releasing the essential life of theatom of physical substance being dealt with.There might here be noted the curious phenomenon, in the human kingdom which iserroneously termed the prolongation of life; it might more truthfully be calledthe perpetuation of the form. Medical science today strains every effort toretain life in forms diseased and inadequate; these Nature, if left to herself,would long ago have discarded. They thereby imprison the life, and force backthe life essence again and again into the sheath at the moment of liberation. Incourse of time and with more knowledge, true medical science will become purelypreventative. It will concentrate its ability on preserving the atomic life ofthe human atom, and at furthering the preservative protective processes, and thefunctionary smoothness of the atomic rotary life, thus conducing to the correctfollowing of the human orbital path. But further than that it will not go, andwhen the course of nature has been run, when the wheel of life has run down,when the hour for liberation has struck, when the time has come for the returnof the essence to its centre, then the work will be recognised as completed, andthe form discarded. But this will not, however, be possible until the humanfamily has reached a stage [1069] when, through pure living and clean thinking,the present corruptions have been eliminated. Men will then function on into oldage, or until the Ego, realising the particular work to be accomplished in anyone life has been duly worked out, calls in the lower spark of life, andwithdraws the central point of fire. This naturally presupposes knowledge andfaculties at present lacking.All these thoughts can be extended to include entire kingdoms of nature, theglobes of a chain, the chains themselves, a planetary scheme or a solar system.The moon is an interesting instance of the transmutative or liberating processpractically completed in a globe: the essential life of the human kingdom haswithdrawn and found a new field of expression. All animal life has equally beenabsorbed by a greater centre in another chain. Practically the same can be saidof the vegetable kingdom on the moon though there are a few of the lower formsof the vegetable life (of a kind unrecognisable by us) still to be found there;whilst the mineral kingdom is radioactive and the essence of all mineral formsis fast escaping.In connection with the kingdoms of nature, it must be remembered that theirgrowth and eventual radiation is dependent upon the cyclic purpose of theplanetary Logos, and upon the currents of force which play upon His planetarybody, and which emanate from other planetary schemes.All atoms become radioactive as the result of a response to a stronger magneticcentre which response is brought about through the gradual evolutionarydevelopment of consciousness of some kind or another. This is known to be truein a small degree in connection with the mineral kingdom though scientists havenot yet admitted that radiation is thus caused. Later they will, but only whenthis general theory which is here laid down in connection with all atoms isadmitted by them to be a plausible [1070] hypothesis. Then the goal of theirendeavour will be somewhat changed; they will seek to ascertain through clearthinking and a study of the involved analogy what focal points of magneticenergy may be regarded as existing, and how they affect the atoms in theirenvironment. One hint only can here be given. Light upon these dark problemswill come along two lines.First, it will come through the study of the place of the solar system in theuniversal whole, and the effect that certain constellations have upon it;secondly, it will come through a close study of the effect of one planetaryscheme upon another, and the place of the moon in our own planetary life. Thiswill lead to a close investigation of polar conditions in the earth, of theplanetary magnetic currents, and of the electrical intercourse between ourearth, and the Venusian and Martian planetary schemes. When this has beenaccomplished, astronomy and esoteric astrology will be revolutionised, and thenature of solar energy as an expression of an Entity of the fourth rank will beappreciated. This will come at the close of this century after a scientificdiscovery of even greater importance to the scientific world than that as to thenature of the atom. Until that time it will be as difficult to express thehylozoistic conception in terms of exact science as it would be for thesixteenth century ancestor of present humanity to conceive of the atom as beingsimply an aspect of force, and not objective and tangible. Hence furtherelucidation will but serve to confuse.In considering this vast subject of radiation, which is the result ofspiral-progressive movement, it might be of interest if I here pointed out thatin every kingdom of nature there are certain focal points of energy which, asthe aeons gradually sweep along, bring the atomic substance of which all formsin all kingdoms are composed to the point where they become radioactive andachieve [1071] liberation. (The term “liberation” really means the ability ofany conscious atom to pass out of one sphere of energised influence into anotherof a higher vibration, of larger and wider expanse of conscious realisation.)Broadly speaking, it might be said that:The mineral kingdom is responsive to that type of energy which is the lowestaspect of fire, of those internal furnaces which exert an influence upon theelements in the mineral world, and which resolve these atomic lives into agradual series of ever-higher types of mineral energy. For instance, the type ofenergy which plays upon iron ore, or which produces tin, is emanated from adifferent centre in the body of the Entity informing the mineral kingdom to thatwhich converts the elements into those wondrous jewels, the diamond, thesapphire, the emerald or the ruby. The energy of the particular centre involvedis likewise responsive to force originating in the centre in the body of theplanetary Logos—which centre depends upon the kingdom to be vivified. In dealingwith these kingdoms, therefore, the relations might be briefly indicated—Kingdom Planetary Centre a. Human Heart centre. b. Animal Throat centre. c.Vegetable Solar plexus. d. Mineral Spleen.The planetary egoic centre is, of course, the transmitter to all the others, andit should be borne in mind in this connection that every centre transmits threetypes of force, with the exception of the spleen which hands on the solar fires,pranic force, pure and simple. Students will eventually ascertain how to groupthe various types in the different kingdoms according to the type of energy theydisplay in fullest measure, remembering that only in the fourth kingdom, thehuman, is the highest of the three types (that which producesself-consciousness) [1072] manifesting; in the others it is latent. This willbecome apparent if the method of lunar individualisation is studied.The vegetable kingdom is responsive to the particular type of energy whichproduces the phenomenon of water, or moisture. Through the effect of water everyhigher type of plant life is evolved, and through the combination of heat andwater results are brought about which produce new types. The herbal scientistwho is producing new species is really occupied with the effect of sex energy inthe second kingdom of nature; he will do well to deal with all plant life asenergy points responsive to other and greater energy centres. Much will belearned along this line when electricity and colored lights are more freely usedin experimental stations. Sex, in the mineral kingdom, or chemical affinity, isthe display in that kingdom of the second type of magnetic force; in thevegetable kingdom the same thing can be studied in the seed life, and in thefertilisation processes of all plants. Neptune, the God of the Waters, has acurious relationship to our planetary Logos, and also to the Entity Who is theinforming life of the second kingdom.The animal kingdom is responsive to a type of energy which is neither fire norwater but is a combination of the two. They are also the first of the kingdomson the physical plane to be responsive to sound , or to the energy emanatingfrom that which we call noise. This is an occult fact worthy of close attention.The energy emanating from the Entity Who is the informing Life of the thirdkingdom in nature has five channels of approach, that is five centres. Thatanimating the fourth kingdom has seven, for the mind and the intuition areadded. In the second kingdom there are three centres, but their manifestation isso obscure as to seem practically nonexistent to the human mind. In the first ormineral kingdom, the avenue of approach is limited to one centre. [1073] It willbe observed, therefore, that the stimulation of magnetic energy proceeds fromwhat might be regarded as jumps, 1-3-5-7. Each kingdom starts with a specificequipment, and during the process of evolution within the kingdom adds to it sothat the liberated life enters the next kingdom with its old equipment plus one.The human kingdom is equally responsive to energy. This time it is the energy offire at its highest manifestation in the three worlds. It must be borne in mindthat we are referring to the positive energy of the greater Whole as it affectsthe lesser positive energetic points. We are not referring to form energy.The atom becomes responsive to form energy or to that which surrounds it. Itbecomes conscious and then becomes responsive to the force of the kingdom inwhich it is a part. It gradually becomes responsive to stronger influences or tothe force emanating from the Entity Who is the life of that kingdom.Finally, the atom becomes conscious of planetary energy, or responsive to theHeavenly Man Himself. It then transcends the kingdom in which it has been, andis elevated into another kingdom in which the cycle is again repeated.This can all be expressed in terms of consciousness but in this section we willlimit the thought simply to that of energy. In summation it might be said that:1. The planetary Logos has seven centres, as has man.2. The informing Life of the animal kingdom has five centres, and the animalkingdom has five prototypes on the archetypal plane, whereas man has sevenprototypes.3. The informing Life of the vegetable kingdom has three centres of force on HisOwn plane, and there are, therefore, but three basic types of plant life. [1074]All that we know are but differentiations of those three.4. The informing Life of the mineral kingdom works through one centre.b. Radiation in the Five Kingdoms . We have seen that the cause of radiation isthe response of the positive life in any atom to the attractive power of thepositive life in a greater atom. Expressed in other words, we might say that thedeva life of any atomic form proceeds with its evolution, and by a series of“releases” transfers itself during the manvantaric cycles out of one kingdominto another until every atom has achieved self-determination, and thus thepurpose of the Heavenly Man for any particular mahamanvantara is satisfactorilyaccomplished. As might be expected, therefore, when the subject is viewed as awhole and not from the standpoint of any one kingdom, there are in theevolutionary process five major at-one-ments.1. At-one-ment with the mineral kingdom.2. At-one-ment of the mineral monad with the vegetable kingdom.3. At-one-ment of the vegetable monad with the animal kingdom.The progressive life has now made three at-one-ments or expanded its realisationthree times.4. At-one-ment with the human kingdom.5. At-one-ment with the Heavenly Man or with the great planetary life.Along these five stages, one of them is considered in this solar system to bethe most important, and that is the at-one-ment with the human kingdom. For thisparticular greater cycle, the goal of evolution is man; when individualisationis achieved and self-determination is awakened, the Monad or Divine Pilgrim hasattained that which expresses the logoic purpose most perfectly. The [1075]later stages but set the crown upon the victor, and the final at-one-ment withthe divine Self is but the consummation of the fourth stage. Students will findit of interest to work out the correspondence between the five initiations andthese five unifications. There is a close connection between the two. Byunderstanding the laws of the different kingdoms, much can be learned anent theconditions governing the five Initiations. It will be found that the initiationsmark stages in response to contact and to realisation which have theirinteresting germs in the five kingdoms.It might here be pointed out with propriety that radiation is the result oftransmutation; transmutation marks the completion of a cycle ofrotary-spiralling activity. No atom becomes radioactive until its own internalrhythm has been stimulated to a point where the positive central life is readyfor the imposition of a higher vibratory activity, and when the negative liveswithin the atomic periphery are repulsed by the intensity of its vibration, andare no longer attracted by its drawing qualities. This is due to the coming inand consequent response to the magnetic vibration of a still stronger positivelife which releases the imprisoned central spark and causes what might from someaspects be called the dissipation of the atom. This process, nevertheless, inthe majority of cases covers such a vast period of time that the human mind isunable to follow the process.The radioactive period is much the longest in the mineral kingdom, and shortestof all in the human. We are not concerned with radiation in the spiritualkingdom at the close of the mahamanvantara, so no comment will here be made.It is interesting to note that during this round, owing to planetary decision,the process of producing human radiation or “release” is being artificiallystimulated through the method which we call initiation, and the [1076] short cutto intensive purification and stimulation is open to all who are willing to passthrough the divine alchemical fire. Simultaneously, in the other kingdoms ofnature a process somewhat similar in kind though not in degree is beingattempted. The tremendous manipulation of ores, the scientific work of thechemist, and scientific investigation is analogous in the mineral kingdom to theworld processes which are being utilised to liberate the human spark. Out of thechaos and turmoil of the World War, for instance, and the weight of metalundergoing violent disintegration the mineral monad emerged as from aninitiatory test, incomprehensible as this may seem. It will be apparent that agreat simultaneous movement is on foot to produce more rapid radiation in allthe kingdoms of nature so that when the cycle is run the process of planetaryradiation may be consummated. This intensive culture is not proceeding upon allthe planets but only upon a very few. The others will run a longer cycle. Theinitiatory cultural process which has in view the stimulation of magneticradiation or transmutation is but an experiment. It was tried first on Venus,and on the whole proved successful, resulting in the consummation of theplanetary purpose in five rounds instead of seven. This was what made itpossible to utilise Venusian energy upon the Venus chain and the Venus globe ofour scheme and thus cause the phenomenon of forced individualisation in Lemuriandays. It was the intensive stimulation of the third kingdom of nature during thethird root race which artificially unified the three aspects. The process ofstimulating through the medium of Venusian energy was really begun in the thirdround when the triangle of force was completed, and ready to function. It isthis factor which occultly makes the third Initiation of such tremendousimportance. In it the human triangle is linked, the Monad, the [1077] Ego andthe personality, or Venus, the Sun and the Earth are symbolically allied.Enough has here been indicated to give the student room for thought, though onemore word in this connection might be added. In the potentially radioactivequalities of the four kingdoms of nature with which we are most concerned willbe found an interesting analogy to the functions of the four planetary schemeswhich (in their totality) form the logoic quaternary. This applies also in alesser degree to the four chains which form the planetary quaternary. All haveto become radioactive and all their principles have to be transmuted and theform for which they are responsible transcended.When the subject of radiation is more completely comprehended, it will be foundthat it demonstrates one more instance of the unity of all life, and furnishesone more corroborative indication of the synthetic nature of the entireevolutionary process. In every instance that which radiates from each kingdom ofnature is one and the same. The radioactive human being is the same in nature(differing only in degree and in conscious response) as the radioactive mineral;in every case it is the central positive life, the electric spark or that whichis its correspondence, which radiates. There are, therefore, sevencorrespondences in this connection in the solar system, seven types whichradiate, or seven classes of entities which demonstrate ability to transcendtheir normal motion and to transfer themselves into some greater sphere in duecourse of evolution. These are:1. The mineral monad of the mineral kingdom, or the central positive nucleus inall atoms and elements.2. The monad in the vegetable kingdom, or the central positive life of everyplant and vegetable growth.3. The monad in the animal kingdom or the positive life of each type. [1078]4. The human Monads in their myriads of groups.5. The Monad of any particular type, or form.6. The planetary Monad, the sum total of all the lives within a planetaryscheme.7. The solar Monad or the sum total of all lives in the solar system.Each of these is first rotary in its activity, or self-centred; later eachsimultaneously with its original motion demonstrates spiral-cyclic activity.Thereby it becomes “aware” of form, and finally becomes radioactive. During thisfinal period it transcends the form, and escapes from out of it, becoming thusconscious of, and able to participate in, the activity of the still greaterenveloping whole.c. Radiation and Cyclic Law . Scattered throughout this Treatise , are numerousindications of the cyclic nature of this phenomenon, and students should bear inmind that in all which concerns radiation, as in all else, there will be periodsof quiescence, and periods of intensified activity. This will be seen quiteclearly in connection with the fourth kingdom of nature. A period ofradioactivity is being entered upon now in which men and women will achieve alarger realisation; they will begin to transcend their human limitations, and toenter the fifth kingdom one by one, and unit by unit. This period, as far as thelarger cycle is concerned, began when the Door of Initiation was opened inAtlantean days, but many lesser cycles have occurred, for the influx into thefifth kingdom is equally governed by cyclic law, by periodic ebb and flow. Atthe close of the fourth root race there was a period of distinctiveradioactivity, and many hundreds of men passed out of the fourth CreativeHierarchy into another and a higher one. Many posts held hitherto by VenusianEntities were vacated in order that our humanity might occupy them, and a vastinterchain [1079] radiation went on as many of the Kumaras and certain lesserexistences quitted our earth chain, and entered upon subtler, and more advancedwork. Then the activity gradually ebbed until a recurring cycle brought ininfluences which produced a new radiation, though not of such a strength as inthe preceding period.Another period of radioactivity occurred during the time of the Buddha and manyachieved Arhatship in those days. That period was the highest point of what isoccultly termed “a cycle of the third degree,” and a similar degree of radiatoryactivity has not been reached since that time. Human radiation of a very slightnature was felt about the time of Christ, but it only lasted for a couple ofhundred years, and though individuals here and there have since achieved thegoal, yet no large numbers have passed successfully through the fires oftransmutation, and thus transcended the fourth kingdom. The cycle is again onthe upward turn; about the fourteenth century the human kingdom began to benoticeably radioactive, and we are on the way to the fulfilment of a “cycle ofthe second order” or of a period of transcendence of a still greater activitythan in the time of the Buddha. It will become demonstrably great when certainconditions have been fulfilled.First, when the present world chaos has subsided. Next, when the presentgeneration has consummated its work of reconstruction. Third, when the cominggreat Lord has entered upon His mission upon earth, thereby increasing thevibration in every kingdom of nature, but particularly in the second and fourth.Fourth, when the movement, inaugurated at the close of each century by theTrans-Himalayan Lodge is under way, and the psycho-scientific Egos who are itsagents have made their presence felt.Finally, when a movement is instituted by the Lodge, working in connection withthe fourth root race; it will [1080] also be part of the stimulative process,and will result in the rendering radioactive of some of the foremost thinkers ofthat race. It will be their day of opportunity, and so great is the importanceattached to this that a Member of the Lodge, Confucius as he has been called inthe past, will incarnate in order to superintend the work. The preliminary stepsare being taken now, and Egos are coming in who will endeavour to direct theenergies of this race on to the right line though the peak of the cycle ofstimulation will not be until the middle of the next century. It is needless forme to point out that all such movements are first felt as disturbing, and onlywhen the dust of turmoil, and the noise of clashing forces have died away willpurpose be seen emerging. This is very apparent in Russia at the present time.A great factor and one that it is hard to explain so that the average thinkercan understand it is the cyclic coming in of egos who are at a point inevolution where they are ready for their first radioactive life. In one greatdepartment of hierarchical endeavour all egos are divided into two groups,according to their cycle and according to their type of energy. These grades arein turn subdivided according to the quality and the vibratory effect to beinduced upon any one kingdom of nature by their united, or single, incarnation.This might be illustrated by pointing out that by the gradual coming in of humanbeings who are vegetarians by natural inclination and by the appearance of egoswho are interested specifically in the welfare and nurture of the animals (as isthe case so noticeably now) we have the cyclic appearance of a whole group ofhuman units who have a definite karmic relation to the third kingdom. Thisrelation is of a kind differing in specific detail from the meat-eating, and oftinhuman, groups of the past five hundred years.It might be of profit and of interest if we here enumerated some of the occultterms applied to some of these [1081] differentiated groups, remembering that weare only touching upon a few out of a vast number, and only name those theterminology of which conveys information and educational benefit to the student:1. The units of inertia,2. Atoms of rhythmic centralisation,3. Units of primary radiation,4. The sons of heavy rhythm,5. The points of fiery excellence (a name given oft to magnetic, highly-evolvedtypes),6. Tertiary points of secondary fire,7. Magnetic flames (given to chelas and initiates of certain degrees),8. Positive sons of electricity,9. Rotating units of the seventh order,10. Points of light of the fourth progression,11. Electric sparks,12. Units of negative resistance,13. The equilibrised atoms.Many more names might be given but these will suffice to indicate the generalnature of these energy summations, under which all the members of the humanfamily are gathered and placed according to:a. Their rhythm,b. Their quality,c. Their heat,d. Their light,e. Their magnetic influence,f. Their radiation,g. Their activity.This tabulation is but an extension of the major one which grouped all Egosunder the divisions of colour, sound and vibration. A similar enumeration hasalso grouped the atoms in the other kingdoms of nature, and [1082] even theDhyan Chohans of the highest rank find their place in the hierarchical archivesof this fifth (or third) department.A cyclic tabulation is of equal interest but is of a totally different nature,carrying to the initiated and intuitive investigator many hints of anevolutionary and historical value. Again we might append a brief epitome of someof the expressions used and of some of the names under which human beings aregrouped in the archives of this the seventh department:1. Units of the fire-mist stage,2. Points of lunar origin,3. Sons of the sun,4. Devas of the fourth degree,5. Flames from interplanetary spheres,6. Atoms from the crimson sphere—a reference to certain Egos who have come tothe earth from the planetary scheme whose note is red,7. The successful Vyasians,8. The points in the third planetary petal, and groups of others related to thetwelve petalled planetary lotus,9. The lovers of low vibration,10. The rejectors of the eighth scheme,11. The points of triple resistance,12. The followers of the ARHAT,13. The cyclic sons of peace,14. The recurring sons of war,15. The specks within the planetary eye,16. The recognised points within the chakras. These naturally exist in tengroups.Each name conveys to the mind of the initiate some knowledge as to the place inevolution of the Monad concerned, the nature of its incarnations, and its placein cyclic evolution.[1083] The same method of grouping is used in connection with all the kingdomsthough only in the case of the fourth and the fifth kingdoms are individualatoms dealt with; the tabulations and records for the other kingdoms areconcerned with groups. When a group is known, the nature, vibration, and rhythmof the atom within that group is immediately apparent.IV. THE TURNING OF THE WHEEL( 312 [text00028.html#Y_FN312] )We come now to the consideration of another point, and one of very real moment;it emerges out of what we have been saying anent cycles and is the basis of allperiodic phenomena. One of the most elementary of scientific truths is that theearth revolves upon its axis, and that it travels around the sun. One of thetruths less recognised, yet withal of equal importance, is that the entire solarsystem equally revolves upon its axis but in a cycle so vast as to be beyond thepowers of ordinary man to comprehend, and which necessitates mathematicalformulae [1084] of great intricacy. The orbital path of the solar system in theheavens around its cosmic centre is now being sensed, and the general drift alsoof our constellation is being taken into consideration as a welcome hypothesis.Scientists have not yet admitted into their calculations the fact that our solarsystem is revolving around a cosmic centre along with six other constellationsof even greater magnitude in the majority of cases than ours, only one beingapproximately of the same magnitude as our solar system. This cosmic centre inturn forms part of a great wheel till—to the eye of the illumined seer—theentire vault of Heaven is seen to be in motion. All the constellations, viewingthem as a whole, are impelled in one direction.The old Commentary expresses this obscure truth as follows:“The one wheel turns. One turn alone is made, and every sphere, and suns of alldegrees, follow its course. The night of time is lost in it, and kalpas measureless than seconds in the little day of man.Ten million million kalpas pass, and twice ten million million Brahmic cyclesand yet one hour of cosmic time is not completed.Within the wheel, forming that wheel, are all the lesser wheels from the firstto the tenth dimension. These in their cyclic turn hold in their spheres offorce other and lesser wheels. Yet many suns compose the cosmic One.Wheels within wheels, spheres within spheres. Each pursues his course andattracts or rejects his brother, and yet cannot escape from the encircling armsof the mother.When the wheels of the fourth dimension, of which our sun is one and all that isof lesser force and higher number, such as the eighth and ninth degrees, turnupon themselves, devour each other, and turn and rend their mother, then willthe cosmic wheel be ready for a faster revolution.”It will, therefore, be apparent that the power of man to conceive of thesewhirling constellations, to measure their interaction, and to realise theiressential unity is not as yet great enough. We are told that even to the [1085]liberated Dhyan Chohan the mystery of that which lies beyond his own solarRing-Pass-Not is hid.Certain influences indicate to Him and certain lines of force demonstrate to Himthe fact that some constellations are knit with His system in a close andcorporate union. We know that the Great Bear, the Pleiades, Draco or the Dragonare in some way associated with the solar system but as yet He knows not theirfunction nor the nature of the other constellations. It must also be rememberedthat the turning of our tiny systemic wheel, and the revolution of a cosmicwheel can be hastened, or retarded, by influences emanating from unknown orunrealised constellations whose association with a systemic or a cosmic Logos isas mysterious relatively as the effect individuals have upon each other in thehuman family. This effect is hidden in logoic karma and is beyond the ken ofman.The wheels in order of their importance might be enumerated as follows:The wheel of the universe , or the sumtotal of all stars and starry systems.A cosmic wheel , or a group of seven constellations. These are grouped accordingto:a. Their magnitude,b. Their vibration,c. Their colour,d. Their influence upon each other.These cosmic wheels, according to the esoteric books, are divided intoforty-nine groups, each comprising millions of septenary constellations. Forpurposes of study by the Adepts, they are each known by a symbol, and theseforty-nine symbols embody all that can be apprehended anent the size, magnitude,quality, vibratory activity, and objective of those great forms through which anExistence is experiencing. The Chohans of high degree [1086] know the forty-ninesounds which give the quality of the consciousness aspect of these great BeingsWho are as far removed from the consciousness of our solar Logos as theconsciousness of man is removed from that of a crystal. The knowledge thusappreciated by the Chohans is naturally but theoretical and conveys only totheir relatively limited consciousness the general nature of the group ofconstellations, and the force occasionally emanating from them which has attimes to be taken into calculation. For instance, the interest awakened in thepublic mind lately by the giant star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion isdue to the fact that at this particular time there has been an interplay offorce between our tiny system and this giant one, and communication between thetwo informing Existences.Systemic wheels or the atomic life of individual constellations. These again aredivided into 343 groups, known to the Adept again through a series of charactersforming a word which—through its ideographic nature—conveys essentialinformation to the Adept. The ideograph for our solar system may in part bedisclosed—not the characters themselves but a digest of that for which thecharacters stand. Our solar system is disclosed as being:a . A system of the fourth order, having its force centres upon the fourthcosmic plane, and making its objective manifestation from the fourth systemicplane, via the fourth subplane of the systemic physical plane.b. Blue in colour, esoteric orange and green.c. A system which is occultly known to the Adept as “in an airy sign in whichthe Bird can fly.”d. A system formed of “three fires which form a fourth.”e. A system in which the Bird has “four tail feathers” [1087] and hence canoccultly “mount to a higher plane and find its fifth.”f. A system which has four major cycles, and minor periods of manifestationwhich are multiples of that figure.g. A system which in the alchemical phraseology of the Masters is viewed asbeing “a product of the fourth; the fourth itself in process of transmutation;and the living stone with four shells.” All this can be seen at one glance bythe Master who has the ideographic word before Him. Other ideograms areavailable for His use which give Him the immediate information as He studies theinfluences contacting our solar system.Planetary wheels. For these there are ten modes of expression.Chain wheels , called in some of the books rounds.The revolution of any one globe.The cycle of the three worlds.The wheel of a plane.The revolution or cyclic appearance of a kingdom in nature. This applies withina scheme but only to the four kingdoms in objective appearance.The revolution of a planetary centre producing monadic appearance.The monadic wheel, or the periodic appearance of units of the fourth CreativeHierarchy. Thus we pass down the scale through all the kingdoms and forms tillwe arrive at the tiny revolution of an atom of substance.In concluding our remarks concerning the diverse wheels of the universe, we willtouch with brevity upon the “wheels” which concern the human monad. This is asubject but little dealt with as yet, though a few words have been spoken anentthe egoic wheel.It must be borne in mind that the evolution of the [1088] Monad is a much moreintricate thing than appears in the books as yet given to the public. In thosebooks the development of consciousness and its transition through the kingdomsof nature are the points dwelt upon. Yet there have been earlier cycles which itwill be only possible to comprehend as the history and evolution of theplanetary Logoi become gradually revealed. They are parts of His body ofmanifestation, cells within that greater vehicle, and thus vitalised by Hislife, qualified by His nature, and distinguished by His characteristics. Thiswill take the history, therefore, of a Monad back to the earlier kalpas. Suchhistory it is not possible to reveal, and no purpose would be served by such arevelation. The fact only can be touched upon as it must be considered alonggeneral lines if the true nature of the Self is to be accurately known.We might consider that the Monad of the human being passes through cyclesanalogous to those through which the Heavenly Man travels. There is, first, thevast cycle of unfoldment through which a “spark” passes. This covers the periodof three major solar systems—that preceding this one, the present, and thesucceeding one. In these three, the totality of the cosmic Past, Present, andFuture, embodying the three aspects of the divine Life of the solar Logos, arecarried to the point of perfection in an individualised Monad. It must beremembered that in this solar system, for instance, certain developments areonly recapitulations of evolutionary processes undergone in an earlier solarsystem; the clue to this lies in the consideration of the manasic or mindprinciple. The solar Angels, the intelligent individualising factor, were (fromcertain angles of vision) the product of an earlier system, and only waited forthe time in the present system when the forms in the three kingdoms had reachedthe point of synthetic development which made it possible for them to beimpressed and influenced from on high. We [1089] have in this concept an ideaanalogous to the entering in of those Monads, during Atlantean days, who, havingindividualised upon another chain, tarried in the inter-planetary spaces untilearth conditions were such that the occupation of adequate forms becamepossible. The correspondence is not exact but is indicative of the truth. Thevast cycle of unfoldment (which rendered later evolution possible) preceded thissolar system, and might be regarded as the monadic correspondence to a cosmicwheel. In the old Commentary this point of development is hinted at in thewords:“The fifth did not appear as the product of the present. The five spokes of thatwheel had each a cycle of development, and one in which they were welded at thecentre.”The Monad has cycles analogous, though on a miniature scale, to those of the oneLife Who permeates and animates all lesser lives. (Bible. I Peter 2:4.) Certainof these cycles cover periods of time so vast, and so long past, that theirhistory can only be conveyed to the investigating Adepts through the medium ofsound and symbol. The details of that development are lost in the night of otherkalpas, and all that can be seen are the results ,—the cause must be accepted asexisting, though for us remaining inexplicable until the higher initiations aretaken.In the fact of the turning of the monadic Wheel covering the period of threesolar systems, lies hid the mystery of monadic self-will, and the secret as towhy some of the Monads refused to incarnate, whilst others “fell,” and thusproceeded along the present lines of evolution. They refused to incarnatebecause of internal group conditions brought about through the evolutionaryprocesses of the past kalpas. It will, therefore, be apparent that the questionof what constitutes sin and evil is far more intricate than even appears uponthe surface. From our [1090] limited vision, it appears to be “sin” to fall intoincarnation, and equally sin or self-will, self-satisfaction, to remainunevolved upon the higher planes. Yet both groups followed the law of theirbeing, and the solution of the mystery lies in that which is to come.If the student will with care meditate upon the fact that the three lowerplanes—the mental, the astral, and the physical—form the dense physical body ofthe planetary Logos and are, therefore, no principle, it will become apparent tohim that through necessity certain units or cells in the body are more active inspace and time than others. He must also bear in mind that groups of Monads comeinto incarnation according to which centre in a Heavenly Man of a particularplanetary scheme, or which centre of the solar Logos, is in process ofvivification or cyclic activity, and that certain of the centres of a solarLogos and this particular solar system are in a condition of partial pralayathrough the process of the absorption of the lower solar life forces by thecentres of higher vitality. Again, he must remember that the entire aspect ofthe Divine Life is not intended to reach its full unfoldment at any time in thissolar system but must wait for the vitalising impulses of a later. This is dueto the fact that there exist in this solar system effects of causes originatingin earlier kalpas or—to word it otherwise—the karmic seeds of earlier logoicactivities.Our solar Logos has not yet attained true rhythm, but for millenia of cycles theequilibrising process must go on. Nor has our planetary Logos achievedequilibrium, and the even balancing of forces, therefore until His point inevolution and His objective vision is known and it is known also which centre inthe solar body is vitalised by His life, it will be the part of wisdom torefrain from dogmatic assertion, and a too free utterance in connection withincarnating, and non-incarnating, Monads. All are turning upon the monadiccosmic wheel; each is being [1091] swept into some form of activity upon thelesser revolution of this particular systemic wheel, but not all in anyparticular cycle are to be found revolving upon a specific planetary wheel. Manywait for development and for more appropriate seasons in interplanetary spaces,and some must wait until the entering in of a new mahamanvantara. Studentsshould bear carefully in mind the words of H. P. B. where he tells students ofthe Secret Doctrine that the stanzas and their Commentary deal primarily withour particular planetary Logos. This is oft forgotten.It may interest students to know that there are certain colours, veiling thesegroups of non-incarnating Monads, at present totally unknown to humanity. Thesewill sweep into the consciousness of the human being in another solar system, orafter the taking of the sixth Initiation. All that we have on earth arereflections of the true colours, and likewise the reflection of the lowestaspect.Every colour in the cosmos exists in three forms:1. The true colour.2. The illusory appearance of the colour.3. Its reflection.The reflection is that with which we are familiar; the appearance, or that whichveils the reality, is contacted and known when we see with the eye of the soul,the Eye of Shiva, and the true colour ( 314 [text00028.html#Y_FN314] ) iscontacted after the fifth kingdom has been passed through, and groupconsciousness is merging in that of the divine. Students will, therefore, notethat the monadic cosmic wheel can be [1092] visioned in terms of “true colour,”and is seen by the illumined seer as the combined blending of the primarycolours of the three solar systems.The monadic systemic wheel, which concerns this solar system alone, isdistinguished by being the totality of the seven colours of the seven HeavenlyMen, and from the vision of the adept of the fifth Initiation is the sumtotal ofthe primary colours of the egoic groups of the differing planetary schemes.The monadic planetary wheel, which concerns the particular group of Monadsincarnating in a particular scheme, is seen by the seer as the blending of egoicgroups, but with the difference that the colour is a dual one, and the colouringof the personality ray of the incarnating Ego is also seen.The egoic cycle, or the turning of the wheel of the incarnating Ego, is of themost practical interest to man, and has already been somewhat dealt with. Forpurposes of clarity and elucidation, this wheel may also be seen as turning inthree cycles and as making three kinds of revolutions, covering varying periodsof time.There is first, the Wheel of the chain , or the cycling of the Monad around anentire chain, and its passage through all the globes and kingdoms. Theconsideration of this is complicated by the fact that in any particular chain,the Monads seldom begin and end their evolution; they seldom emerge, passthrough their cycle and achieve their objective. It is not possible todissociate a chain from its preceding or succeeding chain. Many Monads whoachieved self-consciousness in the moon chain only entered into renewed activityin the middle of the fourth root race; others, who have individualised on thisearth, will not succeed in reaching their goal upon this planet. There is here acorrespondence to systemic evolution, and there is an analogy between the Monadswho refused to [1093] incarnate and the Egos who were unable to take bodies inthe Lemurian or third root race.There is next, the Wheel of a globe , or the process of evolution upon anyparticular globe. The student must bear in mind that the Monad, after planetarydissolution, passes the time between incarnations on other and subtler globes,which are the correspondence to the interplanetary and intersystemic spheres.There is also, the Wheel of a race , or the lesser cycle of incarnations—forminga definite series—wherein the incarnating Monad cycles through a number of livesin a particular race.All these cycles of periodic manifestation are concerned primarily with theappearance, or the manifesting of the “sparks” upon one or other of the threeplanes in the three worlds, or in some part of the physical body of theplanetary Logos. The lesser cycles deal with this; the greater turning of thewheel concerns also the appearance, or flashing forth, of the sparks in theplanetary or systemic etheric body, or on the four higher planes of our solarsystem. We can picture to ourselves the glory of this concept; the downpouringof the streams of fiery sparks; their flashing forth into points of intensifiedfire as they meet conditions which produce occult “ignition”; and the constantcirculation of the forty-nine fires constructed of the sixty thousand millionhuman Monads and the countless streams of deva monads: fire on every side—anetwork of fiery rivers of living energy, focal points of intensified brilliancyand everywhere the sparks.There are a few more remarks to be made anent the turning of the various wheels,and we can then take up the consideration of motion and the sheaths.Within all those wheels which we have enumerated, are many lesser wheels allgoverned by the same laws, actuated by the same three forms of activity, and all(in their totality) forming one great whole. It will be apparent [1094] to allconscientious students that the founders of the symbolical method managed toconvey in the symbol of the wheel an idea of the triplicity of all atomicactivity:a. The central point of active positive force the hub. b. The negative stream oflife the radiating spokes. c. The sphere of activity itself, the effect of theinterplay of these two the circumference of the wheel.If the student can picture those wheels in activity, if he can visualise allparts of the wheel as composed of lesser living wheels, and if he can work intohis picture a hint of the interplay of all these fiery essences, coloured withcertain predominant hues, he will become aware of conditions, and see before hima picture which is ever apparent to the illuminated seer. If, before doing this,he can vision the whole of the systemic wheel as in a constant state ofcirculation, in which the tiny lesser lives are impelled by the force of thecentral solar life to pass throughout the extent of the wheel so that they comein contact with all parts of the wheel, and are impressed by all the varyingtypes of “power-substance,” then the general nature of the method can besomewhat ascertained. We use the term “motion,” but what do we really mean?Simply, and literally, the manifestation of the energy generated through thebringing together of certain aspects of energy, and the triple result therebyproduced; the activities resulting from this stream of dynamic electricalenergy, emanating from some centre, which sweeps into response all that itcontacts, and which holds the responsive units in some form or another.From the occult standpoint, all that manifests is spheroidal in form, and isappropriately called a wheel, yet (in dense physical manifestation) the formsare diverse, and many, and unless etheric vision is present, the spheroidalforms of all lives are not apparent. How can this [1095] be explained? There arethree major reasons for this illusion, and these we might here touch upon,finding in the word “illusion” ( 315 [text00028.html#Y_FN315] ) the key to themystery.We have been told in connection with the dense physical body that it is notconsidered a principle and is not (in this second solar system) expressing thosequalities which are characteristic of the solar Logos and His presentincarnation. We are told, further, that the grosser dense forms of substance,all that is objective and tangible upon the physical plane, are vibrating to akey which is characteristic of the preceding system, being a left-over (if so itmight be expressed) of an earlier kalpa.These two points must be carefully borne in mind and latitude allowed for them,when endeavouring to express the truth anent motion. Therefore, a number of theatoms of matter are as yet governed by an internal life which has for its main,distinctive feature, the faculty of a much closer adhesion, and a decisivenessof grouping that is inherently characteristic of the present body ofmanifestation of the solar system. We must remember when considering this, thatall that is dense and gross in all forms, concerns only those forms on the threelower subplanes of the lowest systemic planes; the forms are constructed ofmatter of all the planes, but the percentage of gross matter is as we canplainly see but small. Interaction for the mineral monad exists, and completelynegatives the vibration of the three lower subplanes of the physical plane; itpasses eventually into forms which are more closely allied to the “true form.”The mineral monad has a problem slightly at variance with that of the otherkingdoms, for it is specifically an [1096] expression of the lives which wereclassed as the failures of a previous solar system, and which were doomed toimmerse themselves in the forms of the mineral kingdom. Liberation for man comeswhen he succeeds in freeing himself from the vibration of the three lower planesof our solar system, from that part of the logoic manifestation whichconstitutes His dense body, and which He does not therefore regard as aprinciple. It will, consequently, be apparent that there is a correspondenceworthy of study to be found in the relation between the mineral monad, a humanbeing, and a solar Logos. Viewing these three as an esoteric triplicity muchlight may be gained by meditation upon them asa. The residual vibration of system 1,b. The medial point of activity of system 2,c. The subjective energy of the present system.In the comprehension of this, and in the realisation that there are forcespresent in nature which are in the nature of left-overs, we have the clue tomuch of the puzzling side of manifestation, to the cruelty and death, thesuffering, and the agony which are seen in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. Inthe term animal kingdom I include man’s physical body. We have also the clue tosome aspects of the left hand Path, and a clue to the problem of the basic causeof the appearance of such existences as black magicians. Just as no human beingcan escape the effects of energy generated by him in an early life, so the solarLogos Himself is working out and so held back by influences which are the resultof His earlier activities in System 1.The dense physical forms are an illusion because they are due to the reaction ofthe eye to those forces about which we have been speaking. Etheric vision, orthe power to see energy-substance, is true vision for the human being, just asthe etheric is the true form. But until [1097] the race is further evolved, theeye is aware of, and responds to the heavier vibration only. Gradually it willshake itself free from the lower and coarser reactions, and become an organ oftrue vision. It might be of interest here to remember the occult fact that asthe atoms in the physical body of the human being pursue their evolution, theypass on and on to ever better forms, and eventually find their place within theeye, first of animals and then of man. This is the highest dense form into whichthey are built, and marks the consummation of the atom of dense matter. Occultlyunderstood, the eye is formed through the interplay of certain streams of force,of which there are three in the animal, and five in the human being. By theirconjunction and interaction, they form what is called “the triple opening” orthe “fivefold door” out of which the animal soul or the human spirit can “lookout upon the world illusion.”The final reason why the spheroidal true form of everything is apparently notseen on the planet can only at this stage be expressed through a quotation froman old esoteric manuscript in the Masters’ archives:“The vision of the higher sphere is hidden in the destiny of the fourth form ofsubstance. The eye looks downwards and, behold, the atom disappears from view.The eye looks sideways and the dimensions merge, and again the atom disappears.Outward it looks but sees the atom out of all proportion. When the eye negatesthe downward vision, and sees all from within outwards, the spheres again willbe seen.”V. MOTION AND THE FORM-BUILDING IMPULSE1. Motion and the Mental Sheath.In the first section of this treatise we dealt somewhat with various phases ofactivity when considering “fire by friction,” and the fiery motion of substanceitself. We will only touch on some further aspects of the matter, for it isnecessary that the student should bear in mind certain [1098] things. He shouldendeavour to ascertain the relationship between the universal mind (or thesystemic mind) and cosmic mind, and seek to comprehend the purpose of the mentalsheath, which is one of the most interesting of the various bodies on account ofits fiery gaseous constitution. He should also seek to bring about throughmeditation that mental control and alignment which will result in stabilisation,and a responsiveness to causal impression. This will lead to the transmission ofegoic instruction to the man on the physical plane.Certain points in connection with the mental sheath require emphasising, thoughit is not our purpose to do more than call attention to their nature. Under thelaw of correspondence, the student should be able to arrive at certainconclusions and judge wisely the assignment of purpose and place to theparticular set of lunar pitris who form the vehicle.The mental body is composed of only four types of essence, whereas the astralbody and the physical are formed of seven types. The devas who compose this bodyare grouped together as “the cohorts of the fourth order” and have a closeconnection with that group of cosmic Lives who (through the impress of theirinfluence upon solar matter) are responsible for the fact that our solar systemis a system of the fourth order. This group of Lives is manipulated andcontrolled, in the macrocosmic sense, from cosmic mental levels via the centralspiritual sun, and through what is called in esoteric parlance “the fourth solarcavity.” If students will meditate upon the nature of the human heart and itsvarious divisions, and particularly upon one of the valves, light upon thiscomplex problem may be forthcoming. There is a constant inflow of energy fromthese great Entities on cosmic mental levels; this inflow is the very lifeitself of the solar units who are the sumtotal of the four lower subplanes ofthe mental plane, and consequently the life [1099] of the individual units whoform the mental bodies of all human beings.It will be apparent to all careful students that on all the planes, the fourthsubplane has a peculiar and close relation to the fourth Creative Hierarchy,that of the human monads, and this is peculiarly the case in connection with themental body. Through the medium of the plane number (five), and the subplanenumber (four), the possibility of initiation for the human being becomes a factand that particular form of activity which distinguishes his progress is broughtabout. There are, therefore, two main streams of energy responsible for the formof the mental sheaths,a. That emanating from the fourth subplane of the cosmic mental plane, includingconsequently the remaining three subplanes.b. That emanating from the aggregate of those lives who form the fourth CreativeHierarchy. As we know, the esoteric number of this Hierarchy is nine, theexoteric number being four.It is the blending of these two streams of force which (within the confines ofthe three worlds) results in the progressive activity of man. When this iscoupled with the self-engendered action of the individual atoms of any sheath,we have spiral-progressive motion. This is true macrocosmically andmicrocosmically, for the activity of the cosmic physical plane (our sevensystemic planes), is largely dependent upon the co-ordinated activity of certainforce manifestations, which might be enumerated as follows:a . That of the fourth Creative Hierarchy, who, in their aggregate, form theforce centres.b. The emanating influences of the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane, uponwhich is dependent, [1100] throughout the system, the manifestation of thatwhich is tangible and objective.c. The opening up, both macrocosmically and microcosmically, of the fourthaspect of the solar and human egoic lotus; this is the revelation of the “Jewelin the Lotus,” and macrocosmically is the perfect co-ordination of the threeaspects through the medium of substance; this is the completion of logoicpurpose, which is that of the fourth group. It might be expressed otherwise:“When all is known of the significance of fourth dimensional existence, then thefourth order with the fifth will complete the sacred nine.”d. The specific alignment, interplay or free circulation of force simultaneouslythrough the following manifestations of the one life:1. The logoic Quaternary and equally the human.2. The fourth systemic ether.3. The fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic.4. The fourth Creative Hierarchy.When this has been completed, the goal universal will have been reached, and theLogos will have assumed the desired control of His physical body; the humanunits will be then functioning upon the buddhic plane, and the groups of liveswho form the mental bodies of the human beings (who are numerically allied withthe above progression) will have equally achieved.Certain influences and forces play upon the mental sheath of any human being,and produce in it that activity which is termed “spiral progressive.” Theseforces might be briefly considered as comprising the following:1. The energies of the atoms of substance which compose the mental body.2. The energies of the lunar father who is the coherent [1101] life of themental group body. These two groups concern the Not-Self, the third aspect ofmonadic manifestation.3. The energies of the solar Angel, or Father, which is the co-ordinatingprinciple behind manifestation in the three worlds.4. The energies of the intelligent lives who form the body egoic. These livesfind their emanating source on other levels than the systemic. These two groupsconcern the egoic principle, the middle principle which links the above and thebelow, and is the second aspect of monadic manifestation.5. The energy emanating from the “Jewel in the Lotus” itself, the focal point ofenergy in the Upper Triad. This concerns the Self, the highest aspect of monadicmanifestation.The effects produced by the play of these five types of energy upon each otherproduce (through the medium of the mental unit) that which we term the mentalsheath. This sheath is after all only the aggregate of those atoms within aspecific area with which the Thinker has to do, which he holds magneticallywithin his ring-pass-not, and which serve as the medium for his mentalexpression, according to his point of evolution. This same definition will berecognised as true of all atomic sheaths, and one of the things which studentsof the occult sciences will eventually do is to investigate the nature of theinforming lives of the sheaths, the qualities of the energies influencing suchlives, and the character and force of the basic underlying principles. They willthus arrive at facts concerning energies in the human kingdom which will proveof inestimable value.In order to keep the basic idea of this Treatise corresponding in its variousdivisions, I might call your attention to the four points we considered relativeto motion [1102] in the physical and astral sheaths. We found that the effectsof such motion might be regarded as four altogether:Separation.Momentum.Frictional Activity.Absorption.Separation. This separation is brought about through the initial activity of theEgo who produces the first of those forms which he intends to use during thecycle of incarnation, through the bringing together of these energies throughself-engendered impulse. He, for purposes of development, identifies himselfwith that form, and thus temporarily separates himself off from his own realSelf. Through the veil of mental matter he first knows separation, and undergoeshis first experiences of the three worlds. This deals with separation from thehighest aspect. Viewing it from the personality standpoint, separation is againto be seen, for the activity of the monadic sheath, its own internal volitionproduces the formation of a sphere of activity, distinct in its nature andgoverned by laws of its own, which—until a certain amount of alignment has beenachieved during evolution—lives its own separate existence apart from the twolower sheaths, astral and physical. Thus it can be truly said that the “mindslays the Real” ( 316 [text00028.html#Y_FN316] ) and serves as the “greatDeluder” of the Self in the one case, and as the “great Separator” in another;it comes between the centralised egoic life and the personality existences.This life of separation becomes steadily stronger as the rotary-spiral action ofthe mental body becomes intensified during the cycles of manifestation, and the“individualised” [1103] Idea becomes daily more dominant. The “Ahamkara”principle, ( 317 [text00028.html#Y_FN317] ) as it is called in the SecretDoctrine, does its work, and man becomes strongly self-centred, andself-conscious in the lower connotation of the term . Later, as higher energiescome into play and the effort is made to balance the three types of forcemanifestations in the three worlds through the three vehicles, the Ego becomesaware of delusion and eventually frees himself. When this is in process ofconsummation during the final stages of evolution, the mental body becomes atransmitter for force currents from the egoic mind, the antaskarana between thehigher mind and the mental sheath is built, and the “transmitting mind body”blends itself with the “reflecting astral body.” Thus separation is negated.Students will note, therefore, that the goal for the mental body is simply thatit should become a transmitter of the thoughts and wishes of the solar Angel,and should act as the agent for the Triad. The goal for the astral body is thatit should be the reflector in a similar way of the buddhic impulses, which reachthe emotional body via certain petals in the egoic lotus, and the astralpermanent atom. The process of equilibrising the forces in the personality (thusproducing stability, and alignment) is brought about through the scientificmanifestation of the electrical reactions of the three sheaths.The mental sheath is regarded in its totality of force as positive. The physicalbodies are regarded as negative to the mental. The astral vehicle is the pointof the at-one-ment of the energies; it is the battleground whereon the dualitiesare adjusted to each other, and equilibrium is attained. This is the underlyingthought when the words “kama-manasic” body are used, because for two-thirds ofthe pilgrim’s journey this body serves a dual purpose. It is only during thelater stage that a [1104] man differentiates between will and desire, andbetween his mental body and his desire body.Momentum: The activity of the mental sheath and its gradually increasing rate ofvibration is brought about by the inflow of energies of different kinds. Thesevarious factors, as they are brought to bear upon the mental sheath produce anincreased activity and speed in the rotary motion of the individual atoms, andalso greater speed in the progress of the entire sheath. This means a more rapidtransference of the atoms of low vibration out of the sheath and thesubstitution of atoms of high quality.It involves also more rapid transition of the various energies, or increasedspiral action. This is one of the factors resulting in more rapid incarnation,and more rapid assimilation of the experiences learnt. Curiously enough, fromthe standpoint of the average thinker, this factor causes longer devachanicperiods, for these cycles of interior mental consideration are of everincreasing activity. They are cycles of intense mental adjustment, and of thegeneration of force until (towards the close of the cycle of incarnation) theactivity which has been generated is so strong that continuity of consciousnessbecomes an accomplished fact. The man frequently then foregoes devachan as heneeds it no more. Other results are the fourth dimensional activity of thevarious “wheels,” which begin not only to rotate but to “turn upon themselves,”and the vivification of the four spirillae of the mental unit. Some of theenergies which produce increased momentum in the mental sheath might beenumerated, and as the students consider them it will again become apparent whata complicated thing human unfoldment really is. These energies are:1. The direct increasing influence of the solar Angel.This influence is felt in four stages:As the three rows of petals unfold. [1105]As the “interior jewel” rays forth more powerfully.2. The reflex action from the physical personality, or the thought currents sentthrough in course of time from the physical brain.3. The activities of the astral body.4. The thought currents or energy units initiated by identification with groups,national, family, racial and egoic.5. The currents which impinge upon the mental bodies of all human beings asdifferent Rays pass in and out of incarnation.6. The forces and energies which become active or latent during differentcycles.7. The interplay between planets, or between systems and constellations, ofwhich an illustration can be seen in the effect of Venusian energy upon ourEarthand many more factors too numerous to mention. All these energies have theireffects, and serve either to speed, or in some cases, to retard the evolutionaryprocess.It should be borne in mind by students that all egoic groups come under the Lawof Karma, but only as it affects the Heavenly Man, and not the law as itdemonstrates in the three worlds. This karmic law, which is the governingimpulse of His centres, will show itself in peculiar ways, and as the humanmonads compose those centres, each group will have its own “activity” problems,will spiral through the round of Being in its own peculiar manner, and willdemonstrate qualities and motions different from its brothers. For instance,through withdrawal of energy and not through basic inertia those monads who arethe sum total of the centre of creative force of the Heavenly Man show qualitiesof violent [1106] reaction on the physical plane against certain “laws ofnature” and in the period of their transition from the lowest centre to thethroat centre of the Heavenly Man, betray qualities of revolt which make them apuzzle to their brothers.We have now to consider the “frictional activity” of the mental sheath, and theactivity of the sheath as it manifests as absorption. These two concern, let usremember, the motion of the mental sheath as a whole. The result of thisactivity is rotary-spiral progressive action.Frictional activity. This, as is apparent from the words, deals with the “Fireby friction” aspect of substance, and therefore with the lowest aspect of theenergy of the mental sheath. The force of the Life within the sheath manifestsin the attractive and repulsive action of the individual atoms, and thisconstant and ceaseless interplay results in the “occult heat” of the body, andits increased radiation. It is one of the factors also which produces thegradual building in of new atoms of substance (ever of a better and moreadequate quality) and the expulsion of that which fails to suffice as a mediumfor intelligent expression.The mental unit is the synthesis of the four types of force with which we aredealing, and of the four expressions of it which we are in process ofconsidering.Each of the groups of lives which are the living essence of four subplanes andwhich focalise through one of the spirillae of the unit and thus influencea. The sheath itselfb. The man on the physical planec. Part of the head centreexpress in greater or less degree these four qualities.It might be noted here that the groups are called certain names by some occultteachers, which names convey [1107] the idea of the active enterprise which istheir predominant function.The “Lives” on the fourth subplane (that on which mental unit has its place) arecalled “The absorbers of the above and the below” or the “Transmitting faces ofthe fourth order.” They receive energy and absorb from the Ego on the one handin the first stage of the incarnation process, and on the other absorb theenergies of the personality at the close of the period of manifestation. Theyhave, therefore, an activity which might be regarded as corresponding to thefirst aspect. When it is remembered that the cosmic process repeats itself onevery plane, and that the Ego in the three worlds stands for the unmanifested,it will be seen that they are the primal separators, and the final “destroyers.”The lives of the next plane (which utilise the second spirilla of the mentalunit) are called “The interacting points of cyclic momentum.” These points whichgather momentum through the process of attraction and repulsion represent, inthe mental body, dual force , for it is only through the coming together and theseparation of atoms, great and small, macrocosmic and microcosmic, thatmanifestation of any kind becomes possible.On the subplane which is formed of lives functioning through the third spirilla,are found “the points of frictional activity” or the “heat producers” and thesethree—the absorbers, the points of momentum, and the heat producers, pour theirunited forces through the “separated lives” which form the real barrier betweenthe next body and the mental sheath. This is only possible when their work isunified and synthesised. The student must here remember that the lives are theexpression of one Life but that one or other of the spirillae will be the agencyfor lives which express specific qualities. We are dealing specifically with thefourth effect of motion in [1108] the mental sheath as it manifests throughoutthe entire vehicle.Absorption: This is the faculty which produces the forms of the mentalring-pass-not, and which (at the close of the cycle) is the active principlebehind devachanic manifestation. The student, through a consideration of themacrocosmic process, can arrive at a knowledge of the separation of the mentalbody and its individual functioning. It is anent the process of “heavenlywithdrawal” that we are speaking; under the law of analogy it is not easilypossible to follow the various steps and stages and this for the followingreasons:All our planes, being the cosmic physical subplanes, form the logoic physicalbody. At His final withdrawal from manifestation, He functions in His cosmicastral body, and the cosmic devachan is as yet far from Him, and impossible toconceive of. Certain points, therefore, anent man’s “rest in Heaven” are allthat is possible for us to deal with.Absorption into devachan is absorption into a definite stage of consciousnesswithin the logoic physical body; devachan, therefore, is occultly a state ofconsciousness, but of consciousness thinking in terms of time and space in thethree worlds. It has therefore no location for the unit of consciousness, buthas location from the standpoint of the Heavenly Man. Prakriti (matter) andconsciousness are—in manifestation—inseparable.The “devachan” of the occult books is connected with the consciousness of thelogoic planetary body, and with the gaseous subplane of the cosmic physicalplane. It is, consequently, transcended the moment a man begins to function inthe cosmic ethers, such as the fourth cosmic ether, the buddhic plane. It isclosely allied with certain karmic forces for, whilst in devachan, the man isoccupied with the aggregate of the thought forms he has built, [1109] which areessentially of an occult, a mental, and a persistent nature.It is in devachan that the man shapes and polishes the stones which are builtinto the Temple of Solomon. It is the workshop to which the individual stones(good deeds and thoughts) are taken for fashioning, after being extracted fromthe quarry of the personal life.Being of mental matter, devachan might be regarded as a centre, or heart ofpeace, within the periphery of the sphere of influence of the mental unit. Thefour spirillae form four protecting streams of force. A correspondence to thisstream of force can be seen in the four rivers which emanated from the Garden ofEden. Out of this garden man is driven into the world of physical incarnationand the Angel with the flaming sword protects the entrance, driving him backfrom entry until the time comes when evolution has progressed so far that he cancome to the portal laden with stones which can withstand the action of fire.When he submits these stones to the fire and they stand the test, he can enter“Heaven” again, his time though being limited by the nature and the quality ofwhat he brought.When the consciousness within devachan has absorbed all the essences of lifeexperience even that locality, or that aspect of matter, cannot enfold him, andhe escapes from limitation into the causal vehicle.2. Motion in the Causal Body.We have studied somewhat this activity as it manifests in fourfold fashion inthe mental sheath, and the reason that there has not been much to say anent thismatter has been that the mental sheath comes under the laws of the matteraspect, and is subject to the same rules as are the material vehicles of allexistences. It is only matter of a finer grade. The student, therefore, canapply what has been earlier said anent the astral and physical bodies [1110] tothe mental body, and thus negate the necessity of our entering upon the subjectin greater detail. The causal body differs from the Brahma aspect in that it isa fuller embodiment of the life of the second aspect, its predominantcharacteristics are those of the second aspect. To study the nature of motion inthe causal vehicle involves much clarity of thought, and due appreciation of thenature of that body.It should here be remembered that in considering the causal body, we are dealingspecifically with the vehicle of manifestation of a solar Angel who is itsinforming life and who is in process of constructing it, of perfecting it, andof enlarging it, and thus reflecting on a tiny scale the work of the Logos onHis own plane.Each part of the causal body is actuated by a type of force emanating from someone or other great centre, and it might be of interest, therefore, if weconsidered the component parts of this “Temple of the Soul,” if we studied thetype of animating activity and arrived at a knowledge of the forces playing uponit and through it. We will take them one by one, beginning with the outer row ofpetals.The Knowledge Petals. These are the petals which represent the lowest aspect ofthe Triad and are responsive to the lowest forms of egoic force. These petalsare three in number and come under the influence of certain streams of activity.a. One stream of energy emanates from the lower triad of permanent atoms,particularly the physical permanent atom, via that one of the three petalscalled the knowledge petal. The stream of force engendered in the lower selfcirculates in a triple stream (the reflection in the lower self of the threefoldPath to God) around the atomic triangle at the base of the egoic lotus. When ofsufficient strength and [1111] purity, it affects the outer row of petals. Thisbegins to be felt during the third period of man’s evolution when he is anaverage intelligent unit or atom. This energy, when it blends with the inherentlife of the atomic lives which form the petals, produces eventually thatintimate fusing of soul and body which makes man a living soul.b. Another stream of energy emanates in time from the second tier of petals whenin activity; this second tier is peculiarly instinctive with the life andquality of the Manasaputra in manifestation. The second tier of petals in anyegoic lotus is the one that gives us the key to the nature of the solar Angel,just as the outer tier is—to the inner vision of the Adept—a clue to the pointin evolution of the personality. By looking at the egoic lotus, the seer cantell the nature of the:Personal self through the condition of the atomic triangle, and the outer tierof petals.Higher Self, through the colour and arrangement of the central tier of petals.This tier gives the “family” of the solar Angel through the arrangement ofatomic lives which form the petals, and the circulation of the streams of forcesin those petals.Monad, through the inner circle of petals; its stage of lower awareness isrevealed in a similar way.The number of the Ray concerned is known through the quality of the “light” ofthe concealed jewel.In all these petals, groups of lives, solar and otherwise, are concerned, andstreams of energy from them focus through the petals. This is apparent to theman who has the key. It is a curious fact that the streams of force which formthe petals and [1112] which are in constant flux produce apparently “keysymbols” within the periphery of the egoic wheel, and thus reveal themselvesthrough their activity.c. A third type of energy is that which—at the close of evolution—makes itselffelt through the inner circle of petals, and which is the result of an inflow ofmonadic force, or atma.d. Finally, therefore, when the petals are unfolded they are thereforetransmitters of life or energy from three sources:1. The lower self Lunar Pitri Knowledge petals. 2. Ego Solar Angel Love petals.3. Monad Father in Heaven Sacrifice petals.It then becomes possible for a still higher form of energy to be felt, thatwhich is the energy of the centre of the body of the Heavenly Man or planetaryLogos, and which uses the “Jewel in the Lotus” as its focal point.In this summation, we have dealt with the main types of energy manifesting inthe egoic or causal body. Certain other influences must likewise be consideredin connection with the outer tier of petals.e. There is the energy reaching directly to the knowledge petals from themanasic permanent atom. The permanent atoms of the Spiritual Triad, as well asthe bodies which are built around them, bring in certain groups of deva liveswhich have not as yet been much considered. They are not the lunar pitris, asthat term is commonly understood, but have a direct connection with what iscalled “the cosmic moon” or to that dying solar system which has the samerelation to our system as the moon has to the earth chain. This “cosmic [1113]moon” transmits its energy to the manasic atomic subplane, via the planetSaturn. It is a triple energy and there is an esoteric connection between thistriple energy, and Saturn’s rings.The old Commentary expresses this truth about an interesting group of sons ofmanas as follows:“These Sons of mind clung to the old and dying form, and refused to leave theirMother. They chose to pass into dissolution with her, but a younger son (Saturn)sought to rescue his brothers, and to this end he built a triple bridge betweenthe old and new. This bridge persists, and forms a path whereon escape ispossible.Some escaped and came to the help of the incarnating Sons of Mind who had leftthe Mother for the Father. The greater gulf was bridged. The lesser gulfpersisted, and must be bridged by the living Sons of Mind themselves.” (Thislatter clause, refers to the building of the antaskarana.)The energy transmitted from the manasic permanent atom of each incarnating jiva,its union with its reflection, the energy of the mental unit, and the triplestream of force thus created on the mental plane, has its planetary reflectionin the relation of Saturn to another planetary scheme, and the three rings whichare energy rings, and symbols of an inner verity.f. Energy also pours in upon the knowledge petals from the egoic group, or fromthe aggregated knowledge petals of all the other lotuses in the group affiliatedwith any particular solar Angel. These groups have been earlier dealt with.g. Energy is transmitted also to the petals via the groups and emanations fromthose planetary schemes and streams of force which form the outer petals of thatgreat centre which is our solar system, and which we are told is seen from thehigher planes as a twelve-petalled lotus. These streams [1114] do not emanatefrom the seven sacred planets but from other planetary bodies within the solarRing-Pass-Not. Streams of force from the Sacred Planets play upon the centraltier of petals. Herein lies a hint to the wise student, and a clue to the natureof the lower aspect of the solar Angel.The Love Wisdom Petals. The streams of energy playing upon and through thissecond tier of petals closely resemble those already dealt with, but originatein differing groups of lives (lunar and solar).a. The lowest form of energy, reaching this circle, emanates from the lowerself, via the astral permanent atom, and the second petal of the outer tier. Itis transmuted astral energy; it is more powerful than its correspondence in thefirst tier, owing to the inherent nature of the astral body, and the fact thatit is augmented by the energy of the outer tier itself. This is one of thefactors which brings about the more rapid progress made towards the close of theevolutionary period. There are certain streams of force in the evolution of theMonad which might be regarded as embodying for it the line of least resistanceand they are specifically beginning at the lowest:a . Emanations from the vegetable kingdom.b. Astral energy.c. The energy of the second circle of petals.d. Buddhic force.e. The activity of the second Logos, planetary or solar.This is, of course, only true of this solar system, being the system ofregenerative love.b. Another form of influencing energy originates in the inner circle of petals,which is the focal point [1115] of force for the Monad, considered as atma. Itmust be pointed out that the streams of force which form the “petals of will”have a dynamic activity and (when in action) produce very rapid unfoldment. Itis the inner of the two types of force; their mutual interplay provides thenecessary stimulus, and results in the opening of the bud and the revelation ofthe Jewel.The other types of energy find their correspondence with those alreadyenumerated but I seek only to mention one of them,—that one which reaches thesecond tier of love petals, via the buddhic permanent atom. The energy thusoriginating is of a peculiarly interesting kind being the basic energy of allmanifestation, and the sum total of the forces which form the sevenfold heart ofthe physical sun, and which are located within its sheltering luminosity. Theyin their turn are transmitters of the life-impulses from the heart of thecentral Spiritual Sun, so that we have a direct graded chain of transmittingenergies.a. The Heart of the central Spiritual Sun.b. The sevenfold heart of the physical Sun.c . The buddhic devastod . The central circle of petals.e . The astral permanent atom.f. The heart centre within the Head.g. The heart centre.This buddhic energy is the sumtotal of the life force of Vishnu or the Son, Whois the transmitter and representative of a still greater cosmic Deity.All the above serves to demonstrate the oneness of the tiniest unit with the onegreat informing Life, and shows the integral beauty of the scheme. The life ofthe greatest cosmic Lord of Love pulsates in infinitesimal degree [1116] in theheart of His tiniest reflection, and for this reason the atom man can likewisesay “I too am God; His Life is mine.”The Sacrifice Petals. The energies or forces flowing through, and thus producingactivity in the inner tier of petals, the Sacrifice Petals , are again similarin nature to those already enumerated, plus a definite stimulation of power intwo directions.One stimulating influence comes from the Will Aspect of the Monad, and thus(through transmission) from the first Aspect of the planetary Logos, and theother emanates from the “Sacred Bud which veils the Jewel.” This is aparticularly strong vibration because, when the inner circle is unfolded, thejewel is revealed, and the three “veils” or “sacred petals” open successivelywhen the three tiers unfold.It is thus apparent what numerous energising agencies are responsible for the“motion,” occultly understood, of the egoic lotus. There is the inherent life ofthe atomic units forming each petal, and the circulatory life of the petalitself, regarding it as an individual unit. There is likewise the life of thecircle of three petals and to this we must add the unified activity of the outerthree circles, or the blending of knowledge forces absorbed from the personalself, of love forces which are the natural energies of the solar Angel, and ofsacrifice forces pouring in from the Monad. Thus we have a marvellous aggregateof streams of energies, all representing interior and still greater (becausecosmic) energies.Finally, we have the dynamic force of the “Jewel” at the Heart, which is itselfthe focal point for the life of the planetary Logos, and through the planetaryLogos of all the other Logoi.Thus the potentialities latent in the incarnating jiva are stupendous, and hecan become as God, provided he submits to the evolutionary process, and does not“refrain [1117] from being stretched upon the wheel.” Thus the expansions ofconsciousness, which will admit an individual point of spiritual life into thecouncils, and the Wisdom of the Deity, are no idle promise but are guaranteed bythe very constitution of the vehicle employed, and the place in the scheme ofthe “developing Point,” as the Ego is sometimes called. Naught in time and spacecan hinder, for every form being simply an expression of energised life, tendsto serve every other form. Stimulation of some kind, the tendency to increasethe vibration of contacting streams of energy, the accentuation of the activityof each centralised point as it contacts other points in the general heighteningof the vibration through the interplay of those forces, all this sweeps theentire system on to its consummation, and to the revelation of the “glory whichshall some day be revealed. (Bible. I. Peter, 5:1.) All these forces form theaggregate of what is called “fohatic life.” As the system, or the body of theLogos, is carried forward through the energy in all its parts, so is eachinfinitesimal part speeded on to its similar individual glorification. The manywhich form the All, and the units which constitute the One, cannot bedifferentiated as the consummation is achieved. They are merged, and lost in thegeneral “beatific light,” as it is sometimes called. We can then extend theconcept somewhat further, and realise the cosmic interplay which is likewisebeing carried forward. We can picture the cosmic stimulation and intensificationwhich proceeds as constellations form the units in the Whole instead of planetsor human atoms. Whole suns with their allied systems in their immensity play thepart of atoms. Thus some idea may be gained of the unified purpose underlyingthe turning of the great Wheel of the cosmic Heaven, and the working through ofthe life purposes of those stupendous Existences Who [1118] hold a position inthe cosmic Hierarchy similar to that of the “ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID.”It is not possible to give students an adequate idea of the beauty of the egoiclotus when it has reached the stage of complete unfoldment. The radiancy of itscolour is not here referred to, but the brilliancy of the fires, and the rapidscintillation of the ceaselessly moving streams and points of energy. Each petalpulsates with quivering fire “points,” and each tier of petals vibrates withlife, whilst at the centre glows the Jewel, raying forth streams of energy fromthe centre to the periphery of the outermost circle.The fires of living energy circulate around each individual petal and the methodof interweaving and the circulation of the fires is (as may be well realised)sevenfold in nature according to the sevenfold nature of the Logos involved.Each circle of petals becomes, as evolution proceeds, likewise active, andrevolves around the central Jewel, so that we have, not only the activity of thepetals, not only the activity of the living points or the deva lives within thepetal circumference, but likewise the unified activity of each tier of thethreefold lotus. At a specific stage in evolution, prior to the opening of thecentral veiling bud, the three tiers of petals, considered as a unit, begin torevolve, so that the entire lotus appears to be in motion. At the final stagesthe central circle of petals opens, revealing that which is hid, and revolvesaround the Jewel, only in a contrary direction to the rapidly circulating outerlotus. The reason may not here be revealed for it is hid in the nature of theelectric Fire of Spirit itself.The Jewel itself remains occultly static, and does not circulate. It is a pointof peace; it pulsates rhythmically as does the heart of man, and from it rayforth eight streams of living fire which extend to the tips of the four lovepetals and the four sacrifice petals. This eight-fold [1119] energy isatma-buddhi. It is this final raying forth which produces the eventualdisintegration of the body of the Ego. The knowledge petals, not being thesubject of the attention of this central fire in due time cease to be active;knowledge is superseded by divine wisdom and the love petals have their forcesequally absorbed. Naught is eventually left but the desire to “sacrifice,” andas the vibratory impulse is akin to the nature of the living Jewel, it issynthesised in the central living unit and only the Jewel of fire remains. Whenall the petals have merged their forces elsewhere, the process of revelation iscompleted. The lower fires die out; the central fire is absorbed, and only theradiant point of electric fire persists. Then a curious phenomenon is to be seenat the final Initiation. The Jewel of fire blazes forth as seven jewels withinthe one, or as the sevenfold electric spark, and in the intensity of the blazethus created is reabsorbed into the Monad or the One. This process is paralleledat the final consummation of solar evolution when the seven Suns blaze forthbefore the great Pralaya.All these modes of expression are but pictures which serve to convey some smallidea of the beauty, and the intricacy of the divine process as it is carried onin the microcosm, and in the macrocosm. They all serve to limit and circumscribethe reality, but to the man who has the divine eye in process of opening, and tohim who has the faculty of the higher intuition awakened, such pictures serve asa clue or key to the higher interpretation. They reveal to the student certainideas as to the nature of fire.In concluding what is to be said anent motion in the causal body, I would liketo point out that it too—on its own plane—has the three characteristics ofinertia, mobility and rhythm.Inertia characterises the stage prior to the revolution of the different tiersof petals, and this revolution only begins [1120] to be felt when the petals arebecoming active. It might be stated that the passing of the Pilgrim through theHall of Ignorance corresponds to the period of “egoic inertia.” During thisperiod, the permanent atoms are the most noticeable points of light in thelotus; they constitute the “energy feeders” of the petal. Later, as the Pilgrimon the physical plane becomes more active and the egoic lotus is consequentlyunfolding with greater rapidity, the stage of mobility supervenes, and thecircles commence their revolution. Finally, when the man treads the Path and hispurpose is intensified, the central bud unfolds, the revolution is unified, andthrough the raying forth of the fires of the Jewel, a specific rhythm is imposedupon the lotus, and its energies are stabilised. This rhythm is diverseaccording to the type of Monad concerned, or the nature of the planetary Logosof a man’s ray, his divine Prototype.By the use of certain terms, information is conveyed to the Workers of theplanet, the Brotherhood of Light, as to the nature of Ego concerned, the qualityof his Ray, the number of his vibration, and the point of evolution attained. Itwill be apparent therefore, why it is not permitted here to make public thenames of the seven rhythmic groups.One of the effects produced in the lower man via the centres, through theunified activity of the causal body, is the co-ordination of the lower energiesof the human being. These lower energies, as we know, demonstrate through themedium of:a. The three groups of centres in the three bodies.b. The etheric body itself.c. Certain centres in the physical body such as the pineal gland, the pituitarybody and the spleen.We are not here referring to the work of those centres as it is self-initiatedbecause inherent in their very nature, [1121] but to the effects to be seen inthem as the three tiers of petals function with increasing coherence, and theforce latent in the Jewel makes its presence felt. It might specifically be saidthat these effects show themselves in a threefold manner:First, they cause the group of “wheels” or centres on each plane (or in each ofthe subtler vehicles) to become fourth dimensional, and to function as “wheelswhich turn upon themselves.”Secondly, they produce the orderly distribution of force by the forming ofvarious triangles of energy within the bodies. This has been earlier dealt with,and it is only necessary here to point out that it is the energy, accumulatingin the causal body and from thence making its presence felt, which producesamong the centres the esoteric circulation of force which eventually links eachcentre up in a peculiar geometrical fashion, thus bringing every part of thenature of the lower man into subjection.Thirdly, they bring about the stimulation of certain of the glands of the bodywhich are deemed at present purely physical, and thus enable the solar Angel togrip and hold to His purpose the dense physical body.It may be helpful if the student bears in mind the fact that every centre may beconsidered as an evidence of solar energy or fire, manifesting as a medium oflower energy or fire by friction. Where these centres exist the solar Angel isenabled gradually to impose his rhythm and vibration upon that which vibrates towhat is regarded as a lower rhythm. Thus He gradually swings the entire lowerform-substance into His control.Before the final liberation but after the major part of the purificatory andaligning processes are complete, the vehicles of the initiate present awonderful appearance, due to the streams of energy from the egoic body which[1122] can reach him. The egoic lotus is unfolded, and the central “fire”displayed. Each petal and each circle of petals is pulsating with life andcolour, and is in active movement, revolving with great rapidity and with thestream of living energy circulating in every part of the lotus. The threepermanent atoms glow and blaze and form, through their rapid revolution andinterplay, what appears to be a blazing point of fire, so that it has beencalled at times “the reflection of the Jewel in the Mother’s forehead.” Theeighteen centres on the three planes (four on the mental and seven on each ofthe two lower planes) are radiant wheels of fire, each group distinguished by aspecific colour, and revolving with such rapidity that the eye can scarce followthem. The bodies are formed of the highest grades of substance, each individualatom, therefore, being capable of intensified vibration, and glowing with thelight of its own central fire. The etheric body especially is to be noticed asit is a transmitter at this stage of the purest type of prana, and deserves thename sometimes given to it of “the body of the Sun.” It is the envelope whichholds the fires of the microcosmic system; in it are centred not only the pranicfires, but those seven centres which are the transmitters of all the higherenergies from the Ego, and from the two higher material bodies. All iscentralised, and the etheric vehicle waits for use on the physical plane inco-operation with the dense medium until the man can succeed in linking theconsciousness of the two aspects of the dense body so that the continuity ispreserved. This work accomplished, the three centres which are of a strictlyphysical nature—the pineal gland, the pituitary body and the spleen-themselvesbecome luminous and radiant, and all the fires of the body are so stimulatedthat the atoms which form the physical sheath appear to radiate. This is theoccult truth behind the belief that every messenger from the Lodge and everySaviour [1123] of man is naturally a healer. The forces which flow through a manwhose atoms, centres, sheaths, and causal body form a coherent unit in full andradiant activity are of such strength and purity as to have a definite effectupon the nature of those they contact. They heal, stimulate and increase thevibration of their fellow men.All this must be somewhat realised and visioned before a man on the physicalplane will be willing to undergo the purifying discipline, and tread the Pathwhereby he finds his centre and works from that standpoint of power. He has toalign these various factors, or energy centres, and thus bring on to thephysical plane power to be used in the healing of the nations. When the glory ofa man’s inner God is seen, when his radiance shines forth then will it be saidof him as of those who have preceded him along the Path: “Then shall the Sun ofRighteousness arise with healing in his wings.” (Bible. Malachi, 4:2.)There are, in connection with human evolution, certain factors which producedefinite and important results, when connected with each other through linkingstreams of energy and therefore consciously functioning. These factors might beconsidered as follows, dividing them into two groups, each of them emphasisingthe duality of the microcosmic manifestation:Group I.1. The Knowledge Petals.2. The knowledge petal in each of the two inner circles.3. The centres on the mental plane.4. The throat centre in etheric matter.5. The alta major centre.6. The physical brain.Group II.1. The Love Petals.2. The love petal in each circle. [1124]3. The centres on the astral plane.4. The heart centre in etheric matter.5. The pituitary body.6. The sympathetic nervous system.These various alignments (when functioning with due adjustment) result in thetransmission of energy in the first case from the manasic permanent atom, and inthe second case from the buddhic permanent atom. It will be apparent, therefore,how important it is that the student duly considers the process of bringingabout a uniform alignment, and a conscious appreciation of the vibratoryprocesses of these two groups. As he brings this adjustment about, the effectupon the physical plane will be the manifestation of the powers of the Soul, andof the healing capacity; the man will become a focal point for egoic energy anda server of his race. The black magician brings about similar results by meansof the first group, only with the exception that he cannot align the knowledgepetals in the two inner groups, as the love-wisdom aspect is atrophied in hiscase. He does, however, bring through the energy of the manasic permanent atom,for the force of Mahat (of which Manas is an expression) is closely connectedwith what is erroneously called “evil.” Mahat and cosmic Evil have a closeconnection.The great Existences Who are the principle of Mahat in its cosmic sense areconnected with the lesser existences who express systemic evil. They are the sumtotal of the separative instrument, and where separation in any form exists,there is to be found ignorance, and therefore evil. Separation negatescomprehension, or knowledge of that which is to be found outside the separatedconsciousness, for separative knowledge entails identification with that whichis expressing itself through the medium of a form. Therefore, the Brothers ofthe Shadow can, and do, reach high levels along one aspect of consciousness, andtouch certain specific heights of [1125] spiritual evil, going a great way alongthe line of Mahat, or knowledge, the principle of Universal Mind. They canreach, in their later stages, expansions of consciousness and of power that willtake them far beyond the confines of our solar system, and give them attributesand capacities which prove a menace to the unfolding of the second Aspect.The first group of alignments, when not balanced by the second group, is theline of the black magician; it will lead him eventually out of the stream offivefold energy we call manasic on to the cosmic path of fohatic energy, thestrictly mahatic. When on that Path two directions are possible to him; one willkeep him in touch with the natural substance aspect concerned with the cosmicincarnations of our solar Logos; the other will sweep him on to that centre inthe universe which is the emanating source of the mahatic principle; it is thefocal point where is generated that type of energy which makes possible thedense physical manifestation of Gods and men.In making this statement, it is necessary to bear in mind that the densephysical sheath is never considered a principle. It is ever deemed occultlyevil. The matter might be more simply expressed by stating that the black adeptis frankly concerned with what is termed “the residue of that which earlierwas.” He responds to the vibration of the solar system of an earlier greatercycle in which the knowledge, or the manasic principle, was the goal ofachievement. He does not respond to the impulse of this solar system, but thislack of response is hid in the karma of the earlier manifestation. As we know,the Sons of Mind or the incarnating jivas are the returning nirvanis of aprevious logoic incarnation. They have achieved mind, and need love. Some few,through a mysterious cycle of events inexplainable to man in this solar system,repudiated opportunity and linked themselves with that great deva existencewhich is the impulse [1126] of the dense physical, and they cannot loosethemselves. Their destination, as well as his, is hidden in the plans of the ONEABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID, and in this solar system there is no hope forthem. Fortunately, they are little likely to make themselves known to averageman; it is the Adepts of the Good Law Who meet them the most often.The subject is most intricate, but some light may come, if we remember thatmanas on the mental plane is found in two expressions:—the mental unit on theform levels and the manasic permanent atom on the formless planes. These twotypes of manas may be regarded as embodying the qualities of the two kinds,white and black. The mental unit or the mind aspect of a man, for instance, isafter all but the sixth sense, and has to be transcended by the higher mind andthe intuition. The black brother carries the evolution of the senses on to astage inconceivable to man now and this sixth mahatic sense is of vaster extentand service to them than it ever is to the white Adept. Therefore, it will beapparent that for a long cycle of time, the black magician can persist anddevelop his powers because one-third of the force of the egoic lotus is his andhe knows well how to utilise it to the best advantage. He builds also anantaskarana, but of quality and objective different to that of the student ofthe white magic. It is called “the path of manasic evil,” and bridges a gapbetween the mental unit of the magician concerned, and certain correspondenceson mental levels in the vehicles of the devas of that plane. Through thismedium, and through identification with the devas , he can escape from the threeworlds to spheres of evil incomprehensible to us. The point to be rememberedhere is that the black magician remains ever a prisoner; he cannot escape fromsubstance and from form.There is no need to enlarge further on this subject. I would like to enumeratethe lines of alignment of the [1127] third group which eventually transcends theother two, and effects the final illumination and liberation of the man.Group III.1. The Sacrifice Petals.2. The sacrifice petals in the two outer groups.3. The three major centres in each of the three planes of the three worlds,producing thus absorption of the lower four centres on each plane.4. The head centre, or the thousand-petalled lotus.5. The pineal gland, producing the vivification and irradiation of the entirelower nature.These three groups of forces in man, when synthesised, produce eventually thatperfect co-ordination and adaptation to all conditions, forms and circumstanceswhich eventuate in the escape of the liberated vital spark. This is technicallyaccomplished when the “bud” opens, and it becomes possible for the Hierophant atinitiation to liberate the energy of the Monad, and to direct that energy(through the agency of the Rod) so that eventually it circulates free anduntrammelled through every part of the lower threefold manifestation. As itcirculates, it destroys by burning, for it arouses the kundalini aspectperfectly by the time the fifth Initiation is taken. The destroyer aspectbecomes dominated, and the form is “burnt upon the altar.”These ideas can also be studied in their larger aspect; a clue to the mystery ofcosmic evil may be found in the difference existing between the sacred andnon-sacred planets, and in the purpose and place, hitherto unrecognised, of thelives of the informing existences of the many planets and planetoids in thesolar system. Some are purely mahatic or of the third Aspect, dominated by thedevas. Others (of which the sacred planets are examples) are controlled by thesecond Aspect, and that second aspect will work through unconquerably intomanifestation. [1128] A few, like our Earth planet, are battlegrounds, and thetwo Aspects are in collision, with the indication of the eventual triumph of the“white” magic.VI. EFFECTS OF SYNTHETIC MOTION1. Introductory remarks on alignment .The effects of the synthetic activity of the centres, sheaths and causal bodyproduce:Periodicity of manifestation.The linking of the Triangles.The relation between:a. The alta major centre.b. The throat centre.c. The centres on the mental plane.If we summarize the thoughts conveyed here, we will find that it deals with someaspects of that very necessary alignment which must take place prior to fullability to serve in final liberation. We have studied from many angles thecomponent parts of man, the microcosm, and the mode whereby he manifests onearth in order to express that which lies hidden, and to make his energy felt inthe group and place where he finds himself. The constitution of the causal bodyhas been seen to consist of a triple form of energy, with a fourth and moredynamic type of force latent at the heart, ready to demonstrate when the otherthree forms are active, thus utilising them as a vehicle. We have noted alsothat there are also three forms of energy which we call the sheaths of thepersonal self, and which have also to be actively functioning before the tripleegoic force can make itself felt through their medium. Added to these factors,must be mentioned the seven centres in etheric matter which find their place inthe etheric body, and which awaken and become active as the sheaths swing intorhythmic activity. Of these centres the three major are of the main importancewhere [1129] egoic alignment is concerned, and their vital force only begins tomake itself felt after the lower four are fully active.A second factor which works into the general scheme here is the latent triplekundalini fire which is aroused and mounts through the triple spinal channeljust as soon as the three major centres (the head, the heart and the throat)form an esoteric triangle, and can thus pass the fiery energy hidden in eachcentre in circulatory fashion. To summarise therefore: we have perfectedalignment just as soon as the following factors have been put in touch with eachother, or as soon as their motion or activity is synthesised; this is a mostimportant subject for students of meditation, and for those who tread the Pathof attainment to consider and practically realise.1. The three tiers of petals.2. The three sheaths.3. The three major centres.4. The threefold Kundalini fire.5. The threefold spinal channel.6. The three head centres, the pineal gland, the pituitary body, the alta majorcentre. ( 320 [text00028.html#Y_FN320] )Another factor which must be allowed for in advanced stages of development, isthe third eye which is to the occultist and true white magician what the fourthenergy centre (the jewel in the lotus) is to the lotus, or to the three tiers ofpetals. The correspondence is interesting:The jewel in the lotus is the director of energy from the monad, whilst thethird eye directs the energy of the Ego on the physical plane.The jewel in the Lotus is the centre of force which links [1130] the buddhic andmental planes. When it is to be seen and felt, the man can function consciouslyon the buddhic plane. The third eye links the awakened physical plane man withthe astral or subjective world, and enables him to function consciously there.The jewel, or diamond concealed by the egoic lotus, is the window of the Monador Spirit whereby he looks outward into the three worlds. The third eye is thewindow of the Ego or soul functioning on the physical plane whereby he looksinward into the three worlds.The jewel in the lotus is situated between manas and buddhi whilst the third eyeis found between the right and left eyes.One of the main functions of the Master in this cycle (though not in all cycles)is to teach His pupil how to reconcile all these factors, how to synthesisetheir various modes of motion or expression, and how to co-ordinate them all sothat the vibration is uniform. When energy from the Ego controls, or imposes itsrhythm upon the various sheaths via their respective major centres, when thetriple fire is mounting in orderly fashion via the triple channel, and when thethree head centres are united in triangular fashion, then we have illuminationor the irradiance of the entire personality life, darkness gives place to light,and the Sun of Knowledge arises and dispels the darkness of ignorance. The minorcentres are concerned with the internal co-ordination of the sheath, the majorwith the group co-ordination or the interrelation of one sheath to another. Theman becomes a burning and a shining light, radiating forth a light which burnsfrom within.When the next step is accomplished, and the energy of the Monad, focussedthrough the jewel, makes itself felt also on the physical plane, passing throughthe triple egoic lotus via the channels already utilised by the Ego, [1131] wehave a man who is “inspired,” who is a spiritual creator, and who is himself “aSun of Healing Radiance.”These are the objectives before all those who tread the path and the goal aheadfor those who follow the necessary discipline of life, and the stages ofunfoldment through meditation. There are, needless to say, certain modes of workand mantric formulas known to the Masters which enable Them to hasten theprocess (when necessary) for Their disciples, but these are secrets scrupulouslyguarded and not frequently used. The usual method, a lengthy and laborious one,is to let the pupil find out each step of the way for himself, to teach him theconstitution of his own body, the nature of the sheaths, and the function andapparatus of energy and so let him gradually become aware of the forces latentin himself. What is meant by the “three periodical vehicles” and the sevenprinciples or qualities of force, is slowly revealed to him, and throughexperience, experiment, frequent failures, occasional success, mature reflectionand introspection, and frequent incarnation, he is brought to the point where hehas produced a certain measure of alignment through self-induced and continuouseffort. He is then taught how to utilise that alignment, and how to manipulateenergy consciously so that he can bring about on the physical plane results inservice that for many lives have been probably a dream or an impossible vision.When he is proficient in these two things—stabilisation and manipulation—then,and only then, are committed to him the words and secrets which produce thedemonstration on the physical plane of spiritual, or monadic, energy by means ofthe soul or egoic energy, utilising in its turn the energy of the material formsin the worlds, or what we might call bodily energy. This has been expressed inthe following mystical and occult phrase:“When the jewel sparkles as does the diamond under the influence of the rays ofthe blazing sun, then the setting likewise [1132] gleams and rays forth light.As the diamond shines with increasing brilliance, the fire is generated whichsets on fire that which held and enclosed.”2. Motion produces periodic manifestation.We must here bear in mind, that we are considering synthetic alignment inconnection with the second aspect, and are therefore dealing with the activityof those forms of divine manifestation which are nearing their objective. Thisobjective might be defined as ability to vibrate synchronously with the greaterunit of which it is a part. This must, therefore, be considered by the studentin seven ways.The first three ways concern the relation of the perfected or nearly perfectedunits in the three kingdoms of nature with their immediate group soul, and theircontinued manifestation in any particular kingdom.Fourth, the relation of the disciple, or man on the path, to his immediategroup, and the laws which govern his reappearance in physical incarnation.Fifth, the relation of a planetary Spirit to His group of planets, and theprocesses of man’s obscuration, or withdrawal, from physical planemanifestation.Sixth, the relation of the major three planetary Spirits, or the three majoraspects of the Logos and their manifestation.Seventh, the relation of the informing Life of a solar system to the group ofconstellations of which He forms part, and His periodic manifestation.These subjects have been touched upon when we studied incarnation and, earlierstill, when considering pralaya or obscuration, but we dealt then with them ingeneral terms. We might now deal more specifically with the final activities, ormodes of motion, in these various congeries of lives, and see what occurs duringthe final stages of conscious existence, and of limited manifestation. Thesubject [1133] is peculiarly abstruse, particularly where the elemental groupsare concerned, but certain interesting points might here be brought out whichwill bear the closest study. Let us consider the three lower kingdoms first andpass later to the methods and activities of a human being, of a planetary Logos,and of a solar Logos.The appearance, and the final disappearance, of any manifested Life isintimately concerned with the possession, the evolutionary development, and thefinal disintegration, of the permanent atom. Permanent atoms, as the term isusually understood, are the property of those lives only who have achievedself-consciousness, or individuality, and therefore relative permanence in timeand space. The permanent atom may be viewed as the focal point of manifestationon any particular plane. It serves, if I may use so peculiar a term, as theanchor for any particular individual in any particular sphere, and this is trueof the three great groups of self-conscious Lives:a . The incarnating Jivas, or human beings,b . The planetary Logoi,c . The solar Logos.We must remember here that all the atomic subplanes of the seven planes form theseven spirillae of the logoic permanent atom, for this has a close bearing uponthe subject under consideration.The units, therefore, in the three lower kingdoms possess no permanent atoms butcontribute to the formation of those atoms in the higher kingdoms. Certain widegeneralisations might here be made, though too literal or too identified aninterpretation should not be put upon them.First, it might be said that the lowest or mineral kingdom provides that vitalsomething which is the essence of the physical permanent atom of the humanbeing. It provides that energy which is the negative basis for the [1134]positive inflow which can be seen pouring in through the upper depression of thephysical permanent atom.Secondly, the vegetable kingdom similarly provides the negative energy for theastral permanent atom of a man, and thirdly, the animal kingdom provides thenegative force which when energised by the positive is seen as the mental unit.This energy which is contributed by the three lower kingdoms is formed of thevery highest vibration of which that kingdom is capable, and serves as a linkbetween man and his various sheaths, all of which are allied to one or other ofthe lower kingdoms.a. The mental body mental unit animal kingdom. b. The astral body astralpermanent atom vegetable kingdom. c. The physical body physical permanent atommineral kingdom.In man these three types of energy are brought together, and synthesised, andwhen perfection of the personality is reached, and the vehicles aligned, wehave:a. The energy of the mental unit positive. b. The energy of the astral permanentatom equilibrised. c. The energy of the physical permanent atom negative.Man is then closely linked with the three lower kingdoms by the best that theycan provide, and they have literally given him his permanent atoms, and enabledhim to manifest through their activity. The above three groups might be studiedalso from the standpoint of the three Gunas: ( 321 [text00028.html#Y_FN321] )[1135]1. Tamas inertia mineral kingdom physical permanent atom. 2. Rajas activityvegetable kingdom astral permanent atom. 3. Sattva rhythm animal kingdom mentalunit.All these must be regarded only from the point of view of the personality, thelower self, or not-self. In illustration of this idea, it might be pointed outthat when the animal body of prehuman man was rhythmically adjusted, and hadattained its highest or sattvic vibration, then individualisation becamepossible, and a true human being appeared in manifestation.Each kingdom is positive to the one next below it, and between them is foundthat period of manifestation which bridges the two, and connects the positiveand the negative. The types of most intense rajas or activity in the mineralkingdom are found in those forms of life which are neither mineral nor vegetablebut which bridge the two. Similarly in the vegetable kingdom, the rajas periodis seen in fullest expression just before the activity becomes rhythmic and thevegetable merges in the animal. In the animal kingdom the same is seen in theanimals which individualise, passing out of the group soul into separatedidentity. These types of activity must be regarded as constituting for themineral, physical activity, for the vegetable, sentient activity, and for theanimal, rudimentary mental activity.When this triple activity is achieved it might be noted that the dense physicalbody of the solar or planetary Logos is fully developed, and conscious contactcan then [1136] be made with the etheric or vital body. It is this contact whichproduces man , for Spirit (as man understands the term) is after all but theenergy, vitality, or essential life of the solar, or planetary Logos. Itscorrespondence in man is prana. A comprehension of this will be brought about ifman realises that all the planes of our solar system are but the seven subplanesof the cosmic physical plane. It is the realisation of this which willeventually unite science and religion, for what the scientist calls energy, thereligious man calls God, and yet the two are one, being but the manifestedpurpose, in physical matter, of a great extra-systemic Identity. Nature is theappearance of the physical body of the Logos, and the laws of nature are thelaws governing the natural processes of that body. The Life of God, His energy,and vitality, are found in every manifested atom; His essence indwells allforms. This we call Spirit, yet He Himself is other than those forms, just asman knows himself to be other than his bodies. He knows himself to be a will,and a purpose, and as he progresses in evolution that purpose and will become tohim ever more consciously defined. So with the planetary Logos and solar Logos.They dwell within, yet are found without, the planetary scheme or solar system.It is useful to remember that in the three lower kingdoms, manifestation, orappearance on the physical plane, is ever group manifestation and not theappearance of separated units. Each group soul, as it is called, is divided intoseven parts which appear in each of the seven races of a world period, and thereis an interesting distinction between them and the units of the human kingdom.When portions of the group soul in one of its seven parts are out of incarnationthey are to be found on the astral plane, even though the Mother group soul isfound on the mental plane. Human units of the fourth kingdom when out ofincarnation pass through the astral to the mental and descend again toincarnation from mental levels. [1137] Each group soul, therefore, subjectivelyforms a triangle of force with one point (the highest) to be found on the mentalplane, the lowest on the etheric levels of the physical plane, and another onthe astral plane. The third point for the mineral group-soul is found on thesecond subplane of the astral, the vegetable on the third, and the animal on thefourth. It is owing to the fact that a centre of force for the animal group soulis found on the fourth subplane of the astral plane that it is possible fortransference eventually to be made out of that kingdom into the fourth.Certain laws govern the appearance periodically of the three kingdoms of nature,which are the laws of involution, the laws of the elemental kingdoms, and thelaws of the three great groups which hold the germs and seeds of all manifestedforms. We have in logoic manifestation the following seven groups forconsideration:1. 2. 3. Three groups of superhuman existence:a. The group forming the Father aspect of which little can here be predicated.b. The group of seven planetary Logoi.c. The group of seven raja devas, or the life of each of the physical planes.4. A group of solar lives who are the manasaputras or man.5. 6. 7. Three groups of elemental lives, who form the three involutionaryelemental kingdoms.These three lower groups achieve concretion, and enter the upward arc, throughthe medium of the three lower kingdoms. The fourth group is the most importantin some ways during the present cycle for it borrows from all the other sixgroups and is therefore the synthesis of energies taken from each andmanifested. The higher three groups are closely allied, and until a man haspassed out of the period of existence wherein he is controlled by [1138] thatwhich he has borrowed from the three lower kingdoms, he cannot comprehend thenature and purpose of the three higher. We might express the matter as follows:The three higher groups are sattvic.The three lower groups are tamasic.The fourth group, or human, is rajasic.Again, the three higher groups are energised by three streams of force whichenter along the line of the three spirillae of the logoic permanent atom. Thethree lower groups are energised by energy entering by the three lowestspirillae (which we call the three lowest planes) and these spirillae energisethe logoic dense body, were vitalised in the previous solar system, and are nolonger in any way controlling factors in logoic existence. The fourth group, thehuman, is energised by the force of the fourth spirilla, to which we give thename of buddhic energy, and this fourth group has, therefore, the problem ofbringing about conditions whereby the buddhic vibrations may dominate the other,and lower, three. It is this imposition which eventually releases the humanunits, and permits of their passing into the higher group. The elemental groupsouls find correspondences in the higher—first, in the human kingdom in thethree main groups of Egos, in whom the three types of energy predominate; againin the three main or major planetary groups, and finally in the three aspects.Elemental group animal kingdom Sattvic Solar Logos Uranus. Father aspect.Elemental group vegetable kingdom Rajasic Planetary Logoi Neptune. Son aspectElemental group mineral kingdom Tamasic Plane devas. Saturn. Mother, Brahmaaspect.[1139] The fourth or human group, unites all three lives. The periodicmanifestation of the three elemental groups (through the medium of the threelower kingdoms) is, therefore, governed by factors hidden in the nature of thatgreat vibration which we call tamasic , or heavy rhythm. It is the vibration ofBrahma, the third aspect, the mother or matter aspect. Their appearance,therefore, is one of a very slow manifestation, the seven subsidiary vibrationsbringing in one or other of the seven groups of each group soul in a very slowalternation. The cycles cannot be given; two things only can be said: theappearance of these groups as units in manifestation is controlled by threefactors:1. The moon, for these are the many lunar fathers.2. The ray in manifestation at any time.3. The karma of the informing Life of any kingdom.The second consideration is the karma and life-history of the planetary entity.He sleeps and awakes; he is the embodiment of tamas, and as he progresses andevolves so do the lower kingdoms.The lunar pitris are to the planetary entity what the three major centres are toman or to the Logoi. The lunar Pitris who contribute the human form are (to theplanetary entity) the correspondence to the head centre. Those who are thefathers of the vegetable forms correspond to his heart centre , whilst thePitris of the mineral kingdom are analogous to the throat centre . This is allvery obscure but hints of much value lie here.It is not possible to give much further information relative to the periodicalappearing of the subhuman forms of life. The subject is too obscure, and thedetail too vast. Until the student has fitted himself to appreciate [1140] thesymbolic, or hieroglyphic writings of the adepts, ( 322 [text00028.html#Y_FN322]) it is impossible for him to grasp the matter. Much of the teaching on thismatter is found in records in the department of the Manu, as it concernsprimarily the initial stages of form building. It might be said that theappearance of any life in manifestation is due to primary activity on the partof some Entity, which activity is largely the expression of the first Ray. Thisconcerns the periodical manifestation of the life or lives of any round just asit concerns also the ephemeral existence of a dragon fly; it deals with the formthrough which what we call a race is evolving and concerns itself with the tinylife of an individual in that race. The same laws govern all, though theresponse to the law may be relative and in degree. This law has the generic nameof the “Law of Cycles,” and is expressed in terms of time; [1141] but the secretto the cycles may not as yet be given as it would convey to the intuitive toomuch dangerous information. It is the knowledge of this law as it concernsrounds, races, subraces, groups (involutionary and evolutionary) and individuals(human and superhuman) which enables the Lords of Karma, and the Adepts of thegood Law, to manipulate force or energy, and so carry all that is, on to itstriumphant conclusion. In connection with this, students may get much light onthis difficult question of force if they bear in mind that every form in everykingdom on the downward, and the upward arc, is in itself a negative forceimpelled into activity by a positive force and demonstrating as a combination ofthe two. The distinctions are demonstrated in the fact that some forms arenegative-positive, others positive-negative, whilst still others are at thepoint of equilibrium. This includes all the intermediate stages. The Builders ofthe cosmos work under cyclic law consciously, and utilise the aggregate of theseforces in any kingdom, any group or any unit to bring about the consummation ofthe plan.It would interest men much if they could see and interpret some of the recordsin the hierarchical records, for in them men and angels, minerals and elements,animals and vegetables, kingdoms and groups, Gods and ants are specified interms of energy formulas and by a scrutiny of these records the approximateincrease of vibration in any form of any kind can be found out at any time. Thismight be expressed in terms also of the Gunas; it will be found by disciples(when permitted access to the records) that they themselves, along with everyother expression of the divine life, are described by a triple formula whichconveys to the mind of the initiate the proportions of tamas or inertia, ofrajas or activity, and of sattva or rhythm to be found in any form. This,therefore, through correspondences, imparts knowledge as to past achievement,present opportunity and the immediate [1142] future of any unit or embodiedlife, manifesting under any of the three aspects.Another series of files in the records give—under a differentformula—information as to what is esoterically called “the heat content” of anyunit, “the radiating light” of any form, and the “magnetic force” of every life.It is through this knowledge that the Lipikas control the bringing in, and thepassing out, of every Life, divine, superhuman, solar and human, and it isthrough a consideration of that formula which is the basic formula for a solarsystem that the physical plane appearance of a solar Logos is controlled, andthe length of a cosmic pralaya settled. We must not forget that the Lipika Lordsof the solar system have Their cosmic prototypes, and that These have Theirfeeble and groping human reflections in the great astronomical scientists whoendeavour to ascertain facts anent the heavenly bodies, being subconsciouslyaware of the existence of these cosmic formulas conveying information as to thespecific gravity, constitution, radiation, magnetic pull, heat and light of anysun, solar system, or constellation. Many of them in future and remote ages willpass to a full comprehension, and will have the formulas committed to theircare, thus joining the ranks of the Lipikas. It is a peculiar line, requiringcycles of careful training in divine mathematics.The Lipika Lords, controlling the periodical manifestation of life are, roughlyspeaking, divided into the following groups, which it might be of interest tonote:1. Three extra-systemic or cosmic Lords of Karma, Who work from a centre inSirius through the medium of three representatives. These form a group aroundthe solar Logos, and hold to Him a position analogous to the three Buddhas ofActivity Who stand around Sanat Kumara. [1143]2. Three Lipika Lords Who are the karmic agents working through the threeaspects.3. Nine Lipikas Who are the sumtotal of the agents for the Law working throughwhat the Qabbalah calls the nine Sephiroth.4. Seven presiding agents of karma for each one of the seven schemes.These four groups correspond in manifestation to the Unmanifested, manifestingthrough the triple Aspects, and under Them work an infinity of lesser agents.These lesser agents might again be somewhat differentiated, each of thefollowing groups being found in every scheme and on every ray-emanation.1. The Lipika Lords of a scheme Who, through the manipulation of forces, make itpossible for a planetary Logos to incarnate under the Law, and work out Hiscyclic problem.2. Those who (under the first group) control the destiny of a chain.3. Those who are the energy-directors of a globe.4. Agents of every kind Who are concerned with the karmic adjustments, incidentupon the periodical manifestation of such forms as:a. A round, seven in all.b. A kingdom in nature, seven in all.c. The human kingdom.d. A rootrace, subrace and branch race.e. A nation, a family, a group, and their correspondences in all the kingdoms.f. A plane.g. The reptile and insect world.h. The bird evolution.i. The devas.j . Human units, egoic groups, monadic lives, [1144] and myriads of other forms,objective and subjective, planetary and interplanetary, in connection with theSun, and in connection with the planetoids.All work with energy emanations, and with force units under cyclic law, and allhave the same objective,—the producing of perfected activity, intensification ofheat, and of radiant magnetic light as an expression of the will or purpose ofeach embodied life.Periodicity of manifestation is the cyclic appearance of certain forms ofspecified energy, and this is true whether a man is speaking of a solar system,of a Ray, of the appearance of a planet in space, or of the phenomenon of humanbirth. Certain factors extraneous to any energy unit under consideration, willinevitably affect its appearance, and act as deflecting or directing agents. TheLaw of Cycles has ever been regarded as one of the most difficult for a man tomaster, and it has been truly said that when a man has mastered itstechnicalities, and can understand its methods of time computation, he hasattained initiation. Its intricacies are so numerous and so bound up with thestill greater law, that of cause and effect, that practically the whole range ofpossible knowledge is thereby surmounted. To comprehend this law involvesability to:a. Deal with the higher mathematical formulas of the solar system.b . Compute the relationship between a unit of any degree and the greater wholeupon whose vibration that unit is swept into periodic display.c. Read the akashic records of a planetary system.d. Judge of karmic effects in time and space.e. Differentiate between the four streams of karmic effects as they concern thefour kingdoms of nature.f. Distinguish between the three main streams of energy [1145] —the units ofinertia, mobility and rhythm—and note the key of each unit, and its place in thegreat group of transitional points. These latter units are those who are on thecrest of one of the three waves, and ready, therefore, to be transferred into awave of a higher vibratory capacity.g. Enter the Hall of Records and there read a peculiar group of documentsdealing with planetary manifestation in a fourfold manner. It concerns theplanetary Logos, and deals with the transference of energy from the moon chain.It concerns the transmission of energy to another planetary scheme, and concernsthe interaction between the human Hierarchy (the fourth Kingdom) and the greatinforming Life of the animal kingdom.When a man can do all these things and has earned the right to know that whichproduces the phenomenon of manifestation, he has earned the right to enter intothe councils of the planetary Hierarchy, and himself to direct streams of energyupon, through and out of the planet.Some idea of the complexity governing the periodical manifestation of a humanbeing may be gathered by a consideration of the forces which bring human unitsinto manifestation, which produce individualisation; this is, after all, theappearing of a third stream of energy in conjunction with two others. A man isthe meeting ground of three streams of force, one or other preponderatingaccording to his peculiar type.Let us briefly enumerate these factors and thus get some idea as to thecomplexity of the matter:The first and paramount factor is the ray upon which a particular human unit isfound. This means, that there are seven specialised force streams, each with itspeculiar quality, type and rhythm. The matter is further complicated by the factthat though the Ray of the Monad is its [1146] main qualifying factor, yet twosubsidiary Rays, those of the Ego and of the personality, have likewise to beconsidered.Secondly, it must be borne in mind that the human units now upon this planetfall naturally into two great groups—those who reached individualisation, orbecame “units of self-directing energy,” upon the moon, and those who attainedself-consciousness upon the earth. There are important distinctions betweenthese two groups, for the units of the moon chain are distinguished, not only bya more advanced development, owing to the longer period of their evolution, butalso by the quality of great and intelligent activity, for (as might beexpected) on the third or moon chain, the third Ray was a dominant factor. Inthis fourth chain, the quaternary dominates, or the synthesis of the three so asto produce a fourth, and this is one reason for the intensely material nature ofthose who entered the human kingdom on this planet. The distinctions between thetwo groups are very great, and one of the mysteries lying behind the maindivisions of humanity—rulers and the ruled, capitalists and labourers, thegoverned and those who govern—is found right here. No system of sociologicalreform will be successfully worked out without a due consideration of thisimportant fact. Other distinguishing features might be enumerated but would onlyserve at this stage to complicate the matter.A third factor differentiating the groups of human units who reachedself-consciousness on our planet is hidden in the methods employed by the Lordsof the Flame at that time. They, we are told, employed three methods.First, They themselves took bodies and thus energised certain of the higherforms of the animal kingdom, so that they appeared as man, and thus initiated aparticular group. Their descendants can be seen in the highest [1147] specimensof the earth humanity now on earth. They are not even now, however, as faradvanced as the groups of units from the moon chain who came in in Atlanteandays. Their heredity is peculiar.They implanted a germ of mind in the secondary group of animal-men who wereready for individualisation. This group, for a long time, was unable to expressitself, and was most carefully nurtured by the Lords of Flame, nearly proving afailure. By the time, however, that the last subrace of the Lemurian root racewas at its height it suddenly came into the forefront of the then civilisation,and justified hierarchical effort.Thirdly, They fostered the germ of instinct in certain groups of animal-menuntil it flowered into mind. It must never be forgotten that men have withinthemselves (apart from any extraneous fostering) the ability to arrive , and toachieve full self-consciousness.These three methods bring us to the fourth factor which must be remembered, thatof the three modes of motion which powerfully affect the incarnating jivas.The Sons of Mind are distinguished by the three qualities of matter as has beenearlier brought out, and they have been generically called:1. The Sons of sattvic rhythm,2. The Sons of mobility,3. The Sons of inertia.These qualities are the characteristics of the three major Rays, and of thethree Persons of the Godhead; they are the qualities of consciousness—material,intelligent, and divine. They are the predominating characteristics of thechains of which our earth is one.[1148]Earth Planetary SchemeFirst Chain Archetypal. Second Chain Sattvic Rhythm. Third Chain Mobility.Fourth Chain Inertia. Fifth Chain Mobility. Sixth Chain Sattvic Rhythm. SeventhChain Perfection.The factors which we have considered as affecting the different incarnatingunits have a vital effect on their cyclic evolution, and the ray and the threemain types produce varying periodic appearance. Certain statements have beenmade in occult books as to the length of time varying between incarnations. Suchstatements are in the main inaccurate, for they make no allowance for Raydifference, and permit of no calculations as to whether the human unit involvedis a unit of inertia, a sattvic point, or a rajasic entity. No hard and fastrule can be laid down at this time for the general public, though such rulesexist, and are governed by seven different formulas for the three main types.Within this sevenfold differentiation, exist many lesser, and the wise studentrefrains from dogmatic assertion on this most peculiar and difficult subject.The fringe of the matter has but been touched upon here. It should be rememberedthat in the earlier stages of incarnation, the unit is governed mainly by groupappearance, and comes into incarnation with his group.As time progresses and his own will or purpose becomes more distinctive, he willat times force himself into manifestation independently of his group, as willother group units, and this leads to an apparent confusion which is detrimentalto the surface calculations of the superficial student. When this is the case,the particular unit concerned has his record transferred into another file inthe hierarchical archives, and becomes what is occultly termed “a self directedpoint of fire.” He is then strongly individualised, entirely self-engrossed,free of [1149] all group sense, except the earthly affiliations to which headheres from the instinct of self-protection and personal well-being. In thisstage he remains for a vast period of time, and has before him the mastering ofa later stage in which he returns to the earlier group recognition on a higherturn of the spiral.The rules governing the incarnations of average man have been consideredelsewhere, and much information has been given in this treatise and in Letterson Occult Meditation which—if collated—will provide sufficient data for studyfor a long time. Not much has been given anent the incarnations of disciples andthe methods involved in the later stages of evolution.It should here be borne in mind that (for a disciple) direct alignment with theEgo via the centres and the physical brain is the goal of his life of meditationand of discipline. This is in order that the Inner God may function in fullconsciousness and wield full control on the physical plane. Thus will humanitybe helped and group concerns furthered. Again it must be remembered that thebasic Ray laws and the disciple’s particular type will paramountly dictate hisappearances, but certain other forces begin to hold sway which might here betouched upon.The factors governing the appearance in incarnation of a disciple are asfollows:First, his desire to work off karma rapidly and so liberate himself for service.The Ego impresses this desire upon the disciple during incarnation, and thusobviates any counter desire on his part for the bliss of devachan, or even forwork on the astral plane. The whole objective, therefore, of the disciple afterdeath is to get rid of his subtler bodies, and acquire new ones. There is nodesire for a period of rest, and as desire is the governing factor in thissystem of desire, and particularly in this planetary scheme, if it exists not,there is no incentive to fulfilment. [1150] The man, therefore, absents himselffrom the physical plane for a very brief time, and is driven by his Ego into aphysical body with great rapidity.Second, to work out some piece of service under direction of his Master. Thiswill involve some adjustments, and occasionally the temporary arresting of hiskarma. These adjustments are made by the Master with the concurrence of thedisciple, and are only possible in the case of an accepted disciple of somestanding. It does not mean that karma is set aside, but only that certain forcesare kept in abeyance until a designated group work has been accomplished.Third, a disciple will return into incarnation occasionally so as to fit intothe plan of a greater than himself. When a messenger of the Great Lodge needs avehicle through which to express Himself, and cannot use a physical bodyHimself, owing to the rarity of its substance, He will utilise the body of adisciple. We have an instance of this in the manner the Christ used the body ofthe initiate Jesus, taking possession of it at the time of the Baptism. Againwhen a message has to be given out to the world during some recurring cycle, adisciple of high position in a Master’s group will appear in physicalincarnation, and be “overshadowed” or “inspired” (in the technically occultsense) by some teacher greater than he.Fourth, a disciple may, through lack of rounded development, be very faradvanced along certain lines but lack what is called the full intensification ofa particular principle. He may, therefore, decide (with the full concurrence ofhis Ego and of his Master) to take a series of rapidly recurring incarnationswith the intention of working specifically at bringing a certain quality, orseries of qualities, to a point of higher vibratory content, thus completing therounding of his sphere of manifestation. This accounts for the peculiar, yetpowerful, people who are [1151] met at times; they are so one-pointed andapparently so unbalanced that their sole attention is given to one line ofdevelopment only, so much so that the other lines are hardly apparent. Yet theirinfluence seems great, and out of all proportion to their superficial worth. Arealisation of these factors will deter the wise student from hasty judgments,and from rapid conclusions concerning his fellow men.Occasionally a variation of this reason for rapid and immediate incarnation isseen when an initiate (who has nearly completed his cycle) appears inincarnation to express almost entirely one perfected principle. This he does forthe good of a particular group which—though engaged in work for humanity—isfailing somewhat in its objective through the lack of a particular quality, orstream of force. When this becomes apparent on the inner side, some advanceddisciple puts the energy of that particular quality at the disposal of theHierarchy, and is sent forth to balance that group, and frequently to do so fora period of rapidly succeeding lives.These are a few of the causes governing the periodic manifestation of those whoare grouped in the Hierarchical records as “the aligned points of fire.” Theyare distinguished by the energy flowing through them, by the magnetic quality oftheir work, by their powerful group effects, and by their physical planerealisation of the plan.The coming into manifestation of the superhuman lives (such as greater liberatedExistences, or the raja-devas of a plane), the appearing of the planetary Logoiand the solar Logoi in physical incarnation is governed by laws similar innature to those governing the human unit, but of a cosmic scope. It will beapparent to the most superficial student that the gradual emergence of a planeout of the darkness which exists between systems is produced not only as theresult of vibratory response to the enunciated Word, but as the working out ofthe karma of a [1152] cosmic Life and the relationship existing between thatparticular Life and the cosmic Existence Whom we call Brahma or the third Personof the Trinity. The deva Ruler of a plane is a superhuman Entity Who comes inunder a great cosmic impulse to provide the vibratory form which will makepossible the appearing of other and lesser forms. The Lords of the Rays, or theplanetary Logoi, are similarly and karmically linked with the second aspectlogoic, or with that manifesting Life we call Vishnu. It will thus be seen thatthree main impulses, each emanating from the will, plan, or conscious purpose ofa cosmic Entity are responsible for all that is seen and known in our solarsystem. This, of course, has been oft emphasised in different occult books butthe following tabulation may be of service:Cosmic Entity Systemic Entities Number of Impulses Quality 1. Brahma The RajaLords 7...Activity Inertia. 2. Vishnu The Planetary Logoi 7...Wisdom Mobility.3. Shiva The Solar Logos 1....Will Rhythm.It should be noted here that the above tabulation will apply to the microcosm aswell as the macrocosm, and students will find it interesting to work it out.3. Triangular Linking.Enough has been indicated in this Treatise to show the general plan underlyingand accounting for systemic emergence or incarnation, and it is not my purposehere to enlarge at great length. Just as it is not possible for man in an earlyincarnation to conceive of the effects of evolution upon him and to realise thenature of the man upon the Path, so it is not possible for even great [1153]systemic existences to conceive (except in the broadest and most general terms)of the nature of the solar Logos, and of the effect evolution will have on Him.Suffice it to add, anent this matter, that when certain vast cosmic alignmentshave been made and the energy from the logoic causal ovoid on the cosmic mentalplanes is able to flow unimpeded through to the physical plane atom (our solarsystem) great eventualities and unconceived of possibilities will then takeplace.Certain phenomena likewise of a secondary nature to this major happening willalso take place as the cycles slip away which may be generally summarised asfollows:First. Certain systemic triangles will be formed which will permit of theinterplay of energy between the different planetary schemes, and thus bring tomore rapid maturity the plans and purposes of the Lives concerned. It should benoted here that when we are considering the transmission of energy throughalignment and through the forming of certain triangles, it is always inconnection with the energy of the first aspect. It deals with the transmissionof electric fire . It is important to bear this in mind, as it preserves theanalogy between the macrocosm and the microcosm with accuracy.Second. A final systemic triangle will be formed which will be one of supremeforce, for it will be utilised by the abstracted essence and energies of theseptenate of schemes as the negative basis for the reception of positiveelectric energy. This electric energy is able to circulate through the schemesowing to the bringing about of a cosmic alignment. It is the bringing in of thisterrific spiritual force during the final stages of manifestation which resultsin the blazing forth of the seven suns. ( 323 [text00028.html#Y_FN323] ) Thoughthe seven have become the three, this is only in [1154] connection with thedense physical planets. The blazing forth spoken of in the occult books and inthe Secret Doctrine is in etheric matter; it is this etheric fiery energy whichbrings to a consummation (and so destroys) the remaining three major schemes. Inthis we have a correspondence to the burning of the causal body at the fourthInitiation through the merging of the three fires. It is only a correspondence,and the details must not be pushed too far. The Saturn scheme is esotericallyregarded as having absorbed the “frictional fires of systemic space”; Neptune islooked upon as the repository of the “solar flames,” and Uranus as the home of“fire electric.” When, through extra-systemic activity based upon three causes:1. Logoic alignment,2. The taking of a logoic Initiation,3. The action of the “ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID,”these three schemes are simultaneously stimulated and the fires pass from one toanother in a triangular manner, they then too pass into obscuration. Naught isleft save the blazing etheric suns and these—through very intensity ofburning—dissipate with great rapidity. [1155]4. Relation between the Throat, Alta Major and Mental Centres.The question of the centres has always had a great deal of interest for men, andmuch harm has been done through the directing of attention upon the physicalcentres. Unfortunately, names have been given to the centres which have theircounterparts in the physical form, and with the usual aptitude of man toidentify himself with that which is tangible and physical, a mass of data hasaccumulated which is based (not on spiritual knowledge) but on a study of theeffects produced through meditation on the physical centres. Such meditation isonly safely undertaken when a man is no longer polarised in the lower personalself but views all things from the standpoint of the Ego with whom he iscompletely identified. When this is the case, the centres in physical matter arerecognised as being simply focal points of energy located in the etheric body,and having a definite use. This use is to act as transmitters of certain formsof energy consciously directed by the Ego or Self, with the intent of drivingthe physical body (which is not a principle) to fulfil egoic purpose. To do thisthe Ego has to follow certain rules, to conform to law, and to have attained notonly conscious control of the physical body, but a knowledge of the laws ofenergy, and of the constitution of the etheric body, and its relation to thephysical. The attention of students must be called to certain fundamental factsanent the centres and thus supplement, correlate, and summarise that alreadygiven in this Treatise. That a certain amount of repetition will be necessary isof value, and the information here given and the correspondences indicated,should provide all followers of raja yoga with a basis for sane consideration,wise meditation and a fuller comprehension of the truths involved. Owing to therapid development of the race, and the future [1156] quick unfoldment of ethericvision, the gain will be very real if occult students have at least atheoretical concept of the nature of that which will be seen relatively so soon.The centres, as we know, are seven in number and are formed in matter of theetheric subplanes of the physical plane. As we have been told, there areliterally ten, but the lower three are not considered as subjects for thedirection of egoic energy. They relate to the perpetuation of the physical formand have a close connection with:a. The three lower kingdoms in nature.b. The three lower subplanes of the physical plane.c. The third solar system, from the logoic standpoint.It must be borne in mind that though the three solar systems (the past, thepresent and that which is to come) are differentiated in time and space wherethe consciousness of man is concerned, from the point of view of the Logos theyrepresent more accurately, highest, intermediate and lowest, and the three formbut one expression. The past system, therefore, is deemed esoterically thethird, being the lowest and being related to the dense and negative matter. Itwill be apparent that the past solar system has consequently a close relation tothe third or animal kingdom, and this, man has presumably transcended.The seven centres with which man is concerned are themselves found to exist intwo groups: a lower four, which are related to the four Rays of Attributes, orthe four minor rays, and are, therefore, closely connected with the quaternary,both microcosmic and macrocosmic, and a higher three which are transmitters forthe three rays of aspect.These energy centres are transmitters of energy from [1157] many and variedsources which might be briefly enumerated as follows:a. From the seven Rays, via the seven subrays of any specific monadic ray.b. From the triple aspects of the planetary Logos as He manifests through ascheme.c. From what are called “the sevenfold divisions of the logoic Heart,” or thesun in its sevenfold essential nature, as it is seen lying esoterically behindthe outer physical solar form.d. From the seven Rishis of the Great Bear; this pours in via the Monad and istransmitted downward, merging on the higher levels of the mental plane withseven streams of energy from the Pleiades which come in as the psychical forcedemonstrating through the solar Angel.All these various streams of energy are passed through certain groups orcentres, becoming more active and demonstrating with a freer flow as the courseof evolution is pursued. As far as man is concerned at present, this energy allconverges, and seeks to energise his physical body, and direct his action viathe seven etheric centres. These centres receive the force in a threefoldmanner:a . Force from the Heavenly Man and, therefore, from the seven Rishis of theGreat Bear via the Monad.b. Force from the Pleiades, via the solar Angel or Ego.c. Force from the planes, from the Raja Devas of a plane, or fohatic energy, viathe spirillae of a permanent atom.It is this fact which accounts for the gradual growth and development of a man.At first it is the force of the plane substance, which directs him, causing himto identify [1158] himself with the grosser substance and to consider himself aman, a member of the fourth Kingdom, and to be convinced, therefore, that he isthe Not-Self. Later as force from the Ego pours in, his psychical evolutionproceeds (I use the word “psychical” here in its higher connotation) and hebegins to consider himself as the Ego, the Thinker, the One who uses the form.Finally, energy from the Monad begins to be responded to and he knows himself tobe neither the man nor the angel, but a divine essence or Spirit. These threetypes of energy demonstrate during manifestation as Spirit, Soul, and Body, andthrough them the three aspects of the Godhead meet and converge in man, and lielatent in every atom.The sevenfold energy of the planes, and therefore of substance, finds itsconsummation when the four lower centres are fully active. The sevenfold energyof the psyche, the consciousness aspect, demonstrates when the three higher inthe three worlds are vibrating with accuracy. The sevenfold activity of spiritmakes itself felt when each of these seven centres is not only fully active butis rotating as “wheels turning upon themselves,” when they are fourthdimensional and are not only individually alive but are all linked up with thesevenfold head centre. A man is then seen as he is truly—a network of fire withflaming focal points, transmitting and circulating fiery energy. These centresnot only receive the energy through the top of the head, or through a pointslightly above the top of the head, to be more accurate, but pass it out throughthe head centre likewise, that which is being passed out being seen as differingin colour, being brighter and vibrating more rapidly than that which is beingreceived. The etheric body is formed of a negative aspect of fire, and is therecipient of a positive fire. As the various types of fire blend, merge, andcirculate, they gain thereby and produce definite effects in the fires of themicrocosmic system.[1159] The centre at the base of the spine (the lowest with which man hasconsciously to deal) is one of a peculiar interest, owing to its being theoriginating centre for three long streams of energy which pass up and down thespinal column. This triple stream of force has most interesting correspondenceswhich can be worked out by the intuitive student. Some hints may here be given.This channel of threefold energy has itself three points of supreme interest,which (to word it so as to convey sense to the interested) may be regarded as:1. The basic centre at the extreme lowest point of the spine.2. The alta major centre at the top of the spine.3. The supreme head centre.It is, therefore, a miniature picture of the whole evolution of spirit andmatter for,1. The lowest centre corresponds to the personality,2. The middle centre to the Ego, or the Thinker,3. The supreme head centre to the Monad.In the evolution of the fires of the spine, we have a correspondence to thesutratma with its three points of interest, the monadic auric egg, its emittingpoint, the egoic auric egg, the medial point, and the body or gross form, itslowest point.Another hint of interest lies in the fact that there exist between these spinalcentres, certain gaps (if I may so express it) which have (in the course ofevolution) to be bridged by the energetic action of the rapidly growingvibration of the force unit. Between the triple energy of the spinal column andthe alta major centre, there is a hiatus, just as there exists that which mustbe bridged between the triple lower man and the egoic body, or between themental unit on the fourth subplane of the mental plane and the solar Angel onthe third subplane. Though we are told that the permanent atomic triad isenclosed in the [1160] causal periphery, nevertheless, from the standpoint ofconsciousness there is that which must be bridged. Again, between the alta majorcentre and the supreme head centre, exists another gulf—a correspondence to thegulf found between the plane of the Ego and the lowest point of the Triad, themanasic permanent atom. When man has constructed the antaskarana (which he doesduring the final stages of his evolution in the three worlds) that gulf isbridged and the Monad and the Ego are closely linked. When man is polarised inhis mental body, he begins to bridge the antaskarana. When the centre betweenthe shoulder blades, referred to earlier in this Treatise as the manasic centre,is vibrating forcefully, then the alta major centre and the head centre, via thethroat centre can be united.Man, when he reaches this stage, is a creator in mental matter of a calibredifferent from the unconsciously working average man. He constructs in unisonwith the plan and the divine Manasaputra, the Son of Mind, will turn hisattention from being a Son of Power in the three worlds and centre his attentionin the Spiritual Triad, thus recapitulating on a higher turn of the spiral, thework he earlier did as man. This becomes possible when the growth of thetriangle just above dealt with (base of spine, alta major centre and throat, asthey unify in the head) is paralleled by another triplicity, the solar plexus,the heart and the third eye; the energy merging through them is similarlyunified in the same head centre. The third eye is an energy centre constructedby man; it is a correspondence to the energy centre, the causal body,constructed by the Monad. The alta major centre is similarly constructed byother streams of force and corresponds interestingly to the triple formconstructed by the ego in the three worlds.When this dual work has proceeded to a certain evolutionary point, anothertriplicity becomes alive within the [1161] head itself as the result of thesedual streams of triple energy. This triangle transmits fiery energy via thepineal gland, the pituitary body and the alta major centre and this reaches thehead centre. In this way in these three triangles we have nine streams of energyconverging and passing into the highest head lotus. The correspondence tocertain macrocosmical forces will here be apparent to all discerning students.We have seen the close connection between the different centres and thegradually demonstrating effects to be noted as they are linked up and eventuallyproduce a synthetic circulatory system for egoic energy in conjunction with theenergy of the lower man, which forms a kind of medium by which the egoic forcemakes itself felt. Macrocosmically, but little can be said which would proveintelligible to man at his present stage of evolution. Some brief statementsmight, nevertheless, be given which (if pondered on and correlated with eachother) may throw some light on planetary evolution and on the relation of theplanetary Logoi to the solar Logos.A solar Logos uses for His energy centres the planetary schemes, each of whichembodies a peculiar type of energy, and each of which, therefore, vibrates tothe key of the logoic solar Angel, of which the human solar Angel is a dimreflection. It is interesting here to note that as the human solar Angel is aunity, manifesting through three tiers of petals, the logoic correspondence iseven more interesting, for that great cosmic Entity demonstrates on the cosmicmental plane as a triple flame working through seven tiers of petals, and it isthe energy from these seven circles of energy which pulsates through the mediumof any scheme. All this is hidden in the mystery of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHTMAY BE SAID, and it is not possible for men to solve it,—the truth being obscureto even the highest Dhyan Chohan of our system.The energy centres of the solar Logos are themselves [1162] in the form of vastlotuses ( 324 [text00028.html#Y_FN324] ) or wheels, at the centre of which lieshidden that central cosmic Life, we call a planetary Logos. He is the meetingplace for two types of force, spiritual or logoic, which reaches Him (via thelogoic Lotus on cosmic mental planes) from the seven Rishis of the Great Bear onTheir own plane, and, secondly, of buddhic force, which is transmitted via theSeven Sisters or the Pleiades from a constellation called the Dragon in somebooks, and from which has come the appellation “The Dragon of Wisdom.”A third type of energy is added and, therefore, can be detected in thesecentres, that of manasic type. This reaches the logoic centres via the starSirius, and is transmitted from that constellation which (as earlier I have[1163] hinted) must remain obscure at present. These three great streams ofenergy form the total manifestation of a logoic centre. This is known to us as aplanetary scheme.Within the planetary scheme, these streams of energy work paramountly in thefollowing manner:a. Spiritual energy three higher planes the Monads. b. Buddhic force fourthplane the solar Angels. c. Manasic force two lower planes the four kingdoms ofnature.Physical energy, the left-over of a previous solar system, demonstrates throughthe dense physical form and in the material which is energised during theinvolutionary cycle. It is not considered a principle; and is regarded as thebasis of maya or illusion.The various planetary schemes are not all alike and differ as to:a. Type of energy,b. Point in evolution,c. Position in the general plan,d. Karmic opportunity,e . Rate of vibration.The main distinction exists in the fact, as we have so oft repeated, that threeof them form the three higher etheric energy centres of the Logos, and fourconstitute the lower centres.Saturn is of interest to us here because the Logos of Saturn holds a position inthe body logoic similar to that held by the throat centre in the microcosm.Three centres towards the close of manifestation will become aligned in the sameway as the centre at the base of the spine, the throat centre and the alta majorcentre. Here it must be pointed out that there are three planetary schemes which[1164] hold a place analogous to that held by the pineal gland, the pituitarybody, and the alta major centre, but they are not the schemes referred to ascentres, or known to us as informed by planetary Logoi. Certain of theplanetoids have their place here, and one scheme which has passed out ofactivity, and is in a condition of quiescence and nonactivity. This latterscheme is the correspondence in the logoic body to the atrophied third eye inthe fourth kingdom of nature. When man has developed etheric vision and thus hasexpanded his range of vision, he will become aware of these facts, for he willsee. Many planetary schemes which are found only in etheric matter will berevealed to his astonished gaze, and he will find that (as in the bodymicrocosmic) there are seven (or ten), paramount centres but numbers of othercentres for the purpose of energising various organs. So likewise the bodymacrocosmic has myriads of energy focal points or feeders which have theirplace, their function, and their felt effects. These centres, with no densephysical globe, constitute what has sometimes been called “the inner round” andtransmit their force through those greater centres which have been spoken of inoccult books as having a connection with the inner round.Each of these planetary schemes can be seen as a lotus having seven majorpetals, of which each chain forms one petal, but having also subsidiary petalsof a secondary colour according to the nature and karma of the Entity concerned.It is in the enumeration of these solar lotuses that occult students go astray.It is, for instance, correct to say that the planetary scheme corresponding tothe microcosmic base of the spine is a fourfold lotus and has, therefore, fourpetals. There are four outstanding petals of a peculiar hue, but there are threeof a secondary colour, and nine of a tertiary nature. (To students withintuition the hint here conveyed may reveal the name of the planet, and thenature of its evolution).[1165] Each of these solar lotuses, or planetary schemes, unfolds in three greatstages of activity, in each one of which one of the three types of energydominates. As the unfolding proceeds, the vibratory activity increases, and theappearance of the manifesting activity changes.a. The motion of the lotus or wheel for a long time is simply that of a slowrevolution.b . Later, for a still vaster period, each petal revolves within the greaterwhole, and at an angle different to that of the whole revolution.c. Finally, these two activities are increased by the appearance of a form ofenergy which, originating from the centre, pulsates so powerfully that itproduces what look to be streams of energy passing backwards and forwards fromthe centre to the periphery.d . When these three are working in unison, the effect is wonderful in theextreme, and impossible for the eye to follow, the mind of man to conceive, orthe pen to express in words. It is this stage, macrocosmic and microcosmic,which constitutes the different grades of alignment, for it must never beforgotten by students that all that manifests is a sphere, and alignment reallyconsists in unimpeded communication between the heart of the sphere and theperiphery or the bound of the influence of the dynamic will and the centre.Within each planetary scheme, are found the seven chains which are the sevenplanetary centres, and again within the chain are the seven globes which are thechain centres, but students would do well not to study the globes from the pointof view of centres until their knowledge of the mystery underlying densephysical substance is greater, or they will be led into error. The lower downone seeks to carry the correspondence, the more the likelihood of error. Thecorrespondence must lie in quality and in principle expressed, but not in form."},{"pageContent":"DIVISION F. - THE LAW OF ATTRACTION[1166]I. The Subsidiary laws.1. Law of Chemical Affinity.2.

Twenty-two methods of interplay.This law is, as we know, the basic law of all manifestation, and the paramountlaw for this solar system. It might strictly be called the Law of Adjustment orof Balance, for it conditions that aspect of electrical phenomena which we callneutral . The Law of Economy is the basic law of one pole, that of the negativeaspect; the Law of Synthesis is the basic law of the positive pole, but the Lawof Attraction is the law for the fire which is produced [1167] by the mergingduring evolution of the two poles. From the standpoint of the human being, it isthat which brings about the realisation of self-consciousness; from the point ofview of the subhuman beings it is that which draws all forms of life on toself-realisation; whilst in connection with the superhuman aspect it may bestated that this law of life expands into the processes conditioned by thehigher law of Synthesis, of which the Law of Attraction is but a subsidiarybranch.Strictly speaking, the Law of Attraction is a generic term under which aregrouped several other laws similar in nature but diverse in theirmanifestations. It might be useful if we enumerated a few of these laws, therebyenabling the student to get (as he studies them in their totality) a broadgeneral idea as to the Law and its modifications, its spheres of influence andthe scope of its activity. It should be noted here as a basic proposition inconnection with all atoms that the Law of Attraction governs the Soul aspect.The Law of Economy is the law of the negative electron; the Law of Synthesis isthe Law of the positive central life; whilst the Law of Attraction governs thatwhich is produced by the relation of these two, and is itself controlled by agreater cosmic law which is the principle of the intelligence of substance. Itis the law of Akasha.It must be borne in mind that these three laws are the expression of the intentor purpose of the three Logoic Aspects. The Law of Economy is the governingprinciple of Brahma or the Holy Spirit; the Law of Synthesis is the law of theFather’s life; whilst the Son’s life is governed by, and manifests forth divineattraction. Yet these three are the three subsidiary laws of a greater impulsewhich governs the life of the Unmanifested Logos. (S. D., I, 56, 73, 74.) [1168]I. THE SUBSIDIARY LAWSThe subsidiary aspects, or laws, of the Law of Attraction might be enumerated asfollows:1. The Law of Chemical Affinity. This law governs the soul aspect in the mineralkingdom. It concerns the marriage of the atoms, and the romance of the elements.It serves to perpetuate the life of the mineral kingdom and to preserve itsintegrity.It is the cause of the immetalisation of the Monad.2. The Law of Progress. It is called this in the vegetable kingdom owing to thefact that it is in this kingdom that definite objective response to stimulationcan be noted. It is the basis of the phenomenon of sensation, which is the keyto this solar system of love, our system being a “Son of Necessity” or ofdesire. This law is the working out into manifestation of the informingconsciousness of a part of the deva kingdom, and of certain pranic energies. Thestudent will find much of esoteric interest in the following line of livingforces:a. The second chain, globe and round,b . The vegetable kingdom,c. The devas of desire in their second reflected groupings,d . The heart of the Sun,e . The second Ray force.3. The Law of Sex.This is the term applied to the force which brings about the physical merging ofthe two poles in connection with the animal kingdom, and of man, viewing him asresponsive to the call of his animal nature. It concerns itself with the dueguarding of the form in this particular cycle and its perpetuation. It is onlypowerful during the period of the duality of the sexes and their separation and,in the case of man, will be offset by a higher expression of the law when man isagain androgynous. It is [1169] the law of marriage, and finds some aspects ofits manifestation not only in marriage of men and animals in the physical sense,but in the “occult marriage” ofa. The Soul and the Spirit.b. The Son with his Mother (or the Soul with the physical substance).c. The negative planetary lives with the positive ones earlier pointed out.d. The systemic marriage, or the merging of the two final planetary schemesafter their absorption of the other forces.e. The cosmic marriage, or the merging of our solar system with its oppositecosmic pole, another constellation. The cosmic marriage of stars and Systems isthe cause of the occasional irregular flaring-up or intensification of suns andtheir increased luminosity which is sometimes seen, and which has frequentlybeen the subject of discussion.4. The Law of Magnetism. This is the law which produces the unifying of apersonality, and though it is an expression of lunar force, is, nevertheless, ofa much higher order than the law of physical sex. It is the expression of thelaw as it is demonstrated by the three major groups of lunar pitris. These threegroups are not concerned with the building of the forms of the animal kingdom,for they are the builders of the body of man in the final three stages of thepath of evolution:a. The stage of high intellectuality, or of artistic attainment,b. The stage of discipleship,c. The stage of treading the Path.The lower four groups concern themselves with the earlier stages, and with theanimal aspects of attraction in both the kingdoms. [1170]5. The Law of Radiation. This is one of the most interesting of the laws for itonly comes into activity in connection with the highest specimens of the variouskingdoms, and concerns itself with the attraction that a higher kingdom ofnature will have for the highest lives of the next lower kingdom. It governs theradioactivity of minerals, the radiations of the vegetable kingdom and(curiously enough) the entire question of perfumes. Smell is the highest of thepurely physical senses; so in the vegetable kingdom a certain series of perfumesare evidence of radiation in that kingdom.There is, moreover, an interesting link between those who are members of thefifth kingdom (the spiritual) and the vegetable, for in esotericism the two andthe five, the Son, and the Sons of Mind, are closely allied. It is not possibleto indicate more, but it is not without significance that certain Rays are,through the initiates and Masters, represented by vegetable perfumes. Itsignifies radiation, and to those who have the key reveals the quality of theegoic lotus and the place it holds in any particular planetary lotus, as well asa connection with certain devas who are the sevenfold life of the vegetablekingdom. We must not forget that man is occultly a “seven-leaved plant, thesaptaparna.” (S. D., I, 251; II, 626.)This law in a mysterious manner, inexplicable to those ignorant of the karma ofour planetary Logos, is not operative in the animal kingdom during this Cycle orchain. One of the problems of the next chain will be the bringing in of animalradiation; thus offsetting the method of initiation now pursued. It must neverbe forgotten that the chain process of individualisation, and the earlier threeInitiations concern the animal kingdom and man is viewed therein as an animal.In the final Initiation or the offering up of the entire bodily nature, [1171]this part of the general karma of the planetary Logos and the Life of theinforming Spirit of the animal kingdom become adjusted. If this is meditatedupon, some light may be thrown upon the problem as to why the Adepts of the lefthand path in Atlantean days were called “the Trees,” (S. D., II, 519, 520, 521.)and were destroyed with the entire Atlantean vegetation. In the oldest of allthe Commentaries the mystery is expressed thus:“They (the Adepts of the Left Hand Path) became thus separated through their ownfault. Their smell rose not up to Heaven; they refused to merge. No perfume wastheirs. They hugged to their greedy bosoms all the gains of the floweringplant.”6. The Law of the Lotus. This is the name given to the mysterious influence fromthe cosmic Law of Attraction which brought in the divine Sons of Mind, and thuslinked the two poles of Spirit and matter, producing upon the plane of mind thatwhich we call the egoic lotus, or “the Flower of the Self.” It is the law whichenables the lotus to draw from the lower nature (the matter aspect and the wateraspect) the moisture and heat necessary for its unfoldment, and to bring downfrom the levels of the Spirit that which is to it what the rays of the sun areto the vegetable kingdom. It governs the process of petal unfoldment, andtherefore itself demonstrates as a triple law:a. The Law of Solar Heat Knowledge petals. b. The Law of Solar Light Lovepetals. c. The Law of Solar Fire Sacrifice petals.7. The Law of Colour.To get any comprehension of this law students should remember that colour servesa twofold purpose. It acts as a veil for that which lies behind, and istherefore attracted [1172] to the central spark; it demonstrates the attractivequality of the central life.All colours, therefore, are centres of attraction, are complementary, or areantipathetic to each other, and students who study along these lines can findout the law, and comprehend its working through a realisation of the purpose,the activity, and the relation of colours to or for each other.8. The Law of Gravitation. This law is for the non-occult student the mostpuzzling and confusing of all the laws. It shows itself in one aspect as thepower, and the stronger urge that a more vital life may have upon the lesser,such as the power of the spirit of the Earth (the planetary Entity, not theplanetary Logos) to hold all physical forms to itself and prevent their“scattering.” This is due to the heavier vibration, the greater accumulativeforce, and the aggregated tamasic lives of the body of the planetary Entity.This force works upon the negative, or lowest, aspect of all physical forms. TheLaw of Gravitation shows itself also in the response of the soul of all thingsto the greater Soul in which the lesser finds itself. This law, therefore,affects the two lowest forms of divine life, but not the highest. It emanates inthe first instance from the physical sun and the heart of the Sun. The finalsynthesising forces which might be regarded as forms of spiritual gravitationalactivity are, nevertheless, not so, but are due to the working of another law,emanating from the central spiritual Sun. The one is purely systemic, the othera cosmic law.9. The Law of Planetary Affinity . This term is used in the occult teachingspecifically in connection with the interaction of the planets with each otherand their eventual marriage. As we know, the planetary schemes (the seven sacredplanets) will eventually synthesise, or absorb the life of the planets which arenot termed sacred and the numerous planetoids, as far as the four kingdoms[1173] of nature are concerned. The absorption of the Spirit aspect proceedsunder the Law of Synthesis. The minor four planetary schemes become first thetwo, and then the one. This one, with the major three, forms a second and higherquaternary which again repeats the process, producing from the four, the two,and from the two, the one. This final one is eventually merged in the Sun,producing in this prolonged process, and over a vast period of time, theappearance of the “seven Suns who run together, and thus blaze forth, producingone flaming ball of fire.”On a lesser scale the same law governs the merging of the chains in a scheme.10. The Law of Solar Union . When the interplay of the Suns is being dealt withfrom the material aspect and from the consciousness aspect, this term isoccultly used. It is not possible to enlarge upon it, but only to point out theuniversality of this Law of Attraction.11. The Law of the Schools. (The Law of Love and Light.) This is a mysteriousterm used to cover the law as it affects the expansions of consciousness whichan initiate undergoes, and his ability to attract to himself through knowledge,a. His own Higher Self, so as to produce alignment and illumination,b. His Guru,c. That which he seeks to know,d. That which he can utilise in his work of service,e. Other souls with whom he can work.It will be evident, therefore, to the thoughtful student that this Law of theSchools is primarily applicable to all units of divine life who have arrived at,or transcended the stage of self-consciousness. It has consequently a vitalconnection with the human kingdom, and there is an occult significance in thefact that this is the eleventh [1174] Law. It is the law which enables a man tounite two of his aspects (the personal self and the Higher Self). It is the lawwhich governs the transition of the human atom into another and a higherkingdom. It is the law which (when comprehended and conformed to) enables a manto enter into a new cycle. It is the law of the adept, of the Master, and of theperfected man. For this reason it might be of profit here if we dealt with it alittle more fully than with the other laws, for mankind is now at the stagewhere a number of its units are ready to come under the specific influence ofthis law, and thus be transferred out of the Hall of Learning, via the Hall ofWisdom, into the fifth or spiritual kingdom.This Law of the Schools does not specifically apply to the deva evolution. Theycome under another law called “The Law of Passive Resistance” which does notconcern us here, nor would it profit us to consider it. Three main groups ofexistences are controlled by it:1. Human beings from the moment they tread the Probationary Path.2. All the units of the fifth kingdom, therefore, all the members of theHierarchy.3. The planetary Logoi throughout the system.It will be apparent, therefore, that this law concerns the great experimentwhich has been inaugurated on earth by our planetary Logos in connection withthe process of initiation, and it has only held sway since the Door ofInitiation was opened in Atlantean days. It does not, therefore, apply to allthe members of the human family; some of whom will achieve slowly and under thesway of the basic Law of Evolution. It does not affect, in any way, forinstance, those members of the human family who have individualised on the earthchain through the fanning of the spark of mind—one of the methods employed bythe Lords of the Flame, as earlier seen.[1175] It can be studied in two main divisions, first, in connection with thehuman units passing under hierarchical influence in the Hall of Wisdom, and alsoin connection with the various planetary schemes. Each scheme exists in order toteach a specific aspect of consciousness, and each planetary school or Hierarchysubjects its pupils to this law, only in manners diverse. These planetaryschools are necessarily governed by certain factors of which the two mostimportant are the peculiar karma of the planetary Logos concerned, and Hisparticular Ray.It is not possible at this stage to convey to students the information as to thenature of each planetary school. They exist in five great groups:1. The exoteric non-sacred planets , called in occult parlance “the outer round”or outer circle of initiates. Of these our earth is one, but being aligned in apeculiar fashion with certain spheres on the inner round, a dual opportunityexists for mankind, which facilitates, whilst it complicates, the evolutionaryprocess.2. The sacred planets, called sometimes (when this Law of the Schools is underconsideration) the “seven grades of psychic knowledge” or the “seven divisionsof the field of knowledge.”3. The inner round, which carries with it vast opportunity for those who cansurmount its problems and withstand its temptations. This inner round has apeculiar appeal to units on certain Rays, and has its own specific dangers. Theinner round is the round that is followed by those who have passed through thehuman stage and have consciously developed the faculty of etheric living and canfollow the etheric cycles, functioning consciously on the three higher ethericplanes in all parts of the system. They have—for certain occult and specificpurposes—broken the connection between the third etheric and the four lowersubplanes of the physical plane. This [1176] round is followed only by aprepared percentage of humanity, and is closely associated with a group who passwith facility and develop with equal facility on the three planets that make atriangle with the earth, namely Mars, Mercury, and Earth. These three planets—inconnection with this inner round—are considered only as existing in ethericmatter, and (in relation to one of the Heavenly Men) hold a place analogous tothe etheric triangle found in the human etheric body. I have here conveyed morethan has as yet been exoterically communicated anent this inner round and by thestudy of the human etheric triangle, its function, and the type of force whichcirculates around it, much may be deduced about the planetary inner round. Wemust bear in mind in this connection that just as the human etheric triangle isbut the preparatory stage to a vast circulation within the sphere of the entireetheric body, so the etheric planetary triangle—passing from the Earth to Marsand Mercury—is but the preparatory circulatory system to a vaster round includedwithin the sphere of influence of one planetary Lord.4. The circle of the planetoids. Students of the Ageless Wisdom are apt toforget that the Life of the Logos manifests itself through those circlingspheres which (though not large enough to be regarded as planets) pursue theirorbital paths around the solar centre and have their own evolutionary problemsand are functioning as part of the solar Body. They are informed—as are theplanets—by a cosmic Entity and are under the influence of the Life impulses ofthe solar Logos as are the greater bodies. The evolutions upon them areanalogous to, though not identical with, those of our planet, and they swingthrough their cycles in the Heavens under the same laws as do the greaterplanets.5. The absorbing Triangles. This term is applied to the evolutionary schoolsfound located in the three major [1177] planets of our system—Uranus, Neptuneand Saturn—and to those found in the three major chains, and three major globesin a planetary scheme. The Rulers of these planets, chains and globes are calledthe “Divine Examiners,” and Their work concerns the human kingdom specificallyand entirely. They are responsible for the work ofa. Transferring men from one school to another, and from one grade to another.b. For the expanding of the human consciousness under the law,c. For the transmutation of the forms of the human unit in the three worlds andthe consequent negation of the form,d. For the radioactivity of the fourth kingdom in nature.We might regard the presiding lives in these departmental schools as thecustodians of the Path, and responsible, therefore, for the divine Pilgrimduring the final stages of the treading of the Path of Evolution. They begin towork with men from the moment they first set foot upon the Probationary Path andThey continue Their work until the seventh initiation is taken.The Masters, therefore, Who take pupils for training, are numbered amongst them,whilst the Masters Who do not concern Themselves with individuals and theirdevelopment are not.It is not possible to give fully the types of schools and teaching which isgiven on the different planets. All that can be done is to give an occult phrasewhich will convey to the intuitive student the necessary hint.Planetary SchoolsURANUS—The School of Magic of the tenth order. It is sometimes called “theplanet of the violet [1178] force,” and its graduates wield the power of cosmicetheric prana.EARTH—The School of Magnetic Response. Another name given to its pupils is “Thegraduates of painful endeavour” or the “adjudicators between the polaropposites.”A further hint to be taken in connection with the two names above given, is thatits graduates are said to undergo examination upon the third subplane of theastral plane.VULCAN—The School for Fiery Stones. There is a curious connection between thehuman units who pass through its halls and the mineral kingdom. The human unitson the earth scheme are called in mystical parlance “the living stones”; onVulcan they are called “fiery stones.”JUPITER—The School of Beneficent Magicians. This planet is sometimes called inthe parlance of the schools, the “College of Quadruple Force units,” for itsmembers wield four kinds of force in constructive magical work. Another namegiven to its halls is “The Palace of Opulence” for its graduates work with theLaw of Supply, and are frequently called “The Sowers.”MERCURY—The pupils in this planetary school are called “The Sons of Aspiration”or “The Points of Yellow Life.” They have a close connection with our Earthscheme, and the old Commentary refers to this in the words:“The points of golden flame merge and blend with the four-leaved plant of tendergreen, and change its colour to a tinge of autumn yellow. The four-leaved plantthrough new and fresh [1179] inflow becomes the plant with seven leaves andthree white flowers.”VENUS—The School with five strict Grades. This again is a planetary schemeclosely related to ours, but its planetary Logos is in a more advanced group ofstudents in the cosmic sense than is our planetary Logos. Most of itshierarchical instructors come from the fifth cosmic plane, and are a peculiargroup of Manasadevas of very exalted rank. They are each depicted in thearchives of our Hierarchy as holding a trident of fire surmounted by five greenemeralds.MARS—The School for Warriors, or the open grades for soldiers. Four of theseplanetary schools are responsible for the energy flowing through the foremostexponents of the four castes and this not only in India but in all parts of theworld. Its teachers are spoken of as the “Graduates of the ruddy Fire,” and arefrequently portrayed as clothed in red robes, and carrying ebony wands. Theywork under the first Aspect logoic and train those whose work is along the linesof the destroyer.NEPTUNE—This school concerns itself with the development and fostering of thedesire element and its graduates are called “the Sons of Vishnu.” Their symbolis a robe with a full sailed boat portrayed over the heart, the significance ofwhich will be apparent to those who have eyes to see.It is not permissible to touch upon the other planetary schools, nor would itprofit. Certain further facts can be ascertained by the student of meditationwho is aligned with his Ego, and in touch with his egoic group.[1180] The teaching given on our earth scheme in the Hall of Wisdom has beendealt with in many occult books, including Initiation, Human and Solar , andneed not be enlarged upon here.Some of the aspects of this law are here indicated. The ground is by no meanscovered but enough has been shown to indicate its magnitude and extent. Inclosing, it must be pointed out that the Law of Karma is from some angles ofvision the sum total of this Law of Attraction for it governs the relation ofall forms to that which uses the form, and of all lives to each other.Students of the Law of Attraction must be careful to bear in mind certainthings. These should be carefully considered and realised as the subject isstudied.They must remember first, that all these subsidiary laws are really only themanifestation of the One Law; that they are but differentiated terms, employedto express one great method of manifestation.Secondly, that all energy, demonstrating in the solar system, is after all theenergy of the logoic physical permanent atom, having its nucleus on the atomicsubplane of the cosmic physical. This physical permanent atom (as is the casewith the corresponding atom of the incarnating jiva), has its place within thecausal body of the Logos on His own plane; it is, therefore, impressed by thetotality of the force of the egoic cosmic lotus, or the attractive quality ofcosmic love. This force is transmitted to the solar system in two ways: Throughthe medium of the Sun, which is in an occult sense the physical permanent atom;it, therefore, attracts, and holds attracted, all within its sphere ofinfluence, thus producing the logoic physical body: through the medium of theplanes which are the correspondences to the seven spirillae of the physicalpermanent atom of a human being. Thus a dual type of attractive force is found:one, basic and fundamental; the other more differentiated and secondary. [1181]CHART XI — ETHERIC-ATOMIC PHILOSOPHY OF FORCE[Image00017.jpg]Fig 135. The General form of an atom, including the spirals and 1st Spirillae,together with influx and efflux ethers, represented by dots, which pass trhoughthese spirillae. The 2nd and 3rd spirillae and their still finer ethers are notshown.From ‘the Principles of Light and Colour’,Edwin D. Babbitt, New York 1878[1182] These streams of energy, judged by their effects, are called in humanterminology laws, because their results are ever immutable and irresistible, andtheir effects remain unchangeably the same, varying only according to the formwhich is the subject of the energic impulse.Thirdly, the student must bear in mind that the seven planes, or the sevenspirillae of the logoic permanent atom, are not all equally vitalised by theattractive pull emanating from the logoic lotus via the heart of the Sun. Fiveof them are more “alive” than the other two; these five do not include thehighest and the lowest. The words “the heart of the Sun” must be understood tomean more than a locality situated in the interior recesses of the solar body,and have reference to the nature of the solar sphere. This solar sphere isclosely similar to the atom pictured in the book by Babbitt and later in OccultChemistry by Mrs. Besant. The Sun is heart-shaped, and (seen from cosmic angles)has a depression at what we might call its north pole. This is formed by theimpact of logoic energy upon solar substance.This energy which impinges upon the solar sphere, and is thence distributed toall parts of the entire system, emanates from three cosmic centres and,therefore, is triple during this particular cycle.a. From the sevenfold great Bear.b. From the Sun Sirius.c. From the Pleiades.It must be remembered that the possible cosmic streams of energy available foruse in our solar system are seven in number, of which three are major. Thesethree vary during vast and incalculable cycles.Students may find it of use to remember that,a . The Law of Economy demonstrates as an urge ,b. The Law of Attraction as a pull ,c. The Law of Synthesis as a tendency to concentrate at a centre, or to merge.[1183] The streams of energy which pour forth through the medium of the Sun fromthe egoic lotus and which are in reality “logoic Soul energy” attract to themthat which is akin to them in vibration. This may sound rather like thestatement of a platitude, but is susceptible of really deep significance to thestudent, being accountable for all systemic phenomena. These streams pass indifferent directions, and in the knowledge of occult direction comes knowledgeof the various hierarchies of being, and the secret of the esoteric symbols.The main stream of energy enters at the top depression in the solar sphere andpasses through the entire ring-pass-not, bisecting it into two halves.With this stream enters that group of active lives whom we call the “Lords ofKarma.” They preside over the attractive forces, and distribute them justly.They enter, pass to the centre of the sphere and there (if I may so express it)locate, and set up the “Holy Temple of Divine Justice,” sending out to the fourquarters of the circle the four Maharajahs, their representatives. So is theequal armed Cross formed—and all the wheels of energy set in motion. This isconditioned by the karmic seeds of an earlier system, and only that substance isutilised by the Logos, and only those lives come into manifestation who have setup a mutual attraction.These five streams of living energy (the one and the four) are the basis of theonward march of all things; these are sometimes esoterically called “the forwardmoving Lives.” They embody the Will of the Logos. It is the note they sound andthe attractive pull which they initiate which bring into contact with the solarsphere a group of existences whose mode of activity is spiral and not forward.These groups are seven in number and pass into manifestation [1184] through whatis for them a great door of Initiation. In some of the occult books, these sevengroups are spoken of as the “seven cosmic Initiates Who have passed within theHeart, and there remain until the test is passed.” These are the sevenHierarchies of Beings, the seven Dhyan Chohans. They spiral into manifestation,cutting across the fourfold cross, and touching the cruciform stream of energyin certain places. The places where the streams of love energy cross the streamsof will and karmic energy are mystically called the “Caves of dual light” andwhen a reincarnating or liberated jiva enters one of these Caves in the courseof his pilgrimage, he takes an initiation, and passes on to a higher turn of thespiral.Another stream of energy follows a different route, which is a little difficultto make clear. This particular set of active lives enter the heart shapeddepression, pass around the edge of the ring-pass-not to the lowest part of thesolar sphere and then mount upwards, coming into opposition therefore with thestream of downpouring energy. This stream of force is called “lunar” force forlack of a better term. They form the body of the raja Lord of each of theplanes, and are governed by the Law of Economy.All these streams of energy form geometrical designs of great beauty to the eyeof the initiated seer. We have the transverse and bisecting lines, the sevenlines of force which form the planes, and the seven spiralling lines, thusforming lines of systemic latitude and longitude, and their interplay andinteraction produce a whole of wondrous beauty and design. When these arevisualised in colour, and seen in their true radiance, it will be realised thatthe point of attainment of our solar Logos is very high, for the beauty of thelogoic Soul is expressed by that which is seen. [1185]II. THE EFFECTS OF THE LAW OF ATTRACTIONThe Law of Attraction produces certain effects which it might profit us to touchupon here, provided we remember that only a few effects out of many possible arebeing considered.1. Association.The first effect might be called association. Under this law the karmic Lordsare enabled to bring together those lives (human, subhuman, and superhuman)which have earlier been associated, and have, therefore, somewhat to work out.The seven Heavenly Men, for instance, are a few out of the great band ofassociated Lives who have chosen to come into incarnation in this kalpa forpurposes of mutual help and mutual correction. They are really destined to worktogether, but nevertheless on other cosmic planes have points of contact unknownto us.Under this attractive pull the informing existences of the various kingdoms ofnature are engaged in mutual interaction, and thus swing into lesser but similaractivity all the lives of these various bodies of manifestation. These lines ofattraction are veiled in mystery, and all that it is possible to indicate is thekarma of the Lord of the second or vegetable kingdom with the Lord of the fifthkingdom, and a close line of linking energy between the Lord of the mineralkingdom and the human. These points are only for reference to our own planetaryscheme. The Lord of the Moon chain and the Lord of our present animal kingdomare “blood brothers” and in their relationship and the esoteric interference ofthe “Man of Men” (the human family personified) is hidden the mystery of presentanimal karma and the slaughter of animal forms, the terror of wild beasts andthe work of vivisectionists.Under this Law, too, is found “the Path” upon which [1186] men lift themselvesout of the human state of consciousness into the divine, but on this there is noneed to enlarge.2. Form Building.The second effect is form building. Upon this we will not enlarge at any length,as all that it is at present possible to impart anent this subject has alreadybeen given in this Treatise, and other works of a similar nature. It is themiddle, or second aspect which is ever responsible for the construction of aform around a central nucleus. Students would find it useful to study andmeditate upon the appended tabulation of energy streams and their objectivisingthrough mutual interplay.As time goes on, science will become aware of the basic nature and fundamentalaccuracy of the method whereby every form can be divided into its three aspects,and viewed as an Entity energised by three types of force, emanating fromvarious points extraneous to the form under consideration. It can be consideredalso as expressing in some way or another, in its various parts, force or energyoriginating in the three forces of manifestation, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.Where this is the case and the premise admitted, the entire outlook on life, onnature, medicine and science and on methods of construction or destruction willbe changed. Things will be viewed as essential triplicities, men will beregarded as a combination of energy units, and work with things and with menfrom the form aspect will be revolutionised. In the tabulation much informationis given anent the form building aspects of energy and the Law of Attraction asit shows itself in the working of the various groups of the Army of the Voice.It is this Army which is responsible for the attraction which is the medium ofbringing together the material required by the free Spirits in order toconstruct their bodies of manifestation.

A phrase.b. Phrases.c. Sentences.d. Speech.e. The myriad sounds of nature.Each of these terms can be explained in terms of attractive energy, and thisattractive energy is likewise the demonstration of the life of an Existence ofsome grade or other.“God speaks and the forms are made.” This tabulation should form the basis of acomplete phase of study along this line and is one of the most basic given inthis Treatise.3. Adaptation of the form to the life.This is the process of gradually providing forms which are due expressions ofthe indwelling consciousness which is the great purpose of what we call “MotherNature”; this she does, working under the Law of Attraction which we areconsidering. This law, therefore, governs two aspects of unfoldment, that whichconcerns the soul or consciousness aspect and that relating to the Spirit on itsown plane. It is the cause of that continuous cycle of form taking, of formutilisation and of form rejection which characterises the incarnations of everykind and type of living being. The student should here remember that theExistences who are the attractive force in manifestation, the Dhyan Chohans, areseven in number, and that, therefore, the quality of the vehicles which formTheir bodies will have the sevenfold variation according to the specific natureof the Lords of Life.[1189] The only way to arrive at a realisation of the basic qualities of theseplanetary Logoi is through a consideration of the energy emanating from Them,and it is this which the true esoteric astrology will eventually reveal. Thetime is not yet; it will come when the scientific consideration of humanmagnetism, of the distinctions between the seven types of men, and the nature ofthe Ego is more truly followed. Then will be revealed the nature of planetarymagnetism and the quality of any specific planetary soul as it is known throughthe aggregated nature of the men, responsive to and exponents of any particularplanetary Ray. The mystery is increased by the fact that there are not onlycertain logoic qualities manifesting which are not included by the term“sacred,” but that there are numerous other aspects of what we might term“secondary centres of fire,” generated and making their presence felt. We have acorrespondence to this in the fact that there are centres of energy in man whichare not purely etheric centres but are the product of the interaction of theetheric centres and certain forms of negative energy of the lowest kind. Such,for instance, is the heart. There is the heart centre, one of the major centerson the etheric planes, but there is also the physical heart which is an energygenerator also; there are the lower organs of generation which are equally areflex product with an energy which is the resultant of the higher vibrationsyet which has a quality all its own. This has its correspondence in the solarsystem. Many are the lesser planets and numerous are the planetoids which havean energy or attractive quality all their own and which, from the systemicstandpoint, must be allowed for in the measuring of the attraction producing theforms of or upon any particular planet.As we know from a study of the Secret Doctrine, certain of the planetary Logoiare pure and passionless whilst others are still under the domination of desireand [1190] of passion. (S. D., I, 214, 449; II, 223.) This quality of Theirsnecessarily attracts to Them that which They need for the due expression ofTheir life in any scheme, and controls the nature of those egoic groups who are(for Them) generating force centres. Hence the nature of men upon earth. Allhuman beings are paramountly governed by certain planetary attractions,impressions or influences which might be enumerated in the order of theirimportance.There is, first of all, the attractive pull of the Life of the planetary Logosof this particular planet. This is necessarily the strongest and is one of thebasic factors which have settled the lines the human form has taken upon thisplanet. There are human beings, or exponents of self-consciousness on otherplanets, but the forms they utilise are not the same as ours.There is next, the attractive pull of the planetary Logos Who is thecomplementary Life to that of our Logos. This involves a planetary Logosresponsive to a vibration which harmonises with that of our Logos but Who, whenin union with Him, forms what might be called “the Third” or His dominant, asthe case may be. It is not possible to reveal whether the blending of the notewill mean that our scheme will absorb that which expresses the note of anotherscheme, or vice versa. It means that somewhere in the solar system is aplanetary scheme of some kind (not necessarily one of the seven or of the ten)which has an interplay with ours and which, therefore, inevitably affects theegoic groups. We must note also the fact that—in connection with the expressionof a Heavenly Man—the egoic groups are energy centres and make His densephysical body eventually an accomplished fact.Finally, there is the attractive pull of that planetary scheme which isesoterically regarded as our polar opposite. [1191] (What is here said hasreference to the other schemes, for the law persists throughout the solarsystem.)It will be apparent, therefore, that the real and esoteric astrology will dealwith four kinds of force, when it seeks to explain the nature of the Energieswhich influence any human being:1. The quality of the solar system.2. The quality of the Logos of the planet as it pours through the chains andglobes and rounds in a sevenfold differentiation.3. The quality of our earth’s complementary planet.4. The quality of the attraction of our earth’s polar opposites.This involves information as yet veiled in deepest mystery, but which willunfold as the true psychology is studied, and which will eventually embodyitself in a fourth fundamental of the Secret Doctrine so that later studentswill have the three as they are now found in the Proem to that book, plus thefourth. (S. D., I, 42-46.) This might be expected in this fourth round. The trueastrology will reveal the nature of this fourth proposition at some later date.More attention will eventually be paid to the planetary influences, and not somuch to the signs of the zodiac where the nature of an Ego is concerned. Thegreat signs of the zodiac concern the Heavenly Man, and necessarily, therefore,the Monads of every human being. The planetary influences must be studied tofind out the quality of a man’s Ray, and this in the above indicated threefoldmanner. Man is the Monad, therefore, he expresses a small part of his enfoldinglife. In this solar system he is essentially the Ego.Astrologers should study the planetary schemes in the light of the Heavenly Man,viewing them as an incarnation [1192] of a planetary Logos, and thus strive tocast the horoscope of the planetary Logos. They cannot succeed in doing so, butin the attempt may learn much and achieve new light upon a most difficultsubject.In considering this question of the adaptation of the form to vibration, or theconstruction of a vehicle which will be a fitting instrument for spirit, thefollowing factors must be borne in mind:1. That it is the quality of the indwelling life which decides the type of form.2. That these qualities are the sumtotal of the attributes of divinity which theindwelling life has succeeded in unfolding.3. That these qualities—as may well be surmised—fall into the usual septennate.4. That they fall also into two groups, those which concern the lowerprinciples, and are, therefore, four in number, and those which concern thehigher and middle and are, therefore, three.This is true of all men, of the Heavenly Men and of the solar Logos likewise,and there is a mysterious analogy concerned in the manifestation of the threehigher principles in man (which may be considered as demonstrating through theperfected Adept, the Bodhisattva) and the three higher principles of the solarLogos as they demonstrate through the major three aspects. They form but oneprinciple showing forth in three ways. So it is with the unmanifested Monad(unmanifested from the standpoint of the lower man). That Monad can—at a certainvery advanced stage in evolution, and one far beyond that of the Adept—have itstriple simultaneous manifestation, and show forth as a Master in the threeworlds, as a Bodhisattva on His own plane and as the emancipated Dhyani Buddha;yet these Three will be but One, will be [1193] the result of a great spiritualvibration and will perform the triple work which may (from the standpoint of thethree worlds) appear as the work of three separate great Existences. They areforms of three monadic “vestures,” worn by the one Monad as a man wears histhree bodies simultaneously, and functions in them separately. ( 330[text00028.html#Y_FN330] )One or other of these three can, if so He will, occupy a body on the physicalplane which will not be simply a created mayavirupa. This is done in one of twoways: either through the occupancy of a willingly vacated body, as was the casewhen the Christ occupied the body of Jesus, or by a divine overshadowing of adisciple, as has been and will be the case. The quality of the form occupied orused, and the nature of its work depends upon which of the three higher aspectsof the initiating impulse, is manifesting. Very rarely a more mysteriousphenomenon occurs and the overshadowing Buddha, Bodhisattva, or Adept each makesHis “appearance” [1194] upon earth thus demonstrating the three aspects ofknowledge, love and will and all taking form.This may seem to be a great complexity, but it is not so much stranger after allthan the phenomenon of the Monad (in time and space and during evolution)demonstrating forth as the Triad, the Ego and the Personality. This type oftriple Avatar only makes its appearance under a peculiar series of cyclesconcerned with a group of Monads who were the most progressed and advanced atthe opening of the mahamanvantara. As yet, there are not many progressed enoughto do this triple work; the Buddha and nine others being the only Ones as yetremaining in touch with our particular planet in this particular manner. A feware as Christ is, and have the power to make a dual appearance. This type ofmonad is only found on Rays two, four, six.If the student bears in mind that the nature of the form is dependent upon thequality of the incarnating Life, he will have also to bear in mind thedistinctions between the various groups of Hierarchies, for the Lives in thosegroups are of a quality diverse to each other and the forms through which theymanifest are equally distinct and diverse. Therefore, we must distinguishbetween:1. The involutionary groups.2. The evolutionary groups.3. The seven groups of lives which we call the lunar Fathers:a. Three incorporeal who are the elemental kingdoms.b. Four material who are the forms of the four kingdoms on the upward arc.4. The seven hierarchies of Lives.5. The seven groups of solar Angels.There must not be confusion as to the distinction between the hierarchies ofBeings and the seven Rays, for [1195] though there is close connection, there isno resemblance. The “Rays” are but the primordial forms of certain Lives who“carry in their Hearts” all the Seeds of Form. The Hierarchies are the manifoldgroups of lives, at all stages of unfoldment and growth who will use the forms.( 331 [text00028.html#Y_FN331] ) The Rays are vehicles and are, therefore,negative receivers. The Hierarchies are the users of the vehicles, and it is thenature of these lives and the quality of their vibration which under this greatLaw of Attraction brings to them the needed forms. These are the two primaldistinctions, Life and Form, and these two are the “Son of God,” the secondPerson of the Trinity in His form-building aspect. They are the Builders andequally exist in three groups with their lesser differentiations. It is notnecessary here to place these groups on certain planes in the solar system.These hierarchies of Beings Who come in on the Ray of Light from the centre arethe seeds of all that later is and it is only as they pass out intomanifestation and the forms which they are to occupy are gradually evolved, thatconsideration of the planes becomes necessary. The planes are to certain ofthese hierarchies what the sheaths of the Monad are to it; they are veils forthe Life indwelling; they are media of expression, and exponents of force orenergy of a specialised kind. The quality of a [1196] Ray is dependent upon thequality of the hierarchy of Beings who use it as a means of expression. Theseseven hierarchies are veiled by the Rays, but each is found behind the veil ofevery ray, for in their totality they are the informing lives of every planetaryscheme within the system; they are the life of all interplanetary space, and theexistences who are expressing themselves through the planetoids, and all formsof lesser independent life than a planet. Let me briefly give certain hintsconcerning these hierarchies which may serve to elucidate that contained in theSecret Doctrine concerning them.What is here imparted is not in itself new, but is the synthesising of muchalready known and its gathering together in the form of brief enunciated facts.Each of these seven hierarchies of Beings Who are the Builders or the AttractiveAgents are (in their degree) intermediaries; all embody one of the types offorce emanating from the seven constellations. Their intermediary work,therefore, is dual:1. They are the mediators between Spirit and matter.2. They are the transmitters of force from sources extraneous to the solarsystem to forms within the solar system.Each of these groups of beings is likewise septenary in nature, and theforty-nine fires of Brahma are the lowest manifestation of their fiery nature.Each group also may be regarded as “fallen” in the cosmic sense, becauseinvolved in the building process, or the occupiers of forms of some degree ofdensity or another.Hierarchy I. The first great Hierarchy is emanated from the Heart of the centralSpiritual Sun. (S. D., I, 233-250; III, 565-566.) It is the Son of God Himself,the First Born in a cosmic sense, even as the Christ was the “Eldest in a vastfamily of [1197] brothers,” and the “first flower on the human plant.” Thesymbol of this Hierarchy is the Golden Lotus with its twelve petals folded.It should be remembered that this Hierarchy is literally the sixth, for fivehierarchies have passed on, being the product of the earlier system, thatwherein Intelligence or Manas was the goal. The five liberated hierarchies arein their totality the sumtotal of manas. It is the Hierarchy which is the fifthin order, and which we are told is in process of achieving final liberation, ortaking its fourth Initiation, which is the cause of certain phenomena upon ourplanet which has merited our planet being called the “Star of Suffering.” Thereis a karmic link between the animal kingdom and the fifth Creative Hierarchy ofthe earlier system which makes itself felt in man in the necessary crucifixionof the animal physical nature, particularly along sex lines. We must rememberthat the hierarchies work under the Law of Attraction; it is the law of theBuilders.This first (sixth) Hierarchy has for its type of energy the first aspect of thesixth type of cosmic electricity, and wields special power, therefore, inconjunction with the lowest fire, or “fire by friction,” as it makes itself felton the sixth plane. These lives are called “the burning Sons of Desire” and werethe Sons of Necessity. It is said of them in the old Commentary:“They burned to know. They rushed into the spheres. They are the longing of theFather for the Mother. Hence do they suffer, burn, and long through the sixthsphere of sense.”Hierarchy II. The second Hierarchy is closely allied with the Great Bear. We aretold that They entered through the second ventricle within the Sacred Heart, andare (as we are told in the Secret Doctrine ) the prototypes of the Monads. Theyare the source of monadic Life, but They are not the Monads; They are farhigher.[1198] This Hierarchy, which is literally the seventh, is the influx into oursystem of those Lives who in the first solar system remained on their own plane,being too sinless and holy to find opportunity in that very material andintellectual evolution. Even in this, they will find it impossible to do morethan influence the incarnating Jivas, imparting to them ability to realise thenature of group consciousness, the quality of the seven Heavenly Men, but notbeing able to express themselves fully. Some clue to this mystery will come ifthe student carefully bears in mind that in our solar system and our sevenplanes, we have only the physical body of the Logos, and that that physical bodyis a limitation of the expression of His threefold nature. The first (sixth)Hierarchy might be viewed as endeavouring to express the mental vibration of thesolar Logos and the second, His emotional, or cosmic astral, nature.This second (seventh) Hierarchy has for its type of force the second aspect ofthe seventh type of force from out of the many. Some idea of the relative pointin evolution of the solar Logos may be gained by study of the varying aspects offorce which He is demonstrating in this particular incarnation. It is thisenergy which drives the Monads through into physical incarnation for it makesitself felt on the seventh plane. The energies which are functioning are thosewhich the Logos has unfolded, and are the gain of previous incarnations. Gapsnecessarily occur, and certain types of force are lacking, because He has as yetmuch cosmically to gain.It is the energy of this Hierarchy (whose numbers are two and seven) whichresults in the manifestation of the Divine Androgyne, and in the seven centresof force which are the seven Spiritual Energies.Hierarchy III. The third Creative Hierarchy (or the eighth) is a peculiarlyinteresting one. They are called “the Triads” for they hold in themselves thepotencies [1199] of triple evolution, mental, psychical, and spiritual. TheseTriads of Life are inherently the three Persons and the flower of the earliersystem from a certain angle. From another angle, when studied as the “flower ofthe earlier Eight,” They are the eightfold points awaiting opportunity to flameforth. They are the devas who are ready for service, which is to give to anotherhierarchy certain qualities which are lacking. This Hierarchy is regarded as thegreat donors of immortality whilst themselves “standing aloof from incarnation.”Lords of Sacrifice and Love are They, but They cannot pass out of the logoicetheric body into the dense physical vehicle.This third Hierarchy wields the third aspect of electric force of the first typeof cosmic energy. They stand for a recurrent cycle of that first type symbolisedby the number 8. The formulae for these electrical energies are too complicatedto be given here, but the student should bear in mind that these hierarchiesexpress:1. Septenary cosmic energy.2. Cosmic prana.3. Solar energy or electric fire, solar fire and fire by friction.Each hierarchy manifests a triple energy or an aspect of each of the above, andthat necessitates a ninefold differentiation, for the two first are triple as isthe third. It is the rejection of the Triadal Lives by units in the fourthHierarchy, that of the human Monads, which precipitates a man eventually intothe eighth sphere. He refuses to become a Christ, a Saviour and remainsself-centred.We have dealt with the first three hierarchies which are regarded as ever“seeing the Face of the Ruler of the Deep,” or as being so pure and holy thatTheir forces are in realised contact with Their emanating source.We now take up for brief consideration two hierarchies [1200] which closelyconcern ourselves, the human self-conscious entities. These two groups areliterally three, as the fifth Hierarchy is a dual one and it is this which hasled to some confusion and is the occult significance behind the ill-omenednumber thirteen. They are the “Seekers of satisfaction” and the cause of thesecond fall into generation, the fact behind the taking of a lower nature by theEgo. The fourth and the fifth Hierarchies are the ninth and tenth, or the“Initiates” and the “Perfect Ones.” All human beings, or “Imperishable Jivas,”are those who evolve through a graded series of initiations either self-inducedor brought about on our planet with extraneous aid. This they achieve through a“marriage” with the order next to them, the fifth. They are then completed orperfected, and it is owing to this occult fact that the fourth Hierarchy isregarded as masculine and the fifth as feminine.Hierarchy IV . The fourth Creative Hierarchy is the group wherein the highestaspect of man, his “Father in Heaven” finds place. These lives are the points offire who must become the flame; this they do through the agency of the fifthHierarchy and the four wicks, or the two dual lower hierarchies. Thus it can beseen that where man is concerned, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventhhierarchies are, during the cycle of incarnation, his very self. They are the“Lords of Sacrifice” and “Lords of Love,” the flower of Atma-buddhi.In studying these hierarchies, one of the most valuable lessons to be learned isthe place and importance of man in the scheme. The hierarchy, for instance,which is the essence of the intangible Life of Spirit, and principle of Buddhi,is the esoteric cause of the cosmic marriage of spirit and matter, based on thelove and desire of the Logos, but each hierarchy also expresses itself throughone particular manifestation which comes to be regarded by the finite mind ofman as the hierarchy itself. This [1201] is not so, and care must be taken todistinguish between these hierarchies.They are latent germs of force centres and manifest subjectively; they warm andvitalise groups of forms; they flower forth and express themselves through themedium of a form, or another hierarchy. These hierarchies are all interrelatedand are negative or positive to each other as the case may be.As is stated in the Secret Doctrine , this hierarchy is the nursery for theincarnating Jivas; (S. D., I, 238.) and it carried in it the germs of the Liveswhich achieved the human stage in another solar system, but were not able toproceed beyond that owing to the coming in of pralaya, which projected them intoa state of latency. The condition of the hierarchy is similar, only on a cosmicscale, to the condition of the seeds of human life held in a state ofobscuration during an interchain period. The three other hierarchies dealt with(first, second, and third) were those who have (in previous kalpas of logoicmanifestation) passed beyond the human stage altogether. They are, therefore,the formless groups, as the remaining are the rupa groups or those having forms.The fourth Creative Hierarchy, or the ninth, must ever be regarded in this solarsystem as occupying what might be considered as the third place,First, the Lives or the three Persons of the Trinity.Second, the Prototypes of man, the seven Spirits.Third, man or the lowest manifestation of the self-conscious Spirit aspect.This needs to be carefully considered and has no reference to the form aspectbut solely to the nature of the lives expressing themselves through other liveswho are also self-conscious , or fully intelligent. This, certain of thehierarchies are not.[1202] The four lower hierarchies are all concerned with manifestation in thethree worlds, or in the dense physical body of the solar Logos. They are thosewho can discard or pass through the etheric body of the solar Logos and takeforms composed of either gaseous, liquid, or dense substance. The others cannot.They cannot fall into physical generation.Students must bear in mind that from the standpoint of the Logos, the solarAngels on the mental plane (the fifth subplane of the cosmic physical plane) arein physical incarnation, and what is called the “second fall” applies to this.The first fall has reference to the taking of a form of cosmic etheric matter,such as is the case with the Heavenly Men, the prototypes of the human jivas. Inthis latter case the bodies used are called “formless” from our standpoint, andare “vital bodies” animated by cosmic prana. In the case of ourselves and theremaining groups, the forms are composed of substance of the three lower planes(that which the Logos does not regard as principle) and, therefore, matterresponding still to the vibration of the earlier system. This means that thefour lower hierarchies are links between the life of the past and of the future.They are the present. They had not finished their contacts with the activeintelligent principle of the preceding kalpa, and so must continue such contactsin this. They will work out of it in this system, the four will become the threeand they will then be the three, higher arupa hierarchies of the next system.Before continuing our consideration of the particular hierarchies, it isnecessary to point out that in these hierarchies, certain of them are termed“dominant hierarchies” and others “subsidiary hierarchies.” By this is meantthat certain of them are in this solar system expressing themselves more fullythan the others, and this necessarily entails the consequence that theirvibration is more to be felt than that of the subsidiary groups. [1203] Thedominant groups are the second, fourth and fifth, and this because:a. The second is the great expression of duality, of the Son as He vitalises theSun.b. The fourth is the hierarchy of human Monads who are the mediators or thesynthesisers; they express the gain of System 1 and the goal of System 2.c. The fifth or tenth is closely linked with the five liberated hierarchies, andis an expression of their synthesised life. It might, therefore, be said thatthe fifth Hierarchy serves as the representative of the five liberated groupsand the fourth is the representative group in this system, whilst the secondrepresents (for man, or these two groups united) that which is the Spiritaspect, the Father, the Unknown.Hierarchy V. The fifth Creative Hierarchy is, as we know from study of theSecret Doctrine, a most mysterious one. This mystery is incident upon therelation of the fifth Hierarchy to the five liberated groups. This relation, inconnection with our particular planet, which is not a sacred planet, can besomewhat understood if the history of the Buddha and his work is contemplated.This is hinted at in the third volume of the Secret Doctrine. ( S. D., I, 239;III, Sections 43, 44, 45)The relation of the fifth Hierarchy to a certain constellation has also abearing upon this mystery. This is hidden in the karma of the solar Logos, andconcerns His relationship to another solar Logos, and the interplay of forcebetween them in a greater mahakalpa. This is the true “secret of the Dragon,”and it was the dragon-influence or the “serpent energy” which caused the influxof manasic or mind energy into the solar system. Entangled closely with thekarma of these two cosmic [1204] Entities, was that of the lesser cosmic EntityWho is the Life of our planet, the planetary Logos. It was this triple karmawhich brought in the “serpent religion” and the “Serpents or Dragons of Wisdom”in Lemurian days. It had to do with solar and planetary Kundalini, or serpentfire. A hint lies in the fact that the constellation of the Dragon has the samerelation to the ONE greater than our Logos as the centre at the base of thespine has to a human being. It concerns stimulation, and vitalisation with aconsequent co-ordination of the manifesting fires.A clue to the mystery lies also in the relation of this fifth group to the twocontracting poles. They are the fivefold Links, the “Benign Uniters” and “theProducers of the Atonement.” Esoterically, they are the “Saviours of the Race”and from Them emanates that principle which—in conjunction with the highestaspect—lifts the lower aspect up to Heaven.When these mysteries are carefully studied, and due application made to thelives of the greatest exponents of the at-one-ing principle, it will becomeapparent how great and all-important is their place in the scheme.It is for this reason that the units of the fifth Hierarchy are called “TheHearts of Fiery Love”; they save through love, and in their turn these lives arepeculiarly close to the great Heart of Love of the solar Logos. These greatredeeming Angels, who are the Sons of Men on their own true plane, the mental,are ever, therefore, pictured as taking the form of twelve-petalled lotuses—thissymbology linking them up with “the Son of Divine Love,” the manifested solarsystem, which is said to be a cosmic twelve-petalled lotus, and with the logoiccausal lotus, equally of a twelve-petalled nature.We have, therefore, a direct flow of energy flowing through: [1205]a. The logoic twelve-petalled egoic Lotus. Cosmic mental plane.b. The solar twelve-petalled Lotus.c. The planetary logoic Heart, also a twelve-petalled Lotus.d. The twelve-petalled human egoic lotus on the mental plane.e. The twelve-petalled heart centre in a human being.Or, to word it otherwise, energy flows directly from:a. The solar Logos via three great cosmic centres:1. The central spiritual Sun.2. The heart of the Sun.3. The physical Sun.b. The heart centre of the planetary Logos, situated on the fourth cosmicetheric plane (our buddhic plane)c . The egoic lotus of a human being on the mental plane, which is literally acorrespondence to the “heart of the sun.” The monadic point is a reflection inthe human system of the “central spiritual sun.”d. The heart centre of a man on the etheric plane of the physical plane, whichis in its turn a correspondence to the physical sun.Thus the tiny atom man is linked with the great central Life of the solarsystem.This Fifth Hierarchy is equally, under the law, a distributor of energy to thefifth subplane of each plane in the system, only it must be borne in mind thatin the three worlds, it is the fifth subplane counting from above downwardwhilst in the worlds of superhuman evolution, it is the fifth counting frombelow upwards. This hierarchy wields, as we know, the dual aspects of manas, onein the three worlds and one which makes itself felt in higher spheres.[1206] It is necessary to bear in mind that all these groups are (even whentermed “formless”) the true forms of all that persists, for all are in theetheric body of the solar Logos or planetary Logos. This is a point requiringcareful emphasis; students have for too long regarded the form as being thedense physical body, whereas to the occultist the physical body is not the form,but a gross maya, or illusion, and the true form is the body of vitality.Therefore, these hierarchies are the sumtotal of the vital lives and thesubstratum or the substance of all that is. We might regard the subject asfollows:a . The four superior groups are the hierarchies expressing themselves throughthe three cosmic ethers, the second, third and fourth.b. The two lowest groups are the lives which are found functioning as theinvolutionary matter (organised and unorganised) of the logoic dense physicalbody, the liquid and gaseous, with the living substance of the four highersubplanes of the systemic dense physical body.c. The fifth Hierarchy has an interesting position as the “mediating” bodybetween the higher four and those which are found on the lower three subplanes.There is a vital and significant correspondence to be found between the sevenhead centres and the seven groups of Egos on the mental plane, and there is anoccult analogy between the three head centres (pineal gland, pituitary body, andthe alta major centres) and the expression of these seven groups of Egos in thethree worlds. This is a most important esoteric fact, and all students ofmeditation upon the laws of at-one-ment must take this analogy intoconsideration.It is useful to remember the place of these hierarchies in the scheme, and torealise that upon the sumtotal of these vital bodies is gradually gathered thedense manifestation which we regard as the evolutionary matter. The forms arebuilt (from the form of all atoms to the [1207] body of the Ego, from the formof a flower to the vast planetary or solar lotus) because the hierarchies existas the aggregate of germ lives, giving the impulse, providing the model, andprocuring, through their very existence, the entire raison d’être of all that isseen on all planes.Hierarchies VI and VII. These sixth and seventh Hierarchies which provide thesubstance forms of the three worlds have a vital use and a most interestingplace. From the logoic standpoint, they are not regarded as providingprinciples, but from the standpoint of man they do provide him with his lowestprinciples. They hold the same relation to the Logos as the dense physical bodydoes to man, and all that concerns the evolution of man must (in this particularplace) be studied as going on within the physical, logoic vehicle. They dealwith the display of physical energy; with the working out in the physicalvehicle, of all divine purposes, and with the physical organisation of a certaingreat cosmic Life.Particularly is this so when we view the two hierarchies under consideration.They are the lowest residue of the previous system, and the energy of thatmatter (liquid, gaseous and dense) which the vibration of the logoic permanentatom (on the plane adi) attracts to itself in the building of the divine form.For purposes of clarification and of generalisation, it might be noted that theseventh Hierarchy is the life or energy found at the heart of every atom, itspositive aspect, and the sixth Hierarchy is the life of the forms of all theetheric bodies of every tangible object. The function of this Hierarchy is welldescribed in the words of the old Commentary:“The devas hear the word go forth. They sacrifice themselves and out of theirown substance they build the form desired. They draw life and the material fromthemselves, and yield themselves to the divine impulse.”[1208] It is not possible to say much more anent these two last Hierarchies.Much that concerns them has been covered in the section of this Treatise whichdeals with the fire of matter. I would only point out that just as we teach inthe occult wisdom that there is a definite progression from one kingdom into thenext higher above, so there is a similar activity in the realm of thehierarchies. The lives which compose a Hierarchy pass in ordered cycles into thenext above, though the word “above” but serves to mislead. It is consciousnessand realisation which must be considered as being transferred and theconsciousness of one hierarchy expands into that of the next higher.This can also be viewed in terms of energy. The negative lives of a hierarchyfollow the following sequence:1. Negative energy.2. Equilibrised energy.3. Positive energy.The positive lives of one hierarchy become the negative lives of another whenthey pass into it, and this it is which leads to the general confusion of ideasunder which the average student labours. If he is to comprehend the matter withaccuracy, he must study each hierarchy in a threefold manner, and view it alsoin its transitional state, as the negative blends and merges into the positive,and the positive becomes the negative pole of a higher vibratory stage. Thereare, therefore, nine states of consciousness through which each hierarchy has topass, and some idea of the significance of this and their relativity can begained by a consideration of the nine Initiations of the fourth CreativeHierarchy. Within these nine distinct expansions through which each life in eachhierarchy must pass, are to be found lesser expansions and it is here that themain difficulty for the student of divine psychology lies. The whole subjectconcerns the [1209] psyche, or second aspect, of every life—superhuman, humanand subhuman—and only when the true psychology is better understood will thesubject take on its true importance. Then the nine unfoldments of each hierarchywill be somewhat comprehended, and their relative importance assigned.Study of the matter in each kingdom will not as yet bring full enlightenmentregarding the constitution of the elements of the human kingdom and itsprinciples, which are the manifestations of the different hierarchies. The truerevelation will only come as the following points are recognised:1. The triple nature of man.2. The distinctions between the vehicle and that which utilises the vehicle.3. The distinction between a Ray which is the expression of logoic energy and apositive emanation, and a hierarchy which is a negative emanation of the Logos,upon which His positive energy impresses itself, driving that hierarchy on toself expression and forcing the “marriage of the poles.”The whole subject is very involved and difficult but light will begin to dawnbefore long when science recognises the nature, place and responsibility of theetheric body in man, or of his vital body, and its position as the true form,and basic unit of the dense physical body. When this has been admitted, and theilluminating facts recorded and known, when the connection between the two isgrasped, and the necessary deductions and correlations are made, the wholesubject of logoic manifestation and the work of the Lives on the four higherplanes, with their effect upon the Logoic dense physical plane (our three worldsof expression) will take on a new colouring. The thoughts of men will berevolutionised on the subject of creation; [1210] the terms and expressions nowused will be corrected, and all will be expressed in terms of form-buildingenergy, and the three modes of electrical phenomena. This realisation is rapidlyon its way but only the generation after the one which the children of thepresent age are expressing, will see it demonstrated to such an extent as toplace etheric electrical phenomena beyond all dispute. This will be done by thecoming in of egos who are fully conscious on the etheric levels and who can seeall that which is now the subject of speculation. They—from their great numbersand high stage of intellectuality—will rescue the whole matter from the realm ofcontroversy and demonstrate the facts.The work of building forms will never be understood till the true function ofthe etheric body is realised. It is the attractive agent for those lives whichare so low an order as to be occultly inert . These lives, which are notincluded in the list of hierarchies, are acted upon by the sixth and seventhgroups and by the energy emanating from them. They are stirred from the inertiain which they have rested, and are driven to take their place, and to form theconcrete vehicles of all that is. They are the lowest manifestation of thatwhich is abstract; they are the densest concretion of Spirit; they are thefailures of the system preceding this, and their failure is so complete (fromthe standpoint of consciousness) that all the response they can make to thepositive vibration of the seventh Hierarchy is simply to be attracted. They canbe occultly drawn into place but only at the close of this solar system willthey be in a condition to pass into and become the seventh Hierarchy of the nextsolar system.The goal for that which is not a principle is that it shall become a vitalprinciple through the play of energy upon it. We are dealing here with thatmysterious something which has been called “the refuse of that which earlier[1211] was seen,” with that latent energy which hid the lowest vibration of thesystem before ours, and which was so heavy, and so inert, as to be regardedbeyond the ken of the Logos. He was unaware of it, and the object before thesepeculiar lives which live (and yet are occultly dead) is that they must forcethemselves into the range of His conscious control by response to those liveswhich are consciously directed by Him, and who are, therefore, the Saviours ofthe lowest.4. Group Unity.Group unity must be viewed somewhat from the mystical standpoint. It is a truismin occultism to say that nothing stands alone, yet it is a fact that eachinfinitesimal part of the whole has three relations:1. To those units which form its body of manifestation.2. To its own unitary life.3. To that greater unit of which it forms a part.One of the main things which, it has been said, underlies logoic purpose, is theworking out of ways which will result in true group unity. All that is to beseen might be regarded as a gigantic endeavour on the part of a greatIntelligence to produce a group, and evolution is to be regarded, therefore, asa vast experiment with this objective in view.This triple responsibility above referred to exists for the atom or for thesolar Logos, and the trend of the evolutionary process is to make each unit,microcosm and macrocosm, an intelligent co-operator, responsive to forcesimpinging upon it externally, and aware of its own internal economy and of thelatent forces and energies which it has to contribute to the good of the whole.Man, standing as he does at the middle point in evolution, and marking the stagein the evolution of consciousness where a triple awareness ispossible,—awareness of individuality, awareness of the forces which are subhumanand [1212] which must be controlled, and awareness of a place within the planand purpose of a greater Man—must, therefore, rightly be regarded as the mostimportant of the evolutions, for through him can be worked out intelligently thelaws of group unity for all the three groups, superhuman, human, and subhuman.Above him stand those who are too pure or, as it is called, “too cold” to beimmersed in the matter of the three worlds, below him are found those liveswhich are too impure (occultly understood) or “too full of burning matter andveiled in smoke” to be able to mount of themselves into regions where stand theunveiled sons of God. Man, therefore, acts as the mediator, and in him andthrough him can be worked out group methods and laws which—in a later solarsystem—can form a basic law for unified work. It is this fact which brings aboutso much of the peculiar trouble and nature of the human kingdom, and it mighthere be said that on our planet, which is, it must be remembered, one of the“profane” planets, certain experiments in connection with this problem have beenundertaken by our planetary Logos. These (if successful) will result in a greatexpansion of the knowledge of the planetary Logos regarding the laws governingall bodies, and masses. Our planetary Logos has been given the name of the“experimenting divine Physicist.” It is this condition which makes the humanityof this planet unique in some respects, for they may be regarded as working outtwo main problems:1. The problem of establishing a conscious relation, and response, to the animalkingdom.2. The problem of simultaneously receiving and holding vibrations fromsuperhuman lives and of transmitting them consciously to the subhuman states.[1213] All this has to be accomplished by the units of the human kingdom in fullindividual consciousness, and the work of each human being might be regardedtherefore as having in view the establishment of a sympathetic relation withother human units and with the pitris of the animal kingdom, and also thedevelopment of the power to act as the transmitter of energies from greaterlives than his own, and to become a transmuting mediating agency.It might be of interest here to note that it is the problem of establishing arelation between the animal and himself which was the original basis of what iscalled Hatha-Yoga and tantric magic. The link was sought in this yoga with thatwhich was known to be similar in the two kingdoms (the physical body with itsactivities and purposes) and that which should be negative in the human kingdomwas stimulated into a positive agency through the power of the will. Thatfollowers of Hatha-Yoga are not aware of this purpose may be true, but theoriginating exponents of the Hatha-Yoga mysteries were well aware of thisobjective, and in their zeal for unity between the two kingdoms, sought unity inthe lower aspects, and neglected the real method.III. GROUP RELATIONSIn establishing group relation with the superhuman kingdoms, man has not soerred, though relatively little progress has as yet been made, and few are thehuman units who have merged their consciousness with that of the greaterdirecting Intelligences and yet remained in the human family. This is the trueRaja Yoga.It will be apparent, therefore, that in the fourth or human kingdom, wherein thefourth Hierarchy is seeking experience, there is an effort on foot to effect themerging or centralisation of the forces of three groups,a. Of the energy for which the animal kingdom stands,b. Of purely human energy, [1214]c. Of the spiritual energy of the group which is the exponent of buddhic force,thus bringing in at the third great realisation, the force of atma itself, ofwhich buddhi is but the vehicle.These three streams of force should hold the following place:Buddhic force Positive. Human energy Equilibrised. Animal energy Negative.Or, to word it otherwise, the positive controlling factor in the human groupshould be spiritual energy, toward which the animal nature should be entirelyreceptive, these two holding towards each other the relative position ofFather-Mother. The purely human energy serves as the balancing factor and bringsabout an adjustment between the Spirit aspect and the material. It is thistriple group relation which makes the microcosm such a genuine reflection of thegreater Man and the Fourth Kingdom a true exponent of cosmic processes.The same laws govern the relationship of these three factors as govern the groupinter-relation of the Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva aspects; time and space or “divineopportunity” play their parts in microcosmic group work as they do in themacrocosmic, and cyclic evolution proceeds in its work of group adjustment forboth units, in order to produce eventual group harmony in both cases. It is theharmony of the individual with himself and with his environing units, and hisrealisation of the essential oneness of all life which brings about the greatexpansions of consciousness and leads to individual identification with somegreater whole.The work of a human atom, therefore, is but a replica of that which proceeds inthe planetary, or solar atom, and serves as an incentive to those minuteindividual lives which find their place in the six subhuman kingdoms (the [1215]three elemental, and the three material). In one case we have a correspondenceof so close a nature as to be almost a replica on a tiny scale; in the other wehave analogies which produce what may be regarded as a reflection of the whole;in both cases we have basic group relations, fundamental group laws whichproduce group inter-relations, and bring about an essential union between allthe forms of life. It is not my intention to say much anent group forms andwork. It is for the student to study himself and that which surrounds him, andthus arrive at his own conclusions. We will, therefore, close this part of ourTreatise by a brief enumeration of:1. The three atomic relations.2. The seven laws of group work.3. The twenty-two methods of interplay.These thirty-two phases and ideas must be applied in degree to all atoms, thetiny lives which are the sumtotal of all material worlds, the planetary atom,the macrocosm for all on the five planes, and the solar atom, the synthesis ofall on the seven planes and of the seven evolutions.1. Three Atomic Relations.Individual. This concerns the central fire of all atoms and affects the relationof that positive centre to all within its sphere of influence.Systemic. This concerns the relation of all atoms to other atoms which comewithin their range of influence, or their scale of contacts.Universal. This deals with the identification of all atoms with these particulargroups, and their consequent submergence in the interests of the greater whole.It might be noted here that the immediate objective of the human kingdom isconsciously to establish systemic relations, [1216] and be actively, andconsciously, part of group work. The individual consciousness of relationship issomewhat established owing to there being self-consciousness. The work for thesubhuman kingdoms is the establishment of conscious self-realisation, or thebringing about of a distinct individualism in every form of atomic life, whilstthe object for the superhuman lives is the establishment of a universalconsciousness which will enable every planet and solar life to be consciouslyand intelligently part of a cosmic whole.2. The Seven Laws of Group Work.These can only be expressed largely through the medium of mystical terms, and itis left to the intuition of the student to apply them to the more material formsof life.Law 1. The Law of Sacrifice. This involves the immolation and sacrifice of thatwhich has been realised. This is crucifixion, the basic law of all group work,the governing principle which results in each human unit eventually becoming aSaviour.Law 2. The Law of Magnetic Impulse. The law governing the primary realisationsby any atom of its environing contacts, and the going out, or feeling after, bythat atom so that eventually a relation between that which is realised as partof the group and the unit is established. This is not the same thing as makingsense contacts, as the relation established is between the Self in all, and notbetween aspects of the Not-Self. This law is sometimes called “The first steptowards marriage,” for it results in an eventual union between the man or atomand the group which produces harmonious group relations.Law 3. The Law of Service. This law, for want of a better name, concerns theidentification of an atom with the group interest, and the steady negation ofthe atom’s own material interests; it really deals with the process or [1217]method whereby an atom (positive in its own centralised life) gradually becomesresponsive and receptive to the positive life of the group.Law 4. The Law of Repulsion . This law concerns itself with the ability of anatom to throw off, or refuse to contact, any energy deemed inimical to groupactivity. It is literally a law of service, but only comes consciously into playwhen the atom has established certain basic discriminations, and guides itsactivities through a knowledge of the laws of its own being. This law is not thesame as the Law of Repulsion which is used in connection with the Law ofAttraction between forms which have relation to the material. The laws we arenow considering have relation to the psyche, or to the Vishnu aspect. One groupof laws concern energies emanating from the physical sun; the ones we are nowconsidering emanate from the heart of the Sun. The “repulsion” here dealt withhas the effect (when consciously applied through the developed heart energy of ahuman atom, for instance) of furthering the interests of the repulsed unit andof driving this unit closer to its own centre. Perhaps some idea of the greatbeauty of this law as it works out can be gathered from an occult phrase in acertain old book:“This repulsive force drives in seven directions, and forces all that itcontacts back to the bosom of the seven spiritual fathers.”Through repulsion, the units are driven home and the straying unconscious onesare forced towards their own centre. The Law of Repulsion, or the stream ofenergy for which it is but a name, can work from any centre, but as dealt withhere, it must emanate from the heart if it is to bring about the necessary groupwork.Law 5. The Law of Group Progress . This is sometimes called “the Law ofElevation” for it concerns the mysteries of group realisation, and expansions ofconsciousness [1218] and the part each unit plays in the general progress of agroup. In relation to the human family, for instance, the truth must ever beborne in mind that no human atom arrives at “fullness of life” without addingmuch to the general nature of his own group. The elevation of a unit results inthe raising of the group; the realisation of the unit brings about eventuallygroup recognition; the initiation of the unit leads finally to planetaryinitiation, and the attainment of the goal by the human atom and his achievementof his objective brings about steadily and ceaselessly group achievement. No manliveth to himself, and the crucifixion of the units throughout the aeons, andtheir realisation of their essential nature, only in order to offer up the bestthey have and realise to the interests of the group, are but the methods wherebythe work of liberation is carried forward.Sacrifice, Service, Magnetism (“I, if I be lifted up, will draw” ), GroupProgress, Divine Repulsion, these are but the inadequate terms whereby we seekto express the divine truth that the whole life and expression of the solarLogos will only be possible, and His purpose only be revealed, when He hasbrought each atomic unit to the stage of self-realisation. Then He will leadthem on to the point of sacrificing that realised self so that divine purposeand will may be consummated, and the divine life and glory shine forth inperfect radiance.This might be expressed in more material terms by saying that through thedominance of these laws of the Soul, the logoic physical body will become anactive expression of His self-realised purpose.The final two laws concerning group activity can only be very briefly treated astheir true significance is only apparent to pledged disciples. They concernprimarily the astral and the mental planes, and, therefore the correspondingvehicles of the group units. A group, it [1219] should be remembered, which isfunctioning on the physical plane is also found in a still larger form on theastral and the mental. Just as the astral body of a man is larger than hisphysical body, and, therefore, has built into its structure a larger number ofatomic units, so a group contains (astrally considered) more units than on thephysical plane. The laws we are touching upon concern the relation of thephysical plane units to those units who form a part of the group, and yet arefunctioning without the physical plane sheaths or vehicles. The same idea mustbe applied to the units devoid of a physical vehicle who form a component partof the mental body of the group.These two laws are termed:6. The Law of Expansive Response.7. The Law of the Lower Four.These laws only become operative in units on the physical plane which arebecoming responsive consciously to those group workers who are discarnate.All these laws, from the point of view of a disciple, need only be considered asoperative in the three worlds, though it is needless to point out that parallelswill be found on all planes. These seven laws are those which are ascertainedand consciously studied in all groups working under the Masters.For each of these Laws, there is a definite formula and symbol. At this stage ofteaching or through this Treatise, it is not possible to reveal or impart theformulas. The symbol may be described, and if the student will carefully ponderupon the nomenclature of the Law, its occult name and its symbol, much may begathered anent group inter-relations. It is these laws which the coming cycle ofregeneration will enunciate, and which the Great Lord will demonstrate upon Hisappearing, and it is these laws which will gradually be applied to the workingmethods [1220] of all organisations, brotherhoods, fraternities and masoniccircles.THE LAWS AND SYMBOLSNo. Exoteric Name Esoteric Name Symbol Ray Energy 1.

A rosy cross, with a bird hovering above it.Law 2. Two balls of fire united by a triangle of fire, thus picturing the tripleinterplay between all atomic structures.Law 3. A pitcher of water, balanced on the head of a man, standing in the formof a cross. It is this law which brings in the energy, symbolised by the signAquarius, and this law is the governing factor of the Aquarian age. It mighthere be added that the symbol for Law 2 was the [1221] origin of the balance orscales of the sign Libra, but in the course of the ages its true form wasdistorted. Not all the astrological signs can be traced to the symbols, for onlya few can be traced back as far as the Master’s ashram.Law 4 . Here we have the angel with the flaming sword turning in all directions.This symbolism is held true in the Bible where the Angel guards the treasure,and drives man forth in search of another way of entrance, thus forcing himthrough the cycle of rebirth until he finds the portal of initiation. Thisportal is occultly regarded as freed from the intervention of the sword as manhas developed the ability to soar and mount as an eagle on wings.Law 5. The symbol for this is the mountain with a goat standing on the summit,and again an astrological sign, that of Capricorn, can be noted. All hard placescan be surmounted, and the summit reached by the “Divine Goat,” symbol of thegroup, viewed as a unit.Law 6. The symbol contains a flaming rosy sun with a sign in the centre—a signsymbolising the union of fire and water; below this sign is found a hieroglyphicwhich may not be given as it gives the clue to the Earth sign, and the keynoteof the physical body of the planetary Logos.Law 7. This symbol takes the form of a male and female figure standing back toback, the male figure holding above his head what looks like a shield or tray ofsilver, a great reflector, whilst the female figure holds aloft an urn full ofoil. Below this sign is another hieroglyphic which [1222] contains the secret ofthe astral plane, which has to be dominated by the mental.These seven laws can be worked out along the line of correspondences. It will befound that the energy of any particular centre and that of any one law can bebrought into line with each other.3. The Twenty-two methods of Group Interplay .These methods of group interplay can only be grasped through a consideration ofthe fact that all groups are to be found on one or other of the seven Rays, andthat their interaction will, therefore, be triple. This must again be regardedas having:a . A triple internal interplay.b . A triple external interaction.We might, therefore, take the seven Rays and give the names for the three waysin which the groups on any particular ray interact with each other, rememberingthat as we consider them, we are really studying the twenty-one vibrations ofthe Law of Attraction or motion, with the basic vibration, which is thesynthesis of the twenty-one added, thus making the twenty-two:RAY METHODS OF ACTIVITYI. Ray of Power.1. Destruction of forms through group interplay.2. Stimulation of the Self, or egoic principle.3. Spiritual impulse, or energy.II. Ray of Love Wisdom.4. Construction of forms through group intercourse.5. Stimulation of desire, the love principle.6. Soul impulse, or energy.III. Ray of Activity or Adaptability.7. Vitalising of forms through group work.8. Stimulation of forms, the etheric or pranic principle.9. Material impulse, or energy. [1223]IV. Ray of Harmony, Union.10. Perfecting of forms through group interplay.11. Stimulation of the solar Angels, or the manasic principle.12. Buddhic energy.V. Ray of Concrete Knowledge.13. Correspondence of forms to type, through group influence.14. Stimulation of logoic dense physical body, the three worlds.15. Manasic energy or impulse.VI. Ray of Abstract Idealism or Devotion.16. Reflection of reality through group work.17. Stimulation of the Man through desire.18. Desire energy, instinct and aspiration.VII. Ray of Ceremonial Order.19. Union of energy and substance through group activity.20. Stimulation of all etheric forms.21. Vital energy.These twenty-one methods and their synthesis sum up very largely all that can besaid anent the actions and motions of all deva substance and all forms. Underthe Law of Attraction, the interplay between these ray forces and all atomicforms is brought about, and manifestation becomes a fact in nature, and thegreat Maya is. It might here be noted in conclusion that the following factors: 3Atomic Relations 7Laws 22 Methods of activity32make the thirty-two vibrations necessary to produce, as far as man is concerned,the five planes of evolution. There are, as we know, the thirty-five subplanes,or in reality the thirty-two minor vibrations and the three which dominate. Justas the three planes of the Ego on [1224] the mental plane dominate the remainingplanes in the three worlds, so in the five worlds of the Hierarchy the threehigher subplanes of the atmic plane hold an analogous place.THE SEVEN HIERARCHIESHierarchy Nos. Symbol Aspect Force Type 1. The Divine Lives. 1 or 6. Closedtwelve petalled Lotus Golden. One of the 6th Cosmic Force or shakti 2. TheBurning Sons of Desire. 2 or 7 Seven coloured Spheres, each with a central fire.Two of the 7th Shakti 3. The Triads or the Triple Flowers. 3 or 8 A triple Flamehovering over a glowing altar. Three of the 1st Shakti or type of force 4. TheLords of Sacrifice or The lnitiates. 4 or 9. The Son, standing with outstretchedarms in space. Second of the 4th Cosmic energy. 5. The Crocodiles or the PerfectOnes. 5 or 10 The five-pointed Star with the symbol of Systern1 in the centre.Fourth of the 5th Cosmic force (Mahat). 6. The Sacrificial Fires. The Aspirants.6 or 11 A silver Moon surmounted by an equal armed Cross. Third of the 6thCosmic force. 7. The Baskets of Nourishment or The Blinded Lives. 7 or 12 A Manreversed with his eyes closed. Fourth of the 7th Creative force.In closing, we might give certain of the symbols for the twelve CreativeHierarchies. It is not possible to give the symbols whereby the Adepts knowthem, for in those symbols would be revealed much that it is deemed wiser toguard in secrecy, but the symbols, as they are [1225] found in recordsaccessible to disciples, may be given, and from the close scrutiny of these someknowledge as to the essential character of the hierarchy may be revealed.The symbols for the five hierarchies which have passed on may be stated asfollows:1. A ball of green fire with three rays of rose.2. A sphere, divided by a Tau, in colours green and silver.3. A bird, with plumage dark and with the eye of radiant fire.4. Two stars of vivid rose linked by a band of violet.5. An ovoid of colour indigo with five letters or symbolic words within itsborders.These hierarchies are also classed together and viewed as one and are called inesoteric parlance:“The Lives of that which appeared, rotated and gathered to themselves the fifthaspect of Mahat.”This symbol, which signifies the liberation achieved and the gains attained inSystem One, takes the form of a blazing altar of pure fire out of which isescaping a bird of green and gold plumage with five wings outspread. Above thissymbol appear certain hieroglyphics in the earliest Sensa script signifying,“Still I seek.”The symbols of the seven Creative Hierarchies now in manifestation are allenclosed in a circle denoting limitation and the circumscribing of the Life. Allthese hierarchies are Sons of Desire, and are paramountly an expression of thedesire for manifested life of the solar Logos. They receive their primaryimpulse from the cosmic astral plane. They are also the expression of avibration emanating from the second row of petals in the logoic Lotus on thecosmic mental plane.They are, therefore, one and all an expression of His love nature, and it is forthis reason that buddhi is found at the heart of the tiniest atom, or what wecall in this [1226] system, electric fire. For the positive central life ofevery form is but an expression of cosmic buddhi, and the downpouring of a lovewhich has its source in the Heart of the Solar Logos; this is itself anemanating principle from the ONE ABOVE OUR LOGOS, HE OF WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID.It is love limiting itself by desire, and for that which is desired. It is lovepouring itself out into forms which are stimulated and aided thereby; it is thefulfillment of divine obligations incurred in the dim and distant kalpas whichantedate the triplicity of solar systems which we can dimly vision, and it isthe “Father of Light” (in a cosmic connotation) pouring Himself out for thatwhich binds Him and which it is His dharma to lift up to His Throne. It is notpossible to picture the revelation of the Love of the solar Logos as it revealsitself to the eye of the illuminated seer, nor to show the nature of the cosmicLord of Sacrifice as He limits Himself in order to save. At each step along thePath, the extent of that love and sacrifice is opened up as the disciple knowshimself to be in tiny measure also a Lord of Sacrifice and Love. It can only beappreciated as the two inner rows of egoic petals are unfolded; knowledge wouldnot reveal it, and it is only as a man transcends knowledge, and knows himselfto be something non-separative, and inclusive that this particular revelationcomes to him.This is the secret behind the seven symbols, each one of which hides an aspectof the sevenfold Love of God as it is revealed through the hierarchy of Beings,or as the Son reveals it, Who is the sumtotal of the Love of God.We might at the same time consider the type of force wielded by a particularhierarchy."},{"pageContent":"SECTION THREE. THE FIRE OF SPIRIT - ELECTRIC FIREDIVISION A. CERTAIN BASIC STATEMENTS.[1229] In connection with this final section of the Treatise on Cosmic Fire ,dealing with the Electric Fire of Spirit it should be remembered that it will bequite impossible to impart information of a definite character; this subject isconsidered (from the standpoint of the esoteric student) to be devoid of formand therefore incognisable by the lower concrete mind. The nature of Spirit canonly be intelligibly revealed to the higher grades of the initiates, that is, tothose who (through the medium of the work effected in the third Initiation) havebeen put in conscious contact with their “Father in Heaven,” the Monad. Esotericstudents, disciples and the initiates of lower degree are developing contactwith the soul, or the second aspect, and only when this contact is firmlyestablished can the higher concept be entertained. The nature of Spirit is dealtwith in the New Testament in one of the esoteric statements addressed by theGreat Lord to the initiate, Nicodemus. As he was an initiate of the seconddegree it may be supposed that he had some glimmering of understanding as to themeaning of the words, which were spoken to him as part of his training inpreparation for the third Initiation.“The wind (prana or Spirit) bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the soundthereof but canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. So is everyonethat is born of the Spirit.”Two ideas are conveyed in this thought-form,—those of an emanating sound anddirection, and that which is [1230][Image00018.jpg][1231] the result of the sound. This is evolution and the effect of thedirecting energy or activity of Spirit. From the point of view of consciousnessthese are the only things which the disciple can intelligently comprehend.All that it will be possible for us to do in this section will be to impart thetruth in three ways. Through the illumination of the student’s mind as hestudies the stanzas of Dzyan which will be found at the commencement of thetreatise. Secondly, through the realisation that will come to the student as hecorrelates and ponders upon the various occult fragments found scattered throughthe pages, primarily centering his attention upon the following words:“The secret of the Fire lies hid in the second letter of the Sacred Word. Themystery of life is concealed within the heart. When the lower point vibrates,when the Sacred Triangle glows, when the point, the middle centre and the apex,connect and circulate the Fire, when the threefold apex likewise burns, then thetwo triangles—the greater and the lesser—merge into one Flame, which burneth upthe whole.”Thirdly, through the consideration of the various charts and word pictures whichwill be found also scattered through the Treatise . The student of the new erawill approach much that he has to master through the medium of the eye, learningthereby to appreciate and solve that which is presented to him in the form oflines and diagrams. All is symbol and these symbols must be mastered.It must also be borne in mind that students who approach the subject of SPIRITneed to grasp the following facts.I. Whilst in manifestation and therefore during the period of an entire solarsystem, it is not possible for the highest Dhyan Chohan to think in terms of thenegation of organised substance and of the non-existence of form. The goal ofrealisation for man is consciousness of the nature of the Soul, the mediumthrough which the Spirit [1232] aspect, ever works. More it is not possible forhim to do. Having learnt to function as the soul, detached from the threeworlds, man then becomes a conscious corporate active part of that Soul whichpermeates and pervades all that is in manifestation. Then, and only then, thepure light of Spirit per se becomes visible to him through a just appreciationof the Jewel hidden at the heart of his own being; then only does he becomeaware of that greater Jewel which lies hidden at the heart of solarmanifestation. Even then at that advanced stage all that he can be aware of, cancontact and visualise, is the light which emanates from the Jewel and theradiance which veils the inner glory.The seer (see-er) has then become pure vision. He perceives but as yetcomprehends not the nature of that which is perceived, and it remains foranother solar system and another kalpa to reveal to him the meaning of thatrevelation, the source of that illumination, and the essence of that Life whosequality is known to him already by its vibratory rate, its heat and its light.Needless it is, therefore, for us to study and consider that which the initiateof high degree can only dimly sense; useless it is for us to seek for terms toexpress that which lies safely hidden behind all ideas and all thought, whenthought itself is not perfectly understood, and the machinery for comprehensionis not perfected. Man himself—a great idea and a specific one—knows not thenature of that which he is seeking to express.All that we can do is to apprehend the fact that there exists THAT which may notas yet be defined, to realise that a central life persists which permeates andanimates the Soul and which seeks to utilise the form through which the soulexpresses itself. This can be stated to be true of all forms, of all souls,human, subhuman, planetary and solar. [1233]II. The wise student will likewise regard all forms of expression as in thenature of symbols. A symbol has three interpretations; it is itself anexpression of an idea, and that idea has behind it, in its turn, a purposeinconceivable as yet. The three interpretations of a symbol might be consideredin the following way:1. The exoteric interpretation of a symbol is based largely upon its objectiveutility, and upon the nature of the form. That which is exoteric and substantialserves two purposes:a . To give some faint indications as to the idea or the concept. This links thesymbol in its exoteric nature with the mental plane, but does not release itfrom the three worlds of human appreciation.b. To limit and confine and imprison the idea and so adapt it to the point inevolution which the solar Logos, the planetary Logos and man have reached. Thetrue nature of the latent idea is ever more potent, complete and full than theform or symbol through which it is seeking expression. Matter is but a symbol ofa central energy. Forms of all kinds in all the kingdoms of nature, and themanifested sheaths in their widest connotation and totality are only symbols oflife—what that Life itself may be remains as yet a mystery.These exoteric symbolic forms are of many kinds and serve many purposes, andthis is largely responsible for the confusion in the minds of men on thesematters. All symbols emanate from three groups of Creators:The solar Logos, Who is constructing a “Temple in the Heavens not made withhands.”The Planetary Logoi , who—in Their seven groups—create through seven ways andmethods, and thus produce a diversity of symbols and are responsible forconcretion.[1234] Man, who builds forms and creates symbols in his work of every day, butwho as yet works blindly and largely unconsciously. Nevertheless, he merits thename of creator, because he utilises the faculty of mind and employs therational quality.The lesser devas and all the subhuman entities and all those builders who mustin some distant future pass through the human state of consciousness are notregarded as creators. They work under impulses emanating from the other threegroups. Each of the three groups is free within certain specified limits.2. The subjective interpretation is the one which reveals the idea lying behindthe objective manifestation. This idea, incorporeal in itself, becomes aconcretion on the plane of objectivity, and as stated above, an idea lies behindevery form without exception and no matter which group of creators isresponsible for its construction. These ideas become apparent to the studentafter he has entered the Hall of Learning, just as the exoteric form of thesymbol is all that is noted by the man who is as yet in the Hall of Ignorance.As soon as a man begins to use his mental apparatus and has made even a smallcontact with his ego three things occur:a. He reaches out beyond the form and seeks to account for it.b. He arrives in time at the soul which every form veils, and this he doesthrough a knowledge of his own soul.c. He begins then himself to formulate ideas in the occult sense of the term andto create and make manifest that soul-energy or substance which he finds he canmanipulate.To train people to work in mental matter is to train them to create; to teachpeople to know the nature of the [1235] soul is to put them in conscious touchwith the subjective side of manifestation and to put into their hands the powerto work with soul energy; to enable people to unfold the potencies of the soulaspect is to put them en rapport with the forces and energies hidden in theakasha and the anima mundi.A man can then (as his soul contact and his subjective perception isstrengthened and developed) become a conscious creator, co-operating with theplans of the Hierarchy of Adepts who work with ideas, and who seek to bringthese ideas (planetary ideas) into manifestation upon the physical plane. As hepasses through the different grades in the Hall of Learning his ability so towork and his capacity to get at the thought lying behind all symbols increases.He is no longer taken in by the appearance but knows it as the illusory formwhich veils and imprisons some thought.3. The spiritual meaning is that which lies behind the subjective sense andwhich is veiled by the idea or thought just as the idea itself is veiled by theform it assumes when in exoteric manifestation. This can be regarded as thepurpose which prompted the idea and led to its emanation into the world offorms. It is the central dynamic energy which is responsible for the subjectiveactivity.These three aspects of a symbol can be studied in connection with all atomicforms. There is, for instance, that unit of energy which we call the atom of thephysicist or chemist. It has itself a form which is the symbol of the energywhich produces it. This form of the atom is its exoteric manifestation. Thereare likewise those atomic aspects which we call—for lack of a better term—theelectrons; these electrons are largely responsible for the quality of anyparticular atom, just as the soul of a man is responsible for his peculiarnature. They represent the subjective aspect or life. Then, finally, there isthe positive aspect, the energy responsible for the coherence [1236] of thewhole and for the uniformity of the dual manifestation, exoteric and subjective.This is analogous to the spiritual meaning, and who can read that meaning?In man likewise, the human atom, these three aspects are found. Man on thephysical plane is the exoteric symbol of an inner subjective idea which ispossessed of quality and attributes and a form through which it seeksexpression. That soul in its turn is the result of a spiritual impulse, but whoshall say what that impulse is? Who as yet shall define the purpose behind thesoul or idea, whether logoic or human? All these three factors are yet inprocess of evolution; all are as yet “imperfect Gods,” each in their degree andtherefore unable to express fully that which is the spiritual factor lyingbehind the conscious soul.III. The wise student will also ponder well the words “the mystery ofelectricity,” which is the mystery surrounding that process which is responsiblefor the production of light and therefore of vibration itself. We have concernedourselves in the other two sections primarily with effects, with the resultsproduced through the operation of the subjective side of nature (that alonewhich the occultist considers and works with) and the consequent production ofobjective manifestation. Now we arrive at the realisation that there is a causelying behind that which has hitherto itself been regarded as a cause, for wediscover that behind all subjective phenomena there lies an essentiallyspiritual incentive. This incentive, this latent spiritual cause, is the objectof the attention of the spiritual man. The man of the world is occupied withobjective phenomena, with that which can be seen, be touched, and handled; theoccult student is engaged in studying the subjective side of life, and isoccupied with the forces which produce all that is familiar [1237] upon theterrestrial plane. These forces fall into three main groups:a. Forces emanating from the mental plane in its two divisions.b. Forces of a kamic nature.c. Forces of a purely physical description.These the occult student studies, experiments with, manipulates and correlates;through the knowledge thus gained there comes an understanding of all that canbe known in the three worlds, and likewise an understanding of his own nature.The spiritual man is he who having been both a man of the world and an occultstudent has reached the conclusion that behind all those causes with which hehas been hitherto engaged is a CAUSE; this causal unity then becomes the goal ofhis search. This is the mystery lying behind all mysteries; this is the secretof which all that has hitherto been known and conceived is but the veil; this isthe heart of the Unknown which holds hid the purpose and the key to all that IS,and which is only put into the hands of those exalted Beings Who—having workedtheir way through the manifold web of life—know Themselves indeed and in truthto be Atma, or Spirit itself, and veritable sparks in the one great Flame.Three times the cry goes out to all the Pilgrims upon the Path of Life: “Knowthyself” is the first great injunction and long is the process of attaining thatknowledge. “Know the Self” comes next and when that is achieved, man knows notonly himself but all selves; the soul of the universe is to him no longer thesealed book of life but one with the seven seals broken. Then when the manstands adept, the cry goes forth “Know the One” and the words ring in theadepts’ ears: “Search for that which is the responsible Cause, and having knownthe [1238]CHART XIII[Image00019.jpg]“This diagram is an outline of a portion of the Hierarchy at the present moment,and gives only the outstanding Figures, in connection with human evolution. Asimilar daigram from the standpoint of the deva evolution would be differentlyarranged”(The connecting lines indicate force currents)[1239][Image00020.jpg][1240] soul, and its expression, form, search for THAT which the soul reveals.”Here is to be found the clue to the search which the adept or perfected manundertakes when He puts His foot upon one of the seven possible paths. The onlyway in which any light can be thrown upon the mystery lies in the considerationof those seven cosmic Paths, of their names, and symbols. Very little can besaid for the secrets of the higher initiations may not be revealed, nor theinformation given in a book for exoteric publication. All that can be done is tomake certain suggestions, caution against certain conclusions, and indicatecertain symbols which, if pondered upon, may bring a certain amount ofillumination. [1241]DIVISION B. THE NATURE OF THE SEVEN COSMIC PATHS.It should be carefully borne in mind that when the term PATH is used, it issimply an energy term, and streams of energy are indicated,—seven streams whichblend and merge to form one Path. It should also be noted that the Adept Whoundergoes the discipline and who passes through initiatory rites which willenable him to tread those seven Paths, has transcended colour , has passedbeyond the veil and has expanded His consciousness so that he is at-one with theconscious life of His planetary Logos. He has therefore arrived at a stageincomprehensible to man now; He is passing out of the realm of substantial formsaltogether into the realm of energy. He knows the life of the two aspects, thesoul and the body, and is passing away from the realm of awareness altogether.This will sound to the average reader as a foolish jingling of words and asplitting of hairs but he who reasons by the Law of Correspondences and who hasgrasped the basic essential relativity of the three aspects to each other hasarrived at the knowledge that back of all form is a subjective Life which isknown by its quality, its colour, and its attributes; he has expanded hisconsciousness until gradually he has ascertained and made a part of his ownconscious ensemble those attributes and qualities. But the pulsating dynamicvibration which is the producing cause of both the subjective life and itsqualitative form is as yet—to him—the mystery of mysteries and the ineffablesecret. It becomes the goal of his endeavour as he sets foot upon one of theseven Paths which face him after the fifth Initiation. If a Master of the Wisdomand the one who has unified both the manas (intellect) and wisdom (buddhi) knowsnot what shall be revealed to him as he treads the cosmic Path which is hischoice, surely it is needless for us to try and comprehend (at our relativelylow stage of evolution) what is the true [1242] connotation of the word“Spirit.” Pondering upon these matters is (for the average man) not only uselessbut also dangerous. He has not yet the apparatus of thought necessary for itssafe undertaking. It is as if one tried to force a child in the first grade inschool to comprehend the differential calculus and the laws of trigonometry.These seven Paths, when trodden, prepare a man to pass certain cosmicinitiations, including those upon the Sun Sirius. One hint may here be given.Each of these Paths eventually leads to one or other of the six constellationswhich (with ours) form the seven centres in the body of the ONE ABOUT WHOMNAUGHT MAY BE SAID. Those adepts therefore who stay for a prescribed length oftime upon our planet are a correspondence to those greater initiates who remainfor many kalpas within the solar system, taking certain mysterious initiationsconcerned entirely with solar evolution. Their work is concerned with the systemas a centre in the body of that Existence Who vitalises the Logos of our ownsystem.It might be of value here to list the seven cosmic Paths as follows: ( 335[text00028.html#Y_FN335] )Path I The Path of Earth Service. Path II The Path of Magnetic Work. Path IIIThe Path of the Planetary Logos. Path IV The Path to Sirius. Path V The RayPath. Path VI The Path of the Solar Logos. Path VII The Path of Absolute Sonship[1243] It must be borne in mind and no confusion of thought must be permittedthat these terms are the generic names given in the mystic parlance of the Lodgeof Masters to the seven methods of work, of endeavour and of aspiration wherebythe perfected sons of Earth’s humanity pass on to specific cosmic Paths orstreams of energy, making in their totality one great cosmic WAY.The seven paths at a certain stage which may not be defined become the fourpaths, owing to the fact that our solar system is one of the fourth order. Thismerging is effected in the following way:The initiates upon Path I “fight their way” on to path VI.The initiates upon Path II “alchemise themselves” on to Path VII.The initiates upon Path III through “piercing the veil” find themselves uponPath V.This leaves Path IV to be accounted for. Upon this Path pass all those who,through devotion and activity combined, achieve the goal but who lack as yet thefull development of the manasic principle. This being the solar system oflove-wisdom, or of astral buddhic development, the fourth Path includes thelarger number of the sons of men. In the hierarchy of our planet the “Lords ofCompassion” are numerically greater than the “Masters of the Wisdom.” The formermust therefore all pass to the sun Sirius there to undergo a tremendous manasicstimulation, for Sirius is the emanating source of manas. There the mystic mustgo and become what is called “a spark of mahatic electricity.”These seven Paths are not concerned with nature or the balancing of the pairs ofopposites. They are concerned only with unity, with that which utilises thepairs of opposites as factors in the production of LIGHT. They deal [1244] withthat unknown quantity which is responsible for the pairs of opposites; thereforethey are primarily concerned with that which lies outside the manifested forms,with the true abstraction or the Absolute. Spirit and matter are neverdissociated during manifestation; they are the duality lying back of all that isobjective. Yet some factor is responsible for them—that which is neither Spiritnor matter, that which will be regarded as nonexistent by anyone except theinitiate. At the third Initiation some glimmering light upon this Abstraction issensed by the initiate, and by the time the fifth Initiation is reached enoughis apprehended by him to enable him to set forth with ardour on the search forits secret.Path I. The Path of Earth Service.The nature of the spiritual force which animates the group of our peculiarplanetary initiates will become apparent perhaps if the methods and purposes oftheir work are studied from the standpoint of subjective energy, and not sospecifically of the material form. This point of view can be gleaned most easilyfrom a consideration of the animating impulse lying behind all world groupswhich are particularly consecrated to the uplift of the race. This willnecessarily include all political, religious, scientific and metaphysicalorganisations. It will be found that each and all are definitely related andhave a point of at-one-ment with certain of the numerous occult bodies which are(usually unknown to the affiliated group) responsible for the vitalisation ofthe principal units in any of these organisations doing this pioneer work.This first path is the one that keeps a man linked to the Hierarchy which ispledged to the service of our planetary scheme. It comprises those who workunder the Lord [1245] of the World in the seven groups into which our Masters ofthe Wisdom are divided. Not so many Masters follow this Path as some of theothers, and only enough are permitted to do so to carry on planetary evolutionsatisfactorily. More is known about this Path than about any of the others, andmore will continuously be found out as members of our humanity fit themselves tocontact the Brothers of the Hierarchy. Their field of employ, Their methods ofwork will eventually become exoteric, and as the seven groups are recognised andknown, schools of development for the filling of posts in these groups will bethe logical sequence.The adepts who stay upon this Path are distinguished by a dual attribute, whichis their guarantee of attainment along this line of spiritual endeavour. Theyare animated by wise-compassion . These words should be carefully studied forthey hold the clue to the nature of this first Path. The adepts who choose thisPath are called esoterically the “beneficent dragons,” and the energy with whichthey work and the stream of living force upon which they are found emanates fromthe constellation of the Dragon, working through the zodiacal sign Libra. Thisspecial spiritual energy produces in all those groups which come under itsdirect influence a profound faculty for identification. This identification doesnot concern the form nor the soul but only the spiritual point of positive lifewhich in the human unit we call the “Jewel in the Lotus.” It should beremembered in this connection that there is a jewel at the heart of every atom.Every jewel has seven facets which are the seven doorways to the seven Paths.The “beneficent dragons” are distinguished by their “luminosity,” and it is thisbasic quality which lies behind the injunction given by all spiritual teachersto their pupils in the words “let your light shine forth.”[1246] When the adept enters through the “luminous door” he has before him fourvery peculiar and esoteric IDENTIFICATIONS. This entrance takes place after hehas passed the fifth Initiation and has demonstrated his fitness so to dothrough a long period of service in connection with our planetary evolution.These identifications eventually bring about within the jewel, which isessentially the true spiritual unit, a momentous happening, and are undergonewithin the monadic consciousness after the transcendence of the atmic sheath.These four identifications are connected with the fourfold lotus of the solarLogos, or with His twelve-petalled heart centre. This lotus is sometimes calledthe “heart of the Sun,” and concerns the subjective sun. It is not, however,possible to say more along this line.These four Identifications are only undergone upon this particular Path and areeach preceded by three lesser identifications which make a totality of twelveIdentifications, corresponding to the twelve-petalled lotus. It will be noted bythe accurate student that we are now discontinuing the use of the word“initiation” which has to do specifically with consciousness and therefore withduality and are utilising a word which connotes synthesis, though veryinadequately.The energy which is manipulated in the process of these identifications islargely that pouring through the sixth Hierarchy, which has an esoteric relationto the sixth Path on to which the initiates of Path I have eventually to fighttheir way. The form through which the adept must work in order to demonstratehis control of the energy concerned may not here be given. It may only be statedthat luminosity is gained upon the battle ground through a fight with a dragon.The following summation may be found suggestive: [1247]PATH I. EARTH SERVICEAttributes Wise-compassion. Source Constellation of the Dragon, via Libra.Method Twelve cosmic Identifications. Hierarchy The sixth. Symbol A green dragonissuing from the centre of a blazing sun. Behind the sun and over-topping it canbe seen two pillars on either side of a closed door. Quality gained Luminosity.Path II. The Path of Magnetic Work.In considering this Path students must bear in mind that they are dealing withthat Path which of all the seven expresses most fully the effects of the Law ofAttraction. It will be remembered by those who have carefully read this Treatisethat this law is the expression of the spiritual will which produces themanifestation of the Son (Sun). Magnetism—physical, attractive and dynamic—isthe expression of the law in the three worlds as far as the human unit isconcerned. It will be apparent, therefore, that the adept who passes upon thisPath is dealing with that reality which is the basis of all coherency in nature,and with that essence which through the force of its own innate quality producesthe attractive energy which brings together the pairs of opposites; it is theforce which is responsible for the interplay of electrical phenomena of everykind. The adept who chooses this cosmic stream of energy upon which to makecertain cosmic approaches and upon which to make a series of cosmic unfoldmentsis one who has worked primarily upon the second ray path prior to the fifthInitiation, and who frequently has also been upon the fourth ray path. Adeptswho have been upon the fourth ray path and who pass from thence upon the secondray do not as a rule choose this cosmic line of endeavour.[1248] Those who do the work of wielding forces or electrical magnetism for theuse of the Great Ones on all planes pass to this Path. They wield the elementalformative energy, manipulating matter of every density and vibration. Greatwaves of ideas and surging currents of public opinion on astral levels as wellas on the higher levels where work the Great Ones, are manipulated by them. Alarge number of fifth Ray people, those who have the Ray of Concrete Knowledgefor their monadic ray, pass to this line of endeavour. The inherent quality inthe type of the Monad settles the line of activity. The karma of the fifth rayis one of the factors which produces this. These Monads work with fohat, andmust, to the end of the greater manvantara. They have their eventual position onthe cosmic mental plane, but as yet the capacity for abstract thought is solittle developed that it is impossible for us to comprehend the significance ofthis expression.Three types of magnetic work have been mastered by the adept who treads thissecond Path. He has mastered (in the three worlds) the magical work of formconstruction through the manipulation of magnetic energy and the utilisation offohatic attractive energy in order to “bind the builders.” This he does throughthe medium of a purified lower nature which can act as a perfect transmitter.He has learnt also the secret of group coherence on the higher levels of themental plane in connection with his own planetary Logos, and with those twoother Logoi Who form with his own Logos a systemic triangle within the solarsystem. He has passed on also to a comprehension of the forces which unite thevarious streams of living energy emanating from Them in the furthering of theplans of solar evolution. This becomes possible to him when he can function inthe monadic vehicle and is conscious in that unit of force.[1249] This has been expressed in the old Commentary in the following words:“The seven Brothers love each other, yet each seeketh for many aeons the path ofhatred. They hate and kill each other until they find that which dieth not andis not hurt. Together then they stand and serve and through their service theseven suns burn up.”The seven suns are destroyed because when synthesis and unity are reached andwhen the differentiated forces become one homogeneous force, the attractive ormagnetic effect of this coherence is a manifested unit on the physical plane aswell as on the subjective side of nature. This produces necessarily thedestruction of all limiting forms, the merging of the fires, and the blazingforth into objectivity of the vital body of the Logos prior to the finalabstraction and the subsequent dying out or obscuration of the solar system.The will or purpose aspect which is the spiritual life behind all subjective andobjective phenomena suddenly makes itself felt and also seen. It is theproduction of this which is the main work of the adept who passes on to Path IIfrom off his particular ray path.Those who tread this second Path work with magnetic or attractive energy becausethey have identified themselves with it. Eventually they will all pass on toPath VII, which is the Path of Absolute Sonship. All that can be said here inregard to their efforts is the statement that this Path carries them (throughthe medium of the logoic head centre) into the Heart of the ONE ABOUT WHOMNAUGHT MAY BE SAID. They are swept out of systemic evolution altogether upon agreat tide of attractive energy which emanates from one of the major centres ofthat great Existence Who is the source of the life of the solar Logos. Thiscentre is of course one of [1250] the seven constellations. As it is the mostpotent constellation as far as our system is concerned owing to the fact thatthis system predominantly expresses love or attractive energy and our Logos isas yet polarised in His cosmic astral body, it is not permitted to hint at thename of the constellation. The reason is that if the name were known and ifenough people could do the work of occult meditation and visualisation,accompanying the work with a vivid imagination, it might be possible to attractinto our system such a downpour of attractive energy from the constellationinvolved as to unduly speed up the processes of evolution upon our planet, andthus upset the systemic economy most dangerously. People do not yet realise thepotency of meditation and especially of group meditation.The zodiacal sign concerned is Gemini, and the reason will be apparent to alltrained initiates.A word here is necessary in explanation of the expression used earlier inconnection with the passing of adepts from off this second Path on to theSeventh Path. It is stated that they “alchemise themselves” on to it. Some ideaas to the meaning of this phrase may be gained through a consideration of thepurposes of heat, when divorced from moisture, and of the method of employingsuch heat. The adepts use the “dry alchemical fires” to produce the results theydesire in aiding the evolutionary process. As they use these “dry fires” thereaction upon themselves is such that they transmute the electrical spark (orthe Monad within the flame of the planetary Life) and break it up in such amanner that it can pass through the systemic etheric web and on to that streamof cosmic energy emanating from the constellation mentioned above.They are then known as “Absolute sparks of parental love,” or (in the exotericlanguage of the initiates) they pass on to Path VII, that of “Absolute Sonship.”[1251] The attributes which the adept on this path has to possess prior totaking the needed training for the seventh cosmic method of approach isresponsiveness to heat and a knowledge of rhythm. These words will, of course,mean nothing to the uninitiated but to some it will convey much and when it isnoted that there will be found coupled with these two attributes an ability to“see the dancing of the particles of heat and the waves of warm vibration” (asit is called in an old manual which those in training for this path employ) itwill be apparent that the effects of fire and the laws of fiery energy andvibration are here dealt with. Those sons of men who at this time search for the“heat of the love nature” of the human unit and who add to that search acultivation of a vivid imagination and an intense power to visualise are layinga groundwork upon which this later knowledge may be superimposed. But this isnot the easy thing it sounds, for it involves an identification at presentimpossible to the majority, and a power to realise the nature of that which isvisualised which negates the idea of duality,—that which visualises and thatwhich is visualised.The method employed can only be expressed as the “entering of theburning-ground.” The power to do this is gained through passing through threepreliminary burning-grounds, as is easily to be seen:1. The burning-ground which lies between the Hall of Ignorance, and the Hall ofLearning. This is the destructive fire which man creates under the working ofthe Law of Karma.2. The burning-ground of the dead personality which lies between the Hall ofLearning and the Hall of Wisdom. It is found upon the shores of the river oflife and has to be passed prior to the third Initiation. [1252]3. The burning-ground which is found when a man is ready to pass out of the Hallof Wisdom as a full adept. It is a triple burning-ground and is found “upon themountain top, being kept alive and flaming by all the winds of heaven.” It isresponsible for the destruction of the egoic or causal body.The third produces a spiritual alchemicalisation, whereas the other two producedresults in the objective or form side and the subjective or consciousness aspectof his triple nature. When these three burning grounds are passed then the adeptis prepared for another and fiercer experience.The hierarchies connected with this Path are mainly the third and the fourth.Only the human units can pass on to these two paths. The deva hierarchies of thethird order have already passed upon them, and it is their previous work whichenables man to do so. This is a great mystery and more must not be revealedabout it. The group of the Silent Watchers of all degrees are closely connectedwith this second cosmic path. All of Them are Lords of Sacrifice, and areanimated solely by love, and all have therefore passed through the sacrificialburning grounds.It is only possible to give the most elementary of the exoteric symbols. Ittakes the form of a funeral pyre in full conflagration, and with four flamingtorches one at each corner. From the centre of the pyre a fivefold star mountslike a rocket towards a flaming sun of a predominantly rosy hue. [1253]PATH II. PATH OF MAGNETIC WORKAttributes Responsiveness to heat and knowledge of rhythm. Source An unknownconstellation via Gemini. Method The entering of the burning-ground. HierarchyThe third and fourth. Symbol A funeral pyre, four torches, and a fivefold starmounting towards the sun. Quality gained Electrical velocity.Path III. Path of training for Planetary Logoi.This path is one that attracts to itself only a few comparatively of the sons ofmen. It involves a peculiar form of development and the faculty of continuedawareness along with spiritual identification which is the distinguishingcharacteristic of the seven cosmic paths.The adept who chooses this path preserves in a peculiar way the faculty ofsense-perception plus identification with the spiritual aspect. They areconstantly spoken of in the occult archives as the “Lords Whose mayavirupacontinuously recurs.” As they work with the psyche or the soul of manifestationand are primarily concerned with the subjective side of life they are connectedwith that centre in the Body of the ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID which isthe source of conscious sensation. Therefore, they are vitalised from the solarplexus of that great Existence Whose all-embracing vitality holds our Logos,along with other solar Logoi, within the sphere of His consciousness. As is wellknown, the solar plexus is the centre which synthesises the reactions and theessential virtues of the lower three centres. This point must be borne in mindwhen studying this cosmic path.These adepts are also called the “Lords of cosmic Maya” for they work with thatfaculty which is responsible for illusion and with the relation of the Knower tothat which is to be known. Remember here that we are not considering the threeworlds of human endeavour except in so far as they form a part of a whole.The attributes which predispose a man for the work of training himself for thepath of a planetary Logos are three in number and may be expressed thus: [1254]1. Cosmic vision. These adepts are connected with the logoic third eye.2. Deva hearing.3. Psychic correlation.All the senses are, as we know, connected with some centre, and these centresare in turn connected with planetary centres which are themselves energised froman analogous cosmic source. The adept on this third Path has a specificconnection with the energy which emanates from those cosmic centres which arerelated to spiritual vision and spiritual hearing. The sense of touch hasprimarily to do with the objectivity of the dense physical form, and with itthis particular group of adepts has nothing to do. Sight, hearing and the powerto correlate the relation between the Self and the Not-Self is theirs, but theNot-self comes specifically under the guidance and the stimulation of a totallydifferent group of cosmic workers. It is difficult to convey a clear meaning inthis connection and the student must remember that we are dealing with spiritand with the other two types of cosmic energy.This path is trodden by those who will take up the work of the seven planetaryLogoi of the next solar system, and of the forty-nine sub-planetary Logoi, Theirassistants and of certain other entities working in that particular department.There will be seven systems, though we are only concerned with the major three,of which our present solar system is but the second.Each Chohan of a Ray takes a certain number of initiates of the sixth Initiationand trains them specially for this work. Special aptitude in colour and soundpredisposes the choice, and the ability to work with “psyche,” or with theSpirits in evolution, marks a man out for this high post. We might say that theplanetary Logoi are the divine psychologists, and therefore in the training for[1255] this post psychology is the basic subject, though it is a psychologyinconceivable as yet to us.Every planetary Logos has, in His own special planet, schools for thedevelopment of subordinate Logoi, and there trains them, giving them opportunityfor wide experience. Even the Logoi Themselves progress onward, and Their placesmust be taken.Students may be surprised to know that the source of the peculiar cosmic energywhich is found streaming towards our system along this cosmic Path is that ofthe sun Betelgeuse. This name is, however, a blind. The reason that certainfacts connected with this sun have lately come more prominently before thepublic is in reality a subjective one. The science of the soul in its variousaspects (mental, psychical, and spiritual) is making much headway now in theworld, and is absorbing more and more the attention of thinkers. This is theresult of certain waves of energy impinging upon our solar system and thuseventually finding their way to our planet. Betelgeuse from the occultstandpoint is a system of the second order, just as our solar system is one ofthe fourth order. There is consequently a relation between these two numbersboth in the system and the cosmos. This influence reaches our system via thesign Sagittarius.The work that adepts on this path have to accomplish primarily is to makepossible the manifestation of the Monad of the solar Logos through the medium ofthe body of consciousness, or through the soul-form. They thus repeat on ahigher level the work of those Builders who create and make manifest the bodythrough which the soul seeks to express itself. They are not concerned withobjectivity, and have a relation to that fifth Hierarchy which gives to man hisegoic body.The adepts on our Earth planet who seek this path do so through the departmentof the Mahachohan, which [1256] works with the intelligence or mental aspects ofmanifestation. From this third department they pass under the direct training ofone of the Buddhas of Activity, and in the final stages are personally taught bySanat Kumara, functioning as the embodied planetary Logos. This trainingconcerns itself with three main subjects:1. With colour, that which veils the Spirit aspect, as dense form veils thesoul.2. With sound, that which Spirit utters in order to make itself conscious, andto produce psychic awareness. The whole science of mantra yoga is mastered bythem, but only in connection with the higher planes and where the cosmic planesare concerned.3. With the nature of duality, that which is basically the science of the soul.It is difficult to express in words the method employed by a Master of theWisdom as he enters this cosmic Path. It has been called the method of prismaticidentification , for it concerns the colour veils which shroud the spiritualenergy. Another mode of expressing the same truth is to say that it is themethod of understanding the song of life. As the “stars sing together,” as the“chant of the Gods” peals forth in the great choir of the Heavens, it produces acorresponding colour symphony. This particular mode of identification enablesthe adept to act as a director in the chorus and to produce the needed coloureffects and chords. When he can do this to perfection he is then in a positionto take up office as a planetary Logos. More it is not permitted to say and theabove is but a symbolic way of expressing a basic and difficult truth.The symbol of this Path (and the only one it is possible to make exoteric) is aradiant Cross of coloured light; it [1257] has the long limb formed of the sevencolours of the solar spectrum, and the transverse limb is composed of twelvegradations of colours as yet unknown to man. In the centre of the Cross is to beseen a five-pointed star in a deep indigo shade, and behind it is a blazing sunof a warm dark blue. Above the whole are certain Sensa characters, depicted ingold, and conveying to the initiated adept the name of one or other of theplanetary Schools in which this particular line of study is undertaken. Thereare, as has been already said, seven such schools and candidates for this Pathfrom our planetary scheme are transferred to the inner round and from thence tothe Jupiter scheme.The quality gained is cosmic etheric vision, the extent of the vision developedbeing within the seven systems which form (along with our solar system) theseven centres in the cosmic Life with whom our solar Logos is allied. This issometimes called septenary cosmic clairvoyance.One more fact of interest might here be added. This Path is sometimes called the“Lotus Path,” as it concerns itself with the construction of the logoic Lotusesof solar Logoi. The schools which prepare for this work are called in the mysticparlance of the adepts the “lotus lands.” The curriculum is termed at times the“Lotus sleep,” as it involves a condition of complete negation where the formside of manifestation is concerned and an entire abstraction, thus producing atype of solar samadhi. Whilst this is being undergone the adept functions in aform or vehicle which is a correspondence upon the plane of atma to themayavirupa on the plane of mind.PATH III.

Method prismaticidentification. Symbol a coloured Cross, with a star at the centre, and backedby a blazing sun, surmounted by a Sensa Word. Quality cosmic etheric vision orseptenary clairvoyance.[1258] Path IV. The Path to Sirius.This path is of all the Paths the most veiled in the clouds of mystery. Thereason for this mystery will only be apparent to the pledged initiate, though aclue to the secret may be gained if it is realised that in a peculiar andesoteric sense the sun Sirius and the Pleiades hold a close relation to eachother. It is a relation analogous to that which lower mind holds to higher mind.The lower is receptive to, or negatively polarised to the higher. Sirius is theseat of higher mind and mahat (as it is called, or universal mind) sweeps intomanifestation in our solar system through the channel of the Pleiades. It isalmost as if a great triangle of mahatic energy was thus formed. Siriustransmits energy to our solar system via that“...sevenfold brooding Mother, the silver constellation, whose voice is as atinkling bell, and whose feet pass lightly o’er the radiant path between ourworlds and hers.”Within the solar system there is an interesting correspondence to this cosmicinterplay in the relation between the Venus scheme, our Earth scheme and theVenus chain in our scheme.Curiously enough it will be through a comprehension of the human antaskarana, orthe path which links higher and lower mind and which is constructed by theThinker during the process of evolution, that light on this abstruse matter willcome. There is (in connection with our planetary Logos) just such anantaskarana, and as He builds and constructs it, it forms part of the fourthPath, and permits the passage of the bulk of our humanity to this [1259] distantobjective, and this without obstruction. A clue to the nature of this Path andas to the reason why so many of the human Monads seek this particular stream ofenergy lies in the right understanding of the above suggestion.The initiates who tread this way are primarily those of the fourth and the sixthorder. As earlier pointed out, this is the Path that the “lords of compassion”most frequently follow, and at this time the Egyptian Master and the MasterJesus are preparing Themselves to tread it. The mystics of the Occident who havecome into incarnation during the past one thousand years are a peculiar group ofEgos whose impulse is towards this type of cosmic energy. In this system theyhave developed certain basic recognitions and the “ecstasy” of the occidentalmystic is the germ, latent within him, which will some day flower forth intothat cosmic rapture for which we have as yet no name.Cosmic rapture and rhythmic bliss are the attributes of the fourth path. It is aform of identification which is divorced from consciousness altogether. Thereason also why the majority of the sons of men follow this Path lies in thefact of its numerical position. These units of the fourth kingdom, the bulk ofthe fourth Creative Hierarchy on this fourth globe of the fourth scheme in asolar system of the fourth order are innately compelled to seek this fourth WAYin order to perfect themselves. They are called the “blissful dancing points offanatical devotion.” This is as near as we can get to the true description. Theyhave also been described as the “revolving wheels which turn upon themselves,and find the open door to perfect bliss.”The energy of Path IV reaches us from Sirius via the Sun . This must beunderstood as a blind behind which one of the signs of the zodiac veils itself.The hierarchies concerned with this specific type of [1260] cosmic force hidethemselves under the numbers fourteen and seventeen. This will serve as acomplete blind to the average reader, but will carry to the pledged chela thehint needed to produce illumination.The method whereby the adept fits himself to pass upon this path is termed thatof duplex rotary motion and “rhythmic dancing upon the square.”The symbol , which is first given to the pledged disciple to study but whichmay, however, be described, is a duality of interlocked wheels revolving at agreat pace in opposite directions, and producing a unified whole. These wheelsare portrayed as manifesting electric blue flame, rotating and revolving withgreat rapidity around an equal-armed Cross. The Cross is pictured in orange firewith a deep emerald green circle, flaming at the point in the centre where thefour arms of the Cross meet. The symbolism of these colours links this fourthpath to the solar system preceding this one. In that system the Sirian influencewas more potent than in the present one.It is not possible to add more to this beyond pointing out that the qualit ygained by the adept who treads this path may not be revealed. He comes under theconcentrated influence of the energy which is identified with the planetaryantaskarana. It is not permitted, therefore, to state what its specific qualitymay be, as it would convey too much information to the intelligent reader as tothe nature and the objective of our particular planetary Logos.PATH IV.

Method duplexrotary motion and rhythmic dancing upon the square. symbol two wheels ofelectric fire, revolving around an orange Cross, with an emerald at the centre.quality unrevealed[1261] Path V. The Ray Path.This Path is one of the great distributing paths of the system, and is troddenby the adept who has a clear understanding of the laws of vibration. It leads tothe next cosmic plane with great facility and is therefore called “the outerdoor of entry.” As we know, the seven Rays which manifest throughout our solarsystem, are but the seven subrays of one great ray, that of Love-Wisdom. Thisray Path is the one upon which the majority of the “Masters of the Wisdom” pass.In the same way many of the “Lords of Compassion” pass on to Path IV.Five-eighths of the former pass on to this path just as four-fifths of theadepts of suffering pass on to Path IV. In considering these numbers it must beborne in mind that the figures are of very great magnitude. One-fifth of theCompassionate Lords is a vast number, whilst three-eighths is a stupendousnumber of monads. We must remember in this connection also that we are onlydealing with the adepts of the fifth Initiation, and are not taking intoconsideration initiates of lower degrees nor disciples of many grades. It isuseless for average man to ponder upon these figures. They are too difficult tocompute and involve calculations most abstruse and intricate. This can bedemonstrated by pointing out that from these figures must be subtracted thattwo-fifths which (in the next round) pass before the Judgment Throne and arerejected. Out of the remaining three-fifths only a percentage which may not berevealed reach final adeptship, though all pass upon the Path. The five-eighthsabove referred to and the four-fifths have reference only to the two greatgroups of asekha initiates.[1262] Adepts who pass upon the Ray Path have to possess attributes which makethem exceedingly responsive to vibration. In their group work (regarding all theunits upon this Path as forming a unified Whole) the results achieved might becompared to that of a compass upon a ship. They respond primarily to a basicvibration, not through sensation but through that which is the outgrowth ofsensation. It is a form of realisation which is the cosmic correspondence to thereaction which comes when the skin is touched. It is not consciousness butknowledge through vibration . They are themselves identified with a certainvibration and they respond to that vibration alone which is the highercorrespondence upon the cosmic planes. Other vibrations they ignore.They are taught how to insulate themselves so that no vibration save the onewhich reaches them from the cosmic source of the synthetic ray can touch them.Students can get some idea of the lower correspondence to this as they study thecompass, its responsiveness to a certain magnetic current, and the tendencywhich it demonstrates to point ever towards the north. These adepts of the fifthPath are the constituent factor which occultly holds our solar system steadilyequilibrised in one specific direction. Their main characteristic or attributemay be described as a sense of cosmic direction.The source of energy to which they respond may be regarded as the Pole Star. Itshould nevertheless be pointed out that this star serves only as a blind for aconstellation which lies behind,—a constellation which exists only in ethericmatter. It is consequently ignored by astronomers, though its influence isexceedingly potent within our system. It should be borne in mind also that uponanother planet within our solar ring-pass-not this fifth Path is the one thatthe majority of their adepts follow. Adepts who are on this Path, therefore,will pass to this other planetary scheme prior to finding their way [1263] tothe Sun and from thence to cosmic spheres. Adepts from other schemes are nottransferred to our Earth scheme as a school of training as it is not a sacredplanet and therefore lacks such a specific school.The influence which emanates from the Pole Star and which is such a potentfactor in our solar system reaches our planet via the sign Aquarius. The reasonswill be noted if the student bears in mind the significance of water as a symbolof the emotions, which are but a lower manifestation of love-desire. Aquarius isa force centre from which the adept draws the “water of life” and carries it tothe multitude. This force from the Pole Star, via Aquarius, is of special powerat this time and the day of opportunity is therefore great. It is one of theagencies which make the coming of the Great Lord a possibility. He is Himselfupon the fifth Path just as the Manu is upon the third. Hence the close linkbetween the two paths, for those on the fifth path can pass to the third andvice versa. The first and the seventh, the second and the fourth, and the thirdand the fifth are but the two sides of one whole, or the two aspects of the onePath. These three paths (with the fourth Path) constitute two Paths and the twoPaths are but one. This great mystery may not further be enlarged upon.The Hierarchies which play a great part in the introduction of polar influenceare the first and the second . It was this occult truth which had such a bearingupon the nature of the first two races of mankind and upon their habitat.The method whereby the adept develops the needed powers for this Path have beenhinted at above. They might be expressed as a process of electrical insulationand the imprisonment of polar magnetism . It is not permitted to say more.The symbol of this path is five balls of fire (blue fire) confined within asphere. This sphere is formed by a [1264] serpent biting its tail, and theentire body of the serpent is closely covered with written Sensa characters;these characters embody the mantram whereby the adept insulates himself from themagnetic flow of all currents save that for which he is responsible.The quality which the adept develops as he treads this Path can only be given inthe words of the old Commentary:“The depression at the northern point permits entrance of that which stabilises,and acts as the factor of resistance to that which seeketh to deter or todistract.”Perhaps cosmic stability and magnetic equilibrium serve best to convey thenecessary idea.PATH V. THE RAY PATHAttributes A sense of cosmic direction. Source The Pole Star via Aquarius.Hierarchies The first and the second. Method. A process of electrical insulationand the imprisonment of polar magnetism. Symbol Five balls of fire enclosedwithin a sphere. Sphere is formed of a serpent inscribed with the mantram ofinsulation. Quality Cosmic stability and magnetic equilibrium.There is no way in which we can express any teaching or give any informationanent the sixth and seventh Paths. All that can be said is as follows:Path VI. The Path the Logos Himself is on.It will be apparent to all those students who have studied with care the worldprocesses in the light of the law of correspondences that the Logos on thecosmic planes is evolving inner cosmic vision, just as man in his lesser degreeis aiming at the same vision in the system. This might be called the developmentof the cosmic third [1265] EYE. In the physical plane structure of the eye lieshid the secret and in its study may come some revelation of the mystery.A certain portion of the eye is the nucleus of sight and the apparatus of visionitself. The remainder of the eye acts as a protecting shell; both parts arerequired, and neither can exist without the other. It is so in the cosmic sensealso, but the analogy exists on such high levels that words only dim and blurthe truth. Certain of the sons of men, a nucleus who reached a very highinitiation in a previous solar system, formed an esoteric group around the Logoswhen He decided upon further progress. In consequence He formed this solarsystem, desire for cosmic manifestation urging Him on. This esoteric groupremains with the Logos upon the atomic or the first plane of the system, on thesubjective or inner side, and it corresponds in an occult sense to the pupil ofthe eye. The real home of these great Entities is upon the cosmic buddhic plane.Gradually and by dint of hard effort, certain Masters have qualified themselves,or are qualifying themselves, to take the place of the original members of thisgroup thus permitting of Their return to a cosmic centre around which oursystem, and the greater system of Sirius, revolves.Only one adept here and there has the necessary qualities, for the developmentinvolves a certain type of response to cosmic vibration. It means a specialisingof the inner sight, and the development of a certain amount of cosmic vision.More of the deva evolution pass to this Path than do the human. Human beingspass to it via the deva evolution, which can be entered by transference to thefifth, or Ray Path. On this latter Path the two evolutions merge and from thefifth, the sixth Path can be entered. [1266]Path VII. The Path of Absolute Sonship .This sonship is a correspondence on the highest plane to that grade ofdiscipleship which we call “Son of the Master.” It is the Sonship to a Beinghigher than our Logos of Whom we may not speak. It is also the great controllingPath of Karma. The Lipika Lords are upon this Path, and all who are fitted forthat line of work, and who are close to the Logos in a personal and intimatesense pass to this seventh Path. It is the Path of the special intimates of theLogos and into their hands He has put the working out of karma in the solarsystem. They know His wishes, His will and His aim, and to Them He entrusts thecarrying out of His behests. This group, associated with the Logos, forms aspecial group linked to a still higher Logos.These two paths enter into cosmic states of consciousness as inconceivable toman as the consciousness of the Ego of a human being is to an atom of substance.It is unnecessary and profitless therefore to enlarge further upon these exaltedstates.[1267]"},{"pageContent":"DIVISION C. SEVEN ESOTERIC STANZAS.( 336 [text00028.html#Y_FN336] )STANZA I(From Archaic Formulas. No. 49)PATH 1. The Path of Earth Service.The Dragon who hideth within the lowest of the Sacred Three ariseth in Hismight. In His mouth He holdeth the balances, and in the balances He weigheth thesons of men who upon the field of battle are impaled upon His spear.In the great balance upon which His eyes are fixed, one scale is veiled in fireof vivid green; the other hides itself behind a screen of red.Those sons of Men whose note responds not to the note of red enter the scaleupon the right hand side. From thence they pass upon a path which dimly can beseen behind the dragon’s form.This path is entered by a fourfold door. The sacred phrases of the Sons of Lightdefine it thus: “The portal of the luminous light, which leadeth from the greeninto the heart of indigo, by that rare fire and [1268] richly coloured blaze forwhich no name on earth hath yet been found.” Its tone is hidden.The sons of men (and few their number is) enter that door of luminous fire whenthey surmount the crest of gold which riseth on the dragon’s head above thepoint where gleams “the eye of fire.”This eye of fire transmits a strong vibration from the triple Lhas unto a centrein the Adept’s head. This when aroused, reveals the Life that is, the form thatshall be, and the work united of the two and four.These two are drawn together. Their essence blends. The man who seeks this pathis then impaled upon the spear and thrust within the fiery light which veils thebalance. The mystic process then proceeds and...Thus is the work of SATURN seen,and thus the consummation is effected.Through SATURN’S fateful force the victor then is swiftly projected to thesummit of the crest, and thence to that vibrating disk which guards the fourfolddoor of luminosity.Three Words are then committed to the Liberated One. He stands triumphant on thespeeding disk and when their utterance has...the door is seen ajar, and from itsother side a voice is heard to say: “Son of Compassion, Master of Love and Life,the wheel turns all the time for those who battle on the fiery ground beneaththe dragon’s feet.”The first Word having entered on its mission, the victor lifts His head andseeks to utter forth the second Word. But, as He sounds it forth, He arrests itswide vibration, drawing again its power within His heart.[1269] The motion of the disk slows down. The portal of the fiery light opensmore widely yet. A form is seen. Unto the Master of the Fiery Heart, this formpresents three precious jewels. Their names are hidden from those sons of menwho have not yet attained the dragon’s crest.These jewels three give to the Master of the Fiery Heart a portion of the tripleforce which circulates within the planet’s sphere.With eye intent and heart alive with burning love the Master utters not thefinal Word. He steps from off the disk and turns His Lotus Feet back to thatPath He earlier left behind, and from the other side remounts the Dragon’screst. Himself a dragon, He now identifies Himself with those who seek thebeast. And thus He serves, turning His back upon the door of light. He is theoffspring of the dragon and serves His time....Unknown and unseen by Him, a greater disk becomes apparent, turning unceasingly.He seeth not its movement for His eyes are on the world He has returned toserve. The disk revolves and brings around—before His yet unseeing eye—a greaterwider Door....His eye of vision opens....He treads the first great path, yetknows it not.The note that sounds forth from that first great WAY is yet unheard by Him. Itssound is lost in the uprising cry of the children of the lesser dragon. [1270]STANZA XVII(From Archaic Formulas. No. 49)PATH II. The Path of Magnetic Work.The cosmic Burning-ground of living fire lieth in the nethermost part of thewestern heavens. Its smoke riseth unto that high place where dwell the SacredLhas to Whom the triple Unity within our solar space tender Their offerings andTheir fealty. Its scent of spices sweet and faint aroma of incandescent...reachto the utmost confines of the starry vault.The Two arise and pass the essential Flame through Their burning-ground,blending Their lesser smoke with the greater.This smoke formeth a Path which reacheth forth unto those spheres within theradiant form of that Attractive Life, to Whom the sons of being and of men inall their many grades offer their prayers, their life and adoration.The Master on this sphere, which is known as the fourth and is not holy, seeththe fiery WAY; He respondeth to its heat and seeks to warm Himself within itswaves of radiant fire electric.A centre at the midway point within the great Kumaric Body formeth the pyre. Itpulsates and it glows. It becomes a sea of living fire and draws within itselfits own. The smoke which issues from this fiery wheel formeth a living WAY,veiling the steps ahead.[1271] The Master—with the midway wheel on fire—enters within the smoke, andenters blind. He sees no step ahead. He hears no voice. He feels no guidinghand. Only the fifth and latest known aids Him to forward grope, and passstraight onward through the veiling clouds; only the awakening of His wheel mayindicate His progress through the new magnetic field.Only the sons of...(GEMINI) know the way in; only the sons with blazing fire,issuing from the midway point, may enter in. They throw their beams ahead toilluminate the WAY. The Adept of the funeral pyre, the Master of the blazingsphere consumes Himself. Offering Himself the One that is, the new-madethreefold Word, the sacred OM, the fire of God, He treads the burning-ground,and blazes forth to those who watch as a radiant flaming sun.He...and draws the people onward to their goal, warming their hearts, producingdual fire, and leading all towards the portal of the sun and thenceto...(GEMINI).The mystic Word is veiled by letters four—E, M, and A and O—.

Training for Planetary Logoi.The eye of Shiva opens wide and those within its range of vision awaken toanother form of sleep. They sleep, but yet they see and hear; their eyes areclosed, yet naught that passes in the greater cosmic Seven is missed by them.They see, and yet they vision not; they hear and yet their ears are deaf.Three times the eye of Shiva closes and three times it opens wide. Thus threegreat groups of Lotus Lords are impelled upon Their way.One group is called the “Lotus Lords of deep unseeing sleep.” They dream, and asTheir dreams take form, the worlds speed on. The great and cruel maya of theplanes of sweet illusion comes into being, draws into its snare the points ofunconnected light, and dims their lustre.Thus is the work pursued....The eye through which these Lotus Lords contact the planes of cosmic vision isinward turned. They see not that which is upon the outer rim.The second group has for its name “the Lords of the Inner Lotus.” These are Theywho sleep, yet not so deep. They wake enough to guard Themselves from strayingo’er the secret ring-pass-not which rims the great Illusion. They straitlystand, and, through Their very steadfastness, the forms are held together.The eye through which these Lotus Lords look out [1273] upon the great Illusionis upward turned. They see but that which lieth just above Them; they onwardlook to that vast mountain top which pierceth through the circumscribing wheel.This mountain top shineth with radiant light, reflected from the face of HimWhom the Lords of worlds within our solar sphere have never seen.* * * * * * * * * *The third group is the strange mysterious triple group whose name must not beheard as yet within those planetary spheres whose colour blends not with theblue in just proportion.The eye through which these Lotus Lords gaze out upon the cosmic Path is outwardturned. Its hue is indigo. The eye through which the middle group of Lotus Lordslook up is turquoise blue, whilst the Lords of deep unmoving slumber gaze inthrough sapphire blue. Thus is the WAY of triple blue formed into one.This latter aspect of the eye of Shiva directs the other two, and gathers allits energy from a far distant cosmic sphere. The two respond, and in thetreading of the cosmic WAY weave triple force into that path which meets theneed of those who later seek to tread it.They see; They hear; They dream, and dreaming build; Their eyes are blind; Theirears are deaf, and yet They are not dumb. They sound the several cosmic Words,and weave the seven with the twelve and multiply the five.* * * * * * * * * *Thus are the planets built; thus guided, ruled and known.

The energiesconverge, and shake them out of equilibrium. They descend sometimes upon theright hand side and sometimes upon the left.* * * * * * * * * *The Energies are five in number and their major hue is gold.Three great Words are spoken by the Adjuster, and each Word is heard by thosewhose ears have been deaf for seven cycles and whose lips have been sealed fornigh upon fourteen rounded terms.The first Word contains the value numerical of the synthetic indigo. Itreverberates forth. The scales descend. He who hath ears to hear it, mounteththe scales and addeth to that Word another sound. None have heard it save he whohath stood before the Prince of Doom, and hath seen darkness descend upon thefivefold sons of flesh.This dual Word buildeth a wall which surroundeth the Son of Man whose lips aredumb. It holdeth Him secure until the Word is spoken which will unseal the fountof speech.This silence lasteth for seven times forty-nine years and each year for a day.When the Silent One within the wall seeth the Ray [1277] approach, when Hechangeth the key of the earlier spoken Word, the disruption of the wall is seenand a door openeth before Him.* * * * * * * * * *The second Word holds hid the number of the sacred blue.

[1278]STANZA VI(From Archive 49)PATH VI. The Path of the Solar Logos.The major Third carrieth within it the vibration of that which hath alreadybeen. The cosmic Lord from out the greater seven (Whose sacred Name is hid)seeketh the centre of His life from out the sacred seven. This is the mysteryhid, the inner secret found in the heart of cosmic space within the groupsdivine.The sacred seven with the greater seven approach their primary, the One Whostandeth above, and in their cyclic outer sweep will some day touch. The twobecome the One and are lost in their primary.Seek ye the same on lesser scale within the inner round and on the plane ofdensity see the lesser primary manifest. The law holds good; the mysterydissolves in TIME.The major Third in both the lesser and the greater, the cosmic Lord—with His dimreflection solar—completes His cycle, meets His brother, becomes the Son,contacts the Mother, and is Himself the Father. All is One, and naught dividessave in transition and through the agency of time.* * * * * * * * * *The major fifth within the Eternal Now carrieth with it the vibration of thatwhich is. It marks the point of cosmic knowledge that extendeth far ahead [1279]into the lengthening present. The cosmic Lord, Whose sacred Name holdeth for usthe wisdom of the spheres, seeketh a form wherein to veil the Essence, andthrough the progress of the aeons to perfect the great triplicity.Hid is the mystery, and veiled by that which is. Deep is the essence, andsheathed by that which moves. Profound the darkness, lost in the heart of being;dense are the forms, which hide the inner light; gross is the sheath that actethas a barrier, and crude the material veiling the latent life.The major fifth includes the minor third; the double major marks the pointattained. When the major third is synchronised to the greater fifth and thecosmic note—apportioned to the Lord of Cosmic Love Whose essence is the fire—thesacred Name is heard.The cosmic Second approaches to the denser and the greater. He merges and Heblends, and all is lost in dissonance adjusted. The spheres respond; the Nowbecomes the past and blends within the time to be. The essence and the life, thepoint within the circle, and the eternal ring-pass-not becomes as one, and allis peace for aeons. Time ends; space disperses; naught is. Darkness reigns andsilence on the waters. The central calm persists.* * * * * * * * * *The completed chord, the third, the fifth and seventh within the Eternal Now,carrieth with it the vibration of that which is to be. Cometh the Day Be With Uson the greater cosmic plane. Then life and love and power shew forth as one.The cosmic Lord, Whose sacred Name as yet is hid [1280] e’en from the highestChohan, holdeth within Himself the source of cosmic action, and the gain ofcosmic love. The triple All enters—from out of time and space—into the centre ofpralayic peace.All is, yet all is not. The wheels turn not. The fires burn not. The veils ofcolour dissipate. The Three retire within the point of peace. The triplering-pass-not acteth no longer as a barrier. [1281]STANZA IV(From Archive 63)PATH VII.

Hence,everything which is thought, is. That consciousness in which everything is,everything literally, “possible” as well as “actual”—actual being that which isthought of as existent by a separated consciousness in time and space, andpossible all that which is not so being thought of at any period in time and anypoint in space—we call Absolute Consciousness. It is the All, the Eternal, theInfinite, the Changeless. Consciousness, thinking time and space, and of allforms as existing in them in succession and in places, is the UniversalConsciousness, the One, called by the Hindu the Saguna Brahman—the Eternal withattributes—the Pratyag-Atma—the Inner Self; by the Parsi, Hormuzd; by theMussulman, Allah. Consciousness dealing with a definite time, however long orshort, with a definite space, however vast or restricted, is individual, that ofa concrete Being, a Lord of many universes, or a universe or of any so-calledportion of a universe, his portion and to him therefore a universe—these termsvarying as to extent with the power of the consciousness; so much of theuniversal thought as a separate consciousness can completely think, i.e., onwhich he can impose his own reality, can think of as existing like himself, ishis universe.” (back) [text00009.html#Y_back15](16) Universal consciousness, manifesting as consciousness in time and space, asMrs. Besant so ably expresses it, includes all forms of activity and spiralcyclic evolution from the standpoint of cosmic evolution, and in terms ofabsolute consciousness, may again be rotary.

The unmanifested is manifestedby or borne by the subsequent ramifications. These streams are the seven vowelsor seven notes. These seven vowels and notes must have special correlations withthe seven vedic metres, since in the Vishnu Purana, Parasara describes the vedicmetres as the coursers of the solar essence.”—Some Thoughts on the Gita , p. 74.(back) [text00010.html#Y_back17](18) T. Subba Rao says on page 20, of Esoteric Writings : “As a general rule,whenever seven entities are mentioned in the ancient occult science of India inany connection whatsoever, you must suppose that those seven entities came intoexistence from three primary entities and that these three entities again areevolved out of a single entity or monad. To take a familiar example, the sevencoloured rays in the solar ray are evolved out of three primary coloured rays;and the three primary colours co-exist with the four secondary colours in thesolar ray. Similarly the three primary entities which brought man into existenceco-exist in him with the four secondary entities which arose from differentcombinations of the three primary entities.”In Christian terminology these are the three Persons of the Trinity, and theseven Spirits which are before the Throne. Compare “Our God is a consumingfire.” Heb: 12.29. (back) [text00010.html#Y_back18](19) “I have already said in speaking of this Logos, that it was quite possiblethat it was the Logos that appeared in the shape of the first Dhyan Chohan, orplanetary Spirit, when the evolution of man was recommenced after the lastperiod of inactivity on this planet, as stated in Mr. Sinnett’s book, EsotericBuddhism , and after having set the evolutionary current in motion, retired tothe spiritual plane congenial to its own nature, and has been watching sinceover the interests of humanity, and now and then appearing in connection with ahuman individuality for the good of mankind. Or you may look upon the Logosrepresented by Krishna as one belonging to the same class as the Logos which soappeared. In speaking of himself Krishna says, (chap. x, verse 6):“The seven great Rishis, the four preceding Manus, partaking of my nature wereborn from my mind: from them sprang, was (born) the human race and the world.”He speaks of the sapta Rishis and of the Manus as his manasaputras, or mind-bornsons, which they would be if he was the so-called Prajapati, who appeared onthis planet and commenced the work of evolution.”—The Theosophist , Vol. VIII,p. 443.

The destiny of each atom is to create abrahmanda. Brahmandas like or smaller or larger than ours, held together by asun, are present in every atom. Vishvas, great world-systems, exist in an atom,and atoms again exist in these vishvas. This is the significance of ‘many fromone’; wherever we see the one we should recognise the many also, and conversely.After securing the ability of, and then actually, creating a brahmanda, the nextstep is the creation of a jagat, then a vishva, then a maha-vishva and so on,till the status of maha-vishnu is reached.”—Bhagavan Das in the Pranava Vada ,p. 94. (back) [text00010.html#Y_back21](22) Atma means as you all know the self or the ego or an individualised centreof consciousness around which all worldly experiences in their dual aspect ofsubjective and objective cluster and arrange themselves. It is as it were one ofthe foci from which emerge rays of light to illumine the cosmic waters and inwhich also converge the rays sent back by those waters. In Theosophicalwritings, it is called the selfconscious individuality or the Higher Manas. Fromthis point of view, you will see that the Higher Manas is the most importantprinciple or the central pivot of the human constitution or the true soul. It isthe thread which ought to be caught hold of by one who wants to know the truthand lift himself out of this conditioned existence. To this it may be objectedthat Atma represents the seventh principle of the theosophical septenary andthat the Manas is far lower in the scale. But the plain answer is that theseventh principle is the ultimate state attainable by the self after crossingthe ocean of conditioned existence or samsara.”—Some Thoughts on the Gita , p.26.

This is literally Atma-buddhi-manas, the expression of the Monad, justas the personality is the expression of the Ego.

It is the seat of that better and wiserconsciousness behind the outward looking consciousness in the forward part ofthe head; that better and wiser consciousness of “the back of the mind,” whichviews spiritual things, and seeks to impress the spiritual view on the outwardlooking consciousness in the forward part of the head.

This is suggested in the words ofthe Upanishad already quoted. “There, where the dividing of the hair turns,extending upward to the crown of the head’; all of which may sound veryfantastical, until one comes to understand it.”“It is said that when this power is fully awakened, it brings a vision of thegreat Companions of the spiritual man, those who have already attained, crossingover to the further shore of the sea of death and rebirth.

(Vishnu Purana I, XIX, 5). This seed is technically called the KaranaSarira, the causal body (Paingala Upanishad II), as it is the cause of man’senjoyment or suffering. This Karana Sarira is composed of the fifth Kosa(Anandamaya) of man and adheres to the soul so long as the soul remainsenveloped in the gross or subtle body (Sthula or Sukshma Sarira); and vanishesentirely when the soul extricates itself from the trammels of the said twobodies; for then, the soul attains its primeval purity, and burns up as it wereevery trace of its combination with the body, including this causal body (KaranaSarira). This happens when the soul is prepared for final emancipation, Moksha.Till then, of course, the Karana Sarira, the seed, the result of prior actions,remains effective, and asserts a strong controlling influence over man’sactions.”—The Theosophist , Vol. VII, III, p. 59.“An ordinary person will by Vasana (Aroma or smell) repeat (In Jagra, the wakingstate) the old story dreamt in a dream that has passed way. So also will he,who, investigating the true nature of the self has attained to real knowledge,express himself and still will never become Chidabhasa (chidabhasa is thereflection of atma in the Karana Sarira, which is the vehicle of ignorance).

These Pitris are often ‘heard of in asort of antithetical way to the Devas in our puranas and this has led some ofour Hindoos, many theosophists included, to think that the Pitris and Devas arein two distinct spheres of life. Now Pitris and Devas always exist together, theDevas giving the consciousness and the Pitris forming the body. The two arerelative terms. If the Pitris be water the Devas are the fire in the water. Ifthe Pitris be fire, the Devas are the flame in that fire. If the Pitris be theflame, the Devas are the conscious principle that actuates the flame’ and givesto the flame the power of illumining the world and making it exist as a factorof our consciousness. From the highest to the lowest plane of life, the Pitrisfurnish the objective aspect and the Devas the subjective aspect and life itselfis a stream that forms the middle line....When instead of three lokas the cosmosis divided more accurately into seven lokas, you may assort the three higherlokas to the Devas, the three lower to the Pitris and the middle to the lifestream which may be conceived as the point in which the Deva essence is changedinto Pitric essence or the no loka is made fit to appear as a loka down below orthe unmanifested becomes the manifested.”—Some Thoughts on the Gita , p. 56.(back) [text00018.html#Y_back143]( 144) Diversity from Unity.“Now, according to the Adepts of ancient Aryavarta, seven principles are evolvedout of these three primary entities. Algebra teaches us that the number ofcombinations of things, taken one at a time, two at a time, three at a time, andso forth = 2n - 1. Applying this formula to the present case, the number ofentities evolved from different combinations of these three primary causesamount to 23 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. As a general rule whenever seven entities arementioned in the ancient occult sciences of India in any connection whatsoever,you must suppose that these seven entities come into existence from threeprimary entities; and that these three entities, again, are evolved out of asingle entity or Monad.”—The Theosophist , Vol. VIII, p 449.

He is, as said, the “Nameless One” who has so manynames, and yet whose names and whose very nature are unknown. He is the‘Initiator,’ called the ‘Great Sacrifice.’ For, sitting at the Threshold ofLight, he looks into it from within the Circle of Darkness, which he will notcross; nor will he quit his post till the last Day of this Life-Cycle. Why doesthe Solitary Watcher remain at his self-chosen post? Why does he sit by theFountain of Primeval Wisdom, of which he drinks no longer, for he has naught tolearn which he does not know—aye, neither on this Earth, nor in its Heaven?Because the lonely, sore-footed Pilgrims, on their journey back to their Home,are never sure, to the last moment, of not losing their way, in this limitlessdesert of Illusion and Matter called Earth-Life. Because he would fain show theway to that region of freedom and light, from which he is a voluntary exilehimself, to every prisoner who has succeeded in liberating himself from thebonds of flesh and illusion. Because, in short, he has sacrificed himself forthe sake of Mankind, though but a few elect may profit by the GreatSacrifice.”—S. D., I, 229.

In every Brahmanda the activity is fourfold, and the chief functionariesare Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Subdivisions of their functions give rise to thenames and offices of Narayana, etc.“Among these functions, that of making or creating goes with action and belongsto Brahma. Again, “that which has been made is maintained by knowledge;” thismaintenance or preservation is the work of Vishnu. Further, because it isnecessary that what has appeared should disappear, therefore is there adestroyer, and he is Shiva, connected with desire, which first affirms and nextdenies, acts and reacts, now attracts and then repels, begins with craving for,and, after satiety, revolts from its object and casts it off. It precedesaction, or Brahma, as longing for manifestation; and it succeeds knowledge orVishnu, after maintenance or enjoyment of that manifestation, as a sense offatigue, a growth of inertness, a need for rest by winding up themanifestation.”—From Pranava-Vada , pp. 82-84, 311. ( back[text00018.html#Y_back149] )( 151) They have in India an ancient system of psychical teaching called Yoga,in which the recitation of certain mantrams, or verses of Sanskrit, isprescribed. Especially important is said to be the way in which the mysticalsyllable Om, or Aum, is pronounced. Learned Brahmans tell me that theillimitable psychic potentiality of the Sanskrit charms, or mantrams is onlydrawn out by the adoption of a certain very accurate rule of pronunciation(swara). They say that by formulating the words correctly a vibration is set upin the akaz, or that part of the ether of space which enwraps our globe, whichmakes man the master over all the spirit denizens of the various kingdoms ofnature. It first re-acts upon the astral double or ethereal body of the manhimself, purifying its grossness, stimulating its psychic powers out of thenormal state of latency, and gradually fortifying them up to the point ofmastery over nature’s finer forces.—The Theosophist , Vol. XIII, pp. 229, 613.“The primal single sound (Aum or Om) is the highest uttered word of power andknowledge. It is verily as Brahman itself. The regulation of the breath is thechiefest tapas-discipline. Higher than the Savitri is no mantra. Higher thansilence is truth.The Creator stored the veritable essences of the Three Vedas in the threeletters that make up the Sacred Word, in the three utterances that name and formthe three worlds, and in the three parts of the veda-verse that invokes the sun.Each part He milked from one Veda. Who so ponders on these, morning and evening,after having learnt the Vedas previously, he verily studies the whole of theVedas every day. These are the gateway unto Brahman.By repeated dwelling on their significance, and tuning his desire and modellinghis thought to that significance, the seeker after Brahman shall, without fail,attain all perfection, whether he discharge any other duty or not; for the veryname of the Brahmana is ‘the friend of All creatures’ (and the Gayatri is theprayer for the blessing of all creatures by our radiant Father in Heaven, theSun).”—Unknown.There are specific formulae known to all initiates of a certain grade (and evento many who have not attained that grade, a number have become known and areused—sometimes in ways that result in no good to the insufficiently instructeduser), some one or other of which is specially adapted to produce nearly everypossible effect that can be imagined....Well may Isis Unveiled (p. 514) tell us that ‘sounds and colors’ are allspiritual numerals; nor is that all, for odors, metals and planets are equallyspiritual numerals. Each planet (or spiritual plane) has relation to a metal anda color. These again are in co-relation with a corresponding odor and sound.The sphere of aura that surrounds every human being has one very important‘fold’ or ‘layer,’ which invariably bears the color of the metal and planet towhich that particular individual has most affinity, and it is on this layer thatthe magnetic part of odors and all sound vibrations impinges.—The Theosophist ,Vol. VII, p. 218.

These two are, in reality, the A, B, C, of the Wisdom-religion.Karma is the sum total of our acts, both in the present life and in thepreceding births. It is of three kinds:—1. Sanchita karma2. Prarabdha karma3. Agami karma“Sanchita karma includes human merits and demerits accumulated in the precedingand in all other previous births. That portion of the Sanchita karma destined toinfluence human life in one or the present incarnation is called Prarabdha . Thethird kind of karma is the result of the merits and demerits of the presentacts. Agami extends over all your words, thoughts, and acts. What you think,what you speak, what you do, as well as whatever results your thoughts, words,and acts produce on yourself, and on those affected by them, fall under thecategory of the present karma, which will be sure to sway the balance of yourlife for good or for evil in your future development.”—The Theosophist , Vol. X,p. 235.

The exercise of these implements.5. The influence of antecedent conduct.The work which a man does with his body, speech or mind, whether it be just orunjust, has these five essentials or factors engaged in the performance. (Gita,XVIII, 13, 14, 15.)These five essentials of karma are divided into 2 groups in the Mahabharata:—1,man’s present action (including the first four essentials) and, 2, the result ofhis past action (which forms the fifth essential).“At the same time it must be remarked that the result of human existence is notthe work of a day or even a cycle. It is the aggregate sum of actions committedduring innumerable previous existences. Each action may in itself be as slightas can be conceived, like the minutest filaments of cotton,—such that hundredsof them may be blown away by a single breath; and yet, as similar filaments whenclosely packed and twisted together form a rope, so heavy and strong that it canbe used to pull elephants and even huge ships with, so the articles of man’skarma, however trivial each of them may be in itself, would yet by the naturalprocess of accretion, combine themselves closely and form a formidable Pasa(rope) to pull the man with, i.e. to influence his conduct for good orevil.”—The Theosophist , Vol. VII, p. 60.

The first of these in order is the straight line which descendsfrom the third Aspect; the second is that part of the large oval which lies onour left hand—the stream which descends from the second Aspect until it hastouched the lowest point in matter, and then rises again up the side on ourright hand until it reaches the lower mental level. It will be noted that inboth of these outpourings the divine life becomes darker and more veiled as itdescends into matter, until at the lowest point we might almost fail torecognise it as divine life at all; but as it rises again when it has passed itsnadir it shows itself somewhat more clearly. The third outpouring which descendsfrom the highest aspect of the Logos differs from the others in that it is in noway clouded by the matter through which it passes, but retains its virgin purityand splendour untarnished. It will be noted that this outpouring descends onlyto the level of the buddhic plane (the fourth plane) and that the link betweenthe two is formed by a triangle in a circle, representing the individual soul ofman—the reincarnating ego. Here the triangle is contributed by the thirdoutpouring and the circle by the second....”—The Christian Creed , by C. W.Leadbeater, pp. 39, 40.

For two reasons: One is that all that is inthe solar system is but substance energised from the cosmic mental and astralplanes, and built into form through the power of electrical law; all that can beknown is but forms ensouled by ideas. Secondly, that in the knowledge of thecreative processes of the system, man learns for himself how in time to become acreator.

All isLife, and every atom of even mineral dust is a Life, though beyond ourcomprehension and perception....Life therefore is everywhere in theUniverse...wherever there is an atom of matter, a particle or a molecule, evenin its most gaseous condition, there is life in it however latent andunconscious.”—S.

Suchi means the Saura, or Solarfire; Pavamana means Nirmathana, fire produced by friction, as the friction oftwo pieces of wood; and Pavaka means the vaidyuta or fire of the firmament, i.e.the fire of the lightning, or electric fire.The sources of these three fires I may observe in passing, constitute the threeprincipal deities spoken of in the Veda, namely, Surya, the sun, representingthe solar fire; Indra (and sometimes, Vayu) the rain-producing deity,representing the fire of the firmament; and Agni, representing the terrestrialfire, the fire produced by friction (Nirukta, VII, 4); and all these three, beit remembered, are merely the ramifications of one Agni; which in its turn is anemanation from the Supreme One, as the reader will find from the allegoricaldescription given of Agni as being the mouth-born son of Brahma, in the Vishnupurana.Now, each of the triple forms of Agni has numerous subdivisions.

Ifyou add to the nine one more for the orifice known as the Brahma-rundra or thedoor of Brahma, you get ten gates corresponding to the ten directions.

The yajamana is the person who hassacrificed himself for the good of the world and who has undertaken to mould theaffairs of it, in obedience to the law. If the human body be taken as thesacrificial ground, the manas in him is the yajamana. All the doings of man inall his life from birth to death, form one grand yagnic process that isconducted by the true human entity called the Manas. He, who is willing tosacrifice his body, speech, and thought to the good of all the world, is a realyagnika and all the higher lokas are reserved for him. The central keynote ofyagnika’s life is to do good unto all, irrespective of caste and creed even asthe sun shines for all.—Some Thoughts on the Gita , page 90.

Every Ego—the combination of the sixth and seventhprinciples—which, after the period of unconscious gestation is reborn into theDeva-Chan, is of necessity as innocent and pure as a new-born babe. The fact ofhis being reborn at all shows the preponderance of good over evil in his oldpersonality. And while the Karma (of evil) steps aside for the time being tofollow him in his future earth-reincarnation, he brings along with him but theKarma of his good deeds, words, and thoughts into this Deva-Chan. ‘Bad’ is arelative term for us—as you were told more than once before,—and the Law ofRetribution is the only law that never errs. Hence all those who have notslipped down into the mire of unredeemable sin and bestiality—go to theDeva-Chan. They will have to pay for their sins, voluntary and involuntary,later on. Meanwhile they are rewarded; receive the effects of the causesproduced by them.“Of course it is a state , one, so to say, of intense selfishness during whichan Ego reaps the reward of his unselfishness on earth. He is completelyengrossed in the bliss of all his personal earthly affections, preferences,thoughts, and gathers in the fruit of his meritorious actions. No pain, no griefnor even the shadow of a sorrow comes to darken the bright horizon of hisunalloyed happiness; for, it is a state of perpetual ‘Maya.’ ...Since theconscious perception of one’s personality on earth is but an evanescent dreamthat sense will be equally that of a dream in the Deva-Chan—only a hundredfoldintensified.”. . . . . . .“‘Bardo’ is the period between death and rebirth—and may last from a few yearsto a kalpa. It is divided into three sub-periods (1) when the Ego delivered ofits mortal coil enters into Kama-Loka (the abode of Elementaries); (2) when itenters into ‘Gestation State’; (3) when it is reborn in the Rupa-Loka ofDeva-Chan. Sub-period (1) may last from a few minutes to a number of years—thephrase ‘a few years’ becoming puzzling and utterly worthless without a morecomplete explanation; Sub-period 2nd is ‘very long’; as you say, longersometimes than you may even imagine, yet proportionate to the Ego’s spiritualstamina; Sub-period 3rd lasts in proportion to the good Karma , after which themonad is again reincarnated.”. . . . . . ....”Every effect must be proportionate to the cause. And, as man’s terms ofincarnate existence bear but a small proportion to his periods of inter-natalexistence in the manvantaric cycle, so the good thoughts, words, and deeds ofany one of these ‘lives’ on a globe are causative of effects, the working out ofwhich requires far more time than the evolution of the causes occupied.”—FromMahatma Letters to A.

This was hisdoctrine. So, likewise, is it taught in the Aryan Mahabharata (Sec. CXCIX. VanaParva) which says: “Those high souled persons that do not commit sins in word,deed, heart and soul, are said to undergo ascetic austerities, and not that theysuffer their bodies to be wasted by fasts and penances. He that hath no feelingof kindness for relatives cannot be free from sin, even if his body be pure.That hard-heartedness of his is the enemy of his asceticism. Asceticism, again,is not mere abstinence from the pleasures of the world.

This is a great subject and weshould have withheld it from you longer, but that it seems to us now that youare in need of it. Understand then that Evil is the result of Creation. ForCreation is the result of the projection of Spirit into matter; and with thisprojection came the first germ of evil. We would have you know that there is nosuch thing as a purely spiritual evil, but evil is the result of thematerialisation of Spirit. If you examine carefully all we have said to youconcerning the various forms of evil, you will see that every one is the resultof the limitation of the power to perceive that the whole Universe is but theLarger Self....It is, then, true that God created evil; but yet it is true thatGod is Spirit, and being Spirit is incapable of evil. Evil is then purely andsolely the result of the materialisation of God. This is a great mystery. We canbut indicate it tonight....God is perception itself. God is universalpercipience. God is that which sees and that which is seen. If we could see all,hear all, touch all, and so forth, there would be no evil, for evil comes of thelimitation of perception. Such limitation was necessary if God was to produceaught other than God. Aught other than God must be less than God. Without evil,therefore, God would have remained alone. All things are God according to themeasure of the Spirit in them.”That is to say, a perfected humanity will be a perfect vehicle of the divineSpirit (see the Mercaba of Ezekiel, 1st Chapter). Great is our indebtedness tothe Seers who throw out for us flashes of light on the darkness and mystery ofhuman life, where the struggling Spirit within is so often buried in the depthsof this mysterious Chaos, thereby making visible the darkness, so that we areenabled to see a few steps of the Way ahead, thus encouraging us to pressforward with renewed assurance that the mists and clouds will be dispelled, andwe shall in due time enter the fulness of the divine Presence.—The Theosophist ,Vol. XXIX, p. 50.

The most sacred of all the Eastern mantrams given out as yet tothe public is the one embodied in the words: “Om mani padme hum.” Every syllableof this phrase has a secret potency, and its totality has seven meanings and canbring about seven different results.There are various mantric forms, based upon this formula and upon the SacredWord, which, sounded rhythmically and in different keys, accomplish certaindesired ends, such as the invoking of protective angels or devas, and definitework, either constructive or destructive upon the planes.The potency of a mantram depends upon the point in evolution of the man whoemploys it. Uttered by an ordinary man it serves to stimulate the good withinhis bodies, to protect him, and it will also prove of beneficent influence uponhis environment. Uttered by an adept or initiate its possibilities for good areinfinite and far-reaching.Mantrams are of many kinds, and generally speaking might be enumerated asfollows:1. Some very esoteric mantrams, existing in the original Sensa, in the custodyof the Great White Lodge.2. Some Sanskrit mantrams employed by initiates and adepts.3.

Magic is based on the inner powers in man’s soul.—Isis Unveiled, I, 459.2. The trinity of nature is the lock of magic, the trinity of man the key thatfits it.—Isis Unveiled, II, 635.3. Magic is occult psychology.—Isis Unveiled, I, 612-616.4. The astral light is the chief agent of magic.—Isis Unveiled, I, 128, 616; S.D., I, 275; II, 537. ( back [text00020.html#Y_back292] )( 293) Magic.—The very word Magic bears within itself proof of its high origin.The Latin Magus, the Greek Magos, a magician, gives us all those other wordsthat are so indicative of authority, wisdom, superiority. Then we havemagnitude, magnificent, magniloquent, to express greatness in position, inaction and in speech. With the termination slightly changed the same wordsbecome majesty, implying dominion, and again, we have magistrate, anything thatis magisterial which again has been simplified into Master, and finally by theprocess of word evolution has become plain Mister. But the Latin is only atransmitter of words. We can equally follow up the historical development ofthis root until we reach the Zend where we find it doing duty as the name forthe whole priestly caste. The magi were renowned all over the world for theirwisdom and skill in occultism and no doubt our word magic is mostly indebted tothat source for its present existence and meaning. That we need not pause evenhere for back of the Zend “mag,” “looms up the Sanskrit, maha, signifyinggreat.” It is thought by good scholars that maha was originally spelled magha.To be sure, there is in the Sanskrit the word Maga meaning a priest of the Sun,but this was evidently a later borrowing from the Zend which had originallyderived its root from its neighbor the Sanskrit.—Lucifer, Vol. X, p. 157. ( back[text00020.html#Y_back293] )( 294) Magic.—The art of divine Magic consists in the ability to perceive theessence of things in the light of nature (astral light), and—by using thesoul-powers of the Spirit—to produce material things from the unseen universe,and in such operations the Above and the Below must be brought together and madeto act harmoniously.—S. D., II, 538.Magic is the second of the four Vidyas, and is the great maha-Vidya in theTantric writings. It needs the light of the fourth vidya (atmavidya) thrown onit in order to be White magic.—S. D., I, 192.Black Magic is defined by H. P. B. as follows:a. Black magic employs the astral light for purposes of deception and seduction,whereas the white magician employs it for purposes of information, and theaiding of evolution.—S. D., I, 274.b. Black magic works with opposing poles. The white magician seeks the point ofequilibrium or balance, and of synthesis.—S. D., I, 448.c. Black magic has for its symbol the inverted 5-pointed star. White magic usesthe same symbol with the point uppermost.d. Black magic is maha-vidya without the light of atma-vidya. White magic ismaha-vidya illumined by atma-vidya.—S. D., I, 592.e. Black magic is ruled over by the moon. White magic is ruled over by the sun.f. Black and white magic arose during the great schism which started during thefourth root-race.—S. D., II, 221, 445, 520.g. Black magic is based on the degradation of sex and of the creative function.White magic is based on the transmutation of the creative faculty into thehigher creative thought, the generative organs being neglected by the innerfire, which passes to the throat, the centre of creative sound.h. Black magic deals with the forces of involution.White magic works with the powers of evolution.i. Black magic is concerned with the form, with matter.White magic is concerned with the life within the form, with Spirit.

The inner round has many meanings someimpossible to give, but two things may here be said: That it concerns itselfwith the effect of the triangular balancing of forces towards the close of thecycle, when the force or energy involved is circulating unimpeded, even ifslowly, through:1. Two constellations of the solar system,2. The planetary schemes3. Three globes in the scheme.It should be remembered that all these three are interdependent. The forcebegins thus to flow when any cycle is two thirds run. It deals with the greaterInitiations, and is the correspondence on the higher planes to the occult shortcut to wisdom and knowledge which we call the Path of Initiation.

The order and the waythereof are these. This should be destroyed first, this afterwards; and such andsuch work of the nature of negation should be performed. First, make enquiry,entertain the ‘desire to know,’ and thoroughly and fully understand the natureof the I and the This. Then entertain the desire to possess, ‘I shall obtain theThis and the I.’ Having obtained them, you will pass on to the Negation, to thedeclaration, ‘no (I want them no more).’ In the Negation is the summation,sam-a-hara, ‘bringing all together,’ and it is the sam-hara also, the ‘takingall in,’ re-absorption, destruction.”—Pranava-Vada, p. 364.

In the system...The Sun is the sixth principle, buddhi, and its vehicle. (TheDragons of Wisdom taking form on the fourth cosmic ether, our buddhic plane).c. As an entity...The Sun is the seventh principle of Brahma or the aspect ofactive intelligent matter.Hence ‘rejection’ as it is called ensues because consciousness or thedevelopment of the Ego (logoic or human) is the goal of evolution, and not thematter aspect. “The Primordial Ray is only the vehicle of the Divine Ray.”—S.D., I, 108.

It was the basis of the alchemical work of olden days.“True, without error, certain and most true; that which is above is as thatwhich is below and that which is below is as that which is above, for performingthe miracles of the one Thing; and as all things were from one by the mediationof one so all things arose from this one thing by adaptation.The Father of it is the sun, the mother of it is the moon; the wind carries itin its belly and the Mother of it is the earth. This is the Father of allperfection, and consummation of the whole world. The power of it is integral ifit be turned into earth.Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire and subtle from the gross, gentlywith much sagacity; it ascends from earth to Heaven, and again descends toearth; and receives the strength of the superiors and the inferiors—so thou hastthe glory of the whole world; therefore let all obscurity fly before thee. Thisis the strong fortitude of all fortitudes overcoming every subtle andpenetrating every solid thing. So the world was created.”—Emerald Tablet ofHermes . ( back [text00021.html#Y_back311] )( 312) Man must understand the nature of the wheel in which he is turned, calledin Sanskrit the wheel of Samsara. This latter word derived from the root Sru, tomove, indicates a motion wheel or the great wheel of changing life in which thehuman entities have been called upon to work and which must never be abandonedout of compassion for man and in obedience to the law of oneness which connectsthe many, in the opinion of all true yogees and Sri Krishna. The Teacher givesthe nature of the samsaric wheel in a certain peculiar way which deserves to bethought over by you all. He says “all bhootas spring up from food and food fromParjanya or rain. Rain comes out of yagna and yagna out of Karma. Karma is outof the Veda and Veda is of the Eternal.” Here you see a Septenary gamut is givenwith the bhoota (or manifested form) at one end and the eternal substanceunmanifested to us at the other end. If we divide this seven according to thetheosophical plane of a lower four dominated over by a higher triad, we getform, food, rain and yagna as the lower four and karma, Veda and eternalsubstance as the higher triad. The eternal substance that pervades all space,worked on by the world song and giving rise to all the laws of karma that governthe development of the world, develops a lower four and this four is started byyagna—the spirit of evolution that connects the higher and lower or in Puranicfashion, the spirit that seeks to add to the harmony of the unmanifested bygiving it a field of disharmony to work upon and establish its own greatness.This spirit of yagna in its way to produce the manifested form gives rise to theParjanya or rain. The word Parjanya is applied to rain and often times to aspirit whose function is to produce rain.—Some Thoughts on the Gita , p. 127.

The derivation that is given for the word is Ma + Ya or not that.Maya is therefore a power that makes a thing appear as what it is not, or apower of illusion that arises out of limitation in the ancient concept of a trueunity periodically appearing as multiplicity by the power of Maya that coexistswith that unity.

The Aspect of Bliss, or Will, imposes on Matter the quality ofInertia-Tamas, the power of resistance, stability, quietude.

The lotus symbolises a world-system, and Brahma dwells thereinrepresenting action; he is therefore called the Kamal-asana, the Lotus-seated.The lotus, again, is said to arise from or in the navel of Vishnu, because thenavel of Vishnu or all-knowledge is necessary desire , the primal form of which,as embodied in the Veda-text, is: May I be born forth (as multitudinousprogeny). From such central and essential desire, the will to live, arises thewhole of becoming, all the operations, all the whirls and whorls, of change andmanifestation, which make up life. In such becoming dwells Brahma, and from himand by him, i.e., by incessant activity, arises and manifests the organisedworld, the trib huvanam, the triple world. Because first manifested , thereforeis Brahma named the first of the gods; by action is manifestation, and he is theactor; and because actor, therefore is he also sometimes called the preserver orprotector of the world; for he who makes a thing desires also the maintenanceand preservation of his handiwork, and, moreover, by the making of the thingsupplies the basis and opportunity for the operation of preservation, which, instrictness, of course, belong to Vishnu.”—Pranava-Vada, pp. 84, 311.

The Bodhisattva develops it in himself as he proceeds on the path. Havingreached the goal and refused its fruition, he remains on earth, as an Adept; andwhen he dies, instead of going into Nirvana, he remains in that glorious body hehas woven for himself, invisible to uninitiated mankind, to watch over andprotect it.Sambhogakaya is the same, but with the additional lustre of three perfections,one of which is entire obliteration of all earthly concerns.The Dharmakaya body is that of complete Buddha, i.e., no body at all, but anideal breath; consciousness merged in the universal consciousness, or souldevoid of every attribute. Once a Dharmakaya, an Adept or Buddha leaves behindevery possible relation with, or thought for, this earth. Thus to be enabled tohelp humanity, an Adept who has won the right to Nirvana, ‘renounces theDharmakaya body’ in mystic parlance; keeps, of the Sambhogakaya, only the greatand complete knowledge, and remains in his Nirmanakaya. The esoteric schoolteaches that Gautama Buddha, with several of his Arhats, is such a Nirmanakaya,higher than whom, on account of his great renunciation and sacrifice formankind, there is none known.”—Voice of the Silence , p. 98.

A correspondent sends the followingsuggestion: In a Study in Consciousness, the three, by an arrangement ofinternal groupings, show seven groups; these may be represented as ABC, ACB,BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA, and a seventh, a synthesis in which the three are equal. Asecond six would be represented by (AB) C, C (AB), A (BC), (BC) A, (CA) B, B(AC), the two bracketed being equal and the third stronger or weaker. The twogroups of six, and the group in which the three are equal, would make thirteen.“This thirteen may be arranged as a circle of twelve, with one in the centre.The central one will be synthetic, and will be that class in which all three areequal. The physical correspondence of this will be the twelve signs of theZodiac with the Sun at the centre, synthesising all of them. The spiritualcorrespondence will be the twelve Creative Orders with the Logos at the centre,synthesising all.” The arrangement is quite legitimate.—The Theosophist , Vol.XXIX, p. 100.Compare also the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. ( back [text00022.html#Y_back331] )( 335) Students must be careful to distinguish in their minds between theseseven cosmic Paths and the seven ray Paths upon which all humanity are found andwhich have been earlier treated in this Treatise. As we have already seen theseven ray paths become three when units upon the four minor rays mergethemselves into one of the three major rays. These three form the synthetic rayof Love-Wisdom by the time the sons of men have taken the final systemicInitiations. When this stage is reached and men realise the unity of the solarsystem not only theoretically but also as a practical reality with which theyhave identified themselves, then there is borne in upon their consciousness asomething which transcends consciousness altogether and which can only beexpressed by the limiting word identification. This identification is a cosmicand not a systemic process, and is itself sevenfold in nature. This sevenfoldprocess for lack of a better term we call the sevenfold cosmic Path.
