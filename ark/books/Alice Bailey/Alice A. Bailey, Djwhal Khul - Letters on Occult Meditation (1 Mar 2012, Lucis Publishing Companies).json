I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

With the consent of their author they have beengathered together for publication.They are published in full as received, with the exception of certain partswhich have a purely personal application, those having reference to a certainoccult school, and those of a prophetic or esoteric nature, which may not now becommunicated.It is hoped that those who read these letters will endeavour to do two things:1. Read always with an open mind, remembering that the truth is a many-sideddiamond, and that its different aspects will appear at different times, as thosewho guide the race see a need which must be met. Many books on meditation havebeen written, some too abstruse and some too superficial to satisfy the averageeducated man. The writer of these letters has apparently attempted to supply theneed of a brief yet scientific exposition of a rationale of meditation,emphasising the goal immediately ahead and the intermediate stages.2. Judge of the letters on their merits and not upon claims put forth on behalfof the writer. For this reason he has chosen to preserve his anonymity and hasrequested the recipient of the letters to publish them under his pseudonym.If the subject matter of the letters is of value it will call forth a responsefrom the readers and serve to help some onward towards the goal, and prove tomany the inspiration and aid it already has to a few.ALICE A. BAILEY. New York, 1922.[Image00005.jpg]The constitution of man (see diagram above), as considered in the followingpages, is basically threefold, as follows:—I. The Monad, or pure Spirit, the Father in Heaven.This aspect reflects the three aspects of the Godhead:1. Will or Power. . . . . . . . .The Father2. Love-Wisdom . . . . . . . .The Son3. Active Intelligence . . . . The Holy Spiritand is only contacted at the final initiations, when man is nearing the end ofhis journey and is perfected.The Monad reflects itself again inII. The Ego, Higher Self, or Individuality.This aspect is potentially :—1. Spiritual Will . . . Atma2. Intuition. . . .Buddhi, Love-Wisdom, the Christ principle.3. Higher or abstract Mind . ..Higher Manas.The Ego begins to make its power felt in advanced men, and increasingly on theProbationary Path until by the third initiation the control of the lower self bythe higher is perfected, and the highest aspect begins to make its energy felt.The Ego reflects itself inIII. The Personality, or lower self, physical plane man.This aspect is also threefold:—1. A mental body . . .lower manas.2. An emotional body . . . astral body.3. A physical body . . .the dense physical and the etheric body.The aim of meditation is therefore to bring man to the realisation of the Egoicaspect and to bring the lower nature under its control. This is the immediategoal for the average man."},{"pageContent":"LETTER I - THE ALIGNMENT OF THE EGO WITH THE PERSONALITY.Sunday, May 16, 1920.The Aligning of the Three Lower Bodies[1] It is in the aligning of the three vehicles, the physical, the emotional,and the lower mind body, within the causal periphery, and their stabilisingthere by an effort of the will, that the real work of the Ego or Higher Self inany particular incarnation can be accomplished. The great thinkers of the race,the true exponents of lower mind, are fundamentally those whose three lowerbodies are aligned; that is to say those whose mental body holds the other twoin circumspect alignment. The mental body, then, is in direct communication,unobstructed and free from interference, straight through to the physical brain.When the alignment is fourfold and when the three above-mentioned bodies arealigned with the body of the Higher Self, the causal or egoic body, and heldsteady within its circumference, then the great leaders of the race,—those whoemotionally and intellectually sway mankind, can be seen working; then theinspirational writers and dreamers can bring down their inspirations and dreams;and then the synthetic and abstract thinkers [2] can transfer their conceptionsto the world of form. It is, right through, a question of an unimpeded channel.Study, therefore, in this connection and when time permits, physicalco-ordination; then to physical co-ordination add emotional stability, and youhave the two vehicles functioning as one. When the co-ordination extends to themental body, the threefold lower man is reaching his apotheosis, and has rungmost of the changes in the world of form.Later comes co-ordination perfected with the Higher Self, the channel ofcommunication reaching in line direct,—via an unimpeded funnel, if so I mightexpress it,—to the physical brain consciousness. Heretofore it has only beendirect at rare intervals. The four lesser brain centres are functioning at highvibration in the man of a highly co-ordinated personality; when the Ego isnearing alignment with the lower bodies, the pineal gland and the pituitary bodyare in process of development; and when they are functioning with correlation(which eventuates by the time the third Initiation is taken), then the third, oralta major centre, intensifies its hitherto gentle vibration. When the fifthInitiation is taken, the interplay between the three centres is perfected, andthe alignment of the bodies is geometrically rectified; you have then theperfected fivefold superman.For the average man, then, this alignment occurs only at intervals, in momentsof stress, in hours of needed humanitarian effort and in times of intensestaspiration. Abstraction of a more or less degree has to enter in before the Egotakes continued notice of the personality or lower self. When that abstractioninvolves the emotions, is based in the mentality and contacts the physicalbrain, then alignment is commencing. [3]Hence the work of meditation, for it tends to abstraction and seeks to awaken toabstract consciousness both the emotions and the mentality.Alignment and Vibration.Forget not either that it is largely a question of matter and vibration. Theabstract levels of the mental plane consist of the three higher levels, thefirst being that termed the third subplane. As I have explained to you before,each subplane has its correlations on the major planes. When, therefore, youhave built into your bodies,—physical, emotional and mental,—matter of the thirdsubplane of each of those planes, then the Higher self commences consciously andever more continuously to function through the aligning Personality. Perhaps wemight reverse the idea and state that it is only when third subplane matter of acertain percentage (which percentage is one of the secrets of Initiation) iscontained in the vehicles, that the Personality as a conscious whole recognisesand obeys that Higher self. After such a percentage is attained, it is thennecessary to build in matter of the two higher subplanes on the physical andemotional planes; hence the struggle for the aspirant to purify and disciplinethe physical body and to subdue the emotional. Purification and subjugationdescribe the work to be done on the two planes. This involves the use of lowermind, and the three lower vehicles thus become aligned.The vibrations of the abstract levels can then begin to be felt. You need toremember that they come via the causal body, the vehicle of the Higher Self, andthe average causal body is on the third subplane of the mental plane. This is apoint not sufficiently recognised. Ponder on it. Real abstract thought becomespossible only when the Personality has, by vibration reciprocal to that of the[4] Ego, aligned itself sufficiently to form a fairly unimpeded channel. Then atintervals, rare at first but of increasing frequency, will abstract ideas beginto filter down, to be followed in due time by flashes of real illumination orintuition from the spiritual Triad or the true threefold Ego itself.The Chord of the Ego.When I use the term “reciprocal vibration,” what do I mean? I mean theadaptation of the Personality or Lower Self, to the Ego, or Higher Self, thedominating of the Personality ray by the ray of the Ego and the combining oftheir tones. I mean the blending of the primary colour of the Higher Self withthe secondary hue of the Lower Self until beauty is achieved. At first, there isdissonance and discord, a clashing of the colours, and a fight between theHigher and the Lower. But as time progresses, and later with the aid of theMaster, harmony of colour and tone is produced (a synonymous matter), untileventually you will have the basic note of matter, the major third of thealigned Personality, the dominant fifth of the Ego, followed by the full chordof the Monad or Spirit.It is the dominant we seek at adeptship, and earlier the perfected third of thePersonality. During our various incarnations we strike and ring the changes onall the intervening notes, and sometimes our lives are major and sometimesminor, but always they tend to flexibility and greater beauty. In due time, eachnote fits into its chord, the chord of the Spirit; each chord forms part of aphrase, the phrase or group to which the chord belongs; and the phrase goes tothe completion of one seventh of the whole. The entire seven sections, then,complete the sonata of this solar system,—a part of the threefold masterpiece ofthe Logos or God, the Master-Musician. [5]June 2, 1920.Microcosmic and Macrocosmic Alignment .This morning, I would touch on the matter of egoic alignment again, showing you,under the Law of Correspondences, the universal application. It lies based ingeometry, or in figures and numbers.The aim of the evolution of man in the three worlds—the physical, emotional andmental planes—is the alignment of his threefold Personality with the body egoic,till the one straight line is achieved and the man becomes the One.Each life that the Personality leads is, at the close, represented by somegeometrical figure, some utilisation of the lines of the cube, and theirdemonstration in a form of some kind. Intricate and uncertain in outline andcrude in design are the forms of the earlier lives; definite and clear inoutline are the forms built by the average advanced man of this generation. Butwhen he steps upon the Path of Discipleship, the purpose consists in merging allthese many lines into one line, and gradually this consummation is achieved. TheMaster is He Who has blended all the lines of fivefold development first intothe three, and then into the one. The six-pointed star becomes the five-pointedstar, the cube becomes the triangle, and the triangle becomes the one; whilstthe one (at the end of the greater cycle) becomes the point in the circle ofmanifestation.Hence the effort made to teach all devotees simplicity, based on a trinity offoundation truths, and the inculcation of one-pointedness.Each life tends to greater stability but seldom is the three-fold Personalityyet to be found lined up, if so I [6] may put it, with the causal consciousness.Temporary moments occur when this is the case and when (in moments of highestaspiration and for purposes of unselfish endeavor) the higher and the lower forma line direct. Usually the emotional body, through violent emotion andvibration, or a fluctuating restlessness, is continuously out of alignment.Where the emotional body may be momentarily aligned, then the mental body actsas an obstruction, preventing the percolation down from the higher to the lower,and so to the physical brain. It takes many lives of strenuous endeavor beforethe emotional body can be stilled and a mental body built that will act as afilter and not as an impediment. Even when this has been somewhat accomplishedand the emotional body is stabilised and a pure reflector, and the mental bodyserves the purpose of a sensitive plate and discriminator, and the intelligentexplainer of the higher imparted truth,—even then, I say, it takes muchdiscipline and many lives of effort to align the two at the same time. When thatis done, the control of the physical brain and its final alignment remain to beeffected, so that it may act as a direct receiver and transmitter of theimparted teaching, and may reflect with accuracy the higher consciousness.Wherein, therefore, lies the macrocosmic correspondence? Where is the analogy inthe Solar System? An indication I give here. In the direct alignment of certainplanets in the process of systemic evolution, with each other and with the Suncomes Logoic or divine alignment. Think this out, but one word of warning Igive. Seek not to work out hypotheses of alignment based on the physicalplanets. The truth lies not there. Only three of the physical planets (and thosethree in etheric matter) enter into the final alignment that marks theattainment [7] by the Logos of the cosmic egoic consciousness, which is His goalof attainment. Of these three, the earth is not one, but Venus has her placecorresponding to the emotional permanent atom.Further still the alignment may be progressed:—in the alignment of our entiresolar system with the system of Sirius lies a still more remote goal. It is apoint far ahead in time, but holds hid the secret of the greater cycle."},{"pageContent":"LETTER II - THE IMPORTANCE OF MEDITATIONJune 3, 1920.[9] Let me this morning give you some more thoughts on the subject ofmeditation; they will bear somewhat on the matter given yesterday, and on the16th ultimo.Fundamentally, meditation is to assist alignment and so permit of contact withthe Higher Self; hence its institution. I would, in order duly to elucidate,take up the study of this topic under the following heads:The Importance of Meditation.Points considered when assigning a Meditation.The use of the Sacred Word in Meditation.Dangers to be avoided in Meditation.The use of Form in Meditation.The use of Colour and Sound in Meditation.Access to the Masters through Meditation.Future Schools of Meditation.Purification of the Vehicles.The Exoteric Life of Service.Let us today take up the consideration of the first point:—What makes Meditationof importance?The emphasis upon the importance of meditation follows naturally upon therealisation by the student of the absolute necessity for the domination of thePersonality by the Ego.Man at this time is engaged in many pursuits and through the force ofcircumstances he is polarised entirely in the lower self, that polarisationbeing in either the emotional or mental body. One point of interest I wouldindicate:—as long as the polarisation is purely [10] physical or purelyemotional, no need for meditation is ever felt. Even when the mental body isactive, no urge arises until the man has run through many changes and manylives, has tasted the cup of pleasure and of pain through many incarnations, hassounded the depths of the life lived entirely for the lower self and found itunsatisfying. Then he begins to turn his thought to other things, to aspire tothat which is unknown, to realize and sense within himself the pairs ofopposites, and to contact within his consciousness possibilities and idealsundreamt of hitherto. He has come to a point where success, popularity anddiverse gifts are his, and yet from their use he derives no content; always theurge within persists until the pain is so severe that the desire to reach outand up, to ascertain something and someone beyond, overcomes all obstacles. Theman begins to turn within and to seek the source from whence he came. Then hebegins to meditate, to ponder, to intensify vibration until in process of timehe garners the fruits of meditation.FOUR THINGS MEDITATION DOES:l—It enables a man to contact the Ego and to align the three lower bodies.2—It puts a man into an attitude of equilibrium, neither utterly receptive andnegative, nor utterly positive, but at the point of balance. Thus is affordedopportunity to the Ego, and later to the Master, to disturb that equilibrium andtune the quiescent vibration to a higher note than heretofore; to cause theconsciousness to vibrate to a newer and higher measure, and to swing (if so Imay express it) into the periphery of the threefold Spirit. By the constantpractice of this, the whole point of equilibrium is gradually shifted higher andhigher, until the time comes when the lower point of [11] attraction in theswinging and adjustment, is not the physical, touches not the emotional,contacts not the mental (the causal body even escaping) and the man is polarisedin the spiritual consciousness from thenceforth.This marks the fourth Initiation; after that Initiation, the Adept makes forHimself a body of manifestation, a free creation,—there is nothing in Him tocall into objectivity a body for use in the three worlds and evolved under theLaw of Causes.3—It stabilises the lower vibrations on the subplanes of the emotional andmental planes. It commences the work of attuning the self to the vibration ofthe third subplane on each of the three lower planes, until that subplane isdominated. The second subplane is then the next to be synchronised.A man reaches the point of personality attainment in this cycle when he has thecapacity to vibrate and move consciously on the fourth subplane. We might termthe fourth subplane on the physical, emotional and mental planes (whendominated, aligned and functioning simultaneously in the same incarnation) theplane of perfected personality in the concrete sense of the word, and from thelower vision. That particular incarnation will be one in which the man achievesthe fullest expression of his lower self,—physically perfect, emotionallyvibrant, and mentally colossal. Then succeeding that, begins the transference toa higher vibration, the keying up to the Higher Self, and the attuning of thePersonality, or the major third, to the dominant fifth of the Ego.4—It assists in the transference of the polarisation from one of the permanentatoms of the Personality into the corresponding atom in the spiritual Triad.Later I will elucidate this further. [12]Hence may easily be seen the essential nature of Meditation and its wise,diligent and serious following.Early in experience, after the attainment of the highest the lower nature has tooffer, man begins to meditate. Disorderly at first are his attempts, andsometimes several incarnations may go by in which the Higher self only forcesthe man to think and seriously to meditate at rare and separated intervals. Morefrequently come the occasions of withdrawing within, until there arises for theman several lives given to mystic meditation and aspiration, culminating usuallyin a life given entirely to it. It marks the point of the highest emotionalaspiration, apart from the scientific application of the law, via the mentalbody. These laws are those governing the true occult meditation.Behind each of you who are working definitely under one of the Masters, lie twolives of culmination:—the life of worldly apotheosis and the life of intensestmeditation along the mystic or emotional-intuitional line. This meditative lifewas taken either in a monastery or nunnery in middle Europe by those linked withthe Master Jesus and His disciples, or in India, Tibet or China by the pupils ofthe Master M. or the Master K. H.Now comes to all of you the most important series of lives to which the previouspoints of culmination were but stepping stones. In the lives immediately aheadof those upon the Path will come final achievement through the instrumentalityof the ordered occult meditation, based on law. For some few may come attainmentin this life or the next; for others, shortly in other lives. For a few therelies ahead the attainment of the mystic method, to be the basis later on of theoccult or mental method."},{"pageContent":"LETTER III - POINTS CONSIDERED WHEN ASSIGNING MEDITATION.June 4, 1920[14] We have dealt with the importance of meditation, and I have suggested foryour consideration four reasons out of the many why the practice should hefollowed. At this period when meditation is followed by many of you without theguidance of a teacher who is personally acquainted with you on the physicalplane, it has been impossible to do more than formulate a plan for practice thatcarries in it the elements of safety and of universality.When a teacher is on the spot, differentiated practice may be carried on suitedto the temperament of the pupil, and having certain attributes that make thatparticular meditation the line of least resistance from the physical brain ofthe personality to the causal body.In formulating methods of meditation certain factors must be taken intoconsideration. These factors I will now enumerate. I seek not to give yououtlines and methods to be followed. I but indicate the underlying principlesthat guide the teacher in the choice of method suitable for the pupil. Later,when the teacher comes and the scientific application of the method to theindividual is being demonstrated, you can then see if the rules laid down hereare fundamentals or not. These fundamentals and principles are all I seek togive. Method and detail must be worked out through the use of discrimination,experience, courage and perseverance.The factors that must be considered by a teacher when assigning a meditation aresix in number, if we deal only with the principal ones. They are as follows:[15]l—The Ray of the pupil's Ego, or Higher Self.2—The Ray of his Personality or Lower Self.3—The Karmic condition of his threefold lower nature.4—The condition of his Causal Body.5—The immediate need of the period and his availability.6—The groups, inner and outer, with which he may be affiliated.We will now take them up and consider them one by one.1 - THE RAY OF HIGHER SELFThe ray on which a man's causal body is found, the egoic ray, should determinethe type of meditation. Each ray necessitates a different method of approach,for the aim of all meditation is union with the divine. At this stage, it isunion with the spiritual Triad, that has its lowest reflection on the mentalplane. Let me illustrate briefly:When the egoic ray is what is termed the Power Ray, the method of approach hasto be by the application of the will in a dynamic form to the lower vehicles; itis largely what we term achievement by an intense focusing, a terrificone-pointedness, that inhibits all hindrances and literally forces a channel,thus driving itself into the Triad.When the egoic ray is the second or the Love-Wisdom Ray , the path of leastresistance lies along the line of expansion, of a gradual inclusion. It is notso much a driving forward as it is a gradual expanding from an inner centre toinclude the entourage, the environment, the allied souls, and the affiliatedgroups of pupils under [16] some one Master, until all are included in theconsciousness. Carried to the point of achievement, this expansion results inthe final shattering of the causal body at the fourth Initiation. In the firstinstance—achievement via the Power Ray—the driving forward and the forcingupward had a like result; the opened channel admitted the downflow of force orfire from the spirit and the causal body in time is equally destroyed.When the egoic ray is the third or Activity-adaptability Ray , the method issomewhat different. Not so much the driving forward, not so much the gradualexpansion as the systematic adaptation of all knowledge and of all means to theend in view. It is in fact the process of the utilisation of the many for theuse of the one; it is more the accumulation of needed material and quality forthe helping of the world, and the amassing of information through love anddiscrimination that eventually causes the shattering of the causal body. Inthese “Rays of Aspect” or of divine expression, if so I may call them, theshattering is brought about by the widening of the channel, due to the drivingpower of will in the first case; by the expansion of the lower auric egg, thecausal body, in the second case, due to the inclusiveness of the synthetic Rayof Love and Wisdom; and by the breaking of the periphery of the causal body inthe third case, due to the accumulative faculty and systematic absorption of theAdaptability Ray.All these three different methods have the same result, and are fundamentallyall forms of the one great method employed in the evolution of love orwisdom,—the goal of endeavour in this present solar system.You have the will driving a man on to perfection, through realisation of theHigher, and resulting in the service of power through love in activity. [17]You have the wisdom or love aspect driving a man on to perfection through theutilisation of his oneness with all that breathes, resulting in the service oflove through love in activity.You have the activity aspect driving a man on to perfection through theutilisation of all in the service of man; first by the utilisation of all forhimself, then by the graded steps of the utilisation of all for the family, ofall for those he personally loves, of all for his environing associates, andthus on and up till all is utilised in the service of humanity.When the egoic ray is the attributive Ray of Harmony , the fourth ray, themethod will be along the line of the inner realisation of beauty and harmony; itcauses the shattering of the causal body by the knowledge of Sound and Colourand the shattering effect of Sound. It is the process that leads to therealisation of the notes and tones of the solar system, the note and tone ofindividuals, and the endeavor to harmonise the egoic note with that of others.When the egoic note is sounded in harmony with other egos, the result is theshattering of the causal body, dissociation from the lower and the attainment ofperfection. Its exponents develop along the line of music, rhythm and painting.They withdraw within in order to comprehend the life side of the form. The outermanifestation of that life side in the world is through that which we call art.The great painters and the superlative musicians are in many cases reachingtheir goal that way.When the fifth ray, the Ray of Concrete Science or Knowledge is a man's ray, themethod is very interesting. It takes the form of the intense application of theconcrete mind to some problem for the helping of the race; it is the bending ofevery mental quality and the [18] controlling of the lower nature so that onesupreme endeavor is made to pierce through that which hinders the downflow ofthe higher knowledge. It involves also the will element (as might be expected)and results in the wresting of the desired information from the source of allknowledge.As the process is continued, the piercing of the periphery of the causal bodybecomes so frequent that in the end disintegration is produced and a man is setfree. It is mentality driving a man on to perfection and forcing him to utiliseall knowledge in the loving service of his race.The Ray of Devotion is pre-eminently the ray of sacrifice. When it is the egoicray the method of approach through meditation takes the form of one-pointedapplication, through love of some individual or ideal. A man learns to includethrough love of person or ideal; he bends every faculty and every effort to thecontemplation of what is required, and in sacrifice for that person or ideallays even his causal body on the flames of the altar. It is the method of divinefanaticism that counts all lost apart from the vision, and that eventuallysacrifices joyously the entire personality. The causal body is destroyed throughfire, and the liberated life streams upward to the spirit in divinebeatification.When the egoic ray is the seventh or Ray of Ceremony Law or Magic, the method isthat of the glorification and comprehension of form in approach. As saidearlier, the goal of all the meditation practices is approach to the divinewithin each one, and, through that, approach to the Deity Himself.The method, therefore, is the bringing under law, order and rule, of every actof the life in all the three bodies, and the building within the causal body ofan [19] expanding form that results in the shattering of that body. It is thebuilding of the Shrine under certain rules into a dwelling place for theShekinah, and when the spiritual light flames forth, the Temple of Solomonrocks, reels and disintegrates. It is the study of the law and the consequentcomprehension by the man of how that law is wielded and why; it is then thedefinite application of that law to the body of causes so as to render itneedless and thus effect its shattering. Emancipation is the result, and the manfrees himself from the three worlds. Many occultists are coming in on this rayat this time to continue the liberating process. It is the method that leads aman to liberation through the understanding and the intelligent application ofthe law to his own life, and to the ameliorating of conditions in the body ofhumanity, thus making the man a server of his race.This suffices for today.June 5, 1930.2 - THE RAY OF THE PERSONALITYWe have somewhat dealt with the first factor, the egoic ray, in determining themethod of meditation. Today we might take up the function of the personality rayin determining this method. As you know, the personality ray is ever a sub-rayof the spiritual ray and varies with greater frequency than the egoic ray. Withevolved egos such as may be contacted among the thinkers of the race and amongthe prominent workers in all departments of world work everywhere, thepersonality ray may vary from life to life, each life being based on a differentnote and demonstrating a different colour. In this way the causal body is morerapidly equipped. When the reincarnating unit has reached a point where he canconsciously choose his mode of expression, he [20] will first review his pastlives, and from the knowledge gained thereby, he will guide his choice for thenext. Prior to incarnation he will sound his egoic note and will note the lackof fullness or the discord it may contain; he will then decide upon which notehe will base his coming personality vibration.The whole life, therefore, may be given over to the sounding of a particularnote and to the stabilising of one particular vibration. This note must besounded and this vibration stabilised in diversity of circumstances. Hence thenecessity in the life of the aspirant or disciple for frequent change, and theexplanation of the obvious condition of variety and apparent chaos in whichthese lives are spent.When the discord has been corrected and when the vibration becomes steady and isnot subject to change, then the needed work is done. The Ego can call in againhis forces, prior to continuing the work of perfecting the causal body andcarrying to perfect accuracy and clarity of tone the desired chord. See then thenecessity of adapting the method of meditation to the need of the personality,and of synchronising it at the same time with the first factor, involving theray of the Ego.A practical illustration.Let me illustrate, if in any way I can elucidate the matter; accuracy ofcomprehension is desired.We will assume that the egoic ray of A is that of the Love or Wisdom Ray, whilstthe ray of his lower self is that of the fifth or the Ray of Concrete Knowledge.A in past lives has demonstrated love and has made real progress in the methodof the synthetic ray, that of expansion. He loves much and expands with fairfacility his consciousness to include a just part of his environing [21]circumstances. But, though of average intelligence, he lacks the stabilisingvibration that attaches to the fifth ray. He has not that concentration thatforces results, and he needs the basic foundation of facts before he can wiselyand safely proceed much further. The wise teacher, in apprehending thisnecessity, uses the method of expansion inherent in the egoic ray and applies itto the expansion of the mental body. By a wisely adjudicated method, he willapply the faculty of expansion (hitherto used only to include others throughlove) to the one-pointed effort likewise to expand for the purpose ofapprehending knowledge. When this is done, every effort of the personal life mayapparently (in one particular incarnation) be given to the acquirement ofscientific position and to the development of mind. Intellectual progress mayseem of too paramount importance to the uninstructed onlooker; yet, after all,the work proceeds as desired by the inner guide, and only the life succeedingwill demonstrate the wisdom of the egoic choice.Intellectual expansion by the combination of second ray methods with fifth rayapplication will be achieved. Have I made this matter clear? I write for clarityfor this question of meditation is of much vital importance to many.It will, therefore, be clear to you on careful perusal, that as one knows more,one judges less. A person may be well-developed on the love side, yet in someparticular incarnation that side may lie in abeyance, and the line ofdevelopment most apparent may be the purely intellectual. Reservation of opinionis the best line for the wise onlooker to take, for he has not yet the innervision that sees the colour, nor the occult hearing that recognises the note.[22]June 7, 1920.3 - THE KARMIC CONDITION OF THE THREEFOLD MANToday the karmic condition of the threefold man and his place in evolution comesup for consideration under our discussion of “Methods of Meditation.” It is ourthird point and of real moment in deciding wisely upon a method suitable for theindividual. We have up till now considered first the importance of meditation;then we touched briefly upon the part the egoic ray plays in deciding upon thatmethod, incidentally bringing out a point not much emphasized hitherto that thereal goal of meditation is the gradual fracturing, breaking and shattering ofthe egoic body. Each ray necessitated, we saw, a different process. Then we tookup the function of the personality ray in combination with the egoic ray, andsaw how in wise consideration of the two factors a method could wisely beapportioned.Now we take up more specifically the factor of time. Karma and time are moresynonymous terms than is oft realised. Occult meditation and the definitecommencement of the work of liberating the individual from the periphery of thecausal body can only be begun when a certain point in evolution has beenattained, and when (through its content) the causal body is of a certainspecific gravity, and when the circumference of that body measures up to certainrequirements. The whole process is one of law and not, as is so oft considered,one purely of aspiration and lofty desire. Consider wisely this sentence I havejust written upon the karmic condition of the threefold man and his place on theladder of evolution. What have I specified? Three factors for yourconsideration: [23]a—The point in evolution.b—The specific gravity of the causal body.c—The size and circumference of the causal body.Later I intend definitely taking up with you the question of the mental planeand its three higher subplanes, which are the planes of the Ego. We will dealwith the position of the causal body on these planes and with the relationshipof the causal body to other bodies on the same plane. In this letter I deal onlywith the three above-mentioned points. I deal, therefore, with the causal bodyitself, with the egoic consciousness and its relationship to the lower self.Later I will deal with the same consciousness on its own plane and itsrelationship to other egos and to the Hierarchy. Keep this clearly in mind:—thedevelopment of the egoic consciousness within the Personality is my main themeat this time. Do not confuse the two. We might word it otherwise:—I will dealwith the relationship of the Higher Self to the threefold lower man, and thegradually increasing strength of that relationship through meditation. Thisincrease is coincident with the three factors above named. Let us take them inorder.The Point in Evolution.The life of the evolving personality might be divided into five divisions. Oursis, after all, a fivefold evolution, and the life of the man (as a human beingand prior to taking the fifth Initiation) may be considered as a series of fivegradual steps, each step being gauged by the condition of the indwelling Flameof Spirit. From the standpoint of our occult planetary Hierarchy, as before Ihave told you, we are measured by our light.The first division of progress might be measured from the moment when animal-manbecame a thinking entity, [24] a human being, to that of the consciousfunctioning of the emotional body or to the point where the emotions are verylargely paramount. It corresponds to the period covered by the Lemurian andearly Atlantean days. During this period, the man is polarised in his physicalbody and is learning to be controlled by his desire body, the body of feeling orof emotion. He has no aspirations save such as pander to the pleasures of thebody; he lives for his physical nature, and has no thought for aught that may behigher. This period parallels that of the child from one to seven years. At thistime the watching Teachers of the race see the indwelling Flame as a tinypin-point, and the permanent atom of the physical plane holds the polarisation.No attention is called for from the Teachers, for the instinctive force inherentin the Higher Self does the work, and the driving force of evolution carries allon to perfection.The second period covers a point in development when the polarisation is largelyin the emotional body and when lower mind desire is being developed. LaterAtlantean days hold the analogy hid. The desires are not so purely physical, formind is beginning to permeate, much as yeast causes a movement and a rising in amass of dough. The man is conscious of vague pleasures not associated with hisphysical body; he is capable of a deep love for teachers and guides wiser thanhimself, of a wild unreasoning devotion for his environing associates, and of anequally wild and unreasoning hatred, for the equilibrium that mind achieves, andthe balance that is the result of mental action, is wanting in his make-up. Hesuffers from extremes.The polarisation lies now in the emotional permanent atom but, (when this pointof development is reached) a light plays between the two atoms that have [25]known polarisation—the emotional and the physical. What I am seeking to bringout at this stage is that the mental unit has not known the force ofpolarisation, the emotional is holding it, and the result is an integraldifference within the periphery of the atom itself. The electronic combinationsthat compose the atom which has suffered polarisation are grouped in a differentgeometrical form to those which have not yet experienced the process. It is theeffect of the life of the Ego, playing on the matter of the atom and causingvarious approximations and differentiations unseen in a non-polarised atom. Thematter is abstruse and complex.This period is an analogous one to that in the life of a child from seven tofourteen years, or that period when adolescence is traversed and the child ismaturing. This maturity is the product of emotional and physical polarisation inalignment. Alignment is now easily achieved between the physical and emotionalbodies. The problem is to bring both under alignment with the mental and laterwith the egoic bodies.To the watching Guides of the race, the indwelling Flame or Light can be seenslightly more enlarged, but still so small as to be inappreciable. But, if I canin any way make clear without misleading by the use of words—whereas in thefirst period the physical atom could be seen illuminated, now in the secondperiod the emotional atom is similarly lit up, a signal to the Teachers that thework progresses. All this covers a vast period of time, for progress at thisperiod is inexpressibly slow. My allusion to the Atlantean and Lemurian raceswas but to trace analogy in object, and not analogy in time.Now, on entering the third period , comes the most vital point in thedevelopment of the man, that in which [26] mind is developing and the polarisinglife shifts to the mental unit. Speaking in terms of the solar system andviewing humanity as a unit, all of whose permanent atoms form the molecules in acorresponding cosmic atom, the work has progressed from physical to emotionalpolarisation and remains there. Not till the seventh cycle of the greater cycle,not till the calling of the system into obscuration and out of manifestationwill the cosmic mental atom in the body of the Logos achieve polarisation. Hereand there individuals are, as units, accomplishing the work and demonstratingtherefore the hope for all.This period corresponds to that between the ages fourteen and twenty-eight. Theperiod here is longer for there is much to be done. Two atoms have feltpolarisation, and one is receiving the shifting. It is the middle point. At thistime the light plays between the three atoms (outlining the personalitytriangle). But the focal point is gradually shifting more and more into themental unit, and the egoic body is becoming gradually more rounded out, andassuming its proportions.The man has control of the physical body and each life he builds a better; hehas a desire body of more refined requirements (note the occult significance ofthat word); he realizes the joys of intellect and strives ever for a mental bodyof greater adequacy; his desires turn upward instead of downward, and becometransmuted into aspiration,—at first aspiration towards the things of mind, andlater towards that which is more abstract and synthetic. The indwelling egoicFlame or Light now radiates from an inner centre to the periphery, lighting thecausal body and giving indication of burning. To the on-looking Hierarchy it isapparent that the divine fire is permeating and warming and radiating throughout[27] the causal body., and that the Ego is becoming ever more conscious on hisown plane, and ever more interested—via the permanent atoms ,—in the life of thePersonality. The physical brain of the Personality is not yet aware of thedifference between inherent mental capacity and the directed impress of theindwelling Ego, but the time is becoming ripe for a change of some kind, andevolution is moving with rapidity. The fourth period approaches. I would heresound a warning. All this proceeds not in ordered sections, if so I may term it.It proceeds as proceeds the greater system, with constant overlapping. and withparallelism, due to the inherent ray of the spirit or Monad, to cyclic changes,to diversity of forces playing astrologically and oft from unknown cosmiccentres upon the palpitating life within the atoms....The fourth period is that within which co-ordination of the Personality iscompleted, and that wherein the man comes to himself (as did the prodigal in thefar country) and says: “I will arise and go to my Father.” This is the result ofthe first meditation. The three permanent atoms are functioning and the man isan active, feeling, thinking entity. He reaches the consummation of thepersonality life and he begins to shift consciously his polarisation from thepersonality life to the egoic. He stands upon the Path of Discipleship orProbation, or is close to it. He commences the work of transmutation; helaboriously, painfully and carefully, forces his consciousness higher and toexpand at will; at any cost he determines to dominate and function in fullliberation on the three lower planes; he realises that the Ego must have perfectexpression,—physical, emotional and mental,—and he makes, therefore, at infinitecost, the necessary channel. He attracts the attention of the Teachers. [28] Inwhat way does he do this? The causal body begins to radiate the indwellingLight. It has been constructed to a point where it is fine enough to act as atransparency and, where the contact of the Ego is made with the Triad, a pointof Flame appears....The light is no longer under the bushel, but suddenly flamesforth, and catches the eager eye of the Master.This marks the period between twenty-eight and thirty-five in the life of theadult. It is the period wherein a man finds himself, discovers what his line ofactivity may be, what he can accomplish, and from the worldly standpoint, comesinto his own.During the fifth period , the Flame gradually breaks through the periphery ofthe causal body, and the “path of the just shineth ever more and more unto theperfect day.” It is in the fourth period that meditation commences,—the mysticmeditation that leads, in the fifth period, to that occult meditation thatbrings about results, being under the law and hence following the line of theray. It is by meditation that the man—as a Personality—feels out the vibrationof the Ego, and seeks to reach up to the Ego and bring the egoic consciousnessever more and more down, so as to include consciously the physical plane. It isby meditation or by retreating within that the man learns the significance ofFire, and applies that fire to all the bodies, till naught is left save the fireitself. It is by meditation, or the reaching from the concrete to the abstract,that the causal consciousness is entered, and man—during this finalperiod—becomes the Higher self and not the Personality.The polarisation shifts during the fifth period (the period of the Path ofInitiation) entirely from the Personality to the Ego, until, at the close ofthat period, liberation is complete, and the man is set free. Even the [29]causal body is known as a limitation and the emancipation is completed. Thepolarisation then shifts higher into the Triad—the shifting beginning at thethird Initiation. The physical permanent atom goes and the polarisation becomeshigher mental; the emotional permanent atom goes and the polarisation becomesintuitional; the mental unit goes and the polarisation becomes spiritual. Theman then becomes a Master of the Wisdom and is of the symbolic age of forty-two,the point of perfected maturity in the solar system.A still later period comes, corresponding to the ages forty-two to forty-nine,wherein the sixth and seventh Initiations may be taken, but this period concernsnot the readers of these letters....June 9, 1920.The Specific Gravity and Content of the Causal Body.This subject, anent the causal body, opens up for the thinker much food forspeculation. The literal figures and the dimensional lines cannot be given. Theyform one of the secrets of initiation but certain ideas may be suggested andsubmitted to the consideration of all interested.Just what do you mean when you speak of the causal body? Say not glibly, thebody of causes, for words thus spoken are oft but nebulous and vague. Let usnowconsider the causal body and find out its component parts.On the involutionary path you have what is termed the Group Soul, aptlydescribed (as far as earth words permit) as a collection of triads, enclosed ina triple envelop of monadic essence. On the evolutionary path, groups of causalbodies correspond and are similarly composed, three factors entering in. [30]The causal body is a collection of permanent atoms, three in all, enclosed in anenvelop of mental essence.... What happens at the moment when animal-man becomesa thinking entity, a human being? The approximation of the self and the not-selfby means of mind, for man is “that being in whom highest spirit and lowestmatter are linked together by intelligence.” What do I mean by this phrase? Justthis: that when animal-man had reached a point of adequacy; when his physicalbody was sufficiently co-ordinated, when he had an emotional or desire naturesufficiently strong to form a basis for existence, and to guide it by means ofinstinct, and when the germ of mentality was sufficiently implanted to havedonated the instinctive memory and correlation of ideas that can be seen in theaverage domesticated animal, then the descending spirit (which had taken toitself an atom on the mental plane) judged the time ripe for taking possessionof the lower vehicles. The Lords of the Flame were called in and they effectedthe transfer of polarisation from the lower atom of the Triad to the lowest atomof the Personality. Even then, the indwelling Flame could come no lower than thethird subplane of the mental plane. The life of the first Logos must be blendedwith that of the second Logos and based on the activity of the third Logos.Therefore, you have at the moment of individualisation, which is the term usedto express this hour of contact, on the third subplane of the mental plane apoint of light, enclosing three atoms, and itself enclosed in a [31] sheath ofmental matter. The work then to be done consists of:1. Causing that point of light to become a flame, by steadily fanning the sparkand feeding the fire.2. Causing the causal body to grow and expand from being a colourless ovoid,holding the Ego like a yolk within the egg-shell, to a thing of rare beauty,containing within itself all the colour of the rainbow. This is an occult fact.The causal body will palpitate in due course of time with an inner irradiation,and an inner glowing flame that will gradually work its way from the centre tothe periphery. It will then pierce through that periphery, using the body (thatproduct of millennia of lives of pain and endeavour) as fuel for its flames. Itwill burn all up, it will mount upward to the Triad, and (becoming one with thatTriad) will be re-absorbed into the spiritual consciousness,—will carry withit—using heat as the symbol—an intensity of heat or quality of colour orvibration that before were lacking.Therefore the work of the Personality—for we have to view all from that angleuntil egoic vision may be ours,—is first to beautify, build and expand thecausal body; secondly to withdraw within it the life of the Personality, suckingthe good out of the personal life and storing it in the body of the Ego. Wemight term this the Divine Vampirism, for always evil is but the other side ofgood. Then, having accomplished this, comes the application of the flame to thecausal body itself and the joyous standing by whilst the work of destructiongoes on, and the Flame—the live inner man and the spirit of divine life—is setfree and mounts to its source.The specific gravity of the causal body fixes the moment of emancipation andmarks the time when the work of beautifying and building is completed, when the[32] Temple of Solomon is erected, and when the weight (occultly understood) ofthe causal body measures up to the standard looked for by the Hierarchy. Thenthe work of destruction supervenes and liberation approaches. Spring has beenexperienced, the full verdure of summer has succeeded, now must be felt thedisintegrating force of autumn,—only this time it is felt and applied on mentallevels and not on physical. The axe is laid to the root of the tree, but thelife essence is garnered into the divine storehouse.The content of the causal body is the accumulation by slow and gradual processof the good in each life. The building proceeds slowly at first, but towards theend of incarnation—on the Probationary Path and on the Path of Initiation—thework proceeds rapidly. The structure has been reared, and each stone quarried inthe personal life. On the Path, in each of its two divisions, the work ofcompleting and beautifying the Temple proceeds with greater rapidity....Briefly and in conclusion of this matter, I would seek to point out that thecircumference of the causal body varies according to type and ray. Some egoicbodies are of a form more circular than others; some are more ovoid, and othersmore elongated in shape. It is the content and the pliability that matter, andabove all the occult permeability of the lower auric egg that permits of contactwith other egos, yet retains identity; that merges itself with its fellows, yetpreserves individuality; and that absorbs all that is desirable, yet keeps everits own shape.June 16, 1920.4 - CONDITION OF THE CAUSAL BODYThe fourth factor underlying the choice of a method [33] of meditation is oursubject today and consists of the condition of the causal body.We have dealt with the causal body in its relationship to the Personality orlower self, showing the interplay between the two and their interdependence.Through steady application to occult meditation, and through the gradualstilling of the lower mind, through concentration and the wise following of theegoic ray meditation, balanced by the personality ray mediation, we found thatthe relationship of the causal body to the Personality became ever closer andthe channel connecting the two became ever more clear and adequate. Thisresulted eventually, we saw, in a shifting of polarisation from the lower to thehigher and later to complete emancipation from both,—centralisation ensuing thenin the spiritual consciousness. We dealt with the matter from the lower point ofview, seeing it from the standpoint of a man in the three worlds.Today we will deal with the matter from the standpoint of the Higher Self, fromthe egoic level, and consider the relationship of that Self to the Hierarchy, tosurrounding egos, and to the Spirit. It will be difficult to do more than givesome few hints, for much that I could say would be little comprehended, and muchbe too occult and dangerous for general communication.Three things may be imparted, which—when wisely meditated upon—may lead toillumination:The Ego on its own plane, realises consciously its relationship to the Master,and seeks to transmit that consciousness to the Personality.The Higher self on its own plane, is not trammeled by time and space, and(knowing the future as well as that which is past) seeks to bring the desiredend nearer and make it more rapidly a fact. [34]The Higher Self or Ego on its own plane has direct relationship with other egoson the same ray, and on a corresponding concrete or abstract ray, and—realisingthat progress is made in group formation—works on that plane at the helping ofhis kind. These facts are already half apprehended among students but by aslight elaboration I may make it clearer.Relationship of the Ego to the Hierarchy.The relationship of the Ego to some one Master is at this stage consciouslyrealised, but is nevertheless, itself of evolutionary development. As we havebeen told, there are sixty thousand million units of consciousness or spirits inthe evolving human hierarchy. These are found on causal levels, though thenumbers are slightly less now, owing to the attainment of the fourth Initiationby individuals from time to time. These egos at different stages of developmentare all linked with their Monad, Spirit or Father in Heaven, in much the sameway (only in finer matter) as the Ego is linked with the Personality.All the Monads are, as you know, under the control, or rather form part, of theconsciousness of one of the Planetary Spirits. On egoic levels, the egos are ina similar condition. An Adept of their ray supervises their general evolution,dealing with them in groups . These groups are formed under three conditions:a—As to sub-ray of the egoic ray.b—As to period of individualisation or of entrance into the human kingdom.c—As to point of attainment.The Adept of their ray handles the general supervision but under Him work theMasters each on His own ray, and with Their own individual groups, who areaffiliated with Them through period, through karma and [35] through point ofvibration. Under the Masters work the disciples who have the consciousness ofthe Higher Self, and are therefore able to work on causal levels and aid in thedevelopment of those egos whose causal bodies are less developed than their own.All is beautifully subject to law, and as the work of developing the egoic bodyis dependent upon the progress made in the threefold personality, the Ego isconsequently aided on lower levels by two different disciples, one working onemotional levels and reporting to another disciple who works upon the mentalvehicle. He in his turn reports to the disciple with causal consciousness, whoreports again to the Master. All this is done with the co-operation of theindwelling consciousness in the causal body. This, as you see, entails fivefactors concerning themselves with the aiding of the Ego in his evolutionarydevelopment:l—The Adept of his Ray.2—The Master of his group.3—A disciple with causal consciousness.4—A disciple on the mental plane.5—A helper on the emotional plane.For a long period of lives the Ego remains practically unconscious of thePersonality. The magnetic link exists. but that is all until the time comes whenthe personal life reaches a point where it has somewhat to add to the content ofthe causal body—a body at first small, colourless and insignificant. But thehour comes when the stones are first brought perfected from the quarry of thepersonal life, and the first colours are painted in by the man, the builder andthe artist. Then the Ego begins to give attention, rarely at first, but withincreasing frequency, until lives come around in which the Ego [36] definitelyworks at the subjugation of the lower self, at the enlargement of thecommunicating channel, and at the transmission to the physical brainconsciousness of the fact of its existence and the goal of its being. Once thatis accomplished, and the inner fire is freer in its passage, lives are thengiven to the stabilising of that impression, and to the making of that innerconsciousness a part of the conscious life. The flame radiates downward more andmore until gradually the different vehicles come into line, and the man standson the Probationary Path. He is ignorant yet of what lies ahead, and isconscious only of wild and earnest aspiration and of innate divine longings. Heis eager to make good, longing to know, and dreaming always of someone orsomething higher than himself. All this is backed by the profound convictionthat in service to humanity will the dreamed-of goal be reached, will the visionbecome reality, the longing fructify into satisfaction, and aspiration be mergedin sight.The Hierarchy begins to take action and his instruction is carried out asaforesaid.... Until now the Teachers have only watched and guided withoutdefinitely dealing with the man himself; all has been left to the Ego and thelife divine to carry out the plan, the attention of the Masters being directedto the Ego on his own plane. The Ego bends every effort to quicken vibration,and to force the oft-rebelling lower vehicles to respond and measure up to therapidly increasing force. It is largely a matter of increased fire or heat, andconsequent intensification of vibratory capacity. The egoic fire waxes evergreater until the work is done, and the purificatory fire becomes the Light ofIllumination. Ponder on this sentence. As above, so below; on each rung of theladder the process is repeated; the [37] Monad, at the third Initiation, beginsitself to be conscious of the Ego. The work, then, is more rapid owing to therarity of the material and to the fact that resistance is a factor in the threeworlds but not elsewhere.Hence, pain ceases for a Master. That is, pain as we know it on earth, which islargely pain in matter. The pain that lies hid in comprehension, not resistance,is felt to the highest circles, yea, it reaches to the Logos Himself. But thisis beside the point and well-nigh incomprehensible to you who are yet trammelledby matter.Relationship of the Ego to its own development.The Ego seeks to bring about the desired end in three ways:—1—By definite work on abstract levels. It aspires to contact and enclose thepermanent atom, its first direct approach to the Triad.2—By definite work on colour and sound with the aim in view of stimulation andvivification, working thus in groups and under the guidance of a Master.3—By frequent attempts to definitely control the lower self, a thing distastefulto the Ego, whose tendency is to rest content with consciousness and aspirationon its own plane. Forget not that the Ego itself has somewhat to wrestle with.The refusal to incarnate is not found only on spiritual levels, but is foundalso on that of the Higher Self. Certain developments also, incidental to thefactors of time and space (as understood in the three worlds) are aimed at bythe Ego, such as the increase of the causal periphery through the study ofdivine telepathy, systemic psychology and the knowledge of the law of fire. [38]Relationship of the Ego to other egos.Certain things need to be remembered:—The factor of periodicity. Egos that are in incarnation, and egos that are outof incarnation are differentiated and capable of different work. Egos whosereflections are in incarnation are more limited than those who are not. It isalmost as if the Higher Self were directed downwards, or willinglycircumscribing itself to three-dimensioned existence, whereas the egos out ofincarnation are not so limited but work in another direction or dimension. Thedifference lies in the focusing of attention, during physical plane life. Thematter is hard for you to grasp, is it not so? I scarcely know how to expressthe difference more clearly. It is perhaps as if the incarnating egos were morepositive, and the non-incarnating egos more negative.The factor of activity. This is largely a matter of ray, and affects closely therelationship between egos. Those on similar rays coalesce and vibrate morereadily to each other than those on different rays, and it is only as the secondor wisdom aspect is developed that synthesis becomes possible.On the third subplane of the mental plane egos are separated intogroups—individual separation exists not, but group separation can be felt,incidental to ray and point in evolution.On the second subplane the groups become merged and blend, and from theirforty-nine groups are formed (by merging) forty-two. The process of synthesismight be tabulated as above:Mental plane: 1st subplane 35 groups, 7 x 5 2nd subplane 42 groups, 7 x 6 3rdsubplane 49 groups, 7 x 7 Buddhic plane: 3rd subplane. 28 groups, 7 x 4 1stsubplane 21 groups, 7 x 3 Atmic plane: Atomic subplane . 14 groups, 7 x 2Monadic plane: 7 great groups[39] I have given a few hints here. It is so little, compared with what willlater be known when those of you now studying expand the consciousness stillfurther, but it is all I can as yet impart, and only this has been given withthe intent of showing how much has to be considered, when meditation forms areduly set by a Master. He has to take into wise consideration the egoic ray, andthe condition of the causal body in its relationship to the lower self and tothe Hierarchy. The state of the body must be known, and its content; itsrelationship to other egos must be duly considered, for all is in groupformation. Meditation must therefore be given which is in line with the group towhich the Ego is assigned, for as each man meditates he contacts not only hisown Ego but also his egoic group, and through that group the Master to Whom heis consequently linked, though the efficacy of a meditation depends upon thework being done in an occult manner and under law. The group significance ofmeditation is little understood, but the above thoughts are commended to you foryour wise study.June 17, 19205 - IMMEDIATE NEED OF PERIOD AND MAN'S AVAILABILITYToday we will consider factor five in deciding methods of Meditation, and willdeal with the need of the particular period and the suitability of the man tomeet the need.Let us first of all briefly recapitulate, for the value of reiteration isprofound. We have taken up briefly the [40] factor of the egoic ray, as it isconsidered by a teacher in assigning a meditation, and we have seen how each rayaimed at the same goal along a different route, and that each ray necessitated adifferent type of meditation. We have touched on the modification of themeditation through consideration of the personality ray. Then we took up thefactor of time as shown in the causal body, its point of development, and therelationship of that body to its three lower expressions, finishing yesterdaywith a few brief hints anent the causal body on its own level and its scope ofconsciousness. All this will have indicated to you how wise must be the teacherwho presumes to indicate meditation. One point I would here interpolate:—Nomeditation that is truly and occultly suitable can be assigned by a teacher whohas not the capacity of causal consciousness and contact. When the teacher knowsthe note, the rate of vibration and the colour, then he can wisely assign, butnot before. Before that time, generalisation only is possible, and a meditationgiven that may approximate the need and also be safe.Another factor enters now,—a factor that varies somewhat according to the needof the period. All cycles are not as fundamentally important. The periods in acycle that are of real moment are the termini, and those where overlapping andmerging occur. They demonstrate on the physical plane in great revolutions,gigantic cataclysms, and fundamental upheavals in all three departments of theHierarchy,—the department of the World Teacher, that of the Head of a root-raceand that of the Ruler of civilisation or of force. At the points of merging in acycle, cross-currents are found, and all the system seems to be in a chaoticcondition. The middle part of a cycle where the incoming vibration is stabilisedand the [41] old has passed away, manifests in a period of calm and apparentequilibrium.At no time in the history of the race has this been better shown than in thepresent half century. The sixth Ray of Devotion passes away and the Ray ofCeremonial Law enters and with that entering comes a swinging into prominence ofthe outstanding features and faculties of the department of force and activity,the synthesis, forget not, of the four minor rays. Therefore you have thefighting for ideals and the devoted adherence to a cause, as demonstrated underthe ray of the Master Jesus; therefore the clashing in every field of endeavorof the idealists (right or wrong) and their bitter warfare. What was the worldwar but the culmination of two opposing ideals, fighting it out on the physicalplane?—it was an instance of the force of the sixth ray. Now will come, as thesixth ray passes out, a gradual cessation of the clashing, and the gradualdomination of organisation, rule and order under the sway of the incoming force,that of the ray of the Master R—. Out of the present turbulence will arise theordered and organised form of the new world. Gradually the new rhythm willimpose itself on the disorganised communities of men, and instead of socialchaos as now you will have social order and rule; instead of the religiousdifferences and the differentiated sects of the many so-called religions, youwill have religious expression itself regulated into form and all ordered bylaw; instead of economic and political strain and stress will be seen theharmonious working of the system under certain fundamental forms; all will bedominated by ceremonial with the inner results aimed at by the Hierarchygradually taking shape. Forget not that in the apotheosis of law and order andtheir resultant forms and limitations lies, towards the close (I choose my wordswith deliberation), a [42] fresh period of chaos, and the escape of theimprisoned life from even those limitations, bearing with it the impartedfaculty and the essence of the development aimed at by the Logos of the seventhray.Such is the situation from time to time down through the ages. Each ray sweepsinto power, bearing its own incarnating spirits to whom the period marks a pointof least resistance comparatively. They contact six other types of force in theworlds and six other groups of beings who must be impressed by that force and becarried forward in its sweep towards the universal goal. Such is also thespecific situation in the period in which you live, a period wherein the seventhLogos of Ceremonial Law and Order seeks to straighten out the temporary chaos,and aims at the reduction within limits of the life escaping from the old andworn-out forms. The new forms are needed now and will be adequate. It is onlyafter the middle period in a new cycle that limitation will again be felt andthe attempt to escape be started anew.Therefore the wise teacher at this time considers the situation and weighs theeffect of the incoming ray on the spirits in incarnation. Here, therefore, youhave a third ray and its bearing to be considered in the assigning ofmeditation. Complex you feel the task to be? Fortunately the Hall of Wisdomequips its graduates for the task.At this particular period the aspect of the Form in meditation (whethermeditation based principally on the egoic ray or on the personality ray) will bemuch developed. You can look to see very definite forms built up and assigned,both to individuals and to groups, resulting in an increase of white magic, andthe consequent resultant, on the physical plane, of law and order. The comingperiod of reconstruction goes forward in line with the ray, and its ultimatesuccess and achievement is more nearly [43] possible than perhaps is looked for.The Great Lord comes in under the law and naught can stop His approach.Just now the great need of the time is for those who understand the law and canwork with it. Now is the opportunity, too, for the development of that principleand the training of people in the helping of the world.The minor Rays of Harmony and Science respond quickly to this seventh influence;by that statement I mean that their monads are easily influenced in thisdirection. The monads of the sixth Ray of Devotion find conformity moredifficult, until nearing the point of synthesis. The monads of the first andsecond rays find in this ray a field of expression. First ray monads have adirect link with this ray and seek to wield the law through power, whilst secondray monads, being the synthetic type, guide and rule through love.I think I have today given you enough to engender thought on this fifth factor.This is all I seek to do. To the guiding light of the intuition is the rest leftand what that inner guide reveals is of more value to the individual than aughtexoterically imparted. Therefore, ponder and consider.June 18, 1920Some Words of Cheer.......It is only as the disciple is willing to relinquish all in the service ofthe Great One, and to hold naught back, that liberation is achieved, and thebody of desire becomes transmuted into the body of the higher intuition. It isthe serving perfectly each day—with no thought or calculation about thefuture—that brings a man to the position of the perfect Server. And, may Isuggest one thing? All care and anxiety is based primarily on selfish motive.You fear further pain, you shrink from further [44] sad experience. It is notthus that the goal is reached; it is reached by the path of renunciation.Perhaps it may mean the renunciation of joy, or the renunciation of goodreputation, or the renunciation of friends, and the renunciation of all that theheart clings to. I say perhaps ; I say not, it is so. I but seek to point out toyou that if that is the way you are to reach your goal, then for you it is theperfect way. Aught that brings you rapidly to Their Presence and to Their LotusFeet, is by you to be desired and eagerly welcomed.Cultivate daily, therefore, that supreme desire that seeks solely thecommendation of the inner Guide and Teacher, and the egoic response to goodaction dispassionately performed.Should bereavement come your way, smile through it all; it will end in a richreward and the return of all that has been lost. Should scorn and despisings beyour lot, smile still, for only the look of commendation that comes from theMaster is the one to seek. Should lying tongues take action, fear not, but forgeahead. A lie is a thing of earth and can be left behind as a thing too vile tobe touched. The single eye, the unalloyed desire, the consecrated purpose, andthe ear that turns in deafness to all earth's noise—such is the aim for thedisciple. I say no more. I but desire that you do not dissipate needless forcein vain imaginings, feverish speculations and troubled expectations.6 - THE GROUPS, INNER AND OUTER, WITH WHICH THE PUPIL IS AFFILIATEDThe point for consideration today is of practical interest. It deals with thefactor of a man's groups. The relationship to a Master we have somewhatconsidered, [45] and I will therefore proceed with the instruction on the groupconnection.We showed yesterday the importance of meditation in connection with the group towhich a man is allied on egoic levels. Today we deal with the group to which hemay be called on earth. This group is not exactly a reflection of the group onegoic levels as might be anticipated, for only certain units of an egoic groupwill be in incarnation at any one time. We deal with the Law of Cause andEffect, as demonstrated in the groups national, religious or family.Four groups connected with the pupils.A man, when in incarnation, has four sets of people to consider as his group:—1. The big national group to which he belongs, the karma of which (throughaggregation of numbers) is so strong that he cannot break away from it even ifhe will. Certain racial characteristics, certain temperamental tendencies arehis because they are hidden in the racial physical body, and he must carry thatconstitution, and the tendencies inherent in that particular type of body,throughout his life on earth. That body provides the needed lesson, or (asevolution proceeds) it provides the best body for the type of work that has tobe accomplished. An oriental type of body has one set of qualifications, and anoccidental body has another set, and equally good, if I might so express it. Iseek here to make this point clear, for the tendency of the westerner is to apethe oriental and to endeavor to force his vibrations to the same key as that ofthe oriental. At times, this causes concern to the inner Teachers, andoccasionally leads to trouble in the vehicles. [46]There has been too much tendency to believe that to be an oriental holds thegoal for all. Forget not that even the Great Ones Themselves are not allorientals, and the Masters in European bodies are of equal accomplishment to thebetter known Eastern Adepts. Ponder on this. It needs much wise consideration,hence my emphasis of the fact. When more is known along these lines, and whenschools of meditation are founded and conducted on truly occult lines bygraduated Teachers, forms of meditation will he planned, suited to nationalityand to the temperamental differences existing among nations. Each nation has itsvirtues and each has its defects; it will therefore be the work of thesuperintending Teacher to apportion meditations that will intensify the virtuesand remedy the defects. The field opened up by these ideas is so vast that Icannot deal with it here. Specialists will later take up the problem, and thetime comes when the orient and the occident will each have their own schools,subject to the same basic rules and under the superintendence of the same innerTeachers, but wisely differing on certain points, and (though aiming at the samegoal) following different routes. You will later see these schools founded ineach nation; admission into them will not be easy of attainment, but eachapplicant for instruction will be subjected to a drastic entrance examination.You will find each school will differ somewhat, not in fundamentals but inmethods of application, due to the wise discrimination of the Head of theschool. This Head, being of the same nationality as the pupils, and having thefaculties of the causal body fully developed, will apply the method to theimmediate need.Later I may further expand the future of the meditation schools for youredification, but I seek now principally to generalise. [47]2—The second group, which is of importance in the life of the pupil, is hisfamily group , involving its special family heredity and characteristics. Everyman, who has reached a point in evolution where occult meditation is desirableand possible, has entered some particular family from deliberate choice:—a—To work off karma as rapidly as may be.b—Because of the physical vehicle it provides.You will easily see, therefore, that in the assigning of occult meditation to becarried out on the physical plane and in a physical vehicle, it will be theconcern of the Teacher to know somewhat of the physical pedigree and theinherent characteristics of the pupil, both from the point of view of findingthe line of least resistance and of demonstrating what must be overcome. (Someof you who meditate are apt to be so engrossed straining after intuitionalconsciousness that you overlook the very necessary physical vehicles.) Thephysical brain and the conformity of the head play a large part in the processand must not be overlooked in the future as they are at present. This isnecessarily so, for the dearth of trained teachers in the physical bodies is soinsuperable at present.Therefore the family group is the second thing of moment that enters intoconsideration, and the matter is of more vital importance than perhaps youthink.In the coming schools of meditation there will be records kept as to the pupil'sforbears, his family history, the progress of his youth and life and his medicalhistory. This record will be minutely accurate, and much will be learnt thisway. The life will be regulated and the scientific purification of the physicalbody will be one of the [48] first things attempted. Incidentally (in speakingof these schools) I would like to urge that you picture not some isolated spotfor their location. In the world, yet not of the world is the ideal, and only inthe advanced stages or just prior to taking Initiation will the pupil bepermitted to retire for periods of any length. It is the inner detachment thatcounts, and the ability to dissociate the self from the environment thatmatters, and not so much the physical plane isolation.3—The third group that a man has to consider is the particular band of serversto which he may be affiliated. Any man who is ready for occult meditation musthave demonstrated first for many lives his intelligent willingness to serve andto work among the sons of men. Unselfish service is the bed-rock of the life ofthe occultist, and danger lurks when it exists not, and occult meditationcarries a menace. Hence, the man must be an active worker in some part of thefield of the world, and on the inner planes he must likewise be playing hispart. Certain things will then have to be considered by the Teacher:a—The group work a man is doing and how best he may be qualified to serve betterin that group.b—The type of a man's work, and his relationship in that work to hisassociates—a very important occult factor—will be carefully weighed before ameditation is assigned, and certain types of meditation (perhaps desired by theman himself) may be withheld on account of their being unsuited to the work inhand, and because of their tendency to develop certain qualities which mighthandicap the server in his work. Those meditations which [49] will increaseability to serve will ever be the aim. The greater aim includes, after all, thelesser.4—The fourth group that has a place in the calculations of the Teacher is thatto which a man belongs on the inner plane , the band of helpers to which he isassigned, or—if he is a disciple,—the group of pupils of which he forms a part.Their particular type of group work will be considered, the capacity of thepupil to progress with his fellows will be fostered, and his ability to fill hisappointed post will be increased.I have but hinted in these last few communications at the many things that arisefor consideration in the assignment of a meditation. You have three rays toconsider, the point in evolution of the causal body and its interrelation on itsown plane with its group, with the Hierarchy and with its reflection, thePersonality. You have also the factor of karma, the need of the time and of theman himself, and his relationship with four different groups.All this is possible and will some day be recognized, but the period of laying afoundation is not yet over, and for long will remain with you. The control ofthe mind is the present aim of meditation, and must always be the elementarystep."},{"pageContent":"LETTER IV - THE USE OF THE SACRED WORD IN MEDITATION.June 19, 1920[51] The subject that we are to deal with today is of such profundity and ofsuch vital moment that your shrinking from even considering it is exceedinglynatural. No matter what we may say upon the matter, we can but touch the fringeof it, and the depths of what will be left unsaid may seem so great, that thedata communicated may assume too small proportions.Fundamental Postulates.First, I seek to lay down certain basic postulates which, though realised asmental concepts, may yet be too deep for easy comprehension.These postulates are five in number—five out of a number too vast for yourapprehension. These postulates themselves are based on certain fundamentalfacts, and these facts (seven in number) are not as yet all comprehended. H.P.B.touched on three in his statement of the fundamentals of the Secret Doctrine.Four yet remain hid, though the fourth is emerging somewhat through the study ofpsychology and mental science. The other three fundamentals will emerge duringthe next three rounds. This round will see the apprehension of the fourthfundamental.These postulates are as follows:l—That all that exists is based on sound or on the Word.2—That differentiation is the result of sound.3—That on each plane the Word has a different effect. [52]4—That according to the note of the Word, or the vibration of the sound, willthe work of building-in or casting-out be accomplished.5—That the one threefold Word has seven keys, and these seven keys have theirown subtones.In the apprehension of these basic facts lies hid much light on the use of theWord in meditation.In the great original sounding forth of the Sacred Word (the three originalBreaths, with their seven sounds,—one Breath for each of the three solarsystems) the note was different, and the sounds pitched to a different key.In system one , the completion of the First Breath, the culmination, was thesounding forth, in note majestic, of the note FA,—the note which forms the basicnote of this system, the note of manifested nature. This note is, and to it mustbe supplemented the second note for this the second system. It is not fullysounded or rounded out, nor to the end of the greater cycle will it becompleted. The Logos sounds it now, and should He cease to breathe it forth, thewhole system would disappear into complete obscuration. It would mark the end ofmanifestation.In system two , the present system, the keynote may not be disclosed. It is oneof the secrets of the sixth Initiation, and must not he revealed.In system three the final third note will be added to the basic notes of thefirst and second systems, and then what will you have? You will have the majorthird of the Logoic Personality in its completeness, a correspondence to themajor third of the microcosm,—one note for each plane. We have been told thatthe solar Logos, on the cosmic planes, works at the problem of cosmic mind; thatHe functions in His physical solar system, is polarised in His cosmic astral, oremotional body, and is developing [53] cosmic mind. So, on the planes of thesolar system, is it as with the microcosm. In the realisation of thiscorrespondence and its wise application lies illumination on the use of theSacred Word in meditation.System I . . . .corresponds to the physical body.System II. . . .corresponds to the emotional body.System III. . . corresponds to the mental body.By the study of the Word or Sound in the formation of these three will help comeon the use of that Word in the building of the intuitional vehicle, and thepurification of the personality.Now we will divide what we have to say under four heads, and take up each one ofthem separately:—l—The creative effect of the Sacred Word.2—The destructive effect of the Sacred Word.3—Its pronunciation and use:—a—In individual meditation.b—In group and congregational work.c—For certain specific ends.4—Its effect on the bodies and centres, and its efficacy in effecting egoicalignment.June 20, 19201/2 - THE DUAL EFFECT OF THE SACRED WORD; CONSTRUCTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE.We can today continue with the subject we were considering yesterday. We dividedthe theme into four divisions and we will take the first two, theeffect,—creative and destructive—of the Word. Just a few broad hints will bepossible, to form a basis for the intelligent application of the law.First, let us repeat the truism that the worlds are the effect of sound. Firstlife, then matter; later the attraction [54] of the matter to the life forpurposes of its manifestation and expression, and the orderly arrangement ofthat matter into the necessary forms. Sound formed the allying factor, thepropelling impulse, and the attractive medium. Sound, in an occult and deeplymetaphysical sense, stands for that which we term “the relation between”, and isthe creating intermediary, the linking third factor in the process ofmanifestation. It is the akasha. On the higher planes it is the agent of thegreat Entity Who wields the cosmic law of gravitation in its relation to oursolar system, whilst on the lower planes it demonstrates as the astral light,the great agent of reflection, that fixes and perpetuates on its vibratory bosomthe past, the present and the future, or that which we call Time. In directrelation to the lower vehicle it manifests as electricity, prana and themagnetic fluid. A simplification of the idea may come to you perhaps in therecognition of sound as the agent of the law of attraction and repulsion.The seven great Breaths.In sounding forth the Sacred Word in its sevenfold completeness for this solarsystem, the Logos gathered through inspiration the matter needed formanifestation, and started the evolution of that matter at the first greatBreath.At the second great Breath came differentiation and the instilling of the secondaspect logoic.At the third great Breath the activity aspect was demonstrated, matter wasimpregnated with that faculty, and fivefold evolution became a possibility.At the fourth great Breath certain of the Hierarchies responded, and the greatBuilders more clearly saw the plan. There is a definite connection between thefourth [55] Breath and the fourth Creative Hierarchy, that of the human Spirits.This fourth note of the Logos has a special significance for the human Spirit,and an unique effect in this earth and in this fourth cycle. The relativity ofit is such that it is difficult for you in any way to realise that effect. Itdemonstrates as far as you can grasp it in the harmonic note of the fourth planeand ray. That note permeates the peoples of the world at this time and eversince the fourth root-race. It shows itself in the struggle of humanity to graspthe ideal of harmony and peace, and in the worldwide aspiration in thatdirection.This fourth Breath is especially applicable to human evolution.You have therefore:Subtone one of the threefold Word gave the first vibratory note and started themovement of the spheres—solar or atomic. It embodies Will .Subtone two of the threefold Word instilled the second aspect and called thecosmic ruler of the synthetic ray into manifestation. It marked duality orreflex love .Subtone three of the threefold Word made our fivefold evolution possible. It isthe basic note of the five lower planes. It marked activity or adaptability.Subtone four of the threefold Word is the sound of the Human Hierarchy, and inits entirety might be called the “cry of Man.”Each of the sounds directly called into manifestation one ray, with all thatenters in on a ray. Each sound demonstrates particularly on one plane, being thedominant note of that plane.The fifth great Breath has an effect peculiar to itself, for in itsreverberation it holds the key to all,—it is the Breath of fire. It created asimilar vibration to that of the cosmic mental level, and is closely allied withthe [56] first Breath. It is the dominant note (in technical musicalterminology) of the solar system, just as the third Breath corresponds to themajor third. It is the note of the Logos. Each breath attracts to the Logos forpurposes of manifestation, some entity on cosmic levels. The reflection of themethod can be seen in the microcosm when the Ego sounds the egoic note in thethree worlds and prepares to manifest or to come into incarnation. The noteattracts around the permanent atoms or nuclei adequate matter for the purpose ofmanifestation, and that matter is itself informed by some vital entity.Similarly, the cosmic Lords of Fire, the great informing Entities of our solarsystem, respond when this fifth subtone is sounded forth. Again, the Lords ofthe Flame within the solar system itself responded when the microcosm soundedthe fifth subtone of the monadic note, and involved themselves in humanevolution.The sixth great Breath drew to itself the Lords of the mysterious Pentacle, thevolatile essences of the emotional plane, the desire faculty clothed in matter,the watery aspect of the logoic life.At the sounding of the seventh subtone crystallisation occurred and absoluteconformity to the law of approach. It resulted in the dense aspect ofmanifestation, the point of deepest experience. You will note its connection,therefore, with the Ray of Ceremonial Law, one of the great building rays,—a raywhich adjusts matter, under set forms, to the desired shapes.You may ask here: Why have I thus apparently digressed? It seems to you wide ofthe mark and beside the question? Let me elucidate. The microcosm has but torepeat the work of the macrocosm. The Spirit or monad on his own plane soundsforth the note (his hierarchical note) and descends into incarnation. It is both[57] the note of attraction and of out-breathing. The personality—the reflectionof that monad at the densest point in evolution,—is linked to the monad by theattractive force of the Sacred Word sounded by its monad on its note and on itsown subtone.But the work of outbreathing is already accomplished. It is involution. The workof in-breathing or reabsorption into the source progresses. When the Personalityfinds for itself (after lives of stress and search) its spiritual note with theright key and subtone, what is the result? It accords with its monadic note, itvibrates to the same measure, it pulsates with the same colour, the line ofleast resistance is at last found, and the indwelling life is liberated and.returns to its own plane. But this work of discovery is very slow and the manhas to pick out the chord with infinite care and pains. First, he finds out thethird of the Personality and sounds that forth, the result being an orderedharmonious life in the three worlds. Then he finds the dominant fifth of theEgo, the keynote of the chord, and sounds that in unison with the Personalitynote. The result is that a vacuum is formed (if I may so express it) and theliberated man with his informing soul,—the threefold spirit, plus mind andexperience—the Three completed by the Quaternary and the Fifth, escapes upwardto the Monad. It is the law of attraction demonstrating through sound. Like tolike and kind to kind, driven thereto by unity of sound, of colour and ofrhythm.This leads to the second factor we are considering, the destructive factor. Inemancipation comes the breaking of the chains, in liberation comes the abolitionof the old forms, in the domination of matter is seen the liberation of spirit.So, in the sounding of the Sacred Word in its sevenfold sense, comes theescaping from the shattered [58] forms; first in the out-breathing, theattraction of matter, then in the in-breathing, the gradual shattering of thematerial forms and the leaving of them behind.Meditation and the Word.I have pictured this for you on the systemic scale. Now let me apply it tomeditation and see how it will work. Man, when meditating, aims at two things:—a—At the formation of thoughts, at the bringing down to the concrete levels ofthe mental plane, of abstract ideas and intuitions. This is what might be termedmeditation with seed.b—At the aligning of the ego, and at the creation of that vacuum betwixt thephysical brain and the Ego, which results in the divine outpouring, and theconsequent shattering of the forms and subsequent liberation. This might betermed meditation without seed.At a certain period in evolution the two blend, the seed is dropped and thevacuum is then created, not so much between the higher and the lower vehicles asbetween them and the intuitional plane or the plane of harmony.Therefore, in the sounding of the Sacred Word in meditation man should (ifrightly sounding it forth) be able to do both the creative work and thedestructive work as does the Logos. It will be the reflection in the microcosmof the cosmic process. He will attract to his bodies matter of the finer kindand cast out that which is coarser. He will formulate thoughtforms that attractto themselves finer matter and repudiate that which is of a lower vibration. Heshould so sound the Word that alignment will [59] be automatically made, and thenecessary vacuum created, eventuating in a downflow from above. All theseeffects can transpire when the Word is correctly intoned, and each meditationshould see the man more aligned, should disperse some of the matter of lowvibration in one or other of his bodies, should open up the channel to a greaterextent, and so provide a more adequate vehicle for the illumination from higherlevels.But—until correctness is possible—the effect produced by the use of the Word isvery little, which is fortunate for the man who uses it. In the studying of theseven great Breaths and their effect on each plane, a man can find out much thatshould transpire on the different subplanes of each plane, especially inrelation to his own development. In the studying of the basic note of the solarsystem (which was stabilised in System I), much can be found out about the useof the Word on the physical plane. A hint lies here for consideration. In theendeavour to find the note for this solar system, the note of love and wisdom,the student will make the necessary communication between the emotional ordesire plane and the intuitional plane, and find out the secret of the emotionalplane. In the study of the Word on mental levels and its effect in formbuilding, the key to the erection of Solomon's Temple will be discovered, andthe pupil will develop the faculties of the causal body, and eventually findliberation from the three worlds.The student must remember, nevertheless, that he has first to find hispersonality note, and then the egoic, before he can touch the monadic chord.When he has done that he has, for himself, sounded his own threefold Word, andis now an intelligent creator animated by love. The goal is reached. [60]June 21, 1920Some Practical Hints.I wish to make clear this afternoon that it is not possible for me, nor wise andappropriate to give to you different keys in which the sacred Word can beintoned; I can do no more than indicate general principles. Each human being,each unit of consciousness, is so unlike any other that the individual need canonly be supplied when full causal consciousness exists on the part of theteacher, and when the pupil has himself reached a point where he is willing toknow, to dare and to be silent. The dangers involved in the misuse of the Wordare so great that we dare do no more than indicate basic ideas and fundamentalprinciples, and then leave the aspirant to work out for himself the pointsnecessary for his own development and to carry out the needed experiments untilhe finds for himself that which he needs. Only that which is the result ofself-effort, of hard struggle and of bitter experience is of permanent andlasting value. Only as the disciple—through failure, through success, throughhardly won victories, and the bitter hours that succeed defeat—adjusts himselfto the inner condition, will he find the use of the Word scientifically andexperimentally of value. His lack of will defends him largely from the misuse ofthe Word, whilst his endeavour to love guides him eventually to its correctintoning. Only that which we know for ourselves becomes inherent faculty. Thestatements of a teacher, no matter how profoundly wise he may be, are but mentalconcepts until experimentally part of a man's life. Hence, I can but point theway. I may give but general hints; the rest must be threshed out by the studentof meditation for himself. [61]3 - PRONUNCIATION AND USE IN INDIVIDUAL MEDITATION.I shall now be very practical. I speak for the man on the Probationary Path, whohas therefore an intellectual grasp of what has to be accomplished. He realisesapproximately his place in evolution and the work to be done if he would someday pass through the portal of Initiation. In this way what I will say willteach the majority who study these letters........The man undertakes to meditateand seeks to conform to the necessary rules. Let me give a few preliminaryhints:—The aspirant seeks daily a quiet spot where he can be free from interference andinterruption. If wise, he will always seek the same spot, for he will therebuild up a shell around it that will serve as a protection and make the desiredhigher contact more easy. The matter of that spot, the matter of what you mightterm the surrounding space, becomes then attuned to a certain vibration (theman's own highest vibration, reached in consecutive meditations) which makes iteasier for him each time to start at his highest and so eliminate a longpreliminary keying up.The aspirant composes himself to a position in which he can be unconscious ofhis physical body. No hard and fast rules can be laid down as the physicalvehicle itself has here to be considered,—it may be handicapped in some way,stiff or crippled. Ease of posture is to be aimed at, coupled with alertness andattention. Slothfulness and laxness lead a man nowhere. The position mostsuitable for the average is cross-legged upon the ground, sitting againstsomething that affords support to the spine. In intensest meditation or when theaspirant is very proficient and the centres rapidly awakening (perhaps even theinner fire pulsating at the base of the spine) [62] the back should be erectwithout support. The head should not be thrown back as tension is to be avoided,but it should be held level, or with the chin slightly dropped. When this isdone, that tenseness that is the characteristic of so many will be gone and thelower vehicle will be relaxed. The eyes should be closed and the hands folded inthe lap.Then let the aspirant note if his breathing is regular, steady and uniform.Should this be so, let him then relax his entire person, holding the mindpositive and the physical vehicle supple and responsive.Then let him visualize his three bodies, and having decided whether hismeditation shall be in the head or within the heart (I will later take up thispoint) let him withdraw his consciousness there and focus himself in one orother of the centres. In so doing let him deliberately realise that he is a Sonof God, returning to the Father; that he is God Himself, seeking to find theGod-consciousness which is His; that he is a creator, seeking to create; that heis the lower aspect of Deity seeking alignment with the higher. Then let himthree times intone the sacred Word, breathing it forth gently the first time andthereby affecting the mental vehicle; more loudly the second time, therebystabilising the emotional vehicle; and in a still louder tone the final time,acting then upon the physical vehicle. The effect upon each body will bethreefold. If correctly chanted with the centre of consciousness steadily heldwithin whichever centre has been chosen, the effect will be as follows:On Mental Levels:a—The contacting of the head centre, causing it to vibrate. The stilling of thelower mind. [63]b—Linking up with the Ego to a more or less degree, but always to some extentthrough the permanent atom.c—The driving out of coarse particles and the building in of finer.On Emotional Levels:a—The definite stabilisation of the emotional body through the permanent atom,and the contacting and setting in motion of the heart centre.b—The driving out of coarse matter and the rendering of the emotional or desirebody more colourless, so that it will be a true reflector of the higher.c—It causes a sudden rush of feeling from the atomic levels of the emotionalplane to the intuitional plane, via the atomic channel that exists between thetwo. It sweeps upward and clarifies the channel.On the Physical Planes:a—Here the effect is very similar, but the primary effect is on the ethericbody; it stimulates the divine flow.b—It passes beyond the periphery of the body and creates a shell that serves asa protection. It drives away discordant factors in the near environment.June 22, 1920The Logoic Chord and Analogy.Now, let us proceed with the study of the use of the Sacred Word in its groupapplication and in its employment for certain specific ends. We have verybriefly studied the Word as used by the individual who begins to [64]meditate,—the effect of its use being very largely one of purification,stabilisation and centralisation. This is all that is possible until the studenthas reached a point where he may be allowed to sound the note in one of thesubtones egoic. You will have in the egoic note just the same sequence as in thenote Logoic. What had you there? You had a sevenfold chord of which theimportant points at our stage of development are:1—The basic note.2—The major third.3—The dominant or fifth.4—The ultimate seventh.A hint may here be given along the line of analogy. There is a close connectionbetween the fifth or dominant and the fifth principle, Manas or Mind, and, forthis solar system (though not for the first or third), there is an interestingresponse between the fifth plane of mind and the dominant, and between the sixthplane of the emotions and the major third. From some angles in this connectionthe emotional vehicle forms a third vehicle for consciousness—counting the densephysical and the vehicle for prana or electrical vitality as two units. More Icannot say for the whole shifts and interpenetrates, but I have indicated foodfor thought.In the egoic note,—as before said—you have a similar sequence, for it is thereflection on its own plane of the Logoic. You will therefore have the basicnote of the physical, the third of the emotional, and the fifth of the causallevels. When a man has mastered the key, and has found his own subtone then hewill sound the sacred Word with exactitude and thus reach the desired end; hisalignment will be perfect, the bodies will be pure, the channel [65] free fromobstruction, and the higher inspiration will be possible. This is the aim of alltrue meditation and can be reached by the right use of the Word. In themeantime, owing to the absence of a teacher and the defects of the pupil, allthat is now possible is to sound the Word as well as may be, knowing that dangerdoes not lurk where there is sincerity of purpose, and that certain results,such as protection, quieting and correction may be achieved.Group Use of the Word.In group formation the effect of the Word is intensified, provided the groupsare correctly constituted, or rendered null and void and neutralised should thegroups contain undesirable elements. Certain things, therefore, have to beascertained before the Word may be used with adequacy by a group:—a—It is desirable that people on the same ray or on a complementary ray form agroup.b—It is desirable that the Word be intoned on the same key, or in part harmonic.When this is done, the vibratory effect is far reaching and certain reactionswill occur.What results, therefore, when the Word is correctly sounded by a group of peoplerightly intermingled?a—A strong current is set up that reaches the disciple or the Master responsiblefor the group and which enables him to put the group en rapport with theBrotherhood, permitting the channel to be cleared for the transmission ofteaching.b—A vacuum is created that corresponds somewhat to the vacuum that should existbetween the Ego and the Personality, but this time between a group and Those onthe inner side. [66]c—If all conditions are right, it likewise results in a linking with the egoicgroups of the involved personalities, a stimulation of the causal bodiesinvolved, and a linking of all three groups—the lower, the higher and theBrotherhood—in a triangle for the transmission of force.d—It has a definite effect on the physical vehicles of the lower group; itintensifies the vibration of the emotional bodies, driving out countervibrationand swinging all into line with the higher rhythm. This results in equilibrium;it stimulates the lower mind, yet at the same time opens the connection with thehigher, which higher, entering in, stabilises the lower concrete mind.e—It attracts the attention of certain of the devas or angels whose work lieswith the bodies of men, and enables them to do that work with greater exactitudeand make contacts that later will be of use.f—It creates a protective shell around the group, which (though only temporary)leads to freedom from disturbance, enables the units of the group to work withgreater ease and according to the law, and helps the inner Teachers to find theline of least resistance betwixt Themselves and those who seek Theirinstruction.g—It aids in the work of evolution. Infinitesimal that aid may be, yet everyeffort that leads to the free play of the law, that acts in any way on matterfor its greater refining, that stimulates vibration and facilitates the contactbetween the higher and the lower is an instrument in the hand of the Logos forthe hastening of His plan. [67]I have touched here upon certain effects incident upon the chanting of the Wordin unison. Later, as the rules of occult meditation are understood andexperimentally applied, these effects will be studied. As the race becomes moreclairvoyant, they will also be tabulated and checked. The geometrical formscreated by the individual, and by the group, in sounding forth the Word will berecorded and noted. The elimination of individuals from different groups andtheir assignment to other groups more suitable will be effected by judiciousconsideration of the work done by them. Later, as individuals develop the higherconsciousness, wardens of groups must be chosen—not only for their spiritualattainments and their intellectual capacity, but for their ability to see withthe inner vision, and hence assist their members and group to rightful plans andto correct development.Groups for Specific Purposes.Groups will later be formed for specific purposes, which brings me to my thirdpoint, the use of the Word for certain calculated ends.Let me enumerate for you some of the aims groups will have in view when theyform themselves, and by the use of the sacred Word, coupled to the true occultmeditation, achieve certain results. The time for this is not yet, and needarises not for detailed description, yet if things progress as desired, even youmay see it somewhat worked out in your lifetime.l—Groups for the purpose of working on the emotional body with the object ofdevelopment, of subjugation, and clarification.2—Groups for the purpose of mental development, of strengthening equilibrium,and the contacting of the higher mind. [68]3—Groups for the healing of the physical body.4—Groups whose purpose is to effect alignment, and to clear the channel betwixtthe higher and the lower.5—Groups for the treatment of obsessions and mental diseases.6—Groups whose work it will be to study reaction to the sounding of the Word, torecord and tabulate the consequent geometrical forms, to note its effect onindividuals in the groups, and to note the extraneous entities it draws by itsattractive force. These must be rather advanced groups, capable of clairvoyantinvestigation.7—Groups that definitely work at making contact with the devas, andcollaborating with them under the law. During the seventh ray activity, thiswill be much facilitated.8—Groups that are definitely and scientifically working on the laws of the rays,and studying colour and sound, their individual and group effects, and theirinterrelation. This is necessarily a select group and only those of highspiritual attainment and those nearing Initiation will be permitted to takepart. Forget not that these groups on the physical plane are but the inevitableworking out into manifestation of the inner groups of aspirants, pupils,disciples and initiates.9—Groups that are definitely working under some one Master, and conforming tocertain procedure laid down by Him. The members of these groups will thereforebe chosen by the Master.10—Groups working specifically under one of the three great departments andseeking—under expert guidance—to influence politically and religiously [69] theworld of men, and to speed the processes of evolution as directed from thedepartment of the Lord of Civilisation. Some of these groups will work under theChurch, others under Masonry, and others will work in connection with theInitiate heads of the great organizations. In considering this you need toremember that the whole world becomes ever more mental as time proceeds,—hencethe ever-increased scope of this type of work.11—Other groups will work entirely in what might be termed preparatory work forthe future colony.12—Problem groups, as they might be called, will be formed to deal with social,economic, political and religious problems as they arise, studying the effectsof meditation, colour and sound.13—Still other groups will deal with child culture, with the individual trainingof people, with the guidance of persons on the probationary path, and with thedevelopment of the higher faculties.14—Later, when the great Lord, the Christ, comes with His Masters, there will bea few very esoteric groups, gathered out of all the others, where the members(through graduation and karmic right) will be trained for discipleship and forthe first Initiation. There will be seven such groups or centres formed fordefinite occult training...Only those whose vibratory capacity is adequate willfind their way there.I have given you enough to consider for today, and we will leave theconsideration of point the fourth till tomorrow. [70]June 23, 1920You are right in thinking that conditions today are not desirable. The wholeworld speeds towards a crisis—a crisis reconstructive, even though it seems tothe onlooker to be destructive. On all sides, the tearing down of the old formsis progressing, nor is the work as yet fully accomplished. Enough has,nevertheless, been done to permit of the erection of the scaffolding for the newbuilding. In serenity and steady adherence to the next duty will come thesimplification of that which must he done.Today we deal with the effect of the Word on the various centres, on each body,and its utility in aligning the bodies with the causal vehicle. This was ourfourth point. The first two are closely allied, for the sacred Word (whenproperly enunciated) acts on the various bodies through the medium of thecentres, and their astral and mental counterparts. Some of the effects, such asthe elimination of undesirable matter, and the building in of new, theprotective effect of the Word and its work of stabilisation and purification, wehave somewhat touched upon. We will now focus our attention largely upon thecentres and the result upon them of the sounding of the Word.4 - THE SEVEN CENTRES AND THE SACRED WORD.As is our custom, let us divide our thoughts under the following heads.Tabulation has its value; it systematises knowledge, thus tending to the orderlyarrangement of the mental body; it facilitates recollection through theassistance of the eye.l—Enumeration and discussion of the centres.2—Growth and development of the centres.3—The effect of meditation on the centres.4—Their interrelation in the work of alignment. [71]First let me say that certain information that may seem to be the naturalsequence and corollary of that which I have to impart will have to be withheld.The dangers involved through the injudicious development of the centres are toogreat for us to venture yet to give full and detailed instructions. We seek todevelop Masters of Compassion, dispensers of the love of the universe. We seeknot to develop Masters of Black Arts and specialists in ruthless self-expressionat the expense of the uninitiated. Certain facts have been, and can be,imparted. They will lead to the development of the intuition, and inspire theseeker after light to more earnest endeavour. Others must be withheld for theywould be weapons of great danger in the hands of the unscrupulous. If then itseems to you that I have but imparted only sufficient to arouse interest, knowthen that that is my aim. When your interest and the interest of all aspirantsis sufficiently aroused naught can then be withheld from you.Enumeration of the centres.The physical centres are, as you know:—l—The base of the spine.2—The solar plexus.3—The spleen.4—The heart.5—The throat.6—The pineal gland.7—The pituitary body.This enumeration is correct, but I seek to give you another division, based onearlier imparted facts, those anent the solar system. These seven centres may beenumerated as five if we eliminate the spleen and count the two head centres asone. The five centres thus specified [72] are applicable to our fivefoldevolution in this the second solar system.In the first solar system the three lower centres were developed and with themthe occultist has naught to do. They form the basis of the development of thelower quaternary before individualisation, but are now transcended and thedivine fire must be focalised in other and higher centres.The Spleen.The spleen, the third centre, has a specific purpose. It has its correspondencein the third or activity aspect, and in the third or Activity (Adaptability)Ray, and is the basis of all the fundamental activities of the microcosm, and ofthe recurring adaptations of the microcosm to its environment, to its need andto the macrocosm. It controls the selective processes of the microcosm; it takesthe vibratory force and energy of the macrocosm and transmutes it for the use ofthe microcosm. We might call it the organ of transmutation, and—as its functionsare more completely understood—it will be found that it provides a magnetic linkbetween the conscious, thinking, three-fold man and his lower vehicles,regarding those lower vehicles as the Not-Self, and as themselves animated byinforming entities. It is the life force contacting those entities that is theissue and aim.In its emotional counterpart, it is the organ of emotional vitality, again inthe same sense as providing a link; on the mental plane it serves somewhat thesame purpose, only this time through this centre are the thoughtforms vitalisedby means of the energising will. I will not, therefore, deal more fully withthis centre beyond these general indications. Few people have the faculty ofstimulating [73] it through the use of the Word, nor is it desirable that theyshould. It develops normally if the aspirant himself—as a totality—progresses asdesired:—if his physical body receives adequate application of the life forcesof the sun, if his emotional body is moved by high desire, and open to thedownflow of force from the causal and intuitional levels, and if his mental lifeis intense, vibrant, and animated by a powerful will. Then the spleen, with itsinner counterparts, will progress and be in a healthy condition.We will therefore thus dispose of it and give no further space to it in theseletters.The fundamental centres.The three fundamental centres of vital importance from the standpoint of theaverage man, polarised in his emotional body and living the normal life of theman of the world, are:l—The base of the spine.2—The solar plexus.3—The heart centre.The three major centres for the man nearing the Probationary Path and for theman who is aiming at a life of altruism, having examined the attractions of thethree worlds, are:l—The base of the spine.2—The heart.3—The throat.His solar plexus is left then to normal functioning, having served its purposeas a centre for the emotional focussing. The activity of the fire becomes morecentered in the throat. [74]The three major centres for the man on the Path itself in its twofold divisionsare:—l—The heart.2—The throat.3—The head.The divine activity has developed the solar plexus centre, is controlling allthe centres below the solar plexus, and is passing upward in ordered progressionuntil it is focussed and vivifying the head centres.Earlier we divided the life of the man into five main periods, tracing hisdevelopment in each. We might (if we are careful to generalise widely) apply thesame to the five centres.Period I—wherein the base of the spine is the most active in the purely rotarysense and not in a fourth-dimensional. The inner fire is focussed on thevivification of the organs of generation and on the functional physical life ofthe personality.Period II—wherein the solar plexus is the goal of the attention of the fire andwhen the emotional counterpart vibrates synchronously. Two centres are thusvibrating, even though the measure be slow; the others are alive; pulsation canbe seen, but there is no circular movement.Period III—The divine fire now mounts to the heart centre and the three rotatein ordered measured unison. I would point out that the vivification of any onecentre. causes an accession of force in all, and I would further point out thatin the head are seven centres (three major and four minor) and that thesecentres directly correspond to one or other centre in the body. They are thesynthesis, and, on the stimulation of their corresponding centre, receivethemselves a corresponding acquisition of rotary power. [75]Period IV—marks the definite stimulation of the throat centre. All the creativeactivity of the three-fold man—physical, emotional and mental—is turned upwardin service, and his life begins occultly to sound . He is occultly productive .He manifests forth and his sound goes out before him. This is an occultstatement of fact definitely apparent to those who have the inner vision.Coordination between the centres becomes apparent; rotation is intensified, andthe centres themselves change in appearance, becoming unfolded, and the rotarymovement becomes fourth-dimensional, turning inward upon itself. The centres arethen radiating nuclei of light, and the corresponding four lower head centresare equally alive.Period V—marks the application of the fire to the head centres and theircomplete awakening.Before initiation, all the centres will be rotating in fourth dimensional order,but after initiation they become flaming wheels, and—seen clairvoyantly—are ofrare beauty, The fire of Kundalini is then awakened and is progressing in thenecessary spirals. At the second initiation the emotional centres are similarlyawakened, and at the third initiation those on the mental plane are touched. Theinitiate can then stand in the Presence of the Great King, the One Initiator.I seek to point out that the student must ever remember that heregeneralisations only are given. The complexity in the development of themicrocosm is as great as in the macrocosm. The awakening of the centres andtheir particular order is dependent on several factors, such as:a—The Ray of the Spirit or Monad.b—The Ray of the Ego, Higher Self, or Son, or the sub-ray. [76]c—Race and nationality.d—The special type of work to be done.e—The application of the student.Fundamental centres of average man.[Image00006.jpg]Fundamental centres of developed man.[Image00007.jpg][Image00008.jpg]Fundamental centres of man on Path.Hence you can see for yourself that it is useless to lay down rules for thedevelopment of the centres and to formulate methods whereby the fire can becirculated until such time as trained teachers with expert knowledge andclairvoyant faculty are in charge of the work on the physical plane. It is notdesirable for aspirants to focus their thought on any one centre. They run therisk of overstimulation, [77] or of attrition. It is not wished that effort bemade to turn the fire towards any particular point; in ignorant manipulationlies insanity and fell disease. If the aspirant but seeks spiritual development,if he but aims at sincerity of purpose and at compassionate altruism, if he,with serene application, concentrates on the subjugation of the emotional bodyand the enlargement of the mental, and cultivates the habit of abstractthinking, the desired results upon the centres will be produced from necessityand danger will be eliminated.When these triangles are paths of threefold fire, emanating from the base of thespine, when the interlacing is complete and the fire progresses along the pathfrom centre to centre in the correct manner, and when this is accomplished inthe order required by the man's primary ray, then the work is completed. Thefivefold man has attained perfection for this present greater cycle and the goalis reached.(Note that this order has to be attained in the head centres likewise.)Tomorrow we will continue the study of the centres more specifically andsomewhat describe them, pointing to the effect upon the life through theawakening of these wheels.June 25, 1920.The growth and development of the centres.We will now enumerate the centres again, this time considering their psychiccorrespondences and will note the colours and the number of the petals.1—The base of the spine . Four petals. These petals are in the shape of a cross,and radiate with orange fire. [78]2—The solar plexus. Ten petals. The colour rosy, with an admixture of green.3— The heart centre. Twelve petals. Colour glowing golden.4—The throat centre. Sixteen petals. Colour silvery blue, the bluepredominating.5—The head centres . These are in a twofold division;—a—Between the eyebrows. Ninety-six petals. Colour, one-half of the lotus is roseand yellow, and the other half is blue and purple.b—The top of the head. There are twelve major petals of white and gold, and 960secondary petals are arranged around the central twelve. This makes a total of1068 petals in the two head centres, or 356 triplicities. All these figures havean occult significance.This description is taken from “The Inner Life.” This description applies to theetheric centres, which are themselves the working out into physical planemanifestation of corresponding vortices on the emotional plane, with emotionalvitality playing through. They have their mental counterparts, and in theirawakening as aforesaid, and in their growth and development, comes the finalvivification, and the resultant liberation.The connection between the centres, the causal body and meditation lies hid inthe following hint: it is through the rapid whirling and interaction of thesecentres and their increased force through meditation (the ordered occultmeditation) that the shattering of the causal body is effected. When the innerfire is circulating through each centre and when kundalini is spiralling [79]accurately and geometrically from vortex to vortex, the intensificationinteracts in three directions.a—It focuses the light or the consciousness of the Higher Self into the threelower vehicles, drawing it downward into fuller expression and widening itscontact on all the three planes in the three worlds.b—It draws down from the threefold Spirit more and more of the fire of theSpirit, doing for the causal body what the Ego is doing for the three lowervehicles.c—It forces the unification of the higher and lower, and it attracts thespiritual life itself. When this is done, when each successive life sees anincrease of vitality in the centres, and when kundalini in its seven-foldcapacity touches each centre, then even the causal body proves inadequate forthe influx of life from above. If I might so express it, the two fires meet, andeventually the egoic body disappears; the fire burns up entirely the Temple ofSolomon; the permanent atoms are destroyed, and all is reabsorbed into theTriad. The essence of the Personality, the faculties developed, the knowledgegained, and the remembrance of all that has transpired becomes part of theequipment of the Spirit and eventually finds its way to the Spirit or Monad onits own plane.Now let me enumerate for you the things as to which it will not be possible asyet to furnish more information; the risks involved would be too great.l—The method of arousing the Sacred Fire.2—The order of its progression.3—The geometrical forms it makes as it mounts.4—The order of the development of the centres. according to the ray of theSpirit. The complexity is too great. [80]You will therefore observe that the subject really becomes more abstruse, thelonger it is studied. It is complicated by ray development, by the man's ownplace upon the ladder of evolution, by the uneven awakening of the differentcentres due to the type of a man's lives; it is rendered more complex by thethreefold nature of the centres themselves,—etheric, emotional and mental—by thefact, that some people have one or other emotional centre completely awakenedand demonstrating etherically whilst the mental counterparts may be quiescent;others may have the mental centres awake and the emotional not so vivified andbe etherically quiet. Therefore, it will be obvious how great is the need forconscious clairvoyant teachers, who can judiciously work with the pupils,stimulating through scientific knowledge and methods the dormant or sluggishcentres, and aligning them so that the current can freely flow back and forthbetween the external vortices and the inner centre. Later the teacher can trainthe pupil in the safe awakening of the inner fire, in its scientific culture andtransmission, and instruct him in the order required for its convolutions alongthe path of the triangles until it reaches the head centres. When kundalini hastraversed these geometrical lines the man is perfected, the personality hasserved its purpose, and the goal is reached. Hence the fact that all the centreshave petals whose numbers are multiples of four, for four is the number of thelower self, of the quaternary. The total number of petals in the centres, if weeliminate the spleen which has a purpose all its own, and the three lower organsof creation, is one thousand, one hundred and ten, the total number signifyingthe perfection of the microcosm,—ten the number of perfected personality, onehundred the number of causal perfection, and one thousand the number ofspiritual [81] achievement. When every petal vibrates in all the dimensions,then the goal for this manvantara is reached. The lower lotus is full blown, andreflects the greater with precision.June 26, 1920.THE EFFECT OF OCCULT MEDITATION ON THE CENTRES.We shall study today the effect of occult meditation upon the centres and theirconsequent vivification, positing a meditation prefaced always by the use of theSacred Word, uttered according to rule.We speak also of a meditation followed under the guidance of a teacher. The mantherefore will meditate correctly or approximately so; thus what we are toconsider today is the factor of time , in its relationship to the centres, forthe work is slow and necessarily gradual. Here I would pause to emphasize to youthe need of ever remembering that in all work that is truly occult expectedeffects are very slowly achieved. Should a man seem in any one incarnation tomake spectacular progress it is due to the fact that he is but demonstratingwhat has already been earlier acquired (the manifesting forth of innate faculty,acquired in previous incarnations) and is preparing for a fresh period of slow,careful and painstaking endeavor. He recapitulates in the present life theprocesses surmounted in the past, and thus lays the foundation for renewedeffort. This slow and laborious effort, which is the consistent method of allthat evolves, is after all but an illusion of time and is due to the fact thatconsciousness is at present for the majority polarised in the lower vehicles andnot in the causal. The states of consciousness succeed each other apparentlyslowly, and in their slow progression lies the chance for the Ego to assimilatethe fruit of these stages. [82] It takes a long time to establish a stablevibration, and it takes as long to shatter it, and to impose another and stillhigher rhythm. Growth is one long period of building in order to destroy, ofconstructing in order to disorganise later, of developing certain rhythmicprocesses in order to later disrupt them, and to force the old rhythm to giveplace to the new. What the Personality spends many thousands of lives inestablishing is not going to be lightly altered when the Ego—working in thelower consciousness—seeks to effect a change. The shifting of polarisation fromemotional to mental, and thence to the causal and later to the three-fold Spiritinevitably entails a period of great difficulty, of violent conflict bothinternally and with the environment, intense suffering and apparent darkness anddisruption—all these things characterise the life of the aspirant or thedisciple. What causes this and why is this so? The following reasons may make itapparent why the path is so hard to tread and the process of mounting the ladder(as one nears the higher rungs) becomes ever more complicated and difficult.1—Each body has to be dealt with and disciplined separately and thus purified.2—Each body has to be readjusted and aligned.3—Each body has to be subjected to repolarisation.4—Each body is practically reconstructed.5—Each subplane above the fourth (for on the fourth the life of the aspirantstarts) has to be dominated.6—Each centre has to be gradually, carefully and scientifically awakened, itsrevolutions have to be intensified, its radiations electrified (if I may borrowthat term and apply it to the centres) and its force must demonstrate throughthe higher dimension. [83]7—Each etheric centre has to be magnetically linked, in full alignment, with thecorresponding centres in the emotional and mental bodies, so that the flow offorce is unimpeded.8—Each centre has then to be awakened afresh by the Sacred Fire till theradiations, the velocity and the colours are keyed to the egoic note. This ispart of the work of Initiation.As each change is gradually made, it responds to the same law that governs allcyclic growth in the macrocosm:l—First comes the clashing of the old with the new rhythm.2—This is followed by a period of gradual dominance of the new, elimination ofthe old, and the stabilisation of the new vibration.3—Then finally comes the passing on and out, and again a repetition of theprocess.It is this work that is done on the bodies and on the centres by the work ofmeditation and the use of the Sacred Word. This Word aids in the adjustment ofthe matter, its vitalisation by fire, and enables the aspirant to work in linewith the law. This unfoldment of the centres is a gradual process, parallelingthe work done on the bodies, the refining of the vehicles and the slowdevelopment of causal consciousness.Concluding remarks.In concluding this division upon the use of the Sacred Word in meditation, Iwould like to indicate certain things, though more than a hint is not possible.This matter has been difficult for you to comprehend, and I fully realise it.The difficulty lies in the fact that so little [84] can be safely said, that thereal use of the Word is one of the secrets of initiation and may not thereforebe divulged, and that what little can be indicated is of small value to thestudent apart from the wise attempt to experiment, which experiment must becarried on under the guidance of one who knows. Still, I will indicate certainthings which, wisely pondered upon, may lead to illumination.When meditating in the heart centre, picture it as a golden lotus closed . Whenthe Sacred Word is enunciated, picture it as a lotus slowly expanding until theinner centre or vortex is seen as a radiating whirlpool of electric light, moreblue than golden. Build there the picture of the Master, in etheric, emotionaland mental matter. This entails the withdrawing of the consciousness ever moreand more inwards. When the picture is fully built then gently sound the Wordagain, and with an effort of the will withdraw still further inwards and link upwith the twelve petalled head centre, the centre of causal consciousness. Do allthis very slowly and gradually, maintaining an attitude of perfect peace andcalm. There is a direct relationship between the two twelve petalled centres andoccult meditation, and the action of the kundalini fire will later reveal itssignificance. This visualization leads to synthesis, to causal development andexpansion, and eventually conducts a man into the presence of the Master.The solar plexus is the seat of the emotions and should not be centred upon inmeditation. It is a basis for physical healing and will later be more completelyunderstood. It is the centre of activity—an activity which must later beintuitional. The throat centre works radiantly when the polarisation is shiftingfrom the physical atom to the mental permanent atom as dealt with earlier. [85]The mental permanent atom becomes the centre of pure reason or of abstractthought. Then comes a time in the development of consciousness when theemotional force which governs so many is transcended and superseded by the forceof the higher intellect. It often marks a period when a man is swayed purely byreason and his emotions do not control him. This may demonstrate in the personallife on the physical plane as intellectual hardness. Later, the emotionalpermanent atom gives place to the intuitional, and pure intuition and perfectcomprehension through love is the motive power, with the faculty of reasonadded. Then the solar plexus is distinguished by the preponderance of the greenof activity, for the emotional body is actively the agent of the higher, andengenders but little of the rose of human desire.In the whirling of the force through the vortex (which whirling forms the petalsof the lotus) it will be observed that certain petals predominantly stand out,and each centre demonstrates one particular type of cross, with the exception ofthe two head centres which are the synthesis of the lower crosses. Thefour-armed cross of the third Logos is found at the base of the spine and thecross of the fourth human Hierarchy in the heart.When the Sacred Word is intoned by the average aspirant, it carries forcethrough all the inner centres to the etheric, and causes a definite stimulationof the petals in each centre. If the lotus is only partially unfolded, then onlysome of the petals receive the stimulation. This stimulation creates a vibration(especially in the centre in which a man meditates—the head or the heart) whichcauses reflex action in the spine and down to the base. This is not in itselfsufficient to arouse the fire; that can only be done in due form, in the rightkey and subject to certain rules.[86] When meditation is done in the heart and under occult laws, with thecorrect intoning of the Word, the force comes through the emotional centres fromthe intuitional levels. When it is done in the head, the force comes through themental centres from the abstract manasic levels, and later from the atmic. Theone gives spiritual intuition, and the other causal consciousness.The advanced man is the man who is linking up the two major centres,—the headand the heart,—into one, synthetic instrument, and whose throat centre vibratesto the same measure. Then you have will and love blended in harmonious service,and the lower physical activity is transmuted into idealism and altruism. Whenthis stage is reached, the man is ready for the awakening of the inner fire. Hisbodies are refined enough to withstand the pressure and the onrush; they containnothing dangerous to its progress; the centres are keyed high enough to receivethe acquisition of fresh stimulation. When this has been done, the hour ofinitiation comes when the would-be server of humanity will stand before hisLord, with purified desire, consecrated intellect, and a physical body that ishis servant and not his master.Today we will bring this letter to a close. Tomorrow, we will take up thedangers that confront the man who meditates. I shall seek to point out what hemust guard against and wherein he must move with caution."},{"pageContent":"LETTER V - DANGERS TO BE AVOIDED IN MEDITATION.July 22, 1920.The Withholding of Information.[88] We have reached a point now where the foundations of knowledge have beenlaid,—that knowledge which instills into the wise student the desire to submitto the necessary rules, to conform to the prescribed requirements, and to makethe comprehended mental concepts practical experiences in daily life. Thisdesire is wise and right, and the object of all that has been imparted, but atthis juncture it may be wise to sound a warning note, to point out certaindangerous possibilities, and to put the student on his guard against anenthusiasm that may lead him along paths that will hinder development, and thatmay build up vibrations that will ultimately have to be offset. This entailsdelay and a recapitulation in work that (if realised in time) might be obviated.Certain statements and instructions cannot be made or given in writing tostudents for three reasons:—l—Some instructions are always given orally, as they appeal to the intuition andare not for the pondering and logical reasoning of lower mind; they also containelements of danger if submitted to the unready.2—Some instructions pertain to the secrets of the Path, and are mainlyapplicable to the groups to which the student is attached; they can only begiven in joint instruction when out of the physical body. They pertain to thegroup causal body, to certain ray secrets, and to the invoking of the assistanceof the higher devas to bring [89] about desired results. The dangers attachedthereto are too great to permit of their being communicated in an exotericpublication. The occult effects of the spoken word and of the written word arediverse and interesting. Until such time as you have among you a wise Teacher inphysical person, and until it is possible for Him to gather around Him Hisstudents, thus affording them the protection of His aura and its stimulatingvibration, and until such time as world conditions permit of a certain period ofrelaxation from the present strain and suspense, it will not be possible toimpart forms, invocations and mantrams of a specific character; it will not bepossible to arouse the centres ahead of the necessary evolutionary rate, exceptin a few individual cases where certain pupils (perhaps unconsciously tothemselves) are being subjected to definite processes, which result in a greatlyincreased rate of vibration. This is only being done to a few in each country,and is directly under the eye of a Master, focusing through H.P.B.3—Information as to the invoking of devas in meditation cannot yet be safelygiven to individuals, though a beginning is being made with groups such as inthe rituals of the Masons and of the Church. Formulas that put the lesser devasunder the control of man will not yet he imparted. Human beings are not yet tobe trusted with that power, for the majority are but animated by selfish desireand would misuse it for their own ends. It is deemed by the wise Teachers of therace,—as I think I have before said—that the dangers of too little knowledge aremuch less than the dangers of too much, and that the race can be more seriouslyhindered by the misapplication of powers gained by incipient occultists than itcan by a lack of knowledge that engenders not karmic results. The powers gainedin meditation, the [90] capacities achieved by the adjustment of the bodiesthrough meditation, the faculties developed in each vehicle by definite formulasin meditation, the manipulation of matter that is one of the functions of theoccultist (the result of well-adjusted vehicles that respond perfectly to planeconditions) and the attainment of causal consciousness—a consciousness thatcarries with it the ability to include within itself all the lesser—are of tooserious a character to be lightly disposed of, and in the training of man alongthese lines only those are encouraged by the teacher who can be trusted. Trustedin what sense? Trusted to think in group terms and not in terms of self, trustedto use the knowledge gained anent the bodies and the karma of environingassociates solely for their wise assistance and not for selfish purposes, andtrusted to use occult powers for the furtherance of evolution and for thedevelopment on all planes of the schemes of evolution as planned by the threeGreat Lords.Let me illustrate:—One of the things accomplished in meditation when pursued with regularity andunder correct instruction is the transference of the consciousness of the lowerself into the higher. This carries with it the capacity to see on causal levels,intuitively to recognize facts in the lives of others, to foresee events andoccurrences and to know the relative value of a personality. This can only bepermitted when the student can be silent, selfless and stable. Who as yetanswers to all these requirements?I am endeavoring to give you a general idea of the dangers incident to the tooearly development of the powers achieved in meditation. I seek to sound anote—not of discouragement—but of insistence upon physical purity, on emotionalstability and on mental equilibrium before the student passes on to greaterknowledge. Only [91] as the channel opens to the intuition and closes to theanimal nature can a man wisely proceed with his work. Only as the heart enlargesits capacity to suffer with all that breathes, to love all that is contacted,and to understand and sympathise with the least desirable of God's creatures,can the work go forward as desired. Only when the development is equable, onlywhen the intellect runs not too far ahead of the heart, and the mental vibrationshuts not out the higher one of the Spirit can the student be trusted to acquirepowers that, wrongly used, may result in disaster to his environment as well asto himself. Only as he formulates no thoughts save such as he purposes to makefor the helping of the world can he be trusted wisely to manipulate thoughtmatter. Only as he has no desire save to find out the plans of the Master, andthen to assist definitely in making those plans facts in manifestation, can hebe trusted with the formulas that will bring the devas of lesser degree underhis control. The dangers are so great and the perils that beset the unwarystudent so many that before I proceed further I have sought to urge caution.Let us now specify and enumerate certain dangers that must be guarded against bythe man who progresses in meditation. Some of them are due to one cause and someto another, and we shall have to specify with accuracy.l—Dangers inherent in the Personality of the pupil. They can, as you foresee, begrouped under the three heads:—physical dangers, emotional dangers, and mentaldangers.2—Dangers arising from the karma of the pupil , and from his environment. Thesealso may be enumerated under three divisions: [92]a—The karma of his present life, his own individual “ring-pass-not,” asrepresented by his present life.b—His national heredity and instincts as, for instance, whether he possesses anoccidental or an oriental type of body.c—His group affiliations, whether exoteric or esoteric.3—Dangers arising from the subtle forces that you ignorantly call evil; suchdangers consist in attack on the pupil by extraneous entities on some one plane.These entities may simply be discarnate human beings; they may be the denizensof the other planes who are nonhuman; later on, when the student is ofsufficient importance to attract notice, the attack may come from those who dealpurely with matter to the hindrance of spiritual growth,—the black magicians,the dark brothers, and other forces that appear destructive. This appearance isonly such when viewed from the angle of time and in our three worlds, and is butincidental to the fact that our Logos Himself is also evolving, and (from thestandpoint of the infinitely greater Ones Who assist Him in His development) itis dependent upon His transitory imperfections. The imperfections of nature—aswe term them—are the imperfections of the Logos, and will eventually betranscended.I have therefore outlined for you this morning the material I shall seek toimpart during the coming days.July 24, 1920.The dangers that beset the student of meditation are dependent upon manyfactors, and it will not be possible to do more than briefly indicate certainmenacing conditions, to warn against certain disastrous possibilities, and tocaution the pupil against results that are to be [93] reached by undue strain,by over-excess of zeal, and by a one-pointedness that may lead to an unbalanceddevelopment. One-pointedness is a virtue, but it should be the one-pointednessof purpose and of aim, and not that which develops one sole line of method tothe exclusion of all others.The dangers of meditation are largely the dangers of our virtues, and thereinlies much of the difficulty. They are largely the dangers of a fine mentalconcept that runs ahead of the capacity of the lower vehicles, especially of thedense physical. Aspiration, concentration and determination are necessaryvirtues, but if used without discrimination and without a sense of time inevolution they may lead to a shattering of the physical vehicle that will delayall progress for some one particular life. Have I made my point clear? I seekbut to bring out the absolute necessity for the occult student to have a virilecommon sense for one of his basic qualities, coupled with a happy sense ofproportion that leads to due caution and an approximation of the necessarymethod to the immediate need. To the man therefore who undertakes wholeheartedlythe process of occult meditation I would say with all conciseness:—a—Know thyself.b—Proceed slowly and with caution.c—Study effects.d—Cultivate the realisation that eternity is long and that that which is slowlybuilt up endures forever.e—Aim at regularity.f—Realise always that the true spiritual effects are to be seen in the exotericlife of service.g—Remember likewise that psychic phenomena are no indication of a successfulfollowing of meditation. The world will see the effects and be a better [94]judge than the student himself. Above all, the Master will know, for the resultson causal levels will be apparent to Him long before the man himself isconscious of any progress.Let us now take up these points in detail.1 - DANGERS INHERENT IN THE PERSONALITY.Let us, therefore, consider first those dangers most closely connected with theman's own personal life, and which are dependent upon his three bodies, theirseparate condition and their interrelation. This subject is so vast that it willnot be possible to do more than indicate certain results due to certainconditions; each man presents a different problem, and each body causes adifferent reaction, and each totality in his threefold nature is affected by itsalignment or by its lack of alignment. Let us take each body separately at firstand then in their threefold totality. In this way some specific facts may beimparted.I begin with the mental body as it is for the student of meditation the one thatis the centre of his effort and the one that controls the two lower bodies. Thetrue student seeks to draw his consciousness away from his physical body, andaway from the emotional body into the realms of thought, or into the lower mindbody. Having achieved that much, he seeks then to transcend that lower mind andto become polarised in the causal body, using the antahkarana, as the channel ofcommunication between the higher and the lower, the physical brain being thenbut the quiescent receiver of that which is transmitted from the Ego or HigherSelf and later from the threefold Spirit, the Triad. The work to be donenecessitates a working from the periphery inwards, and a consequentcentralisation. Having achieved that [95] centralisation and focussed in thatstable centre—with the solar plexus and the heart quiet—a point within the head,one of the three major head centres, becomes the centre of consciousness, theray of a man's ego deciding which that centre will be. This is the method of themajority. Then that point having been reached, a man will follow the meditationof his ray as indicated to you in general terms earlier in these letters. Ineach case, the mental body becomes the centre of consciousness and thenlater—through practice—it becomes the point of departure for the transference ofthe polarisation into a higher body, first the causal and later into the Triad.The dangers to the mental body are very real and must be guarded against. Theyare paramountly two, and might be termed the dangers of inhibition and those dueto the atrophying of the body.a—Let us take first the dangers due to inhibition. Some people, by their sheerstrength of will, reach a point in meditation where they directly inhibit theprocesses of the lower mind. If you picture the mental body as an ovoid,surrounding the physical body and extending much beyond it, and if you realisethat through that ovoid are constantly circulating thoughtforms of various kinds(the content of the man's mind and the thoughts of his environing associates) sothat the mental egg is coloured by predominant attractions and diversified bymany geometrical forms, all in a state of flux or circulation, you may get someidea of what I mean. When a man proceeds to quiet that mental body by inhibitingor suppressing all movement, he will arrest these thoughtforms within the mentalovoid, he will stop circulation and may bring about results of a serious nature.This inhibition has a direct effect upon the physical brain, and is the cause ofmuch of the fatigue complained of after a period [96] of meditation. Ifpersisted in, it may lead to disaster. All beginners do it more or less, anduntil they learn to guard against it they will stultify their progress andretard development. The results may indeed be more serious.What are the right methods of thought elimination? How can placidity of mind beachieved without the use of the will in inhibition? The following suggestionsmay be found useful and helpful:—The student having withdrawn his consciousness on to the mental plane at somepoint within the brain, let him sound forth the Sacred Word gently three times.Let him picture the breath sent forth as a clarifying, expurgating force that inits progress onward sweeps away the thoughtforms circulating within the mentalovoid. Let him then at the close realise that the mental body is free and clearof thoughtforms.Let him then raise his vibration as high as may be, and aim next at lifting itclear of the mental body into the causal, and so bring in the direct action ofthe Ego upon the lower three vehicles. As long as he can keep his consciousnesshigh and as long as he holds a vibration that is that of the Ego on its ownplane, the mental body will be held in a state of equilibrium. It will hold nolower vibration analogous to the thoughtforms circulating in its environment.The force of the Ego will circulate throughout the mental ovoid, permitting noextraneous geometrical units to find entrance, and the dangers of inhibitionwill be offset. Even more will be done,—the mental matter will in process oftime become so attuned to the higher vibration that in due course that vibrationwill become stable and will automatically throw off all that is lower andundesirable.b—What do I mean by the dangers of atrophy? [97] Simply this: Some naturesbecome so polarised on the mental plane that they run the risk of breakingconnection with the two lower vehicles. These lower bodies exist for purposes ofcontact, for the apprehension of knowledge on the lower planes and for reasonsof experience in order that the content of the causal body may be increased.Therefore it will be apparent to you that if the indwelling consciousness comesno lower than the mental plane and neglects the body of emotions and the densephysical, two things will result. The lower vehicles will be neglected anduseless and fail in their purposes, atrophying and dying from the point of viewof the Ego, whilst the causal body itself will not be built as desired and sotime will be lost. The mental body will be rendered useless likewise, and willbecome a thing of selfish content, of no use in the world and of littler value.A dreamer whose dreams never materialise, a builder who stores up material whichhe never employs, a visionary whose visions are of no use to gods or men, is aclog upon the system universal. He is in great danger of atrophying.Meditation should have the effect of bringing all three bodies more completelyunder the control of the Ego, and lead to a co-ordination and an alignment, to arounding-out and a symmetrical development that will make a man of real use tothe Great Ones. When a man realises that mayhap he is too much centralised onthe mental plane he should definitely aim at making all his mental experiences,aspirations and endeavours matters of fact on the physical plane, bringing thetwo lower vehicles under control of the mental and making them the instrumentsof his mental creations and activities.I have here indicated two of the dangers most frequently met with, and I adviseall students of occultism [98] to remember that all the three bodies are ofequal importance in carrying out the work to be done, both from the egoicstandpoint and from the standpoint of service to the race. Let them aim at awise co-ordination in expression, that will enable the God within to manifestfor the aiding of the world.July 25, 1920.The emotional body is at this time the most important body in the Personalityfor several reasons. It is a complete unit, unlike the physical and mentalbodies; it is the centre of polarisation for the majority of the human family;it is the most difficult body to control, and is practically the very last bodyto be completely subjugated. The reason for this is that the vibration of desirehas dominated, not only the human kingdom but also the animal and vegetablekingdoms in a lesser sense, so that the evolving inner man has to work againstinclinations set up in these kingdoms. Before the spirit can function throughforms of the fifth or spiritual kingdom, this desire vibration has to heeliminated, and selfish inclination transmuted into spiritual aspiration. Theemotional body forms practically a unit with the physical body, for the averageman functions almost entirely at the instigation of the emotional,—his lowestvehicle automatically obeying the behests of a higher. It is also the body thatconnects most directly, as has been oft-times said, with the intuitional levels,and one path of attainment lies that way. In meditation the emotional bodyshould be controlled from the mental plane, and when the polarisation has beentransferred into the mental body through forms of meditation and intensity ofpurpose and of will, then the emotional becomes quiescent and receptive. [99]This negative attitude in itself, if carried too far, opens the door to seriousdangers, which I will later enlarge upon when we take up the subject ofobsessions, divine sometimes, but more oft the reverse. A negative condition isnot desired in either of the bodies, and it is just this very negativeness thatbeginners in meditation so oft achieve, and so run into danger. The aim shouldbe to make the emotional ovoid positive to all that is lower and to itsenvironment and only receptive to the Spirit via the causal. This can only bebrought about by the development of the faculty of conscious control —thatcontrol which even in the moments of highest vibration and contact is alert towatch and guard the lower vehicles. “Watch and pray,” the Great Lord said whenlast on earth, and He spoke in occult terms, that have not as yet received dueattention or interpretation.What must therefore be watched?l—The attitude of the emotional ovoid and its positive-negative control.2—The stability of the emotional matter and its conscious receptivity.3—Its alignment with the mental and with the causal bodies. If this alignment isimperfect (as it so frequently is) it causes inaccuracy in reception from thehigher planes, distortion of the truths sent down via the Ego, and a verydangerous transference of force to undesirable centres. This lack of alignmentis the cause of the frequent straying from sexual purity of many apparentlyspiritually inclined persons. They can touch the intuitional levels somewhat,the Ego can partially transmit power from on high, but as the alignment isimperfect the force from those higher levels is deflected, the wrong centres areover-stimulated, and disaster results.4—Another danger to be guarded against is that of [100] obsession, but in purethoughts, spiritual aims, and unselfish brotherly conduct, lie the fundamentalsof protection. If to these essentials is added common sense in meditation and awise application of occult rules, with due consideration of ray and karma, thesedangers will disappear.July 28, 1920.Some thoughts on FIRE.Just prior to beginning the consideration of the matter on hand, I would like topoint out to you a certain rather interesting fact. Most of the psychologicalphenomena of the earth are—as you will realise, if you think clearly,—under thecontrol of the Deva Lord Agni, the great primary Lord of Fire, the Ruler of themental plane. Cosmic fire forms the background of our evolution; the fire of themental plane, its inner control and dominance and its purifying asset coupled toits refining effects, is the aim of the evolution of our three-fold life. Whenthe inner fire of the mental plane and the fire latent in the lower vehiclesmerge with the sacred fire of the Triad the work is completed, and the manstands adept. The at-one-ment has been made and the work of aeons is completed.All this is brought about through the co-operation of the Lord Agni, and thehigh devas of the mental plane working with the Ruler of that plane, and withthe Raja-Lord of the second plane.Macrocosmic evolution proceeds in like manner to the microcosmic. The internalfires of the terrestrial globe, deep in the heart of our earth sphere, willmerge with the sacred fire of the sun at the end of the greater cycle, and thesolar system will then have reached its apotheosis. Little by little as theaeons slip away and the lesser cycles run their course, fire will permeate theethers and will be daily more recognisable and controlled till eventually [101]cosmic and terrestrial fire will be at-one (the bodies of all material formsadapting themselves to the changing conditions) and the correspondence will bedemonstrated. When this is realised the phenomena of the earth—such as, forinstance, seismic disturbance—can be studied with greater interest. Later, whenmore is comprehended, the effects of such disturbances will be understood andlikewise their reactions on the sons of men. During the summer months—as thatgreat cycle comes around in different quarters of the earth—the fire devas, thefire elementals and those obscure entities the “agnichaitans” of the internalfurnaces, come into greater activity, relapsing as the sun moves further away,into a less active condition. You have here a correspondence between the fieryaspects of the earth economy in their relationship to the sun similar to thewatery aspects and their connection with the moon. I give you quite an occulthint here. I would like also to give you here a very brief though occultfragment that...may now he made public. If pondered on, it carries the studentto a high plane and stimulates vibration.“The secret of the Fire lies hid in the second letter of the sacred Word. Themystery of life is concealed within the heart. When that lower point vibrates,when the Sacred Triangle glows, when the point, the middle centre, and the apexlikewise burn, then the two triangles—the greater and the lesser—merge into oneflame which burneth up the whole.”It is our task now to deal briefly with the dangers that attend the practice ofmeditation as they manifest in the physical body. These dangers—like so muchelse in the Logoic scheme—assume a three-fold nature, attacking [102] threedepartments of the physical body. They show themselves:a—In the brain.b—In the nervous system.c—In the sex organs.It is needless to point out now the reason why I dealt first with the dangers ofthe mental and emotional bodies. It was necessary so to do, for many of theperils besetting the dense vehicle find their commencement on the subtlerplanes, and are only the outer manifestations of inner evils.Each human being enters into life equipped with a physical and etheric body ofcertain constituents, those constituents being the product of a previousincarnation; they are virtually the body, reproduced exactly, that the manfinally left behind him when death severed him from physical plane existence.The task ahead of everybody is to take that body, realise its defects andrequirements, and then deliberately set in and build a new body that may provemore adequate to the need of the inner spirit. This is a task of largedimensions and involves time, stern discipline, self-denial and judgment.The man who undertakes the practice of occult meditation literally “plays withfire.” I wish you to emphasise this statement for it embodies a truth littlerealised. “Playing with fire” is an old truth that has lost its significancethrough flippant repetition, yet it is absolutely and entirely correct, and isnot a symbolic teaching but a plain statement of fact. Fire forms the basis ofall—the Self is fire, the intellect is a phase of fire, and latent in themicrocosmic physical vehicles lies hid a veritable fire that can either be adestructive force, burning the tissue of the body and stimulating centres of anundesirable character, or be a vivifying factor, acting as a [103] stimulatingand awakening agent. When directed along certain prepared channels, this firemay act as a purifier and the great connector between the lower and the HigherSelf.In meditation the student seeks to contact the divine flame that is his HigherSelf, and to put himself likewise en rapport with the fire of the mental plane.When meditation is forced, or is pursued too violently, before the alignmentbetween the higher and lower bodies via the emotional is completed, this firemay act on the fire latent at the base of the spine (that fire called kundalini)and may cause it to circulate too early. This will produce disruption anddestruction instead of vivification and stimulation of the higher centres. Thereis a proper geometrical spiralling which this fire should follow, dependent uponthe ray of the student and the key of the vibration of his higher centres. Thisfire should only be permitted to circulate under the direct instruction of theMaster and consciously distributed by the student himself, following thespecific oral instructions of the teacher. Sometimes the fire may be aroused andspiral with correctness without the student knowing what is occurring on thephysical plane; but on the inner planes he knows and has but failed to bring theknowledge through to the physical plane consciousness.Let us take up for a moment the three dangers that principally beset thephysical vehicles. I would like to point out that I deal with the trouble in itsextreme, and that there are many intermediate stages of risk and trouble thatattack the unwary student.Dangers to the physical brain.The brain suffers principally in two ways:—From congestion, causing a suffusion of the blood [104] vessels and a consequentstrain upon the delicate brain tissue. This may result in permanent injury, andmay even cause imbecility. It shows in the initial stages as numbness andfatigue, and if the student persists in meditation when these conditions aresensed the result will be serious. At all times a student should guard againstcontinuing his meditation when any fatigue is felt, and should stop at the firstindications of trouble. All these dangers can be guarded against by the use ofcommon-sense, and by remembering that the body must ever be trained graduallyand be built slowly. In the scheme of the Great Ones, hurry has no place.From insanity. This evil has often been seen in earnest students who persist inunwise pressure or seek unguardedly to arouse the sacred fire through breathingexercises and similar practices; they pay the price of their rashness throughthe loss of their reason. The fire does not proceed in due geometrical form, thenecessary triangles are not made, and the electrical fluid rushes with everincreasing speed and heat upwards, and literally burns away all or part of thebrain tissue, thus bringing about insanity and sometimes death.When these things are more widely comprehended and openly acknowledged, doctorsand brain specialists will study with greater care and accuracy the electricalcondition of the spinal column, and correlate its condition with that of thebrain. Good results will thus be achieved.Dangers to the nervous system.The troubles connected with the nervous system are more frequent than thoseattacking the brain, such as insanity and disruption of the brain tissue. Almostall who undertake meditation are conscious of an effect in [105] the nervoussystem; sometimes it takes the form of sleeplessness, of excitability, of astrained energy and restlessness that permit of no relaxation; of anirritability that has been foreign perhaps to the disposition until meditationwas pursued; of a nervous reaction—such as a twitching of the limbs, the fingersor the eyes—of depression or a lowering of the vitality, and of many individualmodes of showing tension and nervousness, differing according to nature andtemperament. This display of nervousness may be either severe or slight, but Iseek earnestly to point out it is quite needless, provided the student adheresto the rules of common-sense , that he studies wisely his own temperament, andthat he does not blindly proceed with forms and methods but insists on knowingthe raison d'etre of instituted action. If occult students disciplined the lifemore wisely, if they studied the food problem more carefully, if they took theneeded hours of sleep with more determination, and if they worked with cautiousslowness and not so much from impulse (no matter how high the aspiration)greater results would be seen and the Great Ones would have more efficienthelpers in the work of serving the world.It is not my purpose in these letters to take up specifically the diseases ofthe brain and of the nervous system. I only desire to give general indicationsand warnings and (for your encouragement) to point out that later when the wiseTeachers move among men and openly teach in specific schools, many forms ofbrain trouble and of nervous complaints will be cured through meditation wiselyadjusted to the individual need. Proper meditations will be set to stimulatequiescent centres, to turn the inner fire to proper channels, to distribute thedivine heat in equable arrangement, to build in tissue [106] and to heal. Thetime for this is not yet, though it lies not so far ahead as you might imagine.Dangers to the sex organs.The danger of the over-stimulation of these organs is well recognisedtheoretically, and I do not purpose to enlarge on it greatly today. I but seekto point out that this danger is very real. The reason is that in theoverstimulation of these centres the inner fire is but following the line ofleast resistance, owing to the polarisation of the race as a whole. The work,therefore, that the student has to do is twofold:—a—He has to withdraw his consciousness from those centres; this is no easy taskfor it means working against the results of age-long development.b—He has to direct the attention of the creative impulse to the mental plane. Inso doing, if successful, he will turn the activity of the divine fire to thethroat centre and its corresponding head centre, instead of to the lower organsof generation. Therefore, it will be apparent to you why—unless a man is veryadvanced—it is not wise to spend much time in meditation during the earlieryears. There was wisdom in the old Brahmanical rule that a man must give hisearly years to household endeavour, and only when he had fulfilled his functionas a man could he go on to the life of the devotee. This was the rule for theaverage. With advanced egos, pupils and disciples, it is not so, and each mustthen work out his own individual problem.July 29, 1920.2 - DANGERS ARISING FROM THE KARMA OF THE STUDENT.These as you know may he grouped under three heads, as follows: [107]l—Those incidental to the karma of his present life.2—Those based on his national heredity and his type of body.3—Those attendant on his group affiliations, whether on the physical plane andso exoteric, or on the subtle planes and so esoteric.Just what do you mean by the “karma of the student?” We use words lightly, and Ipresume that the thoughtless reply would be that the student's karma is theinevitable happenings of the present or the future that he cannot evade. This issomewhat right, but is only one aspect of the whole. Let us look at the matterfirst in a large manner, for oft in the just apprehension of big outlines comescomprehension of the small.When our Logos founded the solar system He drew within the circle ofmanifestation matter sufficient for His project, and material adequate for theobject He had in view. He had not all possible objects in view for this onesolar system: he had some specific aim that necessitated some specific vibrationand required therefore certain differentiated material. This circle that we termthe systemic or solar “ring-pass-not” bounds all that transpires within oursystem, and contains within its bounds our dual manifestation. All within thatring vibrates to a certain key-measure, and conforms to certain rules with theaim in view of the achievement of a particular goal, and the attainment of acertain end, known in its entirety only to the Logos Himself. All within thatcircle is subject to specific rules and governed by a certain key measure, andmight be regarded as being subject to the karma of that sevenfold periodicexistence, and actuated by causes dating back prior to the ringing of thatcircle, thus linking our system to its forerunner and affiliating it with thatwhich will come [108] after. Not an isolated unit are we, but part of a greaterwhole, governed in our totality by cosmic law and working out (as a whole)certain definite aims.Microcosmic purpose.So it is with the Microcosm. The Ego on his own plane and on a tiny scale,repeats the action of the Logos. For certain ends he builds a certain form; hegathers certain material, and aims at a definite consummation that shall be theresult of that gathered material vibrating to a certain measure, governed in onespecific life by certain rules and aiming at some one particular object,—not allpossible objects.Each Personality is to the Ego what the solar system is to the Logos. It is hisfield of manifestation and the method whereby he attains a demonstrable object.That aim may be the acquirement of virtue by paying the price of vice; it may bethe attainment of business acumen by the struggle to provide the necessities oflife; it may be the development of sensitiveness by the revealing cruelties ofnature; it may be the building in of unselfish devotion by the appeal of needydependents; or it may be the transmutation of desire by the method of meditationon the path. It is for each soul to find out. What I want to impress upon you isthe fact that there is a certain danger incident to this very factor. If, forinstance, in the acquirement of the mental capacity to meditate, the studentmisses the very thing he came into the physical body to acquire, the result isnot so much a gain as an unequal development and a temporary loss of time.Let us be specific and illustrate:—An Ego has formed his three-fold body ofmanifestation and set his ring-pass-not with the purpose in view of buildinginto his [109] causal body the faculty of “mental apprehension of the basicfacts of life.” The object of that one incarnation is to develop the mentalcapacity of the student; to teach him concrete facts and science and thus toenlarge the content of his mental body, with a view to future work. He may beover-developed on the heart side, too much of the devotee; he may have spentmany lives in dreaming dreams and in seeing visions and in mystic meditation. Tobe practical, full of common sense, to know the curriculum of the Hall ofLearning and to apply practically the knowledge learnt on the physical plane ishis great need. Yet, even though his ring-pass-not seems to proscribe and limithis inherent tendencies, and even though the stage is set so that it would seemhe must learn the lessons of practical living in the world, he learns not, butfollows what is to him the line of least resistance. He dreams his dreams, andstays aloof from world affairs; he does not fulfil the desire of the Ego, butmisses opportunity; he suffers much, and in the next life is necessitated asimilar staging and a stronger urge, and a closer ring-pass-not until hecomplies with the will of his Ego.For such an one, meditation helps not, but mainly hinders. As before I havesaid, meditation (to be wisely undertaken) is for those who have reached a pointin evolution where the rounding out of the causal body is somewhat matured andwhere the student is in one of the final grades in the Hall of Learning. Youneed to remember that I refer not here to the mystic meditation but to thescientifically occult meditation. The dangers are, therefore, practically thoseof wasted time, of an intensification of a vibration out of ill proportion tothe key of the other vibrations, and of an unequal rounding out and a lop-sidedbuilding that will necessitate reconstructing in other lives. [110]July 30, 1920.Dangers based on national heredity and type of body....As you may well imagine it is not my purpose to enlarge upon the dangersincidental to a defective body, save in general terms to lay down the rulingthat where there is definite disease, congenital trouble or mental weakness ofany kind, meditation is not the part of discretion, but may serve but tointensify the trouble. I wish specifically to point out for the guidance offuture students and as a prophetic statement, that in days to come when thescience of meditation is more comprehended, two factors will be wisely weighedand considered before assigning a meditation. These factors are:a—The man's subrace characteristics.b—His type of body, whether it is oriental or occidental.In this way, certain disasters will be avoided and certain troubles obviatedthat are now found in a more or less degree in every occult group.It is generally recognised that each race has for its predominant feature someone outstanding quality of the emotional body. This is the general rule. Incontrasting the Italian and the Teutonic racial differences, those differencesare summed up in our minds in terms of the emotional body. We think of theItalian as fiery, romantic, unstable and brilliant; we think of the Teuton asphlegmatic, matter-of-fact, sentimental and stolidly, logically clever. It will,therefore, be apparent to you that these different temperaments carry with themtheir own dangers, and that in the unwise pursuit of unsuitable meditations,virtues could be emphasised till they approximated vices, temperamentalweaknesses could be intensified till they became menaces, and consequently [111]lack of balance would result instead of that attainment of equilibrium and thatfine rounding out of the causal body which is one of the aims in view. When,therefore, the wise Teacher moves among men and Himself apportions meditation,these racial differences will be weighed and their inherent defects will beoffset and not intensified. Over-development and disproportionate attainmentwill be obviated by the equalising effects of occult meditation.Meditation as followed now and as followed in Atlantean days differsfundamentally. In the fourth root race an effort was made to facilitateattainment via the atomic subplane, from the emotional plane to the intuitional,to the practical exclusion of the mental. It followed the line of the emotionsand had a definite effect on the emotional body. It worked upwards from theemotional instead of, as now, working on mental levels and from those levelsmaking the effort to control the two lower. In the Aryan root-race, the attemptis being made to bridge the gap between the higher and the lower and, bycentering the consciousness in the lower mind and later in the causal, to tapthe higher until the downflow from that higher will be continuous. With most ofthe advanced students at present all that is felt is occasional rushes ofillumination, but later will be felt a steady irradiation. Both methods carrytheir own dangers. In Atlantean days, meditation tended to overstimulation ofthe emotions and although men touched great heights, yet they also touched greatdepths. Sex magic was unbelievably rampant. The solar plexus was apt to be overvivified, the triangles were not correctly followed, and the lower centres werecaught in the reaction of the fire with dire results.The dangers now are different. The development of [112] mind carries with it thedangers of selfishness, of pride, of blind forgetfulness of the higher that itis the aim of the present method to offset. If the adepts of the dark pathattained great powers in Atlantean days they are still more dangerous now. Theircontrol is much more widespread. Hence the emphasis laid on service, and on thesteadying of the mind as an essential in the man who seeks to progress and tobecome a member of the Brotherhood of Light.The matter I now seek to give some instruction upon is one of very realimportance to all earnest students at this time. The orient is to the evolvingrace of men what the heart is to the human body; it is the source of light, oflife, of heat, and of vitality. The occident is to the race what the brain ormental activity is to the body,—the directing organising factor, the instrumentof the lower mind, the accumulator of facts. The difference in the entire,“make-up” (as you term it) of the oriental and of the European or American is sogreat and so well recognised that it is mayhap needless for me to dwell upon it.The oriental is philosophical, naturally dreamy, trained through centuries tothink in abstract terms, fond of obstruse dialectics, temperamentally lethargic,and climatically slow. Ages of metaphysical thinking, of vegetarian living, ofclimatic inertia and of a rigid adherence to forms and to the strictest rules ofliving have produced a product the exact opposite of his occidental brother.The occidental is practical, businesslike, dynamic, quick in action, a slave toorganization (which is after all but another form of ceremonial), actuated by avery concrete mind, acquisitive, critical, and at his best when affairs movequickly and rapid mental decision is required. He detests abstract thought yetappreciates it when apprehended, and when he can make those thoughts [113] factson the physical plane. He uses his head more than his heart centre, and histhroat centre is apt to be vitalised. The oriental uses his heart centre morethan the head and necessarily the corresponding head centres. The centre at thetop of the spine at the base of the skull functions more actively than thethroat.The oriental progresses by the withdrawing of the centre of consciousness to thehead through strenuous meditation. That is the centre that he needs to master,he learns by the wise use of mantrams, by retiring into seclusion, by isolationand by the careful following of specific forms for many hours each day for manydays.The occidental has in view the withdrawal of his consciousness to the heart atfirst, for already he works so much with the head centres. He works more by theuse of collective forms and not individual mantrams; he does not work so much inisolation as his oriental brother, but has to find his centre of consciousnesseven in the noise and whirl of business life and in the throngs of great cities.He employs collective forms for the attainment of his ends, and the awakening ofthe heart centre shows itself in service. Hence the emphasis laid in theOccident on the heart meditation and the subsequent life of service.You will see, therefore, that when the real occult work is begun, the method maydiffer—and will necessarily differ—in the east and in the west, but the goalwill be the same. It must be borne in mind, for instance, that a meditation thatwould aid the development of an oriental, might bring danger and disaster to hiswestern brother. The reverse would also be the case. But always the goal will bethe same. Forms may be individual or collective, mantrams may be chanted byunits or by groups, different centres may be the object of specialisedattention, yet [114] the results will be identical. Danger arises when theoccidental bases his endeavour on rules that suffice for the oriental, as has attimes been so wisely pointed out. In the wisdom of the Great Ones this danger isbeing offset. Different methods for different races, diverse forms for those ofvarious nationalities, but the same wise guides on the inner planes, the samegreat Hall of Wisdom, the same Gate of Initiation, admitting all into the innersanctuary....In concluding this subject, I seek to give a hint:—The seventh Ray of CeremonialLaw or Order (the ray now coming into power) provides for the occidental whathas long been the privilege of the oriental. Great is the day of opportunity,and in the sweeping onward of this seventh force comes the needed impetus thatmay—if rightly grasped—drive to the Feet of the Lord of the World the dweller inthe occident.August 2, 1920.Dangers attendant on group affiliations.Very briefly would I seek this morning to take up the question of the dangersinvolved in meditation that are incidental to a man's group affiliations,whether exoteric or esoteric. There is not much that can be said on thisparticular matter, save broad indications. Each of these various subjects that Ihave touched upon might warrant the writing of a weighty treatise, and I shallnot, therefore, attempt to cover what might be said but only point out certainaspects of the matter that will (if pondered on with care) open up to theearnest seeker after truth many avenues of knowledge. All occult training hasthis in view,—to give to the pupil some seed thought which (when brooded over inthe silence of his own heart) [115] will produce much fruit of real value, andwhich the pupil can then conscientiously consider his own. What we producethrough wrestling and strenuous endeavour remains forever our own, and vanishesnot into forgetfulness as do the thoughts that enter through the eye from theprinted page, or through the ear from the lips of any teacher no matter howrevered.One thing that is oft overlooked by the pupil when he enters upon the path ofprobation and starts meditation is that the goal ahead for him is not primarilythe completing of his own development, but his equipping for service tohumanity. His own growth and development are necessarily incidental but are notthe goal. His immediate environment and his close associates on the physicalplane are his objectives in service, and if in the endeavour to attain certainqualifications and capacities he overlooks the groups to which he is affiliatedand neglects to serve wisely and to spend himself loyally on their behalf heruns the danger of crystallisation, falls under the spell of sinful pride, andmayhap even takes the first step toward the left-hand path. Unless inner growthfinds expression in group service the man treads a dangerous road.Three types of affiliated groups.Perhaps I could here give some indications of the groups on the various planesto which a man is assigned. These groups are many and diverse and at differentperiods of a man's life may change and differ, as he works out from under theobligating karma that governs the affiliations. Let us remember too that as aman enlarges his capacity to serve he at the same time increases the size andnumber of the groups he contacts till he reaches a point in some laterincarnation when the world [116] itself is his sphere of service and themultitude those whom he assists. He has to serve in a threefold manner before heis permitted to change his line of action and pass on to other work,—planetary.systemic or cosmic.a—He serves first through activity , through the use of his intelligence, usingthe high faculties of mind and the product of his genius to aid the sons of men.He builds slowly great powers of intellect and in the building overcomes thesnare of pride. He takes, then, that active intelligence of his and lays it atthe feet of collective humanity, giving of his best for the helping of the race.b—He serves through love , becoming, as time elapses, one of the saviours ofmen, spending his life and giving of his all through perfect love of hisbrothers. A life then comes when the utmost sacrifice is made and in love hedies that others may live.c—He serves then through power . Proved in the furnace to have no thought savethe good of all around, he is trusted with the power that follows from activelove intelligently applied. He works with the law, and bends all his will tomake the power of the law felt in the three-fold realms of death.In all these three branches of service you will notice that the faculty ofworking with groups is one of paramount importance. These groups are diverse, asbefore I have said, and vary on different planes. Let us briefly enumeratethem:—1—On the physical plane. The following groups will be found:—a—His family group to which he is usually affiliated for two reasons, one towork out karma and repay his debts; the second, to receive a certain type ofphysical vehicle that the Ego needs for adequate expression. [117]b—His associates and friends; the people his environment throws him with, hisbusiness associates, his church affiliations, his acquaintances and casualfriends, and the people he touches for a brief period and then sees no more. Hiswork with them is twofold again; first to repay an obligation should such a debthave been incurred; and secondly to test out his powers to influence for goodthose around him, to recognise responsibility and to direct or help. In doingthus, the Guides of the race find out the actions and reactions of a man, hiscapacity for service, and his response to any surrounding need.c—His associated band of servers, the group under some Great One that isdefinitely united for work of an occult and spiritual nature. It may be either aband of church workers among the orthodox (beginners are tried out here); it maybe in social work such as in the labor movements or in the political arena; orit may be in the more definitely pioneer movements of the world, such as theTheosophical Society, the Christian Science movement, the New Thought workersand the Spiritualists. I would add to this, one branch of endeavour that maysurprise you,—I mean the movement of the Soviet in Russia and all the aggressiveradical bodies that sincerely serve under their leaders (even when misguided andunbalanced) for the betterment of the condition of the masses.Thus on the physical plane you have three groups to which a man belongs. He owesa duty to them and he must play his part. Now wherein could danger enter throughmeditation? Simply in this: that as long as a man's karma holds him to someparticular group the thing that he must aim at is to play his part perfectly, sothat he may work out from under karmic obligation [118] and advance towardultimate liberation; besides this he must carry on his group with him to greaterheights and usefulness. Therefore, if through meditation of an unsuitable naturehe neglects his proper obligation he delays the purpose of his life, and inanother incarnation he will have to play it out. If he builds into that group'scausal body (the composite product of the several lines) aught that has not itsplace properly there, he aids not but hinders, and again that involves danger.Let me illustrate, for clarity is desired:—A student is affiliated with a groupthat has an over-preponderance of devotees, and he has come in for the expresspurpose of balancing that quality with another factor, that of wisediscrimination and mental balance. If he permits himself to be overcome by thegroup thoughtform and becomes himself a devotee, following a devotionalmeditation and unwisely omitting to balance that group's causal body, he runsinto a danger that hurts not only himself but the group to which he belongs.2—On the emotional plane: Here he belongs to several groups such as:—a—His emotional plane family group, which is more thoroughly his own group thanthe family into which he happens to be born on the physical plane. You will seethis demonstrated many times in life when members of an emotional plane familycontact each other on the physical plane. Instant recognition ensues.b—The class within the Hall of Learning to which he is assigned and in which hereceives much instruction.c—The band of Invisible Helpers with whom he may be working and the band ofServers.All these groups involve obligation and work and all must be allowed for instudying the wise use of meditation. [119] Meditation should increase a man'scapacity to discharge his karmic debts, giving clear vision, wise judgment and acomprehension of the work of the immediate moment. Anything that militatesagainst this is dangerous.3—On the mental plane: The groups to be found there may be enumerated asfollows:a—The groups of pupils of some one Master to Whom he may be attached, and withWhom he may be working. This is usually only the case when the man is rapidlyworking out his karma and is nearing the entrance to the Path. His meditation,therefore, should be directly under the guidance of his Master, and any formulafollowed that is not adjusted to a man's need carries with it elements ofdanger, for the vibrations set up on the mental plane and the forces engenderedthere are so much more potent than on the lower levels.b—The egoic group to which he belongs. This is most important for it involvesthe consideration of the man's ray in the apportioning of meditation. Thismatter has already been somewhat touched upon.As you will see, I have not specified certain dangers attacking any particularbody. It is not possible to cover the subject thus. In later days, when occultmeditation is more comprehended and the matter scientifically studied, studentswill prepare the necessary data and treatises covering the entire subject as faras then may be. I sound, however, a note of warning, I indicate the way,—theteachers on the inner side seldom do more. We aim at developing thinkers and menof clear vision, capable of logical reasoning. To do this we teach men todevelop themselves, to do their own thinking, reason out their own problems, andbuild their own characters. Such is the Path.... [120]August 3, 1920.3 - DANGERS ARISING FROM SUBTLE FORCES....We have for our topic this morning the final section of our letter on thedangers incidental to meditation. We have dealt somewhat with individual dangersinherent in the three bodies; we have touched upon the risks that may be runwhen the karma of the student and his group affiliations are overlooked. Todaythe subject involves real difficulty. We have to deal with the dangers that mayarise from forces and persons, from entities and groups working on the subtlerplanes. The difficulty arises in three ways:—l—The ignorance of the average student as to the nature of those forces and asto the personnel of the groups on the subtler planes.2—The risk of revealing more than would be wise in an exoteric publication.3—An occult risk that is little comprehended by the uninitiated. It lies in thefact that in the concentration of thought that necessarily arises in discussingthese problems, thought-waves are set in motion, currents are contacted andthoughtforms circulated that attract the attention of those under discussion.This may lead at times to undesirable results. Therefore, I shall with brevitytouch upon the subject. Upon the inner planes the needed light and protectionare afforded.Three groups of entities:—These groups of entities can be differentiated in a threefold manner:—l—Groups of discarnate beings on either the emotional or the mental planes.2—Devas, either singly or in groups.3—The dark Brotherhood. [121]Let us take each division and deal with it carefully, first laying thefoundation of knowledge by pointing out that the dangers arise from a threefoldcondition of the bodies of the student which may be the result sometimes ofmeditation. These conditions are:A negative condition that makes the entire three bodies of the personalityreceptive and quiescent, and open therefore to the attack of the watchingdenizens of other planes.A condition of ignorance or foolhardiness that, in attempting to use certainforms and mantrams without the permission of the Teacher, involves the studentwith certain groups of devas, bringing him into contact with the devas of theemotional or mental planes and making him therefore (through his ignorance) thebutt of their attack and the plaything of their destructive instincts.A condition which is the reverse of the above, which makes a man positive and achannel, therefore, for force or power. When this is the case, the man proceeds,under occult rule or law and with the aid of his Teacher, to wield theelectrical fluid of the inner planes. He becomes then a centre of the attentionof those who strive against the Brothers of Light.The first two conditions are all the result of meditation unwisely andignorantly practised, the last state of affairs is frequently the reward ofsuccess. In the first two, the remedy lies within the student himself and in thewise correction of the type of meditation and its more careful following; in thethird case the remedy must be sought in various ways which I will laterindicate.Dangers of obsession.Dangers from discarnate entities are frankly those of obsession, either of atemporary nature and lasting for a few moments or more enduring and lasting fora longer [122] period. It may even be permanent and lasting through a lifetime.I have earlier written to you a letter upon this subject which you might hereincorporate. We never duplicate effort if it can be avoided. I seek primarily toemphasise the point that this entrance which we call obsession is effectedlargely through the negative attitude assumed through the unwise following of anunsuitable meditation. In his anxiety to be the recipient of light from above,in his determination to force himself to a place where he can contact theteachers or even the Master, and in his endeavour to eliminate all thought andlower vibrations, the student makes the mistake of rendering his entire lowerpersonality receptive. Instead of making it firmly positive to environingfactors and to all lower contacts, and instead of only allowing the “apex of themind” (if I may use so unusual a term) to be receptive and open to transmissionfrom the causal or the abstract levels and even from the intuitional, thestudent permits reception from all sides. Only a point within the brain shouldbe receptive, all the rest of the consciousness should be so polarised thatouter interference will not be possible. This refers to the emotional and to themental bodies, though with the majority these days it refers solely to theemotional. At this particular period of the world's history the emotional planeis so densely populated and the response of the physical to the emotional is nowbecoming so exquisitely attuned, that the danger of obsession is greater thanever heretofore. But for your cheering—the reverse holds good also, and responseto the divine and rapid reaction to the higher inspiration has never been sogreat. Divine inspiration or that “divine obsession” which is the privilege ofall advanced souls, will be understood in the coming years as never before, andwill be definitely one of the [123] methods used by the coming Lord and HisGreat Ones for the helping of the world.The thing to be remembered is that in the case of wrong obsession the man is atthe mercy of the obsessing entity, and is unconsciously or unwillingly a partnerin the transaction. In divine obsession the man consciously and willinglyco-operates with the One Who seeks to inspire, or to occupy or employ his lowervehicles. The motive is ever the greater helping of the race. The obsession isthen not the result of a negative condition but of a positive collaboration andproceeds under law and for a specific period....As more and more of the racedevelop continuity of consciousness between the physical and the emotional andlater the mental, this act of transference of the vehicles will be more frequentand more understood.October 9, 1919.Causes of Obsession.One of the activities ahead of the occult student is the study and thescientific observation of this matter. We have been told in various occult booksthat obsession and insanity are very closely allied. Insanity may exist in allthree bodies, the least harmful being that of the physical body, whilst the mostenduring and the hardest to cure is that of the mental body. Insanity in themental body is the heavy fate that descends upon those who for many incarnationshave followed the path of selfish cruelty, using the intelligence as a means toserve selfish ends and using it willfully, knowing it to be wrong. But insanityof this type is a means whereby the Ego sometimes arrests the progress of a mantowards the left-hand path. In this sense it is a disguised blessing. Let usdeal first with the causes of obsession, leaving the subject of insanity [124]for another day. These causes are four in number and each responds to adifferent treatment:—One cause is a definite weakness of the etheric double, in the separating web,which like a piece of relaxed elastic permits entry of an extraneous entity fromthe emotional plane. The door of entrance which is formed by this web is notclosed tight, and entrance can be effected from without. This is a physicalplane cause, and is the result of the maladjustment of physical plane matter. Itis the result of karma, and is prenatal, existing from the earliest moment.Usually the sufferer is physically weak, intellectually feeble, but possessed ofa powerful emotional body which suffers and fights and struggles to prevententrance. The attacks are intermittent, and more frequently attack women thanmen.Another cause is due to emotional reasons. A lack of co-ordination existsbetween the emotional and the physical and when the man functions in theemotional body (as at night) the moment of re-entry is attended with difficulty,and opportunity exists for other beings to enter the physical vehicle, andprevent its occupation by the real Ego. This is the most common form ofobsession, and affects those with powerful physical bodies and strong astralvibrations, but with weak mental bodies. It leads, in the ensuing struggle, tothe violent scenes of screaming lunatics and to the paroxysms of the epileptic.Men are more subject to this than women, as women are usually more definitelypolarised in the emotional body.A rarer kind of obsession is the mental. In coming days as the mental bodydevelops, one may expect perhaps to see more of it. Mental obsession involvesthe displacement taking place on the mental levels—hence its rarity. Thephysical body and the emotional body remain as a unit, but the Thinker is leftin his mental body, [125] whilst the obsessing entity (clothed in mental matter)enters the two lower vehicles. In the case of emotional obsession the Thinker isleft with his emotional body and his mental body but with no physical. In thislatter case he is left with neither emotional nor physical. The cause lies inthe fact of the over-development of the mental, and of the relative weakness ofthe emotional and physical bodies. The Thinker is too powerful for his otherbodies and disdains their use; he is too interested in work on mental levels,and thus gives opportunity to obsessing entities to assume control. This, as Isaid before, is rare and is the result of lop-sided development. It attackswomen and men equally; it principally shows itself in childhood and is difficultto cure.A still rarer cause of obsession is definitely the work of the dark Brothers. Ittakes the form of snapping the magnetic link that attaches the Ego to the lowerphysical body, leaving him in his emotional and mental bodies. This wouldnormally result in the death of the physical body, but in cases such as thesethe dark Brother, who is to use the physical body, enters it and makesconnection with his own cord. These cases are not common. They involve only twoclasses of people:—Those who are highly evolved and on the Path, but who through some wilfulshortcoming fail for some one incarnation and so lay themselves open to the evilforce. Sin (as you call it) in the Personality of a disciple leads to a weaknessin some one spot, and this is taken advantage of. This type of obsession showsitself in the transformation that is sometimes seen when a great soul suddenlyplunges on an apparent downward path, when he changes the whole trend of hisexistence and besmirches a fair character with mud. It carries with it its ownpunishment, for on the inner planes the disciple looks [126] on, and in agony ofmind sees his lower vehicle dishonouring the fair name of its real owner andcausing evil to be said of a loved cause.The little evolved, weakly organised, and so unable to resist.The Kinds of Obsessing Entities.These are too numerous to mention in detail but I might enumerate a few.l—Discarnate entities of a low order awaiting incarnation, and who see, in casesone and two, their wanted opportunity.2—Suicides, anxious to undo the deed and to again get into contact with earth.3—Earth-bound spirits, good and bad, who from anxiety over loved ones, overtheir business affairs, or eager to do some wrong or to undo some evil act, rushin and take possession of cases one and two.4—Dark Brothers as aforesaid, who avail themselves principally of the third andfourth cases already cited. They require highly developed bodies, having no usefor weak or unrefined bodies. In case three the weakness is entirely relative,due to over-accentuation of the mental vehicle.5—Elementals and subhuman entities of a malicious nature who rush in on theslightest opportunity and where kindred vibration may be felt.6—Some of the lower devas, harmless but mischievous who, from sheer freakishnessand fun, enter another body in much the same way that a child loves to dress up.7—Occasional visitors from other planets who enter certain highly evolved bodiesfor purposes of their own. This is very, very rare.... [127]Let me now give you some of the methods that eventually will be the firstattempts at cure.In the first type of cases, those due to physical plane weakness, the stress ofthe cure will be laid first on building up a strong physical body in both itsdepartments, though especially the etheric body. This will be done in futureyears with the direct aid of the devas of the shadows (the violet devas or devasof the ethers). The strengthening of the etheric web will be aided by means ofthe violet light, with its corresponding sound, administered in quietsanitariums. Coincident with this treatment will be the attempt to strengthenthe mental body. With the strengthening of the physical body will come longerand longer periods of freedom from attack. Eventually the attacks will ceasealtogether.When the cause is lack of co-ordination between the physical and the emotionalvehicles the first methods of cure will be definite exorcism by the aid ofmantrams and ceremonial (such as religious ritual). Qualified persons will usethese mantrams at night when the obsessing entity may be supposed to be absentduring the hours of sleep. Those mantrams will call the real owner back, willbuild a protective wall after his re-entry and will seek to force the obsessingone to stay absent. When the real owner has returned, the work then will be tokeep him there. Educative work during the day and protective measures at nightfor longer or shorter periods will gradually eliminate the evil occupant, orunwanted tenant, and in the course of time the sufferer will continue to procureimmunity. More anent this can later be given.Where mental obsession is involved the matter is more difficult. Most of thefirst cures achieved in the future will centre around the first two groups.Mental obsession must await greater knowledge, though experimentation [128] fromthe very first should be undertaken. The work will have to be done mostly fromthe mental plane by those who can function there freely and so contact theThinker in his mental body. The co-operation of the Thinker must then beprocured and a definite attack conjointly made on the obsessed physical andemotional bodies. During the night much of the work in the first two cases ofcures will be done, but in the latter case the Thinker has to win back hisphysical and his emotional bodies as well, hence the exceeding difficulty. Deathoften eventuates in these cases.In the severing of the magnetic cord naught can be done as yet.Dangers from the deva evolution.This second point is more complex. You will remember how it has been saidearlier in these letters that contact with the devas can be brought aboutthrough specific forms and mantrams and that in this contact lies peril for theunwary. This danger is curiously real now, owing to the following reasons:a—The coming in of the violet ray, the seventh or Ceremonial Ray, has renderedthis contact more easy of attainment than heretofore. It is therefore the ray onwhich approximation is possible, and in the use of ceremonial and of set forms,coupled to regulated rhythmic movement, will be found a meeting place for thetwo allied evolutions. In the use of ritual this will be apparent, and psychicsare already bearing witness to the fact that both in the ritual of the Churchand in that of Masonry this has been evidenced. More and more will this be thecase, and it carries with it certain risks that will inevitably work themselvesinto common knowledge and thus affect in various ways the unwary sons of men.[129] As you know, a definite effort is being made at this time by the PlanetaryHierarchy to communicate to the devas their part in the scheme of things, andthe part the human family must likewise play. The work is slow, and certainresults are inevitable. It is not my purpose to take up with you in theseletters the part that ritual and set mantric forms play in the evolution ofdevas and of men. I only desire to point out that danger for human beings liesin the unwise use of forms for the calling of the devas, in experimenting withthe Sacred Word with the object in view of contacting the Builders who are solargely affected by it, and in endeavouring to pry into the secrets of ritualwith its adjuncts of colour and of sound. Later on, when the pupil has passedthe portal of initiation, such knowledge will be his, coupled with the necessaryinformation that teaches him to work with the law. In the following of the law,no danger lurks.b—The race is possessed of a strong determination to penetrate within the veil,and to find out what lies on the other side of the unknown. Men and womeneverywhere are conscious within themselves of budding powers which meditationenhances. They find that by the careful following of certain rules they becomemore sensitive to the sights and sounds of the inner planes. They catch fleetingglimpses of the unknown; occasionally and at rare intervals, the organ of innervision temporarily opens and they hear and see on the astral or the mentalplane. They see devas at a meeting in which ritual has been employed; they catcha sound or a voice that tells them truths that they recognise as true. Thetemptation to force the issue, to prolong meditation, to try out certain methodsthat promise intensification of psychic faculty is too strong. They unwarilyforce matters and dire disaster results. One hint here I give:—In meditation[130] it is literally possible to play with fire . The devas of the mentallevels manipulate the latent fires of the system and thus incidentally thelatent fires of the inner man. It is woefully possible to be the plaything oftheir endeavour and to perish at their hands. A truth I speak here; I give notvoice to the interesting chimeras of a fanciful brain. Beware of playing withfire.c—This transition period is largely responsible for much of the danger. Theright type of body for the holding and the handling of the occult force has notyet been built, and in the interim the bodies now in use but spell disaster tothe ambitious student. When a man starts out to follow the path of occultmeditation, it takes well-nigh fourteen years to rebuild the subtle bodies, andincidentally the physical. All through that period it is not safe to tamper withthe unknown for only the very strong refined physical body, the controlledstable and equalised emotional body and the properly striated mental body canenter into the subtler planes and literally work with Fohat, for that is whatthe occult does. Therefore is the emphasis laid by all wise Teachers everywhereon the Path of Purification, which must precede the Path of Illumination. Theylay the emphasis on the building in of spiritual faculty before psychic facultycan be safely permitted; they demand service to the race every day throughoutthe scope of life before a man may be permitted to manipulate the forces ofnature, to dominate the elementals, to co-operate with the devas, and to learnthe forms and ceremonies, the mantrams and the key-words, that will bring thoseforces within the circle of manifestation.August 4, 1920.Danger from the Dark Brothers.I think I gave you earlier practically all that I can as [131] yet impart anentthe Brothers of Darkness, as they are sometimes termed. I only want at thispoint to lay emphasis upon the fact that no danger need be feared by the averagestudent from this source. It is only as discipleship is approached and a manstands out ahead of his fellows as an instrument of the White Brotherhood thathe attracts the attention of those who seek to withstand. When throughapplication to meditation, and power and activity in service, a man hasdeveloped his vehicles to a point of real achievement, then his vibrations setin motion matters of a specific kind, and he learns to work with that matter, tomanipulate the fluids, and to control the builders. In so doing he encroaches onthe domain of those who work with the forces of involution and thus he may bringattack upon himself. This attack may be directed against any of his threevehicles and may be of different kinds. Let me briefly point out some of themethods employed against a disciple which are the ones which alone concern thestudent of these letters:a—Definite attack on the physical body. All kinds of means are employed tohinder the usefulness of the disciple through disease or the crippling of hisphysical body. Not all accidents are the result of karma, for the disciple hasusually surmounted a good deal of that type of karma and is thus comparativelyfree from that source of hindrance in active work.b—Glamour is another method used, or the casting over the disciple of a cloud ofemotional or mental matter which suffices to hide the real, and to temporarilyobscure that which is true. The study of the cases wherein glamour has beenemployed is exceedingly revealing and demonstrates how hard it is for even anadvanced disciple always to discriminate between the real and the false, thetrue and the untrue. Glamour may be either on the [132] emotional or mentallevels but is usually on the former. One form employed is to cast over thedisciple the shadows of the thought of weakness or discouragement or criticismto which he may at intervals give way. Thus cast, they loom in undue proportionand the unwary disciple, not realising that he is but seeing the giganticoutlines of his own momentary and passing thoughts, gives way to discouragement,aye even to despair, and becomes of little use to the Great Ones. Another formis to throw into his mental aura suggestions and ideas purporting to come fromhis own Master but which are but subtle suggestions that hinder and help not. Ittakes a wise disciple always to discriminate between the voice of his realTeacher and the false whispers of the masquerading one, and even high initiateshave been temporarily misled.Many and subtle are the means used to deceive and thereby curtail the effectiveoutput of the worker in the field of the world. Wisely therefore have allaspirants been enjoined to study and work at the development of viveka or thatdiscrimination which safeguards from deception. If this quality is laboriouslybuilt in and cultivated in all events, big and little, in the daily life, therisks of being led astray will be nullified.c—A third method frequently employed is to envelop the disciple in a thick cloudof darkness, to surround him with an impenetrable night and fog through which hestumbles and often falls. It may take the form of a black cloud of emotionalmatter, of some dark emotion that seems to imperil all stable vibration andplunges the bewildered student into a blackness of despair; he feels that all isdeparting from him; he is a prey to varied and dismal emotions; he deems himselfforsaken of all; he considers that all past effort has been futile and thatnaught remains but to die. At such times he needs much the gift [133] of viveka, and to earnestly weigh up and calmly reason out the matter. He should at thesetimes remind himself that the darkness hides naught from the God within, andthat the stable centre of consciousness remains there, untouched by aught thatmay betide. He should persevere until the end,—the end of what? The end of theenveloping cloud, the point where it merges itself into sunlight; he should passthrough its length and out into the daylight, realising that nothing can at anytime reach to and hurt the inner consciousness. God is within, no matter whattranspires without. We are so apt to look out at environing circumstances,whether physical, astral or mental, and to forget that the inmost centre of theheart hides our points of contact with the Universal Logos.d—Finally (for I cannot touch on all the methods used), the means employed maybe to cast a mental darkness over the disciple. The darkness may beintellectual, and is consequently still more difficult to penetrate, for in thiscase the power of the Ego must be called in, whereas in the former frequentlythe calm reasoning of the lower mind may suffice to dispel the trouble. Here, inthis specific case, the disciple will be wise if he not only attempts to callhis Ego or Higher Self for the dispelling of the cloud, but calls likewise uponhis Teacher, or even upon his Master, for the assistance that they can give.These are but a few of the dangers encircling the aspirant, and I hint at themsolely for the purpose of warning and guidance, and not to cause alarm. You canhere interpolate the earlier letter with the rules that I there give for theassistance of the disciple.September 25, 1919.The Dark Brotherhood.Today I seek to speak to you on the powers of the Dark Brotherhood. Certain lawsthat govern their actions, [134] certain methods employed by them in work needto be realised and certain methods of protection apprehended and utilised. Asbefore I have told you the danger is as yet inappreciable to the majority, butmore and more as time elapses shall we find it necessary to teach you, thephysical plane workers, how to shield and guard yourselves from attack.The Dark Brothers are—remember this always—brothers , erring and misguided yetstill sons of the one Father though straying far, very far, into the land ofdistances. The way back for them will be long, but the mercy of evolutioninevitably forces them back along the path of return in cycles far ahead. Anyonewho over-exalts the concrete mind and permits it continuously to shut out thehigher, is in danger of straying on the left-hand path. Many so stray...but comeback, and then in the future avoid like errors in the same way as a child onceburnt avoids the fire. It is the man who persists in spite of warning and ofpain who eventually becomes a brother of darkness. Mightily fights the Ego atfirst to prevent the Personality so developing, but the deficiencies of thecausal body (for forget not that our vices are but our virtues misused) resultin a lop-sided causal body, over-developed in some direction and full of greatgulfs and gaps where virtues should be.The dark brother recognises no unity with his species, only seeing in thempeople to be exploited for the furtherance of his own ends. This then, on asmall scale, is the mark of those who are being used by them wittingly orunwittingly. They respect no person, they regard all men as fair prey, they useeveryone to get their own way enforced, and by fair means or foul they seek tobreak down all opposition and for the personal self acquire that which theydesire. [135]The dark brother considers not what suffering he may cause; he cares not whatagony of mind he brings upon an opponent; he persists in his intention anddesists not from the hurt of any man, woman or child, provided that in theprocess his own ends are furthered. Expect absolutely no mercy from thoseopposing the Brotherhood of Light.On the physical plane and on the emotional plane, the dark brother has morepower than the Brother of the Light,—not more power per se but more apparentpower , because the White Brothers choose not to exert Their power on those twoplanes, as do the Dark Brothers. They could exert Their authority but Theychoose to refrain, working with the powers of evolution and not of involution.The elemental forces to be found on these two planes are manipulated by twofactors.a—The inherent forces of evolution that direct all on to eventual perfection.The White Adepts co-operate in this.b—The Dark Brothers who occasionally employ these elemental forces to wreaktheir will and vengeance on all opponents. Under their control work sometimesthe elementals of the earth plane, the gnomes and the elemental essence as foundin evil form, some of the brownies, and the fairy folk of colours brown, greyand sombre-hued. They cannot control the devas of high development, nor thefairies of colours blue, green and yellow, though a few of the red fairies canbe made to work under their direction. The water elementals (though not thesprites or sylphs) move on occasion to their assistance, and in the control ofthese forces of involution they at times damage the furtherance of our work.[136]Oft too the Dark Brother masquerades as an agent of the light, oft he poses as amessenger of the gods, but for your assurance I would say that he who acts underthe guidance of the Ego will have clear vision, and will escape deception.At this time their power is ofttimes mighty. Why? Because so much exists as yetin the Personalities of all men that respond to their vibration, and so it iseasy for them to affect the bodies of men. So few of the races, comparativelyspeaking, have as yet built in the higher vibration that responds to thekey-note of the Brotherhood of Light, who move practically entirely on the twohighest levels (or the atomic and sub-atomic subplane) of the mental, emotionaland physical planes. When moving on these subplanes the attacks of elementals onlower planes may be felt but effect no harm, hence the necessity of pure livingand controlled pure emotions and elevated thought.You will notice that I said that the power of the Dark Brotherhood is dominantapparently on the physical and emotional planes. Not so is it on the mental,which is the plane on which the Brothers of the Light work. Mighty darkmagicians may be located on the lower mental levels, but on the higher, theWhite Lodge dominates, the three higher subplanes being the levels that They begthe evolving sons of men to seek; it is Their region, to which all must striveand aspire. The Dark Brother impresses his will on human beings (if analogousvibration exists) and on the elemental kingdoms of involution. The Brothers ofLight plead as pleaded the Man of Sorrows for an erring humanity to rise upwardto the light. The Dark Brother retards progress and shapes all to his own ends;the Brother of Light bends every effort to the hastening [137] of evolutionand—foregoing all that might be His as the price of achievement—stays amid thefogs, the strife, the evil and the hatred of the period if, in so doing, He mayby all means aid some, and (lifting them up out of the darkness of earth) settheir feet upon the Mount, and enable them to surmount the Cross.And now what methods may be employed to safeguard the worker in the field of theworld? What can be done to ensure his safety in the present strife and in thegreater strife of the coming centuries?1—A realisation that purity of all the vehicles is the prime essential. If aDark Brother gains control over any man it but shows that that man has in hislife some weak spot. The door whereby entrance is effected must be opened by theman himself; the opening whereby malignant force can be poured in must be causedby the occupant of the vehicles. Therefore the need of scrupulous cleanliness ofthe physical body, of clean steady emotions permitted in the emotional body, andof purity of thought in the mental body. When this is so, co-ordination will bepresent in the lower vehicles and the indwelling Thinker himself permits noentrance.2—The elimination of all fear. The forces of evolution vibrate more rapidly thanthose of involution and in this fact lies a recognisable security. Fear causesweakness; weakness causes a disintegration; the weak spot breaks and a gapappears, and through that gap evil force may enter. The factor of entrance isthe fear of the man himself, who opens thus the door.3—A standing firm and unmoved, no matter what occurs. Your feet may be bathed inthe mud of earth, but your head may be bathed in the sunshine of the higherregions. Recognition of the filth of earth involves not contamination. [138]4—A Recognition of the use of common-sense and the application of thiscommon-sense to the matter in hand. Sleep much and, in sleeping, learn to renderthe body positive; keep busy on the emotional plane and achieve the inner calm.Do naught to overtire the body physical, and play whenever possible. In hours ofrelaxation comes the adjustment that obviates later tension."},{"pageContent":"LETTER VI - THE USE OF FORM IN MEDITATIONAugust 6, 1920.[140] Your very natural desire to have me give you in this sixth letter certainspecific forms to achieve certain results cannot be fully acquiesced in. I donot propose to outline for you any forms for careful following. The risks, asbefore I have pointed out, are too great apart from the supervision of a teacherat hand to watch reactions. These forms may later be given. The work is dulyplanned out for the coming generation of students, this series of letters havingits place within that outline. What I intend to do today is something different.I purpose to do four things which we will separately take up and elucidate.These things, if duly assimilated and acted upon, will lead to furtherenlightenment. In the occult method of teaching step by step is given, point bypoint slowly laid before the pupil, and only as each step is taken and eachpoint is grasped, will the next in order become clear. The teacher gives anindication, drops a hint, and touches some high light. The pupil follows thepoint emphasised, and finds on thus acting that further light pours in, anotherstage appears and other hints are dropped. In joint action and reactiontherefore the occult student is trained by the occultist.In studying the topic, “The use of form in meditation,” the four divisions underwhich I seek to place the intended data are as follows:—1—The use of Form in raising the consciousness.2.—The use of Form by the mystic and the occultist. [141]3—The use of specific forms for specific ends.4—The use of Form collectively.In the exposition of these subjects you will see that what I am endeavouring toproduce is a just apprehension of the value of forms in meditation and not theimparting of any definite method. I seek to show the essential nature ofproceeding under law in this the most important means of bringing about unionwith the divine, and of producing that at-one-ment between the higher and thelower that is the aim of all evolution. I desire to leave in the minds of thosewho read these words a just apprehension of the relationship between spirit andmatter which is the basis of all work of this nature.The method employed by the Logos in this the second solar system is definitelythe use of form for purposes of manifestation, as a medium of expression and asthe vehicle whereby the indwelling life may grow, expand, experience and finditself. This is the case whether the form is an entire solar system, whether itis a human being in his complexity, or whether it is a form built by that humanbeing in his endeavour to realise and know,—a form built for the very purpose ofproviding a vehicle whereby the consciousness may, by set stages, raise itselfstep by step to some visualised point. This brings us to our first point:1 - THE USE OF FORM IN RAISING THE CONSCIOUSNESS.We have under this heading to consider three things:a—The Consciousness itself.b—The goal towards which it seeks to rise.c—The steps whereby it succeeds.Each unit of the human race is a part of the divine consciousness, and is thatwhich is conscious of, or is [142] aware of something without itself,—somethingwhich knows itself to be differentiated from the vehicle which encloses it orthe forms which environ it.At this particular stage in evolution the average man is simply conscious ofdifferentiation, or of being separated off from all other members of the humanfamily, thus forming in himself a unit among other units. He acknowledges thisand acknowledges the right of all other separated units so to considerthemselves. He adds to this a recognition that somewhere in the universe thereexists a supreme Consciousness, Whom he theoretically calls God, or Nature.Between this purely selfish point of view (I use the term “selfish” in thescientific sense and not as a belittling adjective) and the nebulous theory ofGod immanent there are to be found numerous stages, at each of which occurs anexpansion of consciousness, or an enlargement of the point of view, that leadsthat self-recognising unit, step by step, from self-recognition to therecognition of superior selves, to the fitting of himself to be likewiserecognised as a superior self, and eventually to the occult recognition of hisown superior Self. He comes to recognise his Higher Self or Ego as his trueSelf, and from that stage passes on into that of the group consciousness. Herehe realises first his egoic group and then other egoic groups.This stage is succeeded by the recognition of the universal principle ofBrotherhood; it involves not just a theoretical recognition, but a merging ofthe consciousness into that of the human consciousness, in its entirety; this isreally that development of consciousness which enables a man to realise not onlyhis egoic group affiliations but his place in the human Hierarchy on its ownplane. He knows himself in fact as a part of one of the great Heavenly Men. Thisexpands later into an almost [143] inconceivably vast point of view—that of hisplace in the Grand Heavenly Man, as represented by the Logos Himself.This is as far as we need go for our purpose, for this series of letters, aimsnot at the development of cosmic consciousness.It will therefore be apparent to you that all these stages have to be takensystematically and that each one has to be mastered step by step. It isnecessary first to grasp that the place where the expansion takes place, and therealisation has to be felt, has to be finally in the thinking, wakingconsciousness. The Ego on its own plane may be well aware of the unity of itsconsciousness with all other consciousnesses, and be realising his group as onewith himself, but until the man (in physical plane consciousness) has raisedhimself to that same plane and is likewise aware of his group consciousness, andlikewise regards himself as the higher Self within the egoic group and not as aseparated unit, it is of no more use than a recognised theory is of use when notcarried out in experience.The man has to experience these stages in his physical consciousness and to knowexperimentally and not just theoretically that whereof I speak before he isdeemed ready to pass on into the succeeding stages. The whole matter resolvesitself into the expansion of the mind until it dominates the lower, and into thefaculty of abstract conception which results eventually in physical planemanifestation. It means making your highest theories and ideals demonstrablefacts and it is that blending of the higher and the lower and the equipping ofthat lower until it provides a fitting expression for the higher. It is herethat the practice of meditation plays its part. The true scientific meditationprovides [144] graded forms whereby the consciousness is raised and the mindexpanded until it embraces:l—Its family and friends.2—Its environing associates.3—Its affiliated groups.4—Its egoic group.5—Other egoic groups.6—That Man of the Heavens of which the egoic groups form a centre.7—The Grand Heavenly Man.To effect this certain forms will be laid down later, that (working along theline of a man's ray) will teach him in graded steps to do this. You will notethat I have dealt with the consciousness itself and the goal it aspires to andhave thus dealt with our first two points. This brings me to our last subsidiaryheading, the steps whereby attainment eventuates.Each man who enters upon occult development and who aspires toward the higher,has passed the stage of the average man,—the man who regards himself from thepurely isolated standpoint and who works for what is good for himself. Theaspirant is aiming at something different; he seeks to merge himself with hishigher Self and with all that is entailed when we use that term. The stagesbeyond that, in all their intricacies, are the secrets of Initiation and withthem we have naught to do.Aspiration towards the Ego and the bringing in of that higher consciousness withthe subsequent development of group consciousness very directly concern all whowill read these letters. It is the next step ahead for those upon theProbationary Path. It is not achieved by simply giving thirty minutes a day tocertain set forms of meditation. It involves an hour by hour attempt, [145] allday long and every day, to keep the consciousness as near to the high pitchattained in the morning meditation as possible. It presumes a determination toconsider oneself at all times as the Ego, and not as a differential Personality.Later, as the Ego comes more and more into control, it will involve also theability to look upon oneself as part of a group, with no interests and desires,no aims or wishes apart from the good of that group. It necessitates a constantwatchfulness every hour of the day to prevent the falling back into the lowervibration. It entails a constant battle with the lower self that drags down; itis a ceaseless fight to preserve the higher vibration. And—which is the point Iam aiming to impress upon you—the aim should be the development of the habit ofmeditation all the day long, and the living in the higher consciousness tillthat consciousness is so stable that the lower mind, desire and the physicalelementals, become so atrophied and starved through lack of nourishment that thethreefold lower nature becomes simply the means whereby the Ego contacts theworld for purposes of helping the race.In so doing he is accomplishing something that is little realised by the averagestudent. He is building a form, a definite thoughtform that eventually providesa vehicle whereby he steps out of the lower consciousness into the higher, akind of mayavirupa that acts as his intermediate channel. These forms areusually, though not invariably, of two kinds:—The student builds a form daily, with care and love and attention, of hisMaster, to him the embodiment of the ideal higher consciousness. He lays theoutline of this form in meditation and builds in the fabric in his daily lifeand thought. The form is provided with all the virtues, scintillates with allthe colours, and is vivified, [146] first of all, by the love of the man for hisMaster, and later (when adequate for the purpose) it is vitalised by the MasterHimself. At a certain stage in development this form provides the ground for theoccult experience of entering into the higher consciousness. The man recogniseshimself as a part of the Master's consciousness and through that all embracingconsciousness slips into the egoic group soul consciously . This form providesthe medium for that experience until such a time as it can be dispensed with,and the man can at will transfer himself into his group, and later consciouslydwell there permanently. This method is the one most largely used, and is thepath of love and devotion.In the second method the student pictures himself as the ideal man. Hevisualises himself as the exponent of all the virtues, and he attempts in hisdaily life to make himself what he visualises himself to be. This method isemployed by the more mental types, the intellectuals, and those whose ray is notso coloured by love, by devotion or by harmony. It is not so common as thefirst. The mental thoughtform thus built up serves as the mayavirupa as did theother and the man passes from these forms into the higher consciousness. As youtherefore see, in building these forms certain steps will have to be taken andeach type will build the form somewhat differently.The first type will start with some beloved individual, and from thatindividual, will rise through the various other individuals to the Master.The other type will start with meditation on the virtue most desired, add virtueto virtue in the building of the form of the ideal self until all the virtueshave been attempted and the Ego is suddenly contacted. [147]Tomorrow we will take up this same subject from a different angle and study thedifference between the occultist and the mystic.August 8, 1920.2 - FORM AS USED BY THE OCCULTIST AND THE MYSTIC.The subject of this letter today will interest you for we are to take up form asused by the occultist and the mystic.It might be of value to us if we first differentiated with care between the twotypes. I would begin by a statement of fact. The mystic is not necessarily anoccultist, but the occultist embraces the mystic. Mysticism is but one step onthe path of occultism. In this solar system—the system of love in activity—thepath of least resistance for the majority is that of the mystic, or the path oflove and devotion. In the next solar system the path of least resistance will bethat which we now understand as the occult path. The mystic path will have beentrodden. Wherein lies the difference between these two types? The mystic dealswith the evolving life; the occultist deals with the form.The mystic deals with the God within; the occultist with God in outermanifestation.The mystic works from the centre to the periphery; the occultist reverses theprocess.The mystic mounts by aspiration and intensest devotion to the God within or tothe Master Whom he recognises; the occultist attains by the recognition of thelaw in operation and by the wielding of the law which binds matter and conformsit to the needs of the indwelling life. In this manner the occultist arrives atthose Intelligences Who work with the law, till he attains the fundamentalIntelligence Himself. [148]The mystic works through the Rays of Love, Harmony and Devotion, or by the pathof the second, the fourth and the sixth rays. The occultist works through theRays of Power, Activity, and Ceremonial Law, or the first, the third and theseventh. Both meet and blend through the development of mind, or through thefifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge (a fragment of cosmic intelligence), and on thisfifth ray the mystic is resolved into the occultist and works then with all therays.By finding the kingdom of God within himself and by the study of the laws of hisown being, the mystic becomes proficient in the laws which govern the universeof which he is a part. The occultist recognises the kingdom of God in nature orthe system and regards himself as a small part of that greater whole, andtherefore governed by the same laws.The mystic works as a general rule under the department of the World Teacher, orthe Christ, and the occultist more frequently under that of the Manu, or Ruler,but when both types have passed through the four minor rays in the department ofthe Lord of Civilisation, then a completion of their development may be seen,and the mystic becomes the occultist and the occultist includes thecharacteristics of the mystic. To make it more simple for generalcomprehension:—after initiation the mystic is merged in the occultist for he hasbecome a student of occult law; he has to work with matter, with itsmanipulation and uses, and he has to master and control all lower forms ofmanifestation, and learn the rules whereby the building devas work. Beforeinitiation the mystic path might be expressed by the term, Probationary Path.Before the occultist can manipulate wisely the matter of the solar system hemust have mastered the laws that govern the microcosm, and even though he isnaturally [149] on the occult path yet he will still have to find the God withinhis own being before he can safely venture on the path of occult law.The mystic seeks to work from the emotional to the intuitional, and thence tothe Monad, or Spirit. The occultist works from the physical to the mental, andthence to the atma or Spirit. One works along the line of love; the other alongthe line of will. The mystic fails in the purpose of his being—that of lovedemonstrated in activity—unless he co-ordinates the whole through the use ofintelligent will. Therefore he has to become the occultist.The occultist similarly fails and becomes only a selfish exponent of powerworking through intelligence, unless he finds a purpose for that will andknowledge by an animating love which will give to him sufficient motive for allthat he attempts.I have attempted to make clear to you the distinction between these two groups,as the importance of the matter is great when studying meditation. The form usedby the two types is entirely different and when seen clairvoyantly is veryinteresting.The mystic form.The expression, “the mystic form,” is almost a paradoxical remark, for themystic—if left to himself—eliminates the form altogether. He concentrates uponthe God within, brooding on that inner centre of consciousness; he seeks to linkthat centre with other centres—such as his Master, or some saint, or even withthe supreme Logos Himself—and to mount by the line of life , paying no attentionwhatsoever to the environing sheaths. He works along the path of fire. “Our Godis a consuming fire” [150] is to him a literal statement of fact, and ofrealised truth. He rises from fire to fire, and from graded realisations of theindwelling Fire till he touches the fire of the universe. The only form that themystic may be said to use would be a ladder of fire or a cross of fire, by meansof which he elevates his consciousness to the desired point. He concentrates onabstractions, on attributes more than on aspects, and on the life side more thanthe concrete. He aspires, he burns, he harmonises, he loves and he works throughdevotion. He meditates by attempting to eliminate the concrete mind altogether,and aspires to leap from the plane of the emotions to that of the intuition.He has the faults of his type,—dreamy, visionary, impractical, emotional, andlacking that quality of mind that we call discrimination. He is intuitive, proneto martyrdom and self-sacrifice. Before he can achieve and before he can takeinitiation he has three things to do:—First, by meditation, to bring his whole nature under rule, and to learn tobuild the forms, and hence to learn their value.Secondly, to develop appreciation of the concrete, and to learn clearly theplace within the scheme of things of the various sheaths through which the lifehe so much loves has to manifest. He has to work at his mental body and bring itto the store house of facts before he can proceed much further.Thirdly, to learn through the intelligent study of the microcosm, his littlespirit-matter system, the dual value of the macrocosm.Instead of only knowing the fire that burns he has to understand and workthrough the fire that builds , that fuses and develops form. He has, throughmeditation, to learn the threefold use of Fire. This last sentence is of veryreal importance and I seek to emphasise it. [151]August 10, 1920.The occult form.We studied, two days ago, the method whereby the mystic attains union, andoutlined very briefly the path whereby he attempts to reach his goal. Today wewill outline as briefly the course taken by the occultist, and his type ofmeditation, contrasting it with that of the mystic, and pointing out later howthe two have to merge and their individual elements be fused into one.The line of form is, for the occultist, the line of least resistance, andincidentally I might here interpolate a thought. The fact being admitted, we maytherefore look with some certainty at this time for a rapid development ofoccult knowledge, and for the appearance of some true occultists. By the comingin of the seventh ray, the Ray of Form or Ritual, the finding of the occultpath, and the assimilation of occult knowledge is powerfully facilitated. Theoccultist is at first occupied more with the form through which the Deitymanifests than with the Deity Himself, and it is here that the fundamentaldifference between the two types is at first apparent. The mystic eliminates orendeavours to transcend mind in his process of finding the Self. The occultist,through his intelligent interest in the forms which veil the Self and by theemployment of the principle of mind on both its levels, arrives at the samepoint. He recognises the sheaths that veil. He applies himself to the study ofthe laws that govern the manifested solar system. He concentrates on theobjective, and in his earlier years may at times overlook the value of thesubjective. He arrives eventually at the central life by the elimination,through conscious knowledge and control, of sheath after sheath. He meditatesupon form until the form is lost sight of, and the creator of the form becomesall in all. [152]He, like the mystic, has three things to do:—1—He has to learn the law and to apply that law to himself. Rigidself-discipline is his method, and necessarily so, for the dangers threateningthe occultist are not those of the mystic. Pride, selfishness, and a wielding ofthe law from curiosity or desire for power have to be burnt out of him beforethe secrets of the Path can safely be entrusted to his care.2—In meditation he has, through the form built, to concentrate upon theindwelling life. He has to seek the inner burning fire that irradiates all formsthat shelter the divine life.3—Through the scientific study of the macrocosm, “the kingdom of God without,”he has to reach a point where he locates that kingdom likewise within.Here, therefore, is the merging point of the mystic and the occultist. Heretheir paths become one. I spoke earlier in this letter of the interest to theclairvoyant in noting the difference in the forms built by the mystic and theoccultist in meditation. I might touch on some of the differences for yourinterest, though until such vision is yours my point may be but words to you.Occult and mystic forms clairvoyantly seen.The mystic who is meditating has built before him and around him an outlinenebulous, inchoate, and cloudy, and in such a way that he himself forms thecentre of the form. Frequently, according to the trend of his mind, the nucleusof the form may be some favourite symbol such as a cross, an altar, or even hispictured idea of one of the Great Ones. This form will be wreathed in the mistsof devotion, and will pulsate with floods of colour bespeaking aspiration, loveand ardent longing. The colours built in will be of singular purity and clarity[153] and will mount up until they reach a great height. According to thecapacity of the man to aspire and to love will be the density and the beauty ofthe ascending clouds; according to his stability of temperament will be theaccuracy of the inner symbol or picture around which the clouds of colourcirculate.The forms built by the man of an occult trend of thought, and who is moredominated by mind, will be of a geometrical type. The outlines will be clear,and will be apt to be rigid. The form will be more painstakingly built and theman, during meditation, will proceed with greater care and accuracy. He will (ifI may so express it) take a pride in the manipulation of the material that goesto the building of the form. Matter of the mental plane will be more apparentand—though certain clouds of emotional matter may he added to the whole—matterof the emotional plane will be of secondary importance. The colours employed maybe of equal clarity, but they are apportioned with specific intent, and the formstands out clearly and is not lost in the upward surge of emotional colours asthe mystic form is apt to be.Later, when the man in either case has reached a point of more rounded outdevelopment, and is both an occultist and a mystic, the forms built will combineboth qualifications, and be things of rare beauty.This will suffice for today, but I would like to outline for you the ideas thatmust be brought out later. We will deal with the use of forms in achievingspecific results, and though it is not my intention to give or outline suchforms, I wish to group them for you so that later when the Teacher moves amongmen He may find ready apprehension among students everywhere.1—Forms used in work on the three bodies.2—Forms on certain rays. [154]3—Forms used in healing.4—Mantrams.5—Forms used in one of the three Departments:—a—The Manu's Department.b—The Department of the World Teacher or the Christ.c—The Department of the Lord of Civilisation.6—Forms for calling elementals.7—Forms for contacting the devas.8—Special forms connected with Fire.August 11, 1920....Periods of physical weakness are of value only for the reason that theydemonstrate the absolute necessity there is for the worker to build a strongbody before he can accomplish much, and the importance of good health before thedisciple can go forward on the Path. We cannot permit those we teach to docertain things, nor inform them along certain lines unless their physicalvehicles are in good shape, and unless the handicap of ill health and disease ispractically negligible, and the karma of accidental trouble almost completelyobviated in the personal life. National or group karma occasionally involves apupil, and upsets somewhat the plans, but this is unavoidable and can seldom beoffset.3 - THE USE OF SPECIFIC FORMS FOR SPECIFIC ENDS.Until now we have dealt more with the personal aspects of meditation, and haveconsidered the two types that are practically universal and fundamental, havingstudied briefly, (a) Meditation as followed by the mystic, and (b) Meditation aspursued by the occultist.We have largely generalised and have not in any way attempted to enter intoparticulars. It is neither desirable [155] at this stage nor proper. At acertain point in meditation, nevertheless, when the pupil has made the desiredprogress and covered certain specific stages and attained certain objectives(which attainment can be ascertained by a review of the pupil's causal body) andwhen a foundation of right living has been laid which neither storms nor attackwill be liable easily to upset or destroy, the Teacher may impart to the earnestpupil instructions whereby he can build in mental matter and under definiterules, forms that will lead to specific actions and reactions. These forms willbe imparted gradually, and at times the pupil (this especially at first) may notbe in the least conscious of the results achieved. He will obey the orders, saythe imparted words, or work through the outlined formulas, and the resultsattained may do their work even though the pupil is unconscious of the fact.Later—especially after initiation, as the subtler faculties come into activity,and the centres are rotating in fourth dimensional order—he may be aware of theeffects of his meditation on the emotional and mental planes.Results never concern us. Strict obedience to the law, and steady adherence tothe rules laid down, with skill in action aimed at are the part of the wisepupil. The effects then are sure, and carry no karma with them....Let us take up each of the forms in order, but first I would give a warning.I do not intend to outline forms, or to give specific instructions as to how theresults indicated may be achieved. That will be done later, but when, it is notpossible to say. So much depends upon the work done during the next seven years,or on the group karma, also on the progress made, not only by the humanhierarchy, but by the deva or angel evolution as well. The secret of it all lieshid in the seventh Ceremonial Ray, and the hour for the next step onward will[156] be given by the seventh Planetary Logos, working in conjunction with threeGreat Lords, especially with the Lord of the third department.Forms used in work on the three bodies.These forms will be some of the first revealed, and already in the variousmeditations advocated by the wise Guides of the race you have some of the lesserfoundation outlines designed for working on the lower mind. These forms will bebased on the special need of any one body, and will seek through themanipulation of matter to build that which is needed to fill the gap, and thusto supply the deficiency. This manipulation will be begun first on the ethericmatter of the physical body, by forms of breathing (respiration andinspiration), and by certain rhythmic currents set up on the mental plane anddriving from thence to the lower ethers. The etheric body will thus bestrengthened, purified, cleansed, and rearranged. Many of the diseases of thedense physical body originate in the etheric, and it will be an object ofattention at as early a date as possible.The emotional body likewise will be dealt with through special forms, and whenthe pupil has strenuously cultivated the quality of discrimination, and made ita working factor in his life, then these forms will be gradually imparted. Butuntil he can distinguish somewhat between the real and the unreal, and until hissense of proportion is wisely adjusted, the emotional plane should be for him abattle ground, and not a field for experimentation. Let me illustrate the typeof work that these forms which work on emotional matter will accomplish. The aimof the pupil who treads the Path is to build an emotional body that is composedof matter of the higher subplanes, is clear and sensitive, an accuratetransmitter, and which [157] is characterised by a stable vibration, a steadyrhythmic motion, and is not prone to violent storms and the agitating effects ofuncontrolled emotion. When the idealism is high, when the percentage of matterof the two higher subplanes is approaching somewhat the desired figure, and whenthe pupil recognises practically all the time that he is not his vehicles, butis indeed the divine Dweller within them, then certain things will be impartedto him, which—when carefully followed out—will do two things:They will act directly on his emotional body, driving out foreign or lowermatter, and stabilising his vibration.They will build in emotional matter a body or form that he can use for certainwork, and can employ as his agent to attain results that will be part of thepurificatory and constructive work of the emotional body. This is as much as canbe said, but it will serve to show the type of form aimed at.Ray forms.This is a profoundly interesting and vast subject, and may only be indicated ingeneral terms. Certain forms, built up on the numerical aspect of the variousrays, are the special property of those rays and embody their geometricalsignificance, demonstrating their place in the system. Some of these forms beingon the concrete rays or building rays are the line of least resistance for theoccultist, while other forms on the abstract or attributive rays are more easilyfollowed by the mystic.These forms are for three objects:—a. They put the pupil in direct contact with his own ray, either the egoic orpersonality ray.b. They link him up with his group on the inner planes, either the group ofservers, the group of invisible helpers, or later with his egoic group. [158]c. They tend to merge the occult and the mystic paths in the life of the pupil.Should he be on the mystic path he will work at the forms upon the Rays ofAspect, and so develop knowledge of the concrete side of Nature—that side whichworks under law. You can reverse the case for the man of occult tendency, tillthe time comes when the paths merge and all forms are alike to the Initiate. Youhave to remember that at this point of merging a man works ever primarily on hisown ray when he has transcended the personality and found the egoic note. Thenhe manipulates matter of his own ray, and works through his own ray-forms withtheir six representative sub-ray forms until he is adept, and knows the secretof synthesis. These forms are taught by the Teacher to the pupil.You will find that though I have imparted but little on this subject, yet, ifyou brood over what I have given, it contains much. It may give those who wiselyassimilate it the key they seek for their next step on. I may touch on this andsomewhat enlarge when we take up the subject of access to the Masters throughmeditation.Forms used in healing.We must touch now on these forms, remembering first of all that they will benecessarily arranged in three groups, each with many subsidiary heads.a. Forms for use in physical healing. You would be surprised how seldom theseforms will be required, and how few in number therefore they are. The reason forthis is that very few of the troubles of the dense physical body arise withinthat body itself. A few arise directly in the etheric body, but at this stage ofevolution most of the troubles arise in the emotional body, and the remainder inthe mental. We might generalise and say that: [159]25% of the ills flesh is heir to, arise in the etheric body.25% in the mental body.50% find their origin in the emotional body.Therefore, though accidents may occur which lead to unexpected physical disasterand for which forms for healing may be given, yet the wise student will findthat the forms that affect the etheric body may be the first point of departure.These forms, built up in meditation, will act directly on the pranic channelsthat go to the makeup of the etheric—that intricate web which has itscounterpart in the circulatory system of the dense physical body. They are theseat of much of the present disease in that body, either directly or throughcauses set up on the emotional plane and reacting on the etheric.b. Forms for healing the emotional body. As said above, much of the presentsickness is due to causes set up in the emotional body and these causes aremainly three. I would point out that I but outline broadly and give generalindications.Violent emotion and unstable vibration. This, if indulged in, has a shatteringeffect and reacts on the nervous system. If suppressed and inhibited it has anequally dangerous effect, and results in a diseased condition of the liver, inbilious attacks, in the poisons which are generated in the system and find theiroutlet in certain cases of septic poisoning, in skin diseases, and in some formsof anemia.Fear and forebodings, worry and despair. These types of emotion—which are socommon—have a general debilitating effect on the system, leading to loss ofvitality, to sluggish action of the organs, and to many forms of obscurediseases of the nervous system, of the brain and of the spine. [160]Sex emotions , covering a very large range of feeling, ranging from thesuppressed sex emotion which is now beginning to be studied by our psychologiststo the unclean criminal emotion that finds its expression in violent orgies andlicense.Under all these heads many points may be gathered, but I write not letters onhealing, but letters on meditation, so I must not further enlarge.In the forms used in these three cases attention will be paid to the cause ofthe trouble, to the plane on which it originates, and to the effects on thelower bodies or body. In apportioning forms different aims will be in view.Where, for instance, the trouble is based on suppressed emotion, the effect ofthe form (when rightly followed) will be to transmute the emotion and turn itupward. When, by right use, the emotional body is cleared of the emotionalcongestion, the life-giving forces of the Ego, and of the pranic life everywhereavailable, will be set free. They can then circulate with facility, tuning upthe entire system and cleansing all organs that were suffering from the innercongestion.c. Forms for mental healing . These will be, for the majority of you, much moreobscure, and in fact mental trouble is far more difficult to cure than either ofthe other two. This is due to two causes, one being that our polarisation as arace is not yet in the mental body. It is always much more easy to contact abody and to manipulate it when it is the seat of the centre of consciousness.The emotional body likewise, being more fluidic, is more easily impressed. Icannot enlarge upon the troubles of the mental body today save to point out thatthese causes may arise within the mental body itself as a karmic inheritance, ormay originate on the emotional plane and work their way back into the mentalbody. For instance, [161] a person may be prone to some emotional storm. This—ifpersisted in—may set up an analogous vibration in the mental body. Thisvibration in its turn may become practically permanent, and by the interactionof these two bodies serious trouble may be set up. This trouble may go all theway from simply causing a general souring of the Personality, so that the man isrecognized as an unhappy, unpleasant individual, to definite brain disease,resulting in lunacy, brain tumours and cancer in the head.For all these troubles forms of meditation may be found which—if followed intime—will eventually dissipate them. The fundamental fact to be grasped here isthat only when the pupil has an intelligent appreciation of the trouble ortroubles affecting him, only when he has the ability to conscientiously followthe imparted formulas, and only when his object is unselfish, will he be trustedwith these forms. When his object is to equip himself for service, when he aimsonly at the acquirement of healthy vehicles for the better carrying out of theplan of the Great Ones, and when he desires not to escape disease for his ownpersonal benefit, only then will the formulas work in connection with the egoicconsciousness. The downflow of life from the God within results in soundvehicles, so that it is only as the Personality becomes merged in the Ego, andthe polarisation shifts from the lower to the higher that the work becomespossible. That time is nearing now for many, and progress in the new medicalschool—based on thought—can be looked for. Forms in meditation are but forms inthought matter, so that it will be apparent to you that a general beginning hasbeen made.One more hint on this matter I give:—Through the various centres of thebody—those seven centres with [162] which the pupil has to do—will come thepower to heal the corresponding physical centre. As the centres are vitalisedcertain physical effects will be demonstrable, and in specific forms that workon and through the centres will come results that may throw light on thisobscure matter of healing through the subtle bodies.August 20, 1920.Mantric forms.We must today continue the discussion on the forms that will some day be incommon use among the students of occult meditation. We have touched upon threeof the forms, and five more remain to be dealt with.Mantric forms are collections of phrases, words, and sounds which by virtue ofrhythmic effect achieve results that would not be possible apart from them.These mantric forms are too numerous to study here; suffice it to indicatesomewhat the types of mantrams there will be in use, or are now in use amongthose privileged to use them.There are mantric forms based entirely on the Sacred Word. These, soundedrhythmically and on certain keys, accomplish certain results, such as theinvoking of protective angels; they lead to certain effects, either objective orsubjective. These forms or mantrams are much more in use among orientals and inthe eastern faiths than at present among occidentals. As the power of sound ismore completely understood and its effect studied, these mantrams will beadopted in the occident.Some of them are very old and when enunciated in the original Sanskrit haveunbelievably powerful effects. So powerful are they that they are not permittedto be [163] known by the ordinary student and are only orally imparted duringpreparation for initiation.There are a few very esoteric mantrams that exist in the original Sensa, andthat have remained in the knowledge of the Brotherhood from the early days ofthe founding of the Hierarchy. They were brought by the Lords of Flame when Theycame to earth and are only thirty-five in number. They form the key that unlocksthe mysteries of each subplane on the five planes of human evolution. The adeptreceives instruction on their use, and can employ them in the right place andsubject to certain conditions. They are the most powerful known on our planetand their effects are far-reaching. As you know, each plane vibration respondsto a different key and note, and its matter is manipulated, and its currenttapped, by the sounding of certain words in a specific manner, and in a specifictone. When so sounded, the adept enters into the consciousness of that plane andof all contained therein. Mantrams in any tongue are founded on them, eventhough so far removed and unlike as to be practically useless.Certain of these original mantrams are chanted in unison by the Brotherhood ongreat occasions, or when the united power of the Lodge is required to effectdesired ends. Great events are inaugurated by the sounding of their key notewith appropriate words employed; each root-race has its mantric chord known tothose who work with races.Again there are, as you know, certain mantrams in Sanskrit that are employed bystudents in meditation to call the attention of some one Master. These mantramsare communicated to Their disciples, and by their means the Master's attentionis attracted, and His assistance called for. [164]Other and greater formulas are sometimes imparted by which the three Great Lordsmay be contacted, and Their attention drawn in any specific direction.A mantram, when rightly sounded forth, creates a vacuum in matter, resembling afunnel. This funnel is formed betwixt the one who sounds it forth and the onewho is reached by the sound. There is then formed a direct channel ofcommunication. You will see therefore why it is that these forms are socarefully guarded and the words and keys concealed. Their indiscriminate usewould but result in disaster. A certain point in evolution has to be reached,and a similarity of vibration somewhat achieved, before the privilege isafforded the pupil of being custodian of a mantram whereby he may call hisMaster.There are also seven mantrams that are known to the three Great Lords and theHeads of the Hierarchy, whereby They can call the seven Planetary Logoi, or theseven “Spirits before the Throne” as They are called in the Christian Bible. Oneof these mantrams, which causes contact with the Logos of our planet, is knownto the adepts as well. So the scale is mounted, and the Words are sounded forth,until we reach the mantram of our planet, which is based on the key of theEarth, and embodies a phrase which sums up our evolution. Each planet has somesuch note or phrase whereby its guides may contact their Planetary Logos. Theseven Logoi in Their turn have Their available ritual or form whereby They cancommunicate with the threefold Lord of the Solar System. This is done alwaysfour times a year, or when urgent need arises.Once a year the entire Hierarchy employs a composite mantram that creates avacuum between the highest and the lowest members of that Hierarchy and onup—via the seven Planetary Logoi—to the Logos Himself. It marks [165] the momentof intensest spiritual effort and vitalisation during the year, and its effectslast throughout the intervening months. Its effect is cosmic, and links us upwith our cosmic centre.Ray mantrams. Each ray has its own formulas and sounds which have a vital effectupon the units gathered on those rays. The effect of sounding it by the studentof meditation is threefold:1. It links him and aligns him with his Higher self or Ego.2. It puts him in contact with his Master, and through that Master with one ofthe great Lords,—dependent upon the ray.3. It links him with his egoic group and binds all into one composite whole,vibrating to one note.These mantrams are one of the secrets of the last three initiations and may notbe sounded by the pupil before that time without permission, though he mayparticipate at times in the chanting of the mantram under the Master'sdirection.Mantrams, or formulas of words, sung by the pupil, which have direct effect onone of the three bodies. These mantrams are largely already in use—though in amuch distorted degree—in the services of the religious bodies in all lands. Somelight on them is being communicated in the ritual of the Church..........Thepasswords as used in Masonry—though practically valueless now—based on the useof mantrams and some day when there is an Initiate Head to all theseorganisations (such as Masonry, various esoteric societies, and religiousbodies) the old mantrams will be given back in pure form to the peoples. [166]There are also mantrams for use in healing, and for the development of certainpsychic faculties. Some mantrams have a direct effect on the centres of thebody, and will later be used under the guidance of the Master for increasingvibration, for causing fourth dimensional movement, and for the completevivification of the centre.Still other mantrams act upon the hidden fire, but I will deal with them alittle later. There are numerous oriental books on the subject, which is so vasta one that I caution the student from investigating much. It would but prove forthe worker in the world a waste of time. I have touched upon the matter becauseno book on meditation would be complete without a reference to what will someday supersede all preliminary meditation. When the race has reached a certainpoint of development, and when the higher mind holds greater sway, these occultmantrams—rightly imparted and rightly enunciated—will be part of the ordinarycurriculum of the student. He will start his meditation by the use of his raymantram, thereby adjusting his position in the scheme; he will follow this withthe mantram that calls his Master, and which puts him en rapport with theHierarchy. Then he will begin to meditate with his bodies adjusted, and with thevacuum formed that may then be used as a medium of communication.August 13th, 1920Forms used in one of the three departments.The interest of what I have to communicate today is very great, for we have totake up the matter of the forms used in the Departments of the Manu, the WorldTeacher and the Mahachohan, the Lord of Civilisation.These three Departments represent in the Hierarchy the three aspects of theLogos as manifested in the solar [167] system,—the Aspect of Will or Power, theAspect of Love and Wisdom (which is the basic aspect for this system), and theAspect of Activity or Intelligence. You know from your studies the workundertaken by these departments.The Manu manipulates matter and is occupied with the evolution of form, whetherit is the dense physical form of animal, mineral, flower, human being or planet,or the form of races, nations, devas or the other evolutions.The Bodhisattva or World Teacher works with the evolving life within the form,with the implanting of religious ideas and with the development of philosophicalconcepts both in individuals and races.The Mahachohan, who synthesises the four lower rays, deals with mind orintelligence, and, in collaboration with His Brothers, controls the evolution ofmind whereby the Spirit or Self utilises the form or the Not-Self.The synthetic work of the three Great Lords is inconceivably great.Form-Life-Intelligence, Matter-Spirit-Mind, Prakriti-Purusha-Manas, are thethree lines of development, and in their synthesis comes completeness.Each of these three lines works through formulas, or through set forms, which bygraded steps put the man who employs the form in touch with the particular lineof evolution represented by the Head of that line.................What I seek to bring out here are the three clear lines wherebya man may mount to the Logos and find union with the self of the Solar System.He can mount by the line of the Manu, he can attain through the line of theBodhisattva, or he can reach his goal via the path of the Mahachohan. Butspecially note, that on this planet the Lord of Love and Power, the firstKumara, is the focal point for all three departments. He [168] is the OneInitiator, and whether a man works on the line of power, or on the line of love,or on the line of intelligence, he must finally find his goal on the syntheticRay of Love and Wisdom. He must be love, and manifest it forth, but it may belove working through power. It may be love in harmony, or love working throughknowledge, through ceremonial or devotion, or it may be just pure love andwisdom, blending all the others. Love was the source, love is the goal, and lovethe method of attainment.August 14th, 1920.The three lines of approach.As you will note (in continuation of that which we studied yesterday) there arethree direct lines of contact between the higher and the lower, all findingtheir focal point through the same Initiator, and all, at the same time, quitedistinct in their method of approach. If this is borne in mind it will beapparent that each provides for the man (whose egoic note is one of the three,or a department of the third) the line of least resistance and the path wherebyhe may most easily approach the Ultimate. It is fundamentally a matter dealingwith various states of consciousness, and here it is that the Great Ones sopowerfully assist the student. Through meditation, adjusted to the desired line,the student can control step by step the various intermediate states that liebetween him and his goal. He rises by means of various focal points of force.These focal points may be his Higher Self, they may be his Master, they may bean ideal.......But they are only steps upon the ladder whereby expansions ofconsciousness are obtained, and the man is enabled to extend the periphery ofhis consciousness until he gradually embraces all, and merges at last with theMonad, and later [169] with the All-Self, the Logos Himself.For the sake of clarity and in order to satisfy the craving of the concrete mindfor differentiation these three departments are pictured as distinct andseparated the one from the other, though having their points of contact. Inreality—apart from the illusion that mind always sets up—the three are one, andthe seven are but blended parts of one synthetic whole. They all interface andintermingle. All the three departments are but necessary parts of oneorganisation over which the Lord of the World rules. They are but the executivesoffices in which the business of our planet is handled, and each office isdependent upon the other offices, and all work in the closest collaboration. Theman who finds himself on one line has to remember that in time and beforeperfection is achieved he must realise the synthesis of the whole. He must graspit as a fact past all questioning and not just as a mental concept, and in hismeditation there will eventually come a point when this realisation of theessential unity will be his and he will know himself as a fragment of a vasterwhole.In these three departments the method of approach to the Head of the Departmentis meditation, and the means whereby the student puts himself en rapport withthe essential Life of that department (it is all a matter of terms) differ. Thelife within the form manifests—as a result of meditation—in three differentways. The results of meditation as demonstrated in terms of character, if I mayso express it, are really the same aspects of manifestation under differentterms or conditions. Let me tabulate them for you:—Line of the Manu...Force, Strength, Power to rule. [170]Line of the Bodhisattva...Magnetism, Attraction, Healing.Line of the Mahachohan...Electricity, Synthesis, Organisation.I seek here to point out that the effect in the life of the student ofmeditation on one of these three lines will be as enumerated above, though allof course coloured and modified by his personality ray, and by the pointattained in evolution. If you study the three words applied to the three linesyou will find it very illuminating. (I seek not to enlarge the mental body butto train the intuition.) These words demonstrate the law as working through thethree groups, and the working out into active expression in the three worlds ofthe due following of the desired line. Each line has its specific forms wherebythose results are achieved, and the time is coming when the rudiments of theseforms (the first fundamental formulas) will be given to students deemed readyand who have done the necessary preliminary work.1. The line of the Manu.We might here somewhat indicate the approximate method, and lay down certainrules which will serve to elucidate when the time comes.This first line is specially the line of government, of racial, development, ofworking in and with the matter of all forms on all the planes of humanevolution. It is, as I have said before, the line of occultism. It emphasisesthe hierarchical method, it embodies the divine autocracy, and it is the linewhereby our solar Logos imposes His Will on men. It is closely linked to theLords of Karma, and it is through the Manu's department that the Law of Causeand Effect is wielded. The four Lords of Karma work closely with the Manu, forThey impose the Law, and [171] He manipulates the forms of men, of continents,of races, and of nations so that that law may be duly worked out.The man therefore who attempts through meditation to contact these powers, torise to union by these means, and to attain the consciousness of the Willaspect, works under set rules, rises from point to point under due forms, andbroods ever on the Law and its workings. He seeks to understand, hediscriminates and studies; he is occupied with the concrete and its place in thedivine plan. He admits the fact of the indwelling life but concentratesprimarily on its method and form of manifestation. The basic rules of expressionand of government occupy his attention, and by studying the rules and laws, andby seeking to comprehend, he necessarily contacts the Ruler. From stage to stagehe rises—from the ruler of the microcosm in the three worlds, to the group egoicand its focal point, a Master; from the ruler of the group he rises to the Manu,the Ruler of the department wherein he has his place, thence to the Ruler of theWorld, later to the Planetary Logos, and thence to the Solar Logos.2. The line of the Bodhisattva.This is the line of religion and of philosophy, and of the development of theindwelling life. It deals with consciousness within the form more than with theform itself. It is the line of least resistance for the many. It embodies thewisdom aspect of the Logos, and is the line whereby His love is manifested in apredominant fashion. The solar system being in itself a direct expression of theLogos, and of His love aspect, all in manifestation is based upon it—love inrule, love abounding, love in activity,—but in this second line the abovemanifestation is supreme, and will eventually absorb all the others.The man who meditates on this line seeks ever to enter into the consciousness ofall that breathes, and by [172] graded expansions of consciousness to arriveeventually at the All-Consciousness, and to enter into the life of the SupremeBeing. Thus he enters into the life of all within the Logoic Consciousness.He broods not so much upon the Law as upon the life that is governed by thatLaw. Through love he comprehends, and through love he blends himself first withhis Ego, then with his Master, next with his group egoic and then with allgroups, till finally he enters into the consciousness of the Deity Himself.3. The line of the Mahachohan.This is the line of mind or intelligence, of knowledge and of science. It is theline of abstract mind, and of archetypal ideas. The man broods not so much uponthe Law, not so much upon the Life, as upon the effects of both inmanifestation, and upon the reason why. The man on this fivefold line ever askswhy, and how, and whence, and seeks to synthesise, to comprehend and to make thearchetypes and ideals facts in manifestation. He broods on the ideals as hesenses them; he aims at contacting the Universal Mind, at wresting its secretsfrom it, and giving them expression. It is the line of business organisation,the line also in which the artists, musicians, scientists and the workers of theworld have their place. The Spirits of Love and Activity pass much time in eachof its five departments before passing on to the lines of love and of power.In meditation the man takes some ideal, some part of the divine plan, some phaseof beauty and of art, some scientific or racial problem, and by brooding over itand by the employment of lower mind, finds out all that can be known and sensed.Then, having done all that, he seeks to raise the consciousness still highertill he taps the source of illumination, and gains the light and information[173] required. He mounts likewise by entering into the consciousness of thosegreater than himself, not so much from the point of view of love (as in thesecond line) as from admiration and joy in their achievement, and gratitude forwhat they have given to the world, and devotion to the same idea that impelsthem to action.Therefore you will see from even the most superficial study of the above threelines how apparent it is that all the sons of men are rising. Even the ones—soapt to be despised—who are the active workers of the world may, in their placeand through their devotion to the ideals of work or science or even of businessorganisation, be just as far advanced as the more highly considered ones whodemonstrate more patently the love aspect of the Divine Self. Forget not thatactivity is just as divine and just as fundamentally an expression of theAll-Father as love in sacrifice, and even more so than what we now know aspower, for the power aspect is as yet not comprehended by any of you, nor willit be until a further manifestation.August 14th, 1920.Forms used in calling devas and elementals.In taking up the two points that you have enumerated six and seven, we shall beable to deal with them as one, for the mantrams and forms used in contacting thedevas, angels or builders, and in calling the elementals or subhuman forms ofexistence, are practically the same, and should in these letters be counted assuch.As a preliminary step let us be quite clear wherein lies the distinction betweenthese two groups.The elementals are, in their essential essence, subhuman. The fact that they canhe contacted on the emotional plane is no guarantee that they are on theevolutionary [174] path. On the contrary, they are on the path of involution, onthe downward arc. They are to be found on all planes, and the etheric elementalforms—such as the brownies, gnomes and pixies—are well known. They can beroughly divided into four groups:—1. The elementals of earth.2. The elementals of water.3. The elementals of air.4. The elementals of fire.They are the essence of things, if you could but realise it. They are theelemental things of the solar system in their four grades as we know them inthis fourth cycle on the fourth or earth planet.The devas are on the evolutionary path, on the upward way. They are, as youknow, the Builders of the system, working in graded and serried ranks. Devas areto be found of the same rank as the Planetary Logoi, and the Rulers of the fiveplanes of human evolution hold rank equal to that of a Master of the seventhInitiation. Others are equal in development (along their own line) to a Masterof the fifth Initiation, and they work consciously and willingly with theMasters of the Occult Hierarchy. They can be found on all the lesser grades downto the little building devas who work practically unconsciously in their groups,building the many forms necessitated by the evolving life.Earlier—prior to my dictating these letters to you—you received onecommunication along the line of the mantric invocation of the elementals and thedevas. The information given was correct, as far as it went, and you may if youwish incorporate it here.“Force in evolution and force in involution are two different things. That is apreliminary statement. [175] In the one you have destruction, violence, blindelementary powers at work. In involution it is the elementals who do most of thework, working blindly along as controlled by the Builders. The work isconstructive, cohesive, a gradual growing together, harmony out of discord,beauty out of chaos. The lower kingdoms of the devas work, guided by the greatBuilding Devas, and all move upward in ordered beauty from plane to plane, fromsystem to system, universe to universe. Therefore in studying occult lore youneed to remember two things:—a. You control elemental forces.b. You co-operate with the devas.In one you dominate, in the other case you endeavour to work with. You controlthrough the activity aspect , by the definite doing of certain things, by thepreparation of certain ceremonies, for instance, through which certain forcescan play. It is a replica on a tiny miniature scale of what the third Logos didin world making. Certain activities had certain results. Later on, revelationscan be made as to the rites and ceremonies through which you can get in touchwith the various elementals, and control them. The Ceremonial Ray—by coming intoincarnation at this time, is making things much easier along this particularline.Fire elementals, water sprites, and the lower elementals can all be harnessed byrites. The rites are of three kinds:—1. Protective rites, which concern your own protection.2. Rites of appeal, which call and reveal the elementals. [176]3. Rites that control and direct them when summoned.In working with the devas you use the wisdom or love aspect, the second aspectof the Logos, the building aspect. Through love and longing you reach them andyour first step (as you are on the path of evolution, as they are) is to get intouch with them, for together you must work in the future for the guidance ofthe elemental forces and the helping of humanity. It is not safe for humanbeings, poor foolish things, to tamper with the forces of involution until theythemselves are linked with the devas through purity of character and nobility ofsoul.Through rites and ceremonies you can sense the devas and reach them, but not inthe same manner nor for the same reason that you can the elementals. The devasattend ceremonies freely and are not summoned; they come, as you do, to tap thepower. When your vibrations are pure enough the ceremonies serve as a commonmeeting-ground.............I want to say in closing that when you have learned to use theactivity aspect in work with the involutionary powers, and the wisdom aspect inco-operating with the devas, you will then unitedly pass on to use the firstaspect, that of will or power.”Before proceeding further I seek to sound a note of warning as to the dangerthat lies in the calling and the contacting of these groups of builders, andmore especially in the contacting of the elemental forces. Why especially thelatter? Because these forces at all times find a response in one of the threelower bodies of men, these bodies (regarded as separated sheaths) being composedof these involutionary lives. Therefore he who unwittingly lays [177] himselfopen to direct contact with any elemental, runs a risk, and may bitterly rue theday. But, as a man approaches adeptship and has achieved mastery over himself,and can consequently be trusted with the mastery of other forms of life, certainpowers will be his. These powers—based as they are on law—will put into hishands the rule over lesser lives, and will teach him that co-operation with thedeva hosts which will be so essential towards the latter end of evolution.Mantrams of power.The mantrams that hold the secret of power are, as you know and have been toldabove, of different kinds, and are primarily four:a. Of prime importance are the protective mantrams.b. The mantrams that call the elementals and lesser devas, and bring them intothe magnetic radius of the one who calls.c. The mantrams that impose upon the elementals and lesser devas the will of theone who calls.d. Mantrams that break the charm, if I may put it so, and place the elementalsand devas again outside the magnetic radius of the caller.These four groups of mantrams refer especially to the calling and contacting ofthe lesser grades and are not much used, except in rare cases by initiates andadepts, who, as a general rule, work through the instrumentality of the greatguiding devas and builders. The Dark Brotherhood work with the forces ofinvolution and bend to their will the unwitting lesser forms of life. The trueprocedure—as followed by the Brotherhood of Light—is to control theseinvolutionary groups and low grade devas [178] through their own superior ranks,the cohorts of the building devas with their Deva Lords.This brings me to another group of mantrams used in connection with the devasthemselves.a. Rhythmic mantrams, that put the one who uses them in contact with the devagroup he seeks. These mantrams are, of course, forms of Ray Mantrams, for theycall the devas on some one ray. These mantrams again will vary if the manhimself is on the same ray as the group he calls. You ask why protectivemantrams are not used first as in the case of calling elementals. Principallyfor the following reason. The mantrams calling elementals are more easily foundand used than those calling the devas. History is full of instances of wherethis has been done, and all over the world (even at this time) are people whohold the secret that will put them in touch with elementals of one kind oranother. Everyone in Atlantean days knew how to do this, and among savagepeoples and by some individuals in civilised countries the art is still knownand practised. Secondly, the average man, even if he knows the mantram, willprobably fail in calling a deva, for it involves something more than justchanting the words and sounds. This something is one of the secrets ofinitiation. When a man is an initiate or an adept he needs not the protectiverites, for it is a law in the occult world that only those of pure life andunselfish motive can successfully reach the deva evolution, whereas inconnection with the elementary lives it works the other way.b. Mantrams that permit of intercourse with the devas once they have beencalled. Speech, as we know it, is not understood by the devas, but impulses,forces, vibrations can be set up by the use of specific forms that lead to thedesired result and obviate the need of speech. [179] These forms open theavenues of mutual comprehension.c. Mantrams that influence groups, and others that influence specific devas. Iwould like to point out here that as a rule devas are handled in groups and notas individuals until you contact devas of a very high order.d. Mantrams that directly call the attention of one of the deva lords of asubplane, or the mighty Deva Lord of a plane. They are known to very few and areonly used by those who have taken high initiation.August 17th, 1920.The comprehension of force.......The tension today is great, and the force pouring in on all the differentcentres is apt—unless duly regulated—to cause a feeling of fatigue, of tension,of excitement and of restlessness. The secret of regulation which lies innon-resistance is known to very few, and consequently the intensity of emotion,the violent reactions, and present widespread era of crime are the results, verylargely, of force misused and misapplied. This can be seen demonstrating in allranks of life, and only he who knows the secret of being naught but a channel,and who abides still within the secret place, can pass through the presentcrisis without undue shattering and pain. Stimulation—such as is at presentabroad—leads to pain and consequent reaction and must be guarded against with asmuch care as its opposite, loss of vitality—guarded against, not in the sense ofshutting oneself off from stimulating force but of receiving that force, passingit through one's being, and only absorbing as much of it as one can carry. Theresidue will then pass out from one as a healing agency on its return to thegeneral reservoir. The true and occult significant of force in nature, of theelectrical [180] currents of the universe, and of the latent heat stored in allforms is little understood as yet by your exoteric scientists, or your would-beoccult students.......approached the study of occultism from this angle, andtherefore, he attained a profound knowledge of law.I have touched on this matter as it lies back of all instruction along occultlines. If you can grasp somewhat its meaning, and understand how the law is butthe adaptation of the form to some one or other of these great streams of force,you will illuminate your whole life and be carried on those streams of force,those magnetic currents, that vital fluid, those electrical rays (no matter whatthe terms used) right to the heart of the unknown.This same idea of force and of the magnetic currents of the solar system governsall I have imparted on meditation in all its branches—specific, individual andcollective, based on form or formless; it is the medium through which themantrams work, from those that touch the elemental lives up to the great Wordschanted in rhythm that call the Lord of a Ray, the Deva of a Plane, or the Lordof a Solar System Himself. The sounding of these Words, the ascent throughgraded forms to some specific point, and the chanting of mantrams but put theone who is thus working into the line of some one stream of force. It is thefinding of the line of least resistance whereby to reach some goal, tocommunicate with some individual Intelligence, to control some involutionarylife, and to contact and co-operate with some group of devas. The abovedigression may serve somewhat to sum up what I have lately imparted anent forms,mantric or otherwise, as used by the student of occult meditation.As may be imagined, the calling of either the devas or the elementals can onlybe safely undertaken by one who has the power to utilise them wisely whencalled, [181] hence the mantrams we have enumerated above are only put into thehands of those who are on the side of the constructive forces of the system, orwho can constructively control the destructive elements, bending them into linewith the disintegrating forces that are themselves part of the greatconstructive scheme. Should anyone—not thus capable—be able to contact thedevas, and, through the use of mantrams gather them to him, he would find thatthe force they carry would descend on him as a destructive one, and seriousconsequences might result in one or other of his bodies.Think this out, therefore, remembering that those dangers would lie along theline of over-stimulation, of sudden shattering, and of disintegration throughfire or heat. Should he gather involutionary lives around him the dangers wouldbe different or rather would demonstrate in the opposite effect,—such as loss ofvitality due to vampirism, a sucking out of the forces of one or another of hisbodies, an abnormal building in of material into some one body (due to theaction of such involutionary lives as the physical or desire elementals), anddeath through water, earth or fire, understood in an occult sense.I have dealt here with the risks run by anyone who calls within his magneticradius either of these two groups, without possessing the necessary knowledge toprotect, to control and to use. Why have I dealt with this subject at all?Because these magic forms exist, and will be used and known when the student isready, and the work requires it. Some day the lesser forms will be graduallygiven out to those who have prepared themselves, and who unselfishly work forthe helping of the race. As I said earlier, these were known in Atlantean days.They led to dire results at that time, for they were used by those of uncleanlife, for selfish ends and evil purpose. They called [182] the elemental hoststo perpetuate their vengeance on their enemies; they called the lesser devas,and utilised their powers to further their ambitions; they sought not toco-operate with the law, but to wield that law for physical plane schemes whichoriginated in their desires. The ruling Hierarchy deemed the danger too great,for the evolution of men and devas was threatened, so They withdrew graduallyfrom the human consciousness the knowledge of the formulas and Words until sucha time as the reason was developed somewhat, and the spiritual mind showed signsof awakening. In this way the two great evolutions, and the latent thirdevolution (composed of involutionary lives) were separated and shut off fromeach other. Temporarily the whole scale of vibration was slowed down for theoriginal purpose had been a parallel development. The secret of this apparentsetting back of the plans of the Logos lies hid in the remnants of active cosmicEvil that had found their way into manifestation,—a remnant of the first oractivity solar system, and the basis of this, the love system. Evil is but thesediment of unfinished karma and has its root in ignorance.This separation on a threefold scale of the evolving and the involving lives hascontinued up to date. With the coming in of this seventh Ray of CeremonialMagic, a tentative approximation of the two evolving groups is to be somewhatpermitted, though not as yet with the involving group. Remember this statement.The deva and human evolution will, during the next five hundred years, becomesomewhat more conscious of each other, and be able therefore more freely toco-operate. With this growing consciousness will be found a seeking aftermethods of communication. When the need of communication for constructive endsis sincerely felt, then, under the judicious guidance of the Masters, willcertain of the old mantrams [183] be permitted circulation. Their action,interaction and reaction will be closely studied and watched. It is hoped thatthe benefit to both groups will be mutual. The human evolution should givestrength to the deva, and the deva, joy to the human. Man should communicate tothe devas the objective point of view, while they in turn will pour in on himtheir healing magnetism. They are the custodians of prana, magnetism andvitality, just as man is the custodian of the fifth principle, or manas. I havegiven several hints here and more is not possible.Tomorrow we will take up perhaps the most vitally interesting division on formsconnected with fire. Today the matter imparted suffices.August 19th, 1920.Mantric forms connected with fire.Perhaps it would be of value if I touched somewhat upon the part fire plays inevolution and on the various departments connected with fire that may be foundwithin our solar system. I especially emphasise it because in meditation thedomain of fire is entered, and because of its prime importance. The departmentsin which fire plays its part are five. Let us therefore enumerate them. I willdeal first with fire in the Macrocosm, and later show its microcosmiccorrespondence.l—The vital fire that animates the objective solar system. For instance, asevidenced in the internal economy of our planet, and the central ball of fire,the sun.2—That mysterious something called by H. P. B. Fohat, of which some of themanifestations are electricity, certain forms of light, and the magnetic fluidwherever encountered.3—The fire of the mental plane. [184]4—The fire elementals who, in their essence, are fire itself.5—The vital spark we call the “divine flame,” latent in each human being, whichdistinguishes our solar Logos from all other Logoi, and which is the sum of allHis characteristics. “Our God is a consuming Fire.”All these differentiations of fire are practically differentiations of one andthe same thing; they are basically the same though in manifestation they arediverse. They originated fundamentally from cosmic fire found on the cosmicmental levels. In the Microcosm you find this fivefold differentiation again,and it is in the recognition of this correspondence that illumination comes, andthe purpose of meditation is achieved.1—The vital fires that keep the internal economy of the human being,—themicrocosmic system—in full manifestation. At the cessation of that innerburning, death ensues, and the physical objective system passes intoobscuration. So it is in the Macrocosm. Just as the sun is the centre for oursystem, so the heart is the focal point for the microcosmic heat; similarly, asthe earth is vitalised by the same heat and is, for our chain, the point ofdensest matter, and of greatest physical heat, so the lower generative organsare the secondary centre in the majority of cases for the internal fire. Thecorrespondence is accurate, mysterious and interesting.2—The correspondence in the Microcosm to Fohat is found in the pranic currentsthat, through the etheric body, keep the dense physical vitalised andmagnetised. The resources of the pranic fluid are illimitable and littleunderstood, and in their [185] proper comprehension lies the secret of perfecthealth. We will touch upon this later.3—The correspondence to the fire of the mental plane is easily demonstrable. Forthe work of the Lords of Flame in implanting the spark of mind has so developedand grown, that now the fire of intellect is to be seen burning in all civilisedpeoples. All energies are turned to the feeding of that spark and the turning ofit to the greatest profit.4—The fire elementals are known in some measure in the microcosm by thethoughtforms conjured up and vitalised by the man whose thought power sufficesto do so. These thoughtforms, built by the man who can think strongly, arevitalised by his life or capacity to heat, and last as long as he has the powerso to animate them. This is not for long at this time as the real power ofthought is little comprehended. In the fifth great cycle, which for this chainwill see the culmination of the fifth principle of mind, this correspondencewill be more understood. At present the connection is necessarily obscure.5—The vital spark latent in each human being which marks him out as of the samenature as the Solar Logos.Here you have fire as it may be seen in the greater and the lesser systems. Iwould here sum up for you the purpose of fire in the microcosm, and what must beaimed at. You have the three fires:l—The vital divine spark.2—The spark of mind.3—Kundalini, the twofold blending of the internal heat and of the praniccurrent. The home of this [186] force is the centre at the base of the spine andthe spleen as a feeder of that heat.When these three fires—that of the quaternary, of the triad and of the fifthprinciple—meet and blend in proper geometrical manner, each centre is adequatelyvitalised, every power is sufficiently expressing itself, all impurity and drossis burnt away, and the goal is reached. The spark has become a flame, and theflame is part of the great egoic blaze which animates all of the objectiveuniverse.Therefore, we are brought logically to the position that there will be for thesethree types of mantrams another mantram which will bring about their union andmerging. You have in fact:—Mantrams that affect kundalini, and arouse it in the right manner. By the powerof the vibration they send it circulating through the centres according to theirnatural, geometrical progression. A secondary branch of these mantrams dealswith the spleen, and the control of the pranic fluids for the purpose of health,for vitalisation, and for affecting the fire at the base of the spine.Mantrams that work on the matter of the mental plane, on one or other of its twomain divisions,—abstract and concrete,—and which work there in a twofold manner,producing an increased capacity to think, wield or manipulate mental matter,and, acting as a stimulant to the causal body, fit it more rapidly as a vehicleof consciousness, and prepare it for the final disintegration which is effectedby fire.Mantrams that evoke the God within, and work specifically on the Ego. Fromthence they set up a [187] strong vibration within the higher Triad, and socause a downflow of the monadic force into the causal body. All these mantramscan be used separately, and achieve their own result.There are seven great mantrams, one for each ray, that (when used by the Masteror by a member of the Hierarchy) combine all the three effects. They arousekundalini, they work on the causal vehicle on the mental plane, and they set upa vibration in the Triad and thus effect an at-one-ment of the lower, the higherand the fifth principle. This is a reflection of what occurred at the coming ofthe Lords of Flame. It leads to complete unification, and marks the man outhenceforth as one in whom love demonstrates in action by the aid of illuminatedmind.These are the four most important mantrams as regards individual evolution anddevelopment, and are well-known to all those who train pupils for initiation.But by themselves, even if discovered by the unready, they could accomplishlittle, for their use must be accompanied by the power that comes from theapplication of the Rod of Initiation. This Rod, through its surmounting diamond,focuses the three fires in the same way that a burning glass reacts to the sun,and causes a conflagration.I have here given you a lot of information in very few words. The matter is muchcondensed. It has a special significance for the man who nears the Path ofInitiation. Ponder carefully on this which is imparted, for, by brooding upon itin the silence of the heart, light may come, and the inner fire glow withgreater heat.Other mantrams connected with fire can be further enumerated. There are twogroups that are contacted by the use of certain rhythmic sounds. [188]The fire elementals and their various hosts in the bowels of the earth, on thesurface of the earth, and in the air above the earth.The devas of the mental plane, who are essentially the devas of fire.With the mantrams affecting the elementals of fire there is nought to be said orimparted. They are, in many ways, the most dangerous and the most powerful ofthe elementals who attend to the earth economy. For one thing, they faroutnumber all the other elementals, and are found on every plane from thehighest to the lowest. The elementals of water or earth are found only incertain localities or spheres in the solar system, whilst the next most numerouselementals are those of air.Mantrams calling them, controlling and dismissing them, were in common use amongthe Atlanteans. The dangers aroused, and the menace stalking the land throughthe indiscriminate use of elementals, so disturbed the accurate working of thelogoic plans, and so displeased the Guides of the race that the knowledge waswithdrawn. The Atlantean root race passed away through disasters by water, byfloods, by submergings; when you remember that water is the natural enemy offire, and that the two groups of elementals have no point of at-one-ment at thisstage, you may be able to understand an interesting point about the Atlanteancataclysms.Mantrams calling the fire devas are equally well guarded, not only because ofthe dangers involved but because of the obstructions in time that are causedwhen these devas are heedlessly called and held by mantric charm from pursuingtheir necessary vocations. Under these two groups of mantric forms will be foundmany lesser groups which work specifically with different bands of elementalsand devas. [189]We have here enumerated six groups of mantrams connected with fire. There arestill a few more which I might briefly enumerate.Purificatory mantrams that awaken a fire that purifies, and burns on one of thethree lower planes. This is effected through the activity of elementals,controlled by fire devas, and under the direct guidance of an initiate ordisciple for some specific purificatory end. The end may be to cleanse some oneof the bodies or to purify a locality, a house or a temple.Mantrams that call down fire for the magnetisation of talismans, of stones andof sacred spots.Mantrams that bring about healing through the occult use of flame.The mantrams used:—a—By the Manu, in manipulating that which is necessary in the moving ofcontinents, and the submerging of lands.b—By the Bodhisattva, in stimulating the inner flame in each human being.c—By the Mahachohan, in His work with the intelligence, or the fifth principle.All these mantric forms and many others exist......The first step towards theattainment of these mantrams is the acquirement of the faculty of occultmeditation, for it is not the sounding of the words alone that bring about thedesired end but the mental concentration that visualises the results to beattained. This must be accompanied by the will that causes those results to bedominated by the one who chants the sounds. These mantric forms are dangerousand useless apart from the concentrated mental equilibrium of the man, and hispower to control and vitalise. [190]August 21, 1920.We come now to the last division of our sixth letter.4 - THE USE OF FORM COLLECTIVELY.I propose to take this up under three heads which for purposes of clarity wewill call:—l—The use of sound collectively in a meditation form.2—The use of rhythm collectively in meditation.3—Special occasions on which these forms are used.......We have rather exhaustively considered in this series of lettersindividual meditation and have taken up the subject from many and varied angles.In all our handling of the matter only enough has been communicated to arousethe interest of the student and to incite him to greater effort, closer study,and deeper investigation. Only that which is understood and grasped as a fact inexperience by the inner consciousness avails aught in the hard path of occultdevelopment. Theories and mental concepts avail not. They but increaseresponsibility. Only when these theories are put to the test, and areconsequently known to be facts in nature, and only when mental concepts arebrought down and demonstrated on the physical plane in practical experience, canthe student be in a position to point the way to other searchers, and to holdout a helping hand to those following behind. To say: “I hear” may prove helpfuland encouraging; to add to that the words “I believe” may carry added assurance,but to sound forth a trumpet note and say “I know” is the thing needed in thisone of the darkest hours of the Kali Yuga. The knowers are as yet few. Yet toknow is fully possible and is subject only to the diligence, the sincerity, andthe capacity of the pupil on the path to stand firm in suffering. [191]Now having some dim idea of the results to be achieved, and the methods to beemployed in individual meditation, and having enlarged a little on the use offorms by individuals, we can now take up the consideration of the matter fromthe collective standpoints.Some of the most important things to note about the collective use of forms arethat it has a universal vogue, is very effective, and can also be verydangerous. The collective worshipping of the Deity and the performance ofreligious rites in unison is so much a part of the public life of all peoplesthat its raison d'etre, and the results achieved, are apt to be overlooked.Every religion—Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Mohammedan, down to the distortedfetish worship of the most degraded race—has emphasised the value and efficiencyof a united attempt to contact the Divine. Results are inevitably achieved,ranging all the way from the calm and peaceful feeling that rests upon theparticipant in the Christian mysteries, to the frenzy and gyrations of thewildest dervish or the most benighted Zulu. The difference lies in the abilityof the worshipper to assimilate force, and in his capacity to hold and carry it.These points are decided by his place on the ladder of evolution, and by theemotional and mental control of which he may be possessed.The first postulate to remember in considering the collective use of form inmeditation is that those forms, in employing sound and rhythm, should open up afunnel of communication between those taking part in them and the Intelligencesor Powers they are seeking to approach. By the means of this funnel whichpenetrates from the physical to the emotional, or still higher to one or otherof the mental levels, the Intelligences or Powers are enabled to pour forthilluminating light or power of some kind or other into those who thus approachThem. The funnel [192] forms a channel whereby the contact can be made. Thewhole process is purely scientific and is based on vibration, and on a knowledgeof dynamics. It is dependent upon the accurate formation, through occultknowledge, of a vacuum. The occult statement that “Nature abhors a vacuum” isentirely true. When through the correct intoning of certain sounds, this vacuumor empty funnel between the higher and the lower is formed, force or power ofsome manifestation of fohatic energy pours into the funnel under the inevitableworking of the law, and, via that funnel, reaches its objective.It is on the misuse of this knowledge that much of what we call black art orevil magic is based. By means of invocation and forms the Dark Brothers (orthose who tamper with what you ignorantly term the powers of evil) tap forcesconnected with dark intelligences in high places. Thus they set in motionhappenings on the physical plane that have their origination in the darkmysterious caves of cosmic evil as found within our solar system. Equally so, itis possible to tap the still greater forces of light and good and to makeapplication of them on the side of evolution.The use of sound collectively in meditation forms.We will now take up the matter specifically from the standpoint of sound. In thestudy of the Sacred Word and its use we found that it had a triple effect,destructive, constructive and personal,—if I might so express it—or actingdirectly in a stimulating sense on the centres of the body. These three effectsmay be seen in the use of all sound collectively and by a large body of persons.We might enumerate still further for the sake of clarity a fourth effect, thatof the creation of a funnel. This fourth effect is but a synthesis of the othersin actuality, for adjustments [193] in the matter of the three lower planes haveto be made in this creation of a funnel of communication. Those adjustmentsresult first of all in the destruction of obstructing matter, and then in theconstruction of a funnel for use. This is very definitely effected through theinstrumentality of the centres. This latter point is of fundamental interest,and holds hid the secret of the most potent use of sound. That use is itsprojection in mental matter by means of one or other of the major centres. Theeffects achieved by a group of persons who have the power to work on mentallevels, and to employ simultaneously one of the major centres (either entirelythe head centre or one of the other major centres in connection with itscorresponding head centre) can be unbelievably powerful. It is well for the racethat as yet that power is not theirs. Only when united purity of motive and anunselfish adherence to the good of all can be found, will this power bepermitted to return to the common knowledge of men. As yet it is practicallyimpossible to get a sufficient number of people at the same stage of evolution,at the same point on the ladder, employing the same centre and responding to thesame ray vibration to meet in unison, and sound together the same note ormantram. They must also be animated by pure love, and work intelligently for thespiritual uplift of all.Part of the power of the Hierarchy is based on Their ability to do just thisvery thing. As evolution progresses, and the matter is more fully comprehended,meditation groups will change from their present status, which is that of bandsof earnest aspirants seeking illumination, to bands of workers constructivelyand intelligently working together for certain ends. You have in the ChristianBible the remnant of a tale which has descended to us from Atlantean days. Inthose days the use of sound on physical [194] and emotional levels wasunderstood and practised, being utilised for selfish ends in most of the cases.You read that at the sound of trumpets, sounded a certain number of times aftera rhythmical circuit of the walls of Jericho those walls collapsed. This wasmade possible by the occult knowledge of the leaders of the people who—beingversed in the science of sound and having studied its destructive and creativeeffects,—knew just the moment to apply that science and effect the desired end.These sounds can be grouped under three heads:—The united sounding of the Sacred Word.This is one of the most usual methods, and the most direct way of forming afunnel for the transmission of power. If it is so effective in the case of theindividual, as has been again and again demonstrated, surely its united use willbe tremendously effective, and even dangerously potent. It is the loss of theuse of this Word that has crippled and hindered the efficiency of all thepresent exoteric faiths, but this loss has been deliberately brought about owingto the dangers incident to the low point of evolution of the human hierarchy.When the use of this word is restored collectively, and when congregations ofmen can sound it correctly on the right note and in the right cadence or rhythm,then the downflow of force from above (the quality of that force depending onkey and tone) will be such that the vivification of the microcosm will affectthe surrounding country and environment. It will cause corresponding stimulationin all the kingdoms of nature, for the human kingdom forms a link between thehigher and the lower, and, in conjunction with the deva kingdom, provides ameeting ground for the forces of life.These effects upon the different centres will be definitely felt on one or otherplane in the three worlds. Let [195] me illustrate, for clarity is desired. Imust warn you however to bear in mind that no importance must be attached to theorder specified here. The time is not ripe for the opening up of accurateinformation on this matter.We will presume that a congregation of people is desirous of linking up withthat channel of force that works through the emotions, and so stimulates togreater aspiration and love. In united silence they will stand until, at a givenword from the leader, each unit in the group will deliberately withdraw hisconsciousness into the heart centre, and then from that heart centre (keepingthe consciousness steadily there) he will drive forth the sound of the SacredWord, pitched in the key to which the majority of the group respond. This keywill be ascertained by the clairvoyant group leader reviewing rapidly the aurasgathered before him. This sound will create the necessary funnel, and the resultwill be an immense temporary extension of the peripheries of the emotionalbodies of the participants, and an intense vitalisation of their heart centres.By means of this the people will be enabled to reach heights and receiveblessings otherwise not separately possible. You can for yourself think outother conditions. The use of the imagination in these matters is of realimportance and develops a connection between that faculty and its highercounterpart, the intuition. Students of meditation must learn to imagine more.The united sounding of certain mantrams which will be employed for specificpurposes. Instances of such purposes are:—a. The purification of a city.b. The magnetisation of grounds that are to be employed as healing centres.[196]c. The clarification of the minds of the congregation in order that they may beable to receive the higher illumination.d. The healing of people gathered together for that purpose.e. The controlling of the forces of nature so that physical plane occurrencesmay be brought about.f. The initiating of people into the Lesser Mysteries.In this paragraph, as you rightly think, lies material that enlarged would filla volume. It is part of that white magic that again will be restored to the raceand by means of which a glory and a civilisation will be attained that washinted at in Atlantean days, and is one of the dreams of the visionaries of therace.Mantrams or words sounded forth collectively by which the deva, or angelkingdom, will be communicated with. These are a peculiar set of mantramsconnected with the Mahachohan's department and I will take them up morespecifically later......August 22, 1920.The use of Rhythm Collectively in Meditation.Rhythm might be expressed as that cadenced movement which automatically swaysthose who employ it into line with certain of Nature's forces. It is thatdirected action, followed in unison by a body of people, which results incertain alignments and effects upon one or other of the bodies or on all. It hasfor its objects therefore:a. The swinging of a body, or a concourse of bodies, into the radius of actionof a stream of force.b. It causes an adjustment of the matter of one of the various bodies or of allthe bodies that go to the make-up of the personnel of a group. [197]c. It blends—under certain geometrical balances and arrangements—the auras ofthe differentiated units in a group, and causes these auras to form one unitedgroup aura, thereby permitting of the rhythmic flow of force in certainspecified directions, for certain specified ends.This has been well understood right down the ages, even though the methods,procedure and results have not been scientifically comprehended or tabulated,except by various occult and esoteric bodies. In the old, so-called pagan ritesthe value of rhythm was well understood and even David, the psalmist of Israel,danced before the Lord. The swaying of the body to a certain tempo, and theswinging of the framework of the physical vehicle in various directions, subjectat times to the musical sound of instruments, has a peculiar and definite effectupon the matter of the two subtler vehicles. By this rhythmic movement:1. The force that is tapped and put in touch with the causal.This is one of the main objects of the true rhythmic movement, distortions ofwhich come down to us through the centuries, and have their apotheosis in thelow type of modern dance. In the modern dance is found the corruptestmanifestation of rhythmic movement, and the main effect of the rhythm is thedirection of the force tapped by its means to the emotional vehicle, and to thelowest type of matter in that vehicle. This results on the physical [198] planein a most undesirable stimulation of the sex organs. In the true use of rhythmicmovement the effect is to align the three lower vehicles with the causalvehicle, and this lining up—when coupled with intensest aspiration and ardentdesire—results in a downflow of force from above. This causes a vivification ofthe three major centres and a definite illumination.When an entire concourse of people is thus animated by a single high desire,when their auras blend and form one united channel for the downflow, the effectis tremendously intensified and can be world-wide in its radius. You have aninstance of this in the wonderful Wesak festival, kept so universally in Indiato this day, when the Hierarchy forms itself into a channel for the transmissionof power and blessing from the levels on which the Buddha may be found. He actsas a focal point for that power, and—passing it through His Aura—pours it outover mankind by means of the channel provided by the assembled Lords, Masters,graded initiates and disciples. This channel is formed by the use of sound andrhythm simultaneously employed. By the chanting of a certain mantram by means ofthe slow, measured movements that accompany that chanting, the funnel is formedthat reaches upwards to the desired locality. The geometrical figures formed inthe matter of the plane higher than the physical (which are the result of thegeometrical movement of the concourse gathered in that Himalayan centre) formthemselves into wonderful avenues of approach to the centre of blessing for theinhabitants, deva or otherwise, from any particular plane. For those who canclairvoyantly view the scene, the beauty of the geometrical forms isunbelievable, and that beauty is enhanced by the radiant auras of the Great OnesWho are gathered there. [199]In time to come the value of the combination of music, chanting, and rhythmicmovement will be comprehended, and it will be utilised for the achieving ofcertain results. Groups of people will gather together to study the creativeeffects, or the purificatory efficacy of ordered sound joined to movement andunity; the constructive effect on the three bodies will be clairvoyantlystudied; the eliminative effect on the matter of those bodies will beschematically tabulated and all knowledge gained will be definitely applied tothe improvement of those bodies. The quality of the force tapped, and itsexhilarating, vivifying and stimulating effects will be closely watched. Thecentres will be studied in their relation to the streams of force contacted, andtheir culture and the intensification of the rotary movement will be definitelyundertaken.Another angle of the whole matter resolves itself into work in the world, andthough dependent on the status and personnel of the group, it is not primarilyfor group purposes. Groups will apply themselves to the work of contactingcertain types of logoic force, of passing it through the group funnel, and ofsending it out through the world for certain constructive ends. This work isclosely allied to that undertaken by the Nirmanakayas or Distributors of Force,and will be largely under their direction, for—when the right time comes—Theywill be able to use these groups as focal points for Their activities. Theirwork now has its focal point primarily on the mental plane and somewhat on theemotional. When the secret of causal alignment is better grasped, and whengroups of people in physical incarnation can work in real co-operation (animpossibility at present, for the personality looms as yet too large) then theNirmanakayas will be able to directly contact the physical plane, and so actwith great force upon the evolutions found thereon. [200]Healing groups will work as follows. The circle of workers, with the unit to behealed placed in their midst, will definitely apply themselves to the healing ofthat unit by the use of set mantrams, and by the following of certain movementsthey will cause the focal point of the downpouring force to be the sick memberin their midst. By the stimulating power of that force, by its re-buildingquality, or by its capacity to destroy and eliminate, what you call miracleswill be matters of everyday occurrence. The subject is too vast to be more thanhinted at here. But as the race progresses and the secret of making theat-one-ment is more comprehended, when many people tread the Probationary Path,when the percentage of initiates is greater than it is now, and when largenumbers of the human race are more directly aligned with the egoic body, youwill see the scientific application of the laws of sound and rhythm.At the same time you will see the misuse of those powers—a misuse that willherald in one of the final struggles between the Lords of Light and the Lords ofDarkness. Great will be the cataclysm and terrific the disaster, but ever theLight shines in darkness, and He Who reigns above all, and Who holds all withinthe circumference of His Aura knows the hour of opportunity, and knows too howto utilise that which can protect.Special occasions on which these forms will be employed.The great event on the planet in direct relation to the human race is the Wesakfestival. There is one still greater moment in the calendar when a funnel iscreated directly between the earth and the supreme Ruler himself, the Logos ofour system. This is accomplished through the power of certain mantrams and theunited efforts of the Hierarchy and the Deva Lords of the planes. These DevaLords are aided by the deva evolution, and the Hierarchy [201] by those of thehuman race who are steady. They focus through the Lords of the Rays then inmanifestation as well as through the Planetary Logos of this planet. The date ofthis event is not yet for exoteric communication.On all the three main lines of approach—that of the Manu, or Ruler, theBodhisattva, or World Teacher, and the Mahachohan, or Lord of Civilisation—theirown specific groups will be found, subject to certain mantrams and words, andmoving under certain rhythmic laws. One hint only can I give here but I thinkyou will find it interesting. The time is coming when those who work under theManu, manipulating nations, directing their attention to government andpolitics, sitting in the assemblies of the people, giving out the laws andapportioning justice, will begin all their work with great rhythmic ceremonies.By means of their united rhythm and chanted words, they will seek to putthemselves in touch with the consciousness of the Manu and with His greatgoverning department, so bringing more clearly into practice the working out ofHis plans and the formulation of His intentions. Having aligned their bodies andmade the necessary funnel, they will proceed with business after having placedin their midst as a focal point of illumination one or two men who will givetheir entire attention to finding out the intention of the Manu and Hissubordinates upon the matter in hand.So in the department of the Bodhisattva will a similar procedure be followed,for which the construction is already organised. The priest will be the focalpoint, and, after due ceremony and rhythm on the part of the unitedcongregation, they will be the transmitters of information from on high. Buthere is a momentous point of interest: The priesthood will not in those days bea separated body of men. All will then be priests and a [202] layman can holdthat office when duly chosen at the beginning of the ceremony. The onlyqualification required will be the capacity to align with the higher, and toco-operate with all the other units in the concourse.In the department of the Mahachohan, the Lord of Civilisation and Culture andthe head of the third line of evolution, you will see again similar action. Nouniversity or school will start its sessions without the ceremony of alignment,the teacher this time being the focal line of information from the departmentcontrolling the activity of the mind. In this way the stimulation of the mentalbodies of the students, and the strengthening of the channel between higher andlower mind will be greatly aided. The intuition will also be developed andcontacted. In the above statements I have by no means covered the ground. I havebut indicated the broad outlines of what will some day be facts in physicalplane demonstration. The thought conveys much matter for consideration and forspeculation and is full of helpfulness for the wise student. Aught that enlargeshis horizon and increases the range of his vision is to be welcomed, even thoughhis apprehension of these facts may be at fault and his capacity to assimilateleaves much to be desired."},{"pageContent":"LETTER VII - THE USE OF COLOUR AND SOUND.August 27th, 1920.[204] There is no question that those who break the law perish by the law,whilst those who keep it live it. The true study of occultism is the study ofthe why and how of phenomena. It is the finding out of the method wherebyresults are achieved, and it involves close analysis of events and circumstancesin order to discover their governing laws. I have been led to make thesepreliminary remarks today because I saw with clarity the questions that arecontrolling your mind. These questions are of great value, if you continue toapply yourself to the search for the right answer. Certain definite laws governthe life of the disciple. They are the same laws that control all life. Thedifference consists in the partial realisation—on the part of the disciple—ofthe purpose of those laws, their raison d'etre, and their conscious judiciousapplication to the circumstances met in daily living. By conformance to the lawis the personal life transmuted...Take for instance the Law of Substance . Thislaw puts the disciple in the position of wisely utilising the universalstorehouse. It is the manipulation of matter, and its adaptation to theinteracting forces of supply and demand...Blind faith is right for the mystic.It is one of the means whereby the Divine storehouse is entered, but tounderstand the method whereby that storehouse is kept replenished, and tocomprehend the means whereby the bounteous supply of the All Father is broughtin contact with the children's need is better still. One of those maxims I canhere give anent supply and demand. It is only as a skilful [205] use is made ofthe supply for the needs of the worker and the work (I choose these words eachone with deliberation) that that supply continues to pour in . The secret is:use, demand, take. Only as the door is unlocked by the law of demand is anotherand higher door unlocked permitting supply. The law of gravitation holds hid thesecret. Think this out.Some remarks on colour.Now we must go to work. The subject for our consideration this evening is ofprofound and complicated interest. This seventh letter of mine has to do withthe use of colour and sound in meditation.We have, as you know, dealt a good deal with the subject of sound in our earlierletters, both in studying the use of the Sacred Word, and in the study of formsand mantrams. It is a truism to say that sound is colour and colour is sound,yet so it is, and the topic I really seek to bring to your attention is not somuch sound as sound, but the colour effects of sound. I seek to emphasiseespecially the colour aspect in this letter, begging you to remember always thatall sounds express themselves in colour.When the Logos uttered the great cosmic Word for this solar system, three majorstreams of colour issued forth, breaking almost simultaneously into anotherfour, so giving us the seven streams of colour by which manifestation becomespossible. These colours are:—1. Blue.2. Indigo.3. Green.4. Yellow.5. Orange.6. Red.7. Violet. [206]Not unwittingly have I placed them in this order but the exact significance isleft for you to discover.I want to emphasise a second thought:—These seven streams of colour were theproduct of logoic meditation. The Logos meditated, brooded, conceived mentally,formed an ideal world, and built it up in thought matter. Then our objectiveuniverse flashed into being, radiant with the seven colours, with the deep blueor indigo for synthetic undertone. Therefore certain things can be posited aboutcolour:1. It has to do with objective meditation, therefore it has to do with form.2. It is the result of sound uttered as the culmination of meditation.3. In these seven colours, and their wise comprehension, lies the capacity ofman to do as does the Logos and build.4. Colours have certain effects on the different vehicles, and on the planes onwhich those vehicles function. When it is known by the occultist which colour isapplicable to which plane, and which colour therefore is the basic hue for thatplane, he has grasped the fundamental secret of microcosmic development, and canbuild his body of manifestation by means of the same laws that that Logosemployed in building His objective solar system. This is the secret that raymeditation will eventually yield up to the wise student. These four points laythe foundation for all that follows.I would here seek to put your mind at rest on the point as to whether thecolours enumerated by me conflict with those enumerated by H. P. B. You will notfind they [207] do, but both of us use blinds , and both of us use the sameblinds as those who have eyes can see. A blind is not a blind when recognised,and I offer not the key. One or two hints however I may give:—Complementary colours may be spoken of in occult books in terms of each other.Red may be called green and orange may be called blue. The key to the accurateinterpretation of the term employed lies in the point of attainment of the unitunder discussion. If speaking of the Ego one term may be used; if of thePersonality, another; whilst the Monad or higher auric sphere may be describedsynthetically or in terms of the monadic ray.The colours of higher or lower mind are at times spoken of in terms of the planeand not in terms of the ray involved.Blue-indigo, being cosmically related, and not simply analogous, may be usedinterchangeably for purposes of blinding. Let me illustrate:—The Lords of the Flame, in their work in connection with this planet, may bespoken of in terms of four colours:—a. Indigo , as They are in the line of the Bodhisattva in connection with theLove or Wisdom Ray. The Lord of the World is a direct reflection of the secondAspect.b. Blue, because of its alliance with indigo and its relationship to the auricegg; just as the Solar Logos is spoken of as the “Blue Logos” (literallyindigo), so the colour of the perfected man, and of the auric envelope throughwhich he manifests, will be predominantly blue.c. Orange , which is the complementary to blue and which has direct connectionwith man as an intelligence. He is the custodian of the fifth principle [208] ofmanas in its relation to the totality of the personality.d. Yellow, being the complement of indigo, and also the colour of buddhi, and onthe direct line of the second Aspect.I give the above illustration to demonstrate to you the great complexityinvolved by the use of blinds, yet also to show you that for those who have theseeing eye even the choice of these blinds is not arbitrary, but subject to ruleand law.It is therefore obvious to you why it is so often emphasised that in dealingwith esoteric matters lower manas helps not. Only he who has the higher visionin process of development can hope to attain any measure of accuratediscrimination. Just as the green of the activity of Nature forms the basis ofthe love aspect, or the indigo vibration of this love system, so will it befound upon the mental plane. More may not be said, but food for thought lieshere. Orange also holds the secret for the Sons of Mind, and in the study offlame (which even exoterically blends all the colours) comes illumination.In studying this question of colour and sound in meditation how best shall wedivide our vast subject? Let us consider it under the following heads:1. Enumeration of the colours and certain comment thereon.2. Colours and the Law of Correspondences.3. The effects of colours:—a. On the bodies of the pupil.b. On groups and on group work.c. On the environment.4. The application of colour:—a. In meditation. [209]b. For healing in meditation.c. In constructive work.5. The future use of colour.Under these five heads we should be able to sum up all that has to be said atpresent. Perhaps little that I may say will be fundamentally new, for I give notaught which may not he found in that foundation book of H. P. B.'s. But in anewer presentation, and in the aggregation of material under one head may comeenlightenment, and a further wise adjustment of knowledge. We will take up thesefive divisions later. Tonight I will only add a few further points to thosealready given.Colours as manifested on the physical plane show at their crudest and harshest.Even the most exquisite of shades as seen by the physical eye is hard and harshcompared to those on the emotional plane, and as the finer matter of the otherplanes is contacted, the beauty, the softness and the exquisite quality of thedifferent hues grow with each transition. When the ultimate and synthetic colouris reached the beauty transcends all conception.Colours—such as we have now to do with in evolution—are the colours of light .Certain colours, which are the left-overs from the previous solar system, havebeen seized upon as modes of expression by that mysterious something which wecall “cosmic evil” (in our ignorance so we term it). They are involutionarycolours, and are media for the force of the Dark Brotherhood. With them theaspirant to the Path of Light has naught to do. They are such hues as brown,grey, the loathsome purple, and the lurid greens that are contacted in the darkplaces of the earth, on the emotional plane, and on the lower level of themental plane. They are negations. Their tone is lower than the note of Nature.They are the offspring [210] of night, esoterically understood. They are thebasis of glamour, of despair, and of corruption, and must be neutralised by thepupil of the Great Ones by the admission of the colours connected with light.6. The synthesis of all the colours, as aforesaid, is the synthetic ray ofindigo. This underlies all and absorbs all. But in the three worlds of humanevolution the orange of flame irradiates all. This orange emanates from thefifth plane, underlies the fifth principle, and is the effect produced by theesoteric sounding of the occult words “Our God is a consuming Fire.” These wordsapply to the manasic principle, that fire of intelligence or reason which theLords of the Flame imparted, and which stimulates and guides the life of theactive personality. It is that light of reason which guides a man through theHall of Learning on into the Hall of Wisdom. In the latter hall its limitationsare discovered, and that structure which knowledge has built (the causal body orthe Temple of Solomon) is itself destroyed by the consuming fire. This fireconsumes the gorgeous prison house which man has erected through manyincarnations, and lets loose the inner light divine. Then the two fires merge,mount upwards and are lost in the Triadal Light .Certain colours belong more exclusively to the human Hierarchy, others to thedeva. In their ultimate blending and intermingling comes eventual perfection....August 29th, 1920.1 - ENUMERATION OF THE COLOURS.Tonight we must continue our study on colour and take up our first point.In doing this I will make certain comments and give you certain data, impressingupon you nevertheless again the fact that I use the exoteric terms, and that thediscussion [211] is but for suggestive purposes. The very use of the word“Colour” shews the intention, for, as you know, the definition of the wordconveys the idea of concealment. Colour is therefore “that which does conceal.”It is simply the objective medium by means of which the inner force transmitsitself; it is the reflection upon matter of the type of influence that isemanating from the Logos, and which has penetrated to the densest part of Hissolar system. We recognise it as colour . The adept knows it as differentiatedforce, and the initiate of the higher degrees knows it as ultimate light ,undifferentiated and undivided.We enumerated the colours yesterday and in a certain order. I seek again toenumerate them thus, only this time reminding you that the one Ray of which allthe others are but sub-rays, might be regarded as a circle of sevenfold light.Too apt is the student to picture seven bands, striking down athwart the fivelower planes till they contact the earth plane and are absorbed into densematter. Not so is it in fact. The seven colours may be regarded as a band ofseven colours circling and continuously shifting and moving through the planesback to their originating source......These seven bands of colour emanate fromthe synthetic Ray. The indigo sub-ray of the indigo Ray forms the path of leastresistance from the heart of densest matter back again to the source. The bandsof colour form a circulating ring which, moving at different rates of vibration,passes through all the planes, circling down and up again. What I seek to bringout specially here is that these seven bands do not all move at the same rate,and herein lies hid the key to the complexity of the matter. Some move at aswifter rate of vibration than do some of the others. Hence—as they carry theircorresponding monads with them—you have here [212] the answer to the question asto why some egos seem to make more rapid progress than do some others.These coloured rings do not follow a straight unimpeded course, but interweavein a most curious manner, blending with each other, absorbing each other instated cycles, and grouping themselves in groups of threes or fives, yet evermoving onwards. This is the real foundation to the diamond pattern upon the backof the serpent of wisdom. Three major lines of colour should be portrayed asforming the lattice work on the serpent's skin, with the four other coloursinterweaving. Some day some student of colour and of the Divine Wisdom shouldcompile a large chart of the seven planes, and superimposed upon those planesshould be placed a seven-coloured serpent of wisdom. If correctly drawn to scalesome interesting geometrical patterns will be found as the circles cut acrossthe planes, and some impression will be conveyed occularly of the complexity ofthe matter of the seven rays......Certain brief statements seem to be in place:—The true indigo is the blue of the vault of heaven on a moonless night. It isthe culmination, and at the attainment by all of synthesis, the solar night willsupervene. Hence the colour corresponds to what the sky nightly proclaims.Indigo absorbs.Green is the basis of the activity of Nature. It was the synthetic colour forsystem 1, and is the foundation for the present manifested system. The note ofNature is green, and each time a man reviews the robe in which the earth is cladhe is contacting some of the force that reached its consummation in system 1.Green stimulates and heals.I seek to call your attention here to the fact that it is not yet permissible togive out the esoteric significance of [213] these colours, nor exact informationas to their order and application. The dangers are too great, for in the rightunderstanding of the laws of colour and in the knowledge (for instance) of whichcolour stands for a particular ray lies the power the adept wields.Comments on the colours.Certain colours are known and it might be well if we here enumerated them. Thesynthetic ray is indigo, or a deep hue. It is the Ray of Love and Wisdom, thegreat fundamental ray of this present solar system, and is one of the cosmicrays. This cosmic ray divides itself, for purposes of manifestation, into sevensub-rays, as follows:1. Indigo...............and a colour not disclosed.2. Indigo-indigo...The second sub-ray of Love and Wisdom. It finds its greatexpression on the second monadic plane, and its major manifestation in themonads of love.3. Indigo-green.......The third sub-ray, the third major Ray of Activity orAdaptability. It is the basic ray of the second system. It is the great ray forthe deva evolution.4. Indigo-yellow...............The Harmony Ray.5. Indigo-orange..The Ray of Concrete Knowledge.6. Indigo...and a colour not disclosed. The Ray of Devotion.7. Indigo-violet.....The Ray of Ceremonial Order.Now you will note that I do not name the two colours, indigo-red andindigo-blue, nor do I apportion them to [214] certain rays or planes. It is notthat it is not possible to do so, but it is the withholding of this informationthat creates the puzzle. Certain things you must always remember in dealing withthese colours:That I have given their exoteric names and application, and that of all I havegiven only two correspond with their esoteric application,—indigo and green .The Synthetic Ray and the Activity Ray are at this stage the only two of whichyou can be absolutely assured. One is the goal of endeavour, and the other isthe foundation colour of Nature.That the other five colours with which our fivefold evolution is concerned,change, intermingle, blend, and are not esoterically understood in the samesense as you might imagine from the use of the words, red, yellow, orange, blueand violet. Esoterically they scarcely resemble their names, and the namesthemselves are intended to blind and mislead.That each of these three colours and the other two are only understood as yetthrough four of their lesser sub-rays. This is the fourth round and only foursub-rays of these colours have as yet been glimpsed. By remembering these threepoints undue emphasis will not be laid upon apparent information, and thestudent will wisely reserve his opinion.Yellow is another of the colours that have come to us from system 1. Theblending of blue and of yellow in that system had much to do with the productionof activity. Yellow harmonises, it marks completion and fruition. Note how inautumn, when the processes of Nature have run their course and the cycle iscomplete, the yellow of the autumn is spread upon the landscape. Note also thatwhen the sun pours unimpeded down the yellow of the harvest is also to be seen.So it is in the [215] life of the spirit. When the fourth plane of harmony or ofbuddhi is achieved, then is consummation. When the work of the personality iscompleted, and when the sun of the microcosm, the Ego, pours unimpeded down intothe personal life, then comes fruition and harvest. The at-one-ment, or theharmonising has been made, and the goal has been reached. Blue and yellowblended result in green, and the synthetic blue or indigo (the love and wisdomaspect) dominates when the plane of harmony is reached. It leads then to thethird plane of atma whereon the green of activity predominates......August 31st, 1920.In continuing our study of colour and meditation, and our particular division inthat study, I would—for your encouragement—point out that the part that falls toyou is the reception and publication of these letters and of the imparted data,whereas the responsibility for that data rests with me. Even if you understandthem not, and even if it seems to you that some of the data may becontradictory, I would suggest for your consideration that in the esotericinterpretation lies hid half the mystery, and the other half is concealed by thefact that all interpretation depends upon the standpoint of the interpreter, andthe plane whereon his consciousness is working. The value of what I impart nowconsists in this:—that in the study of colour (which is one form of the study ofvibration) comes the ability to understand personal vibration, to attune thatvibration to the egoic one, and to synchronise it later with that of the Master.One of the main methods of effecting this synchronisation is meditation. Whenthe intelligence grasps the scientific facts anent this subject, then comes theutilisation of these facts for the advancement of vibration, and the wisedevelopment of the colours necessitated. [216]We dealt in my last letter with the four colours—blue, indigo, green, andyellow,—and in this primary grouping lies much of interest. We now come to adifferent group of colours, and one that falls naturally together, orange, red,and violet.Orange. This colour is for our purpose the colour of the mental plane, thecolour that marks burning; it is the symbol of flame, and curiously enough thecolour that epitomises separation. But I would have you note that the occultorange is not exactly the colour that you understand by the term. Exotericorange is a blend of yellow and red; esoteric orange is a purer yellow, and thered scarcely is seen at all. This orange comes in as a vibration set up by acosmic ray, for you have to remember that this fifth ray (just as the fifthplane and the fifth principle) is closely allied to the cosmic ray of theintelligence, or to that activity aspect that found its great expression in thefirst solar system. The synthetic ray of that time was the green ray, and itfound one of its closest alliances in the ray of orange, or mind or intelligencedemonstrating through form. You get a correspondence in this solar system in thesynthetic Ray of Love and Wisdom, and its close relationship to the fourth Rayof Harmony. It finds a demonstration in the triangle formed by theirinteraction, as follows: [217]FIRST SOLAR SYSTEMGreen RayThird sub-ray Fifth sub-ray Activity Manas, mind Green-green Green-orangeThird AspectActivity or IntelligenceSECOND SOLAR SYSTEMIndigo RaySecond sub-ray Fourth sub-ray Love and Wisdom Harmony Indigo-indigoIndigo-yellowSecond AspectLove and Wisdom[218] In the activity system you have the third aspect of universal mind oractivity, demonstrating through the orange of the concretesub-ray......adaptability through form—form which perfectly expresses thatlatent activity. Similarly in the second system of love, you have the loveaspect demonstrating through the yellow of the ray of harmony or beauty—loveexpressing itself perfectly through unity, harmony or beauty. Note here the factthat I again use terms that are dependent for their correctness upon theirexoteric or esoteric interpretation.Therefore to return to what I earlier said, this orange comes in as a vibrationset up by the earlier cosmic ray of activity in the earlier solar system; theforce of orange (which is scientific apprehension by the intelligence) comes into perfect the link between spirit and form, between life and the vehiclesthrough which it is seeking expression.1.Life Aspect 2. Form Aspect 3. Intelligence Aspect Spirit Matter MindConsciousness Vehicle Vitality Self Not-Self Relation betweenRay Ray Ray 2. Love and Wisdom 1. Power or Will 3. Activity or Adaptability 4.Harmony 7. Ceremonial Law 5. Concrete Knowledge 6. Devotion 5. ConcreteKnowledgeWe might apportion the great basic colours between the various terms that we useto express the totality of the manifested universe:[219] This is but one of the ways in which the rays may be apportioned andconsidered as influences having direct effect upon the evolving life, or uponthe form in which it evolves by means of that third factor, the intelligence.These three divisions make the three points of a cosmic triangle:—[Image00009.jpg]and the current of the rays playing macrocosmically between the three has itsmicrocosmic correspondence in the fire of kundalini (awakened throughmeditation) playing in accurate geometrical form between the three majorcentres:—[Image00010.jpg]All the seven rays interact between the life, the form and the inner mind, andare in their essence themselves those three. They are life, they are form, theyare intelligence, and their totality is the manifested universe. All seven atdifferent times play on the different aspects. [220]The most important interaction exists between:—a. The Love-Wisdom Ray and the Harmony Ray, as it does between the monadic planeand the buddhic.b. The Power Ray and that of Ceremonial Law, just as it does between the firstand the seventh planes.c. The Activity or Adaptability Ray and that of Concrete Knowledge or Science,just as it does between the third plane of atma and the fifth plane of mind.Green and orange were allied in the first solar system, and continue theiralliance here. I have opened up for all true students vast realms of thought.In the relationship between indigo, blue and yellow lies hid a secret.In the relationship between green, orange and red another is revealed.In the relationship between blue, red, and violet lies still another mystery.The student, who, by using his intuition, apprehends these three mysteries hasfound the key to the greater cycle and holds the key to evolutionarydevelopment. Remember, therefore, when studying the microcosm that the samerelationship will be found, and will open the portal to the “Kingdom of Godwithin.”Red is for all apparent purposes one of the most difficult colours to consider.It ranks as undesirable. Why? Because it has been considered as the colour ofkama, or evil desire, and the picture of the dark and lurid reds in theemotional body of the undeveloped man rises ever to one's vision. Yet—at somedistant time—red will be the basis of a solar system, and in the perfect mergingof red, green and blue will come eventually the completed [221] work of theLogos and the consummation of the pure white light.The activity system was green.The love system is blue.The power system will be red.The result of merging red, blue, and green is—as you know—white, and the Logoswill then have esoterically “washed His robes and made them white in the blood,”just as the microcosm, in a lesser sense, does in process of evolution.Violet . In a curious way the violet Ray of Ceremonial Law or Order is asynthetic ray when manifested in the three worlds. Just as the synthetic Ray ofLove and Wisdom is the synthesis of all the life forces, so in the three worldsthe seventh ray synthesises all that has to do with form. On the first plane,life in its purest, highest, undifferentiated synthetic aspect; on the seventhplane, form in its densest, grossest, most differentiated aspect; one is summedup in the synthetic Ray of Love, whilst the other is worked upon by the seventh.A synthesis too is found in the fact that through the medium of violet the devaand human kingdoms can find a place of contact. Esoterically violet is white. Inthe blending of these two kingdoms the seven Heavenly Men attain perfection andcompleteness, and are esoterically considered to be white, the synonym ofperfection.Another point of synthesis is the fact that through the dominance of thisseventh ray comes a point of merging between the dense physical and the ethericbodies. This is of paramount importance in the macrocosm, and to the student ofmeditation. It is necessary to effect this merging and alignment before thetransmission of the teaching to the dense physical brain can in any way be [222]considered accurate. It has a close bearing upon the alignment of the centres.I have sought in the above remarks solely to indicate lines of thought which, iffollowed closely, may lead to surprising results. By the study of colours andthe planes, by the study of colour and its effect and relationship to the lifeside, and by the study of the form side of the mind, will come much of value tothe student of meditation, provided always he does three things:1. That he seeks to find the esoteric colours and their right application to theplanes and centres, to the bodies through which he manifests, and to the bodiesthrough which the Logos manifests (the seven sacred planets); to the rounds andto the races, and to the cycles of his own individual life. When he can do thishe holds in his hands the key to all knowledge.2. That he endeavours to make practical application of all indicated truth tohis personal life of service in the three worlds, and that he tries to conformin his methods of work to the methods demonstrated by the Logos through theseven rays or influences. By this I mean that, through meditation, he brings hislife systematically and in ordered occult cycles under those seven greatinfluences, and so produces an ordered beauty in his manifestation of the Ego.3. That he remembers ever that perfection, as we know it, is only partial andnot real, and that even perfection itself—as grasped by the mind of man, is butillusion, and that only the next logoic manifestation will reveal the ultimateglory in view. As long as there is differentiated colour there is imperfection.Remember, colour as we know it is the realisation by the man using a fifthroot-race body in the fourth round on the fourth chain, of a vibration thatcontacts the human eye. What then will [223] colour be as visioned by a man ofthe seventh round in a seventh root-race body? Even then a whole range ofcolours of wondrous beauty will be outside and beyond his comprehension. Thereason being that only two great aspects of logoic life are being thoroughlydemonstrated and the third will be but partially revealed, waiting for the stillgreater “Day be with us” to flash forth in perfect radiance. This word“radiance” has an occult meaning worthy of your consideration.September 3rd, 1920In the steady adherence to the next duty and the planting of the foot firmly onthe next step ahead lies the open road to the Master, and the incidentalclearing away of all difficulties. In the formulating of high mental concepts,and the expressing of them on the physical plane lies that development of themental body that permits of an ever greater influx of the life from above. Inthe stabilising of the emotions, and in the transference of desire from thatplane to the buddhic comes the ability to reflect truly the higher point ofview. In the disciplined, purified physical body comes the capacity to work outthat which the inner man knows. If these three things are attended to, the lawcan then work and emancipation be hastened. People ask themselves, how does thelaw work? What is our part in the carrying out of action that sets the law loosein the individual life? Simply adherence, as stated above, to the highest dutyand an ordering of the personality life so that that duty may be perfectlyachieved.The Esoteric and Exoteric colours.Today our subject is the second one in our letter on the use of colour and dealswith the law of correspondences [224 ] and of colour......The esoteric meaningof the exoteric colours is not yet wholly imparted, as I have already told you.Some of these meanings have been given out by H.P.B. but their significance hasnot been sufficiently apprehended. One hint I give for your wise consideration.Some of the information given in The Secret Doctrine anent colour and soundconcerns the first solar system and some concerns a portion of the second solarsystem. The distinction has naturally not been apprehended, but as a key factfor studying in the newer school, the revelation will be great. In thisstatement as to the esoteric significance of the colours I would have you nowtabulate (even though it can be found in The Secret Doctrine), in order to formthe basis of such later communications as I may seek to impart.Only four as yet can be communicated, but if rightly understood they hold thekey to the present fourth round, and to its history. This being the fourth chainand the fourth round you will note therefore how in the number four lies thehistory of the present. Especially would I urge you who are the teachers andstudents of the coming generation to ponder upon the significance of white beingesoterically violet. It has special application now in the coming in of theviolet ray, the seventh ray being one of the three major rays in this round; itwields power in ratio to the four, on the four and under the four.The esoteric colours of the exoteric red, green and orange may not yet beimparted to the general public, [225] though students and accepted chelas, whosediscrimination can be trusted, can attain the necessary knowledge with effort.I would here like to point out certain other considerations which can be bestdealt with by a brief consideration of the law of analogy and correspondence. Wemight therefore consider the following points:—a. Wherein the microcosm and the macrocosm correspond.b. The basic correspondences.c. Colour in the microcosm and in the macrocosm.Let us briefly take up each point, for in the right apprehension of the law liesthe ability to think esoterically, and wrest the inner meaning out of theexternal happenings.Exoteric Esoteric Purple Blue Yellow Indigo Cream Yellow White Violet2 - MICROCOSMIC AND MACROCOSMIC CORRESPONDENCE.The relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm is accurate, and existsnot only broadly but likewise in detail. This is a fact to be grasped and workedout. As knowledge increases and progress is made, and as the ability to meditateresults in the faculty of transmitting from the higher Triad to the Personality,via the causal, then these facts will be ever more clearly demonstrated indetail, and perfect comprehension will ensue. “As above, so below” is a truismglibly repeated but little realised. What is found above and what willconsequently be developing below?Above will be found Will, Love and Activity, or Power, Wisdom and Intelligence,the terms that we apply to the three aspects of divine manifestation. Below willbe found these three in process of appearing:—a. The Personality expresses active intelligence. [226]b. The Ego expresses love or wisdom.c. The Monad expresses power or will.You have in the three worlds of the Personality:—a. The physical, expressing a reflection of the activity aspect.b. The astral, expressing a reflection of the love or wisdom aspect.c. The mental, expressing a reflection of the will or power aspect.What have you for the colours of those three bodies, exoterically described?a. The violet of the physical as expressed by the etheric.b. The rose or red of the astral.c. The orange of the mental.What have you in the Triad, or the world of the threefold Ego?a. Higher manas, expressing the activity or intelligence aspect.b. Buddhi, expressing the love or wisdom aspect.c. Atma, expressing the will or power aspect.What again are the colours of those bodies exoterically described?a. The blue of the higher manasic levels.b. The yellow of the buddhic level.c. The green of the atmic level.They are in the process of transmutation. You have to effect the correspondingchange of colour from the lower to the higher. Couple up this information that Ihave here imparted with that given in an earlier letter on the transference ofpolarisation.There is a direct correspondence between:—a. The violet of the etheric level and the blue of the higher mental. [227]b. The rose of the astral and the yellow of the buddhic.c. The orange of the mental and the green of the atmic.The secret of it all is to be found in the application of the occult laws ofmeditation.Again you can shift the whole range of colour higher, and in the Monad work outthe correspondence.a. The green of the third aspect.b. The synthetic blue or indigo of the second aspect.c. The red of the first aspect.I would point out here that as you return to the centre of systemic evolutionthe nomenclature of these colours is most misleading. The red, for instance, hasno resemblance to that termed red or rose on the lower plane. The red, the greenand the indigo of these high levels are to all intents and purposes new coloursof a beauty and translucence inconceivable. If justly interpreted, you have herea hint of the correspondence between the microcosm and the macrocosm.The colours exoterically have to do with the form. The forces or qualities whichthose colours conceal and hide have to do with the life, evolving within thoseforms. By the use of meditation the bridge is formed which connects these two.Meditation is the expression of the intelligence that links life and form, theself and the not-self, and in time and in the three worlds the process of thisconnection eventuates on the plane of mind which links the higher and the lower.The correspondence will always be found perfect. Therefore through meditationwill come that knowledge which will effect three things:—1. Give the inner significance of the exoteric colour.2. Build in the qualities that those colours veil. [228]3. Effect the necessary transmutation of the colours from the Personality to theTriad, and later from the Triad to the Monad.The causal body acts as a synthesis of these colours in the life of thereincarnating Ego, just as the synthetic ray blends all the colours in logoicmanifestation. Endeavour to keep clear in your own mind......that colours arethe expressions of force or quality. They hide or veil the abstract qualities ofthe Logos, which qualities are reflected in the microcosm in the three worlds asvirtues or faculties. Therefore, just as the seven colours hide qualities in theLogos, so these virtues demonstrate in the life of the personality and arebrought forward objectively through the practice of meditation; thus each lifewill be seen as corresponding to a colour. Ponder on this.The basic correspondences.It is in the study of these correspondences in the different departments of themanifested universe, and the application of these colours to their adjustedportion that the beauty of the synthetic whole and the illuminating of themicrocosmic life ensues. Let us enumerate or tabulate in broad general fashion,leaving the detailed working out to the student of meditation. More at thisjuncture is not possible.1. The threefold solar system.The threefold evolving jiva.The three aspects of the Logos.The threefold Monad.The spiritual Triad, the Ego.The threefold Personality.The three worlds of human evolution.The three persons of the Deity. [229]2. The four Lipika Lords.The four Maharajahs.The fourfold lower man, the quaternary.3. The five planes of human evolution.The five senses.The fivefold department of the Mahachohan.The five kingdoms of nature.a. The mineral kingdom.b. The vegetable kingdom.c. The animal kingdom.d. The human kingdom.e. The spiritual or superhuman kingdom.The fifth principle of manas.4. The seven rays or hierarchies.The seven colours.The seven planes of manifestation.The seven Kumaras.The seven principles of man.The seven centres.The seven sacred planets.The seven chains.The seven globes.The seven rounds.The seven root-races and subraces.The seven initiations.What I seek to emphasise in the above table is that to the adept thecorrespondence of all these is perfectly known and exists in terms ofconsciousness, in terms of form, and in terms of intelligence. He knows it,—if Imay so express it,—in terms of colour when dealing with form; in terms of soundwhen dealing with the life side, and in terms of vitality when dealing withintelligence, or the activity aspect. The above statement will repay much [230]earnest thought; it contains a statement of occult fact. According to the threelines of approach as dealt with in our preceding letter, will be the use of theterms as above describedColour in the microcosm and in the macrocosm.Here lies much of difficulty owing to the process of constant mutation. Colourin the microcosm is subject to the following factors:—1. The factor of the ray of the Ego.2. The factor of the ray of the Personality.3. The factor of the point in evolution.One hint may here be given. At a low point in evolution the colours are largelybased on the activity aspect. Later comes the working in the love, or wisdomaspect, which has three effects:—a. The dropping out of colours from the lower sheaths which are the left-oversfrom a previous system. It involves the elimination of such hues as brown andgray.b. The transmutation of certain colours into those of higher tone.c. An effect of translucence, or an underlying radiance or brilliance, which isthe result of the greater purity of the bodies and the dimensions of theever-growing inner flame.4. The factor of the ray, or rays, that are manifested passing out ofmanifestation or coming into manifestation. These rays necessarily affect theegos in incarnation; they cause a change of vibration somewhat or a consequentchange of colouring or of quality. If a man, for instance, is on the Ray ofScience, and comes under the influence of the incoming Ray of Harmony, theeffect on his trend of thought, and consequently on the colour he [231] will bedemonstrating, will be quite noticeable. All these factors cause the blendingand merging and mixing that is practically inextricably confusing to the manfrom the standpoint of the three worlds.......I appreciate your feeling that even these hints but lead apparently togreater confusion. But by constant application to the subject in hand, byfrequent brooding and meditation on the colours, and by an endeavor to attaintheir esoteric significance, and their microcosmic application, will graduallyappear the thread that will lead the student out of his confusion into the clearlight of perfect knowledge. Have, therefore, courage, a broad elasticity ofview, and an ability to reserve opinion until further facts are demonstrated,and also an avoidance of dogmatic assertion. These will be your best guides inthe early days of your search. Many have, through meditation and a receptivenessto the higher teaching, found their way out of the Hall of Learning into theHall of Wisdom. Only in the Hall of Wisdom can the esoteric interpretation ofthe colours be truly known. That Hall is entered through the meditation whichprepares the student for that initiation which opens to him the door. Therefore,hold fast to meditation and falter not in purpose.September 4th, 1920.We have for discussion today, something of real spiritual application in apractical sense. Much that I have imparted to you has provided food for thoughtand for speculation. It tends to the development of the higher mind and bystimulation of imagination it somewhat develops the intuition. Much of it hasbeen in the nature of prophecy, and of the holding forth of an ideal some day tobe attained. Only by pointing out the goal and by emphasising that point willman be induced to make the [232] necessary effort and thereby approximate insome measure the desired position. But today we come down to practical livingand the imposing upon the personality of a certain rate of rhythm. We do this inour study of the third point upon the effect of colour:—a. On the bodies of the student.b. On the groups with which he is affiliated.c. On his environment.The point I seek specially to emphasise is the life side and not the form sideof colour. As I wrote earlier, colour is but the form assumed by force, of somekind, when that force is moving at a certain measure, and when its action andmovement is impeded or unimpeded by the material through which it plays. In thissentence lies the key to the solution of the problem as to the colourdifferences on the higher planes and on the lower. The resistance of matter tothe downflow of force or life, and its relative density or rarity accounts formuch of the colour distinction. One of the distinctions has, necessarily, acosmic basis and is consequently difficult of apprehension by three-dimensionalman in this, the fourth round. But the basic reason of the difference can beapprehended sufficiently to permit the pupil to realise the absolute necessityof steadily refining his vehicles so that the force may radiate through withgreater facility. It is therefore on the three lower planes a question ofpractical living and a bringing of all the three bodies under edict rules ofrefinement.These forces in terms of spiritual development, and not so much in terms ofform, demonstrate through the virtues, as you call them, through magnetism andthrough vitality and intelligence. To put it quite briefly, as the studentbuilds a pure physical body and a refined etheric, as he develops the emotionalvirtues and as he co-ordinates [233] and enlarges his mental body, he iscontinuously altering its rate of vibration, and changing its rhythm, whichchange demonstrates to the eye of the clairvoyant as mutation in colour. As youhave been taught, the colours as seen in the aura of a savage and in those ofthe average developed man are extraordinarily dissimilar. Why? Because one ismoving or vibrating at a slow rate and the other with greatly increasedrapidity. One has a rhythm slow, sluggish and heavy, the other is pulsating andmoving with a tremendous velocity permitting consequently a more rapid play ofthe material of which those bodies are constructed.Therefore, I would like to point out that as the race progresses as a collectiveunit, Those Who gaze upon it from a higher plane are aware of the steadyimprovement in the colours seen, and of a greater purity and clarity of hue inthe aura of the race, which aura is composed of the composite auras of the unitsof the race. For instance, the aura of the Atlantean root-race and that of theAryan are widely diverse, and radically different. We have, therefore,demonstrated our first point that, as the units evolve, the colours change andthis is brought about by the transmutation of what you term vices, into virtues.A vice is dominance of an involutional quality of the same force which at alater period will show forth as a virtue.The second point I seek to make is that these influences (which show forth ascolours when they contact matter) move in their own ordered cycles. These cycleswe describe as the coming in or the going out of a ray. In this fourth roundusually four rays are in flux at any one given time; by this I seek to impressupon you that though all rays manifest in the solar system, at certain stages ofmanifestation more or less of them will be dominating simultaneously. Theserays, forces, influences, or [234] co-ordinations of qualities, when expressedin terms of light, colour the matters they impinge upon with certainrecognisable hues, and these give the tone to the life of the personality or tothe Ego. They are recognized by you as the composite character and are seen bythe clairvoyant as colour.Groups, therefore, of units who converge through similarity of vibration will beseen as having approximately the same basic hue, though with many lesserdifferentiations in colour and tone. As stated before, the colour of largemasses of people can be gauged and judged. It is in this way that the members ofthe Hierarchy in Whose Hands is placed evolutionary development in the threeworlds, judge of the stage attained and the progress made.Different rays come in bearing units coloured by that ray. Other rags pass outcarrying with them units of a different basic hue. In the period of transitionthe blending of colour is of deep complexity, but of mutual helpfulness andbenefit. Each ray imparts somewhat to the other rays in incarnation at the sametime, and the rate of rhythm will be slightly affected. This from the standpointof the present and of time in the three worlds, may be almost inappreciablysmall, but through the frequent meeting and interplay of the forces and colours,and their constant action and interaction upon each other, will come a steady,general levelling up, and an approximation in vibration. You will see,therefore, how synthesis is achieved at the end of a greater maha-manvantara.The three rays absorb the seven and lead eventually to a merging in thesynthetic ray.In the microcosm the three rays of the Monad, the Ego, and the Personality willlikewise dominate and absorb the seven, and in time also lead to a merging inthe [235] synthetic ray of the Monad. The correspondence will be found perfect.These forces, or virtues, or influences (I reiterate synonymous terms because ofthe need of clear thinking on your part) are gradually received into the bodiesof the personality with ever greater facility and fuller expression. As thebodies are refined they provide better mediums for incoming forces, and thequality of any particular force,—or, to reverse it, the force of any particularquality—becomes more perfectly expressed. Here comes in the work of the studentin meditation. Early in evolution these forces played through and on the bodiesof a man with little understanding on his part, and small ability to profitthereby. But as time proceeds, he comprehends more and more the value of allthat eventuates, and seeks to profit by the sum of the qualities of his life.Herein comes opportunity. In the intelligent apprehension of quality, in thestriving after virtue, and in the building-in of God-like attribute, comesresponse to those forces and a facilitating of their action. The student ofmeditation ponders on those forces or qualities, he seeks to extract theiressence, and to comprehend their spiritual significance; he broods on his ownlack of response, he realises the deficiencies in his vehicle as a medium forthose forces; he studies the rate of his rhythmic vibration, and he strenuouslyendeavors to bend every opportunity to meet the need. He concentrates on thevirtue, and (if he is so situated that he is aware of the incoming ray or of theray in dominance at that time), he avails himself of the hour of opportunity andco-operates with the force extant. All this he does through the ordered forms ofthe true and occult meditation.As time progresses—yes, again I prophesy—occult students will be given certainfacts anent the dominating [236] rays which will enable them to avail themselvesof the opportunity any particular ray affords.3 - EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT.As regards our third point, the effect of all the above on the environment, itwill be obvious at once to the careful student that the effect upon theenvironment will be noticeable, especially as more and more of the human racecome under the conscious control of their higher self and in line with the law.Certain things will then be possible:—a. Direct contact with the deva or angel evolution will come about, though it isimpossible now through instability of vibration.b. Many very highly developed souls will come in who are at present hindered bythe low rate of vibration and consequent heaviness of colour of the majority ofthe human race. There are, in the heaven world and on the causal level, somegreat, and, to you, incomprehensible units of the fourth Creative Hierarchy,awaiting opportunity of expression, just as some of you awaited a period in theAtlantean race before taking incarnation on this planet. When the rate of thevibration of a larger percentage of the race has reached a certain measure, andwhen the colour aspect of the co-ordinated auras of the groups is of a certaintone, they will return, and bring to the earth much of value past yourrealisation.c. Another interesting point upon which we have not time to dwell is that therhythmic effect on even the two kingdoms beneath the human will be objectivelydemonstrable. It was no idle boast of the prophet of Israel when he said “Theleopard shall lie down with the lamb” or that “the desert shall blossom like arose”. It will be [237] brought about by the domination of certain vibrationsand the bringing in of certain colours veiling certain virtues or influences.September 7th, 1920.Today we will take up the subject of the application of colour. If colours arebut the veil cast over an influence, and if you can, by use of the intuition,find out which colours thus shroud a virtue you have the key to the matter inhand. You will have noted two facts that stand out in these letters:—That the subject touched upon is so vast that only its outline has in any waybeen attempted.That each sentence written in these letters aims at an exact impartation of acomplete thought and is full of matter for consideration. Why have I not dealtwith the matter in greater detail, and why have I not entered into lengthyexplanations and sought to expand the sentences into paragraphs? For the solereason that if the preliminary work has been done in the meditation of the pastyears by the student he will find the material of these letters conducive to thedevelopment of abstract thought, and to the widening of the channel thatcommunicates with the intuition. I but seek to be suggestive. My aim is but toindicate. The usefulness of the teaching I give depends upon the intuition ofthe pupil. Therefore, when I say that colour has certain effects when applied Iwould warn you that it will be necessary to interpret the above in terms oflife, in terms of form, and in terms of mind.4 - THE APPLICATION OF COLOUR.a. In meditation.b. In healing.c. In constructive work. [238]Colour may be used in many ways, and the above three ways do not cover thesubject. They but indicate three ways that are of immediate and practical use tothe student. Colour may be employed in contacting other evolutions, subhuman orsuperhuman; in definite work of destruction or of shattering; it may be used inconnection with other methods such as music or movement, or in connection withstated mantrams, thereby bringing about certain results, but with all these weneed not, in this series of letters, concern ourselves. The growth of theindividual and his increased capacity to be of service are all brought about bythe wise use of occult meditation. Let us therefore consider our first point.Use of Colour in Meditation.All colours emanate from one source or one primary colour—in this solar systemthe cosmic ray of indigo veiling cosmic love or wisdom,—and then split intothree major colours and thence into the four minor, making the seven colours ofthe spectrum. You will expect to see the same effect in the life of theindividual, for always the macrocosm affects the microcosm. His primary colourwill be his monadic ray, manifesting next in the three colours of the Triad andin the four colors of the Quaternary. These colours on the path of return areresolved into the three and thence again into the one.The path of manifestation, of differentiation, is the path of acquisition. It isthe homogeneous becoming the many or the heterogeneous. It is the breaking up ofthe one basic colour into its many component parts. This is the form side , theexpression of that which veils the life. On the life side it is the developmentfrom the one basic quality of the many inherent virtues; it is the latentpossibility of divinity demonstrating as the many attributes of [239] thedivine; it is the one life manifesting its many qualities through diversity ofform. It is the self, with the inherent capabilities of the All Self, utilisingforms for the demonstration of its all-including perfections. On theintelligence side it is the method whereby the life utilises the form anddevelops its thorough comprehension, analysis and intellect. It is the relationbetween life and form, the self and the not-self, between spirit and matter,manifesting as modes of expression whereby the indwelling divinity imposes hischaracteristics upon the material provided for his using. The God withinexpresses all his latent virtues through forms by the use of activity orintelligence. The life shows colour and the form perfects those colours, as theintelligence aspect (which forms the energising link) becomes more evolved andcomprehension is developed.On the path of return, renunciation is the rule, in contradistinction to theearlier method. The indwelling life renounces the forms, hitherto regarded (andnecessarily so) as essential. By the use now of the intelligence which haslinked these two pairs of opposites, spirit and matter, consciousness and form,the forms built of matter by the aid of the intelligence are one after anotherrepudiated by the aid of that same intelligence, or reasoning faculty transmutedinto wisdom. The forms go, but the life remains. The colours are graduallyreabsorbed, but the divine virtues persist, stable now and enduringly of use byreason of experience. Not potential are these attributes divine, but developedinto powers for use. Inherent faculty has become active characteristics carriedto the nth power. The veils are discarded one by one; the sheaths are droppedand superseded; the vehicles are dispensed with and the forms are no longerrequired, but the life ever remains and returns to its parent ray. It is [240]resolved back into its primary, plus activity and expression plus experience andthe ability to manifest; plus all that constitutes the difference between theignorant savage and the solar Logos. This has been consummated by theutilisation of many forms by the life, the intelligence constituting the meanswhereby that life employed those forms as a mode for learning. Having manifestedas an aspect of this primary ray, having through many incarnationsdifferentiated that ray into its many component parts, having veiled himselfunder all the seven colours that compose that ray, the reincarnating jiva takesthe path of return and from the seven becomes the three and from the three againbecomes the one.When the man does this consciously , when he willingly and with fullcomprehension of what he has to do endeavours to set the indwelling life freefrom the veils that hide, and from the sheaths that imprison, he discovers thatthe method whereby this is accomplished is by the subjective life of occultmeditation, and the objective life of service. In service is renunciation, and,under the occult law, therefore, in service the subjective finds liberation, andis set free from objective manifestation. Think this out, for it has much hiddenunder the veil of words.The occult student, therefore, from the standpoint of colour has two things todo in meditation.1. To discover his three major colours as manifested in the Personality, theEgo, and the Monad.2. To resolve then the lower quaternary into the three, the first stage of whichis consciously to withdraw into the Ego and so atrophy the lower self. Thestudent begins by eliminating the colours that are not desirable, killing outall low or coarse vibration and eventually so [241] refining his vehicles thatthe three major colours—of which he is the expression—shine out with perfectclarity. This leads him up to the third initiation. After that, he seeks toresolve the three into the one until he has withdrawn all his consciousness fromthe lower vehicles into the monadic sheath.It was not my intention, as you erroneously supposed, to give you information asto the effect of colours playing on the bodies in meditation. I have sought onlyto give you some idea of colour as a veil that must eventually be set aside.Under the heading of the “Future use of colour,” I may touch upon that whichinterests you, but to understand fundamentals is far better than to haveformulas for experimenting given to you.September 10th, 1920.We will, today, scarcely do more than touch upon our second point, which is theapplication of colour for healing purposes, the reason for this brevity beingthat the subject, in order to be handled correctly and therefore safely, shouldbe dealt with at length, and the old adage will consequently prove true in thisconnection that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing”. Unless the matter ofhealing with colour is dealt with in correct fashion and with technicalknowledge and at length, the results achieved might prove more disastrous thanbeneficent. The subject will later be fully elucidated if the future brings thatwhich is intended, and in the meantime I can, for your information, outlinecertain features of this work, point out certain conditions incident to success,and foretell for you somewhat the trend the matter will probably take. [242]Application of colour in healing.We are dealing with the subject now from the standpoint of meditation. It isessential therefore that we consider the subject from that angle. In meditationthe work of healing is handled entirely from the mental standpoint. Thedirection of any force supplied will be from the mental body of the patient andwill work from thence to the physical via the emotional.This involves on the part of the person or group that undertakes this work theascertaining of certain facts. Let us briefly enumerate them in order to clarifythe mind of the reader:—1. The work will be largely subjective and will deal with causes and not witheffects. The primary aim of the healing group will be to discover theoriginating cause of the trouble and having located that cause in either theemotional or the mental body the members of the group will then proceed to dealwith the effect as demonstrated in the physical or the etheric. Should thetrouble be entirely physical, such as is the case in an accident of any kind, orin some affliction which is purely the result of heredity or of congenitaltrouble, the ordinary high class physical plane scientific methods will beapplied at first, and the work of the healers will be to aid those methodsthrough concentration on the subtler bodies. This applies during the transitionperiod into which the race is now entering. Later, when the knowledge of occulthealing is more familiar, and the laws which govern the subtle bodies are moreknown, physical plane science will be superseded by the preventive science ofthe subtler planes, that science which aims at the provision of right conditionsand the building of bodies that are both self-protecting and neutral to allattack. It will he found that the comprehension [243] of the law of vibration,and the effect of one vibration upon another vibration holds the key to theestablishing of better conditions of living, and of sound bodies on all planes.But as things are now, disease, corruption of different kinds and trouble in allthe bodies is everywhere contacted, and when conditions are thus recognised,means of aiding must be earnestly sought. This leads us on to our next point:2. The ascertaining by the group that practises healing of full information asto the patient, based on the following questions:—a. What are his basic lines of thought?By what thoughtforms is he principally surrounded?b. What is the predominant hue of his emotional body? What is its rate ofvibration?Is the patient subject to sudden turmoils that throw the entire emotional bodyinto disorder?c. What are his most ordinary topics of conversation? What are his principalinterests?What literature does he study?What are his favourite pursuits?d. What is the condition of the centres in his body?Which centres are awakened?Are any centres rotating in fourth dimensional order? Which centre is the majorone in any particular case?e. What is the state of the etheric body?Does it show symptoms of devitalisation or of congestion?Is the patient lacking in vitality?What is the value of his magnetic action on other people? [244]Having studied the patient from all these angles, and not at any earlier time,will the group who purpose healing study the physical vehicle itself in detail.Then—with some idea of the inner conditions that underlie the trouble—they willstudy as follows:—f. The condition of the nervous system, giving particular attention to thespine, and to the state of the inner fire.g. The state of the various organs of the body, and especially the organ, ororgans, that are causing distress.h. The structure itself, studying the bones and the flesh, and the condition ofthe vital fluid, the blood.Higher vision and health.This, as you can see, necessarily involves either direct scientific knowledge,or else it involves the faculty of inner vision, that sees the trouble whereverit may be, and can clairvoyantly view the entire frame and organs, so locatinginstantaneously any trouble. This capacity presupposes the development of thoseinner powers which give knowledge in the three worlds, and so obviates thedisastrous mistakes that so oft eventuate in the modern practice of medicine, asyou call the art of healing. There will not be so much danger of error in thefuture day of healing, but what I seek to point out is that although thoseerrors will be obviated in the case of the physical body, yet much time mustelapse before full comprehension of the emotional body has reached the pointwhere modern science has placed the physical. The healing of the physical bodyand its due comprehension and study can be carried on by the man who has theinner vision. With his ability to see on emotional levels he can co-operate withthe modern enlightened medical man, and thus safeguard [245] him from error,enabling him to judge truly of the extent of the trouble, the seat of distress,its assistance, and the progress of the cure.Emotional trouble that is working out in the physical body, as is the case inthe majority of physical ills today, can usually be located and eliminated byjudicious treatment. But emotional trouble that is deepseated in the subtle bodyhas to be dealt with from mental levels, so that it requires a mental psychic todeal with and eliminate it. All these methods of course entail the activeconscious co-operation of the patient himself.Similarly, mental trouble has to be dealt with directly from the causal level,and necessitates therefore the assistance of the Ego, and the help of someonewho has causal vision and consciousness. This latter method, and the major partof these types of trouble, lie far ahead for the race, and therefore littleconcern us at this time. Nevertheless the curing of physical ailments that havetheir seat in the emotional body is already beginning to be known and slightlystudied. In the study of psychology and in the comprehension of nervous diseasesand troubles and their linking together will come the next step ahead in medicalscience. The link between the body of the emotions and physical body is theetheric body. The next immediate step is to consider the etheric body in twoways, either as a transmitter of prana, the life force, vitality or magnetism,or as the vehicle which links the emotional nature to the dense physical. Thephysical invariably follows the behests of that nature as transmitted via theetheric.In forming groups for healing under ideal conditions you would have at the headof the group a person with causal consciousness, who can deal with any troublein the mental body, and who can study the alignment of all [246] the bodies withthe Ego. The group will also include:—a. A person, or persons who can clairvoyantly view the subtle body of theemotions.b. A number of people who know somewhat the rudiments of the law of vibration,and can definitely, by the power of thought, apply certain waves of colour toeffect certain cures, and bring about, through scientific comprehension, thedesired results.c. Some member of the group will also be a member of the medical profession, whowill work with the physical body, under the direction of conscious clairvoyants.He will study the resistance of the body, he will apply certain currents, andcolours, and vibrations, which will have a direct physical effect, and by theco-operation of all those units in the group, results will be achieved that willmerit the name of miracles.d. In the group, also, will be a number of people who can meditate occultly, andcan, by the power of their meditation, create the necessary funnel for thetransmission of the healing forces of the higher self and of the Master.e. Besides this, in each group will be found some person who can accuratelytranscribe all that takes place, and so keep records that will prove to be theliterature of the new school of medicine.I have here touched on the ideal group. It is not as yet in any way possible,but a beginning can be made by the utilisation of any knowledge and powers thatmay be found amongst those who seek to serve their race and the Master.As you will note from the above, colours will be applied in two ways:— [247]1. On the subtler planes by the power of thought, and2. By means of coloured lights applied to the physical body.On the physical plane the exoteric colour will be applied, whilst on the subtlerthe esoteric. The work therefore will be (until the esoteric becomes theexoteric) largely in the hands of the occult students of the world, working inorganised groups under expert supervision.You ask, just what is the point at which these groups may now begin to work withcolour? The thing that now lies ahead to be mastered and done is to develop theknowledge necessary anent the etheric, to inculcate the building of pure bodies,and to study the effect of different colours on the dense physical. It has beenbut little studied as yet. It will be found that certain colours will definitelyaffect certain diseases, cure certain nervous troubles, eradicate certainnervous tendencies, tend to the building of new tissues, or to the burning outof corruption. All this must be studied. Experiments can be made along the lineof vitalisation and magnetisation, which involve direct action on the etheric,and this again will be found hid in the law of vibration and of colour.Later.......we can take up with greater detail the work of these healing groupswhen gathered for meditation. Here I would but add that certain colours have adefinite effect, though I can only as yet enumerate three, and them butbriefly:—1. Orange stimulates the action of the etheric body; it removes congestion andincreases the flow of prana.2. Rose acts upon the nervous system and tends to vitalisation, and to theremoval of depression, and [248] symptoms of debilitation; it increases the willto live.3. Green has a general healing effect, and can be safely used in cases ofinflammation and of fever, but it is almost impossible as yet to provide theright conditions for the application of this colour, or to arrive at theadequate shade. It is one of the basic colours to be used eventually in thehealing of the dense physical body, being the colour of the note of Nature.This seems to you sketchy and inadequate? So it is, even more so than you cangrasp. But forget not that which I have often told you, that in the following upof brief hints lies the path that leads to the source of all knowledge.September 11, 1920.We come now to the final part of our thoughts on the use of colour inmeditation. We have dealt with the matter in such a way that if the hints thatare scattered throughout the communication are adequately followed up they willform the basis of certain inevitable conclusions. These conclusions willeventually prove to be the postulates upon which the newer schools of medicineor science will base the continuance of their work. We might sum up the imparteddata under definite statements:—1. That the basic colours of the Personality must be transmuted into the coloursof the Triad, or the threefold Spirit. This is effected by the truly occultmeditation.2. That the colours with which the beginner will be primarily concerned areorange, rose and green.3. That the violet ray holds the secret for this immediate cycle. [249]4. That the next point of apprehended knowledge will be the laws governing theetheric body.5. That in the development of the intuition comes cognisance of the esotericcolours which the exoteric veil.6. That colour is the form and force of virtue (in the occult sense) in theinner life.I have summed up the practical points requiring immediate attention for thepurposes of clarification. With this as the basis of study the student mayexpect eventually to see the complete transformation of the type of work doneboth by the schools of medicine and by chairs of psychology. Certain propheciesI may here make which you can note down for the benefit of those who may comeafter.Forecasts anent the future.1. The phraseology of the medical schools will more and more become based onvibration and be expressed in terms of sound and colour.2. The religious teaching of the world and the inculcation of virtue will belikewise imparted in terms of colour. People will eventually be grouped undertheir ray-colour, and this will be possible as the human race develops thefaculty of seeing auras. The number of clairvoyants is already greater than isrealised, owing to the reticence of the true psychic.3. The science of numbers, being in reality the science of colour and sound,will also somewhat change its phraseology and colours will eventually supersedefigures.4. The laws that govern the erection of large buildings and the handling ofgreat weights will some [250] day be understood in terms of sound. The cyclereturns, and in the days to come will be seen the re-appearance of the facultyof the Lemurians and early Atlanteans to raise great masses,—this time on ahigher turn of the spiral. Mental comprehension of the method will be developed.They were raised through the ability of the early builders to create a vacuumthrough sound, and to utilise it for their own purposes.5. Destruction, it will be shewn, can be brought about by the manipulation ofcertain colours, and by the employment of united sound. In this way terrificeffects will be achieved. Colour can destroy just as it can heal; sound candisrupt just as it can bring about cohesion; in these two thoughts lie hid thenext step ahead for the science of the immediate future. The laws of vibrationare going to be widely studied and comprehended and the use of this knowledge ofvibration on the physical planes will bring about many interesting developments.They will be partially an outgrowth of the study of the war and its effect,psychological and otherwise. More was effected by the sound of the great guns,for instance, than by the impact of the projectile on the physical plane. Theseeffects are as yet practically unrecognised, and are largely etheric and astral.6. Music will be largely employed in construction, and in one hundred years fromnow it will be a feature in certain work of a constructive nature. This soundsto you utterly impossible, but it will simply be the utilisation of orderedsound to achieve certain ends. [251]You will ask, what place has all this in a series of letters on meditation?Simply this:—that the method employed in the utilisation of colour and sound inhealing, in promoting spiritual growth, and in exoteric construction on thephysical plane, will be based on the laws that govern the mental body, and willbe forms of meditation. Only as the race develops the dynamic powers andattributes of thought—which powers are the product of meditation, rightlypursued—will the capacity to make use of the laws of vibration be objectivelypossible. Think not that only the religious devotee or mystic, or the man imbuedwith what we call higher teaching, is the exponent of the powers attained bymeditation. All great capitalists, and the supreme heads of finance, ororganised business, are the exponents of similar powers. They arepersonifications of one-pointed adherence to one line of thought, and theirevolution parallels that of the mystic and the occultist. I seek most stronglyto emphasise this fact. They are the ones who meditate along the line of theMahachohan, or the Lord of Civilisation or Culture. Supreme concentratedattention to the matter in hand makes them what they are, and in many respectsthey attain greater results than many a student of meditation. All they need todo is to transmute the motive underlying their work, and their achievement willthen outrun that of other students. They will approach a point of synthesis, andthe Probationary Path will then be trodden.The Law of Vibration will gradually, therefore, be more and more understood, andbe seen to govern action in all of the three departments of the Manu, the WorldTeacher and the Mahachohan. It will find its basic expression and its familiarterminology in those of colour and sound. Emotional disorder will be regarded asdiscordant sound; mental lethargy will be expressed in terms of low [252]vibration, and physical disease will be numerically considered. All constructivework will eventually be expressed in terms of numbers, by colours, and throughsound.This suffices on this matter and at this juncture I have naught further tocommunicate. The subject is abstruse and difficult, and only by patient broodingwill the darkness lighten. Only when the ray of the intuition strikes athwartthe pall of darkness (which pall is the ignorance that hides all knowledge) willthe forms that veil the subjective life be irradiated and known. Only when thelight of reason is dimmed by the radiant sun of wisdom will all things be seenin their just proportions, and will the forms assume their exact colours, andtheir numerical vibration be known.[Image00011.jpg]\"This diagram is an outline of a portion of the Hierarchy at the present moment,and gives only the outstanding Figures, in connection with human evolution. Asimilar diagram from the standpoint of the deva evolution would be differentlyarranged.\"(The connecting lines indicate force currents)[Image00012.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"LETTER VIII - ACCESS TO THE MASTERS VIA MEDITATION.September 12th, 1920.The search for the goal.[256] Today it may be possible to touch somewhat upon the subject of the Mastersand how They may be approached through meditation. This I know is a subjectclose and dear to your heart, as it is to the heart of all those who earnestlyfollow the light within. I seek to handle this subject with you in such a waythat at the close of this letter the Masters will be more real to you than everbefore; the significance of approach to Them be better comprehended and themethod more simplified; and the effect of contact with Them will be sodemonstrated in the life that its immediate and practical attainment will beearnestly pursued. Let us, therefore, as we have always done, divide our subjectinto certain heads and divisions:—1. Who are the Masters?2. What does access to Them entail:—a. From the standpoint of the pupil?b. From the standpoint of the Master?3. Methods of approach to the Masters through meditation.4. The effect of this access on the three planes.Everywhere throughout the whole world is felt the urge that drives a man to seekout someone who, for him, embodies the ideal. Even those who do not admit theexistence of the Masters seek some ideal, and then visualise that ideal asembodied in some form on the physical plane. They picture themselves, perhaps,as the exponents [257] of ideal action, or visualise some great philanthropist,some superlative scientist, some notable artist or musician, as embodying theirsupreme conception. The human being,—simply because he is himself fragmentaryand incomplete—has always this urge within himself to seek other and greaterthan himself. It is this that drives him back to the centre of his being, and itis this that forces him to take the path of return to the All-Self. Ever,throughout the aeons, does the Prodigal Son arise and go to his Father, andalways latent within him is the memory of the Father's home and the glory thereto be found. But the human mind is so constituted that the search for light andfor the ideal is necessarily long and difficult. “Now we see through a glassdarkly, but then face to face”; now we catch glimpses through the occasionalwindows we pass in our ascension of the ladder, of other and greater Beings thanourselves; They hold out to us helping hands, and call to us in clarion tones tostruggle bravely on if we hope to stand where They are now standing.We sense beauties and glories surrounding us that as yet we cannot revel in;they flit into our vision, and we touch the glory at a lofty moment only againto lose the contact and to sink back again into the murky gloom that envelopes.But we know that outside and further on is something to be desired; we learnalso the mystery that that external wonder can only be contacted by withdrawingwithin, till the centre of consciousness is found that vibrates in tune withthose dimly realised wonders, and with those radiant Souls Who call Themselvesour Elder Brothers. Only by trampling on the external sheaths that veil and hidethe inner centre do we achieve the goal, and find the Ones we seek. Only by thedomination of all forms, and the bringing of those forms under the rule of theGod within, can we find the God in all, for it is only the [258] sheaths inwhich we move upon the plane of being that hide from us our inner God, and thatshut us off from Those in Whom the God transcends all outer forms.The great Initiate, Who voiced the words I quote, added still other words ofradiant truth: “Then shall we know even as we are known.” The future holds foreach and all who duly strive, who unselfishly serve and occultly meditate, thepromise of knowing Those Who already have full knowledge of the struggler.Therein lies the hope for the student of meditation; as he struggles, as hefails, as he perseveres, and as he laboriously reiterates from day to day thearduous task of concentration and of mind control, there stand on the inner sideThose Who know him, and Who watch with eager sympathy the progress that bemakes.Forget not the earlier part of the Initiate's remarks where he points out theway whereby the darkness is dispelled, and knowledge of the Great Ones isreached. He emphasises that only by love is the path of light and knowledgetrodden. Why this emphasis upon love? Because the goal for all is love, andtherein lies the merging. To put scientifically what is oft a nebuloussentiment, we might express it as follows:—It is by the attainment of thevibration which is analogous to the Ray of Love-Wisdom (the Divine Ray) that theLords of Love are contacted, that the Masters of Compassion are known, and thatthe possibility of entering into the consciousnesses of the Great Ones and ofall our brothers of whatsoever degree, becomes a fact in manifestation.This is the path to be trodden by one and all, and the method is meditation. Thegoal is perfect love and wisdom; the steps are the surmounting of subplane aftersubplane on all the three planes; the method is that of occult meditation; thereward is the continuous expansion [259] of consciousness that puts a maneventually en rapport with his own Ego, with other selves, with the waitingeager Master to Whom he is assigned, with fellow disciples and more advancedInitiates whom he may contact in that Master's aura, till he finally contactsthe One Initiator, is admitted into the Secret Place, and knows the mystery thatunderlies consciousness itself.September 14th, 1920.1 - WHO ARE THE MASTERS?It might be of value to us in our consideration of the subject of access to theMasters via meditation if we started with a few fundamental statements, dealingwith the Masters and Their place in evolution. We will therefore take up ourfirst point. We shall thus bring before the readers of these letters some ideaas to Their status, Their comprehensive development, and Their methods of work.Needless to say, much that will follow will carry nothing new in import. Thethings that concern us most closely and the things that are to us the mostfamiliar are oft the most frequently overlooked, and the most nebulous to ourreasoning faculty.A Master of the Wisdom is One Who has undergone the fifth initiation. Thatreally means that His consciousness has undergone such an expansion that it nowincludes the fifth or spiritual kingdom. He has worked His way through the fourlower kingdoms:—the mineral, the vegetable, the animal and the human—and has,through meditation and service, expanded His centre of consciousness till it nowincludes the plane of spirit.A Master of the Wisdom is One Who has effected the transfer of polarisation fromthe three atoms of the personal life—as included in the causal body—into thethree atoms of the spiritual Triad. He is consciously [260]spirit-intuition-abstract mind, or atma-buddhi-manas, and this is notpotentially but in full effective power, realised through experience. This hasbeen brought about, as earlier said, through the process of meditation.A Master of the Wisdom is One Who has found not only the chord of the Ego, butthe full chord of the Monad, and can ring the changes therefore at will upon allthe notes from the lowest to that of the monadic. This means occultly that Hehas now developed the creative faculty, and can sound the note for each planeand build thereon. This power—first to discover the notes of the monadic chordand secondly to use those notes in constructive building—is first realisedthrough meditation occultly performed, balanced by service lovinglyadministered.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who can wield the law in the three worlds and candominate all that evolves on those planes. By learning the laws of mind throughthe practice of meditation, He expands the laws of mind till they embrace thelaws of the Universal Mind as demonstrated in lower manifestation. The Laws ofMind are mastered in meditation. They are applied in the life of service whichis the logical outcome of true knowledge.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who has passed out of the Hall of Learning into theHall of Wisdom. He has there graduated through its five grades and hastransmuted lower mind into mind pure and unalloyed, has transmuted desire intointuition, and has irradiated His consciousness with the light of pure Spirit.The discipline of meditation is the only way in which this can be accomplished.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who, through knowledge acquired by means of thefive senses, has learnt [261] that synthesis exists and has merged those fivesenses into the synthetic two, that mark the point of attainment in the solarsystem. Through meditation the geometrical sense of proportion is adjusted, thesense of values is clearly recognised, and through that adjustment andrecognition, illusion is dispelled and reality is known. The practice ofmeditation and the inner concentration there brought about awakens theconsciousness to the value and true use of form. Thereby reality is contactedand the three worlds can no more ensnare.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who knows the meaning of consciousness, of life,and of spirit. He can pass—by the line of least resistance—straight to the“bosom of His Father in Heaven”. The approach to the line of least resistance,the direct path, is found through the practice of meditation.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who has resolved Himself from the five into thethree, and from the three into the two. He has become the five-pointed star, andwhen that moment is reached He sees that star flash out above the One Initiator,and recognises it in those of equal place to His. He has sanctified (in theoccult sense) the Quaternary, has used it as the foundation stone upon which toerect the Temple of Solomon. He has grown beyond that Temple itself and has cometo recognise it as limitation. He has withdrawn Himself from its confining wallsand has entered within the Triad. He has done this always by the occult method,that is, consciously and with full knowledge of each step taken. He learns themeaning of each confining form; then, He has assumed control and wielded the lawupon the plane consistent with the form. He has then outgrown the form and hasdiscarded it for other and higher forms. Thus He has progressed always by meansof the sacrifice and death of the form. Always [262] it is recognised asimprisoning; always it must be sacrificed and must die so that the life withinmay speed ever on and up. The path of resurrection presupposes crucifixion anddeath, and then leads to the Mount whence Ascension may be made. In meditationthe value of the life, and the confines of the form, can be appreciated andknown, and by knowledge and service can the life be set free from all thatlimits and trammels.A Master of the Wisdom is One Who has chosen to stay upon our planet to help Hisfellowmen.... All who attain the fifth Initiation are Masters of the Wisdom, butall stay not and work as servers of the race. They pass to other work of greateror equal importance. To the general public the significance of the term lies inthe thought that They choose to stay and limit Themselves for the sake of menwho are pressing forward on the wave of evolution. Through meditation has theGreat One reached His goal and (which is a thing not so oft comprehended)through meditation, or the manipulation of thought matter, and by work on themental bodies of the race, is the work carried on that aids the evolutionaryprocess.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who has taken the first initiation that links Himup with the greater Brotherhood on Sirius. As afore I have told you, He is anInitiate of the First Degree in the greater Lodge. He has attained an expansionof consciousness that has admitted Him into touch with the solar system in manyof its departments. Now He has ahead of Him a vast reach of expansions that willeventually take Him beyond systemic consciousness into something far greater andwider. He has to begin to learn the rudiments of that cosmic meditation thatwill admit Him into a Consciousness past our conceivable surmise. [263]A Master of the Wisdom is He Who can consciously function as part of theHeavenly Man to Whose Body He may belong. He understands the laws governinggroups and group souls. He governs a group soul consciously Himself (a group onthe path of return and formed of the lives of many sons of men) and He knows Hisplace in the body systemic. He realises the centre in the Body of the HeavenlyMan by means of which He and His group are kept in sympathetic vibration, andconducts His relationship with other groups in the same Body under certaindefinite laws. The value of meditation as a preparation for this activity willbe realised by all thoughtful students, for meditation is the one means wherebythe sense of separateness is transcended, and unity with one's kind occultlycomprehended.A Master of the Wisdom is He Who has entrusted to Him, by virtue of workaccomplished, certain Words of Power. By means of these Words He wields the lawover other evolutions than the human, and through them He co-operates with theactivity aspect of the Logos. Thus He blends His consciousness with that of thethird Logos. Through these Words He assists with the building work, and thecohesive manipulating endeavor of the second Logos, and comprehends the innerworking of the law of gravitation for attraction and repulsion) that governs allthe functions of the second aspect logoic. Through these Words He co-operateswith the work of the first Logos, and learns, as He takes the sixth and seventhInitiations (which is not always done) the meaning of Will as applied in thesystem. These Words are imparted orally, and through clairvoyant faculty butmust be found by the Initiate Himself, by the use of atma and as He attainsatmic consciousness.... When atmic consciousness is developing by means of theintuition, the [264] Initiate can contact the stores of knowledge inherent inthe Monad, and thus learn the Words of Power. This ability comes only after theapplication of the Rod of Initiation as wielded by the Lord of the World.Therefore by the higher stages of occult meditation does a Master of the Wisdomincrease still further His knowledge. Not static is His consciousness, but dailyembracing more. Daily does He apply Himself to further expansion.A Master of the Wisdom is One Who has earned the right through similarity ofvibration to work with the Heads of the Hierarchy of this planet, and inconjunction with analogous Heads on two other planets connected with our chain.When He has taken other initiations He can contact and work in conjunction withall the seven Planetary Logoi, and not just the three in control of alliedchains. The whole system can be embraced by Him, and His consciousness hasexpanded to include the entire objective solar system.I could enumerate still other definitions, and further elucidate the matter foryou, but that imparted today suffices. The point reached by a Master is high,but only relatively so, and you must not forget that when attained by Him itseems low indeed, for He measures it up with the vista expanding before Him.Each expansion of consciousness, each step upon the ladder, but opens before theInitiate another sphere to be embraced, and another step ahead to be taken; eachinitiation achieved but reveals still higher ones to be mastered, and nevercomes the point where the aspirant (be he an average man, an initiate, a Master,a Chohan, or a Buddha) can remain in a condition static, and is incapable offuture progress. Even the Logos Himself aspires, and even the One to Whom Heaspires reaches up to a Greater. [265]What happens in the system transpires likewise on cosmic levels, and what ismastered here must be repeated on a vaster scale in the cosmos itself. In thisthought lies inspiration and development and not despair or weariness. Thereward that comes with each step forward, the delight that lies in increasedcomprehension, rewards the struggling aspirant in adequate fashion.... Tomorrowwe will deal with the more practical side, that of the man who aims at this highcalling.September 16th, 1920.2 - WHAT ACCESS TO THE MASTER ENTAILS.We deal today with the second point in our eighth letter, and we have to look atthe subject in two ways, briefly from the standpoint of the Master, and ratherlengthily from the viewpoint of the pupil.We have in these letters given a broad outline of the magnitude of the task thatlies ahead of the man who proposes to attain. Much that has been written has nointerest for the man who is only of average development, but chiefly concernsthe man who has reached a specific point in evolution, and stands upon the Pathof Probation. Much that might be said upon this matter has been covered in thatearlier series I communicated to you. I seek not to cover the same ground here,but to deal more specifically with the internal relationship which existsbetween Master and pupil.That relationship exists in four grades, in each of which a man progressesnearer to his Master. These four grades are as follows and cover the periodwherein the man is under training until the time when he himself becomes anadept.They are:—a. The period wherein he is on probation. [266]b. The period wherein he is an accepted disciple.c. The period wherein he is regarded as the Master's intimate, or—as it isesoterically termed—the “Son of the Master.”d. The period wherein the final three initiations are taken, and he knowshimself as one with the Master. He ranks then as the “Beloved of the Master,” aposition analogous to that which John, the beloved disciple, held in the Biblestory.All these stages are governed by two things:—a. Similarity of vibration.b. Karma,and all are involved in the ability of tie man to develop group consciousness.On the planes of the higher mind, on the second subplane you have a reflectionof what can be seen on the highest planes of our solar system. What have youthere? The seven Heavenly Men are there to be found, each of Whom is composed(from the standpoint of form) of group souls,—those group souls being made up ofthe individual human and angel units of consciousness. On the second subplane ofthe mental plane you have the groups belonging to the Masters, if so I mayexpress it. These groups are animated and vitalised from the atomic subplanewhere the Masters (when manifesting for the helping of the sons of men) haveTheir habitat,* just as the Heavenly Men have Their originating source and thecause of Their life on the atomic plane of the solar system, that which we callthe plane of adi, or the first plane. These groups are formed around a Master,are enclosed within His aura, and are a part of His consciousness. They includepeople whose egoic ray is the same as His, or whose monadic ray is the same.* Since 1920, great changes have occureed. Now (1949) there has been a shift tothe Buddhic Plane. (A.A.B.)[267] This means that two types of people are concerned:—1. Those who are preparing for the first and second initiations, taken upon theray of the Ego, and2. Those who are preparing for the two next initiations, which are taken uponthe ray of the Monad. You have here a cause of the transference of people fromone ray to another. It is only an apparent transference, even though it entailspassing into the group of a different Master. This takes place after the secondinitiation.A Probationer's three objects.During the period wherein a man is under probation, he is supposed to bedeveloping three things:—1. The ability to contact his group, or in other words, to be sensible of thevibration of the group of which some particular Master is the focal point. Hecontacts it at times and at rare intervals at first. During the early part ofhis probation, whilst he is under observation, he can only sense and hold thegroup vibration (which is the Master's vibration) for a very brief interval. Hewill at some high moment link up with the Master and with the group, and hiswhole being will be flooded with that high vibration, and surge upward in anoutburst of his group colour. Then he will relax, drop back and lose thecontact. His bodies are not refined enough and his vibration is too unstable tohold it long.But, as time progresses (longer or shorter according to the earnestness of thepupil) the frequency of the times of contact increases; he can hold thevibration somewhat longer, and does not relax back to normal with so much ease.Then the time comes when he can be trusted to hold the contact fairly stably. Hepasses then to the second stage. [268]2. The second thing he is supposed to be developing on the probationary path isthe faculty of abstract thought, or the power to link up with the higher mind,via the causal body. He must learn to contact the lower mind simply as aninstrument whereby he can reach the higher, and thus transcend it, until hebecomes polarised in the causal body. Then, through the medium of the causalbody, he links up with the abstract levels. Until he can do this he cannotreally contact the Master, for, as you have been told, the pupil has to raisehimself from his world (the lower) into Their world (the higher).Now both these things—the power to touch the Master and the Master's group, andthe power to polarise himself in the causal body and touch the abstractlevels—are definitely the result of meditation, and the earlier letters you havereceived from me will have made this clear. There is therefore no need torecapitulate the earlier imparted data, save to point out that by strenuousmeditation, and the faculty of one-pointed application to the duty in hand(which is after all the fruit of meditation worked out in daily living) willcome the increased faculty to hold steadily the higher vibration. Again andagain would I reiterate the apparently simple truth, that only similarity ofvibration will draw a man to the higher group to which he may belong, to theMaster Who represents to him the Lord of His Ray, to the World Teacher Whoadministers to him the mysteries, to the One Initiator Who effects the finalliberation, and to the centre within the Heavenly Man in Whose Body he finds aplace. It is the working out of the Law of Attraction and Repulsion on all theplanes that gathers the life divine out of the mineral kingdom, out of thevegetable and animal kingdoms, that draws the latent Deity from out of thelimitations of the human kingdom, and affiliates the man [269] with his divinegroup. The same law effects his liberation from subtler forms that likewisebind, and blends him back into his animating source, the Lord of the Ray inWhose Body his Monad may be found. Therefore the work of the probationer is toattune his vibration to that of his Master, to purify his three lower bodies sothat they form no hindrance to that contact, and so to dominate his lower mindthat it is no longer a barrier to the downflow of light from the threefoldSpirit. Thus he is permitted to touch that Triad and the group on the subplaneof the higher mental to which he—by right and karma—-belongs. All this isbrought about by meditation, and there is no other means for achieving theseaims.3. The third thing the probationer has to do is to equip himself emotionally andmentally, and to realise and prove that he has somewhat to impart to the groupwith which he is esoterically affiliated. Think upon this: too much emphasis islaid at times upon that which the pupil will get when he becomes an accepteddisciple or probationer. I tell you here, in all earnestness, that he will nottake these desired steps until he has somewhat to give , and something to addthat will increase the beauty of the group, that will add to the availableequipment that the Master seeks for the helping of the race, and that willincrease the richness of the group colouring. This can be brought about in twoways that mutually interact:—a. By the definite equipping, through study and application, of the content ofthe emotional and mental bodies.b. By the utilisation of that equipment in service to the race on the physicalplane, thereby demonstrating to the eyes of the watching Hierarchy that thepupil has somewhat to give . He must show that his one desire is to be abenefactor and [270] to serve, rather than to grasp and acquire for himself.This life of acquisition for the purposes of giving must have for incentive theideals touched in meditation, and for inspiration those downpourings from thehigher mental levels and from the buddhic levels which are the result of occultmeditation.When these three results are brought about, and when the high vibration touchedis more frequent and stable, then the probationer takes the next step forwardand becomes an accepted disciple.Accepted Discipleship.The second period, wherein a man is an accepted disciple, is perhaps one of themost difficult in a man's whole period of lives. It is made so in several ways:—He is definitely a part of the Master's group, and is within the consciousnessof the Master at all times, being kept within His aura. This involves the steadyholding of a high vibration. I would have you ponder on what the effect of thiswould be. To hold this vibration is at all times a difficult thing to do; itfrequently involves an intensification of all that subsists within a man'snature, and may lead (especially at first) to curious demonstration. Yet, ifever a man is to be able to hold the force that is the result of the applicationof the Rod of Initiation, he has to demonstrate his ability to do so at anearlier stage, and be able to hold himself stably and to move steadily forwardwhen subjected to the intensification of vibration that comes from the Master.He has to discipline himself so that nothing can enter into his consciousnessthat could in any way harm the group to which he belongs, or be antagonistic tothe Master's vibration. If I might so express it, so as to give [271] you someconception of my meaning, when he first forms part of the group enclosed in theMaster's aura, he is kept on the periphery of that aura until he has learnt tothrow off automatically, and to reject immediately, every thought and desireunworthy of the Self and thus harmful to the group. Until he has learnt to dothis he cannot advance into a closer relationship, but must remain where he canbe automatically shut off. But gradually he purifies himself still more,gradually he develops group consciousness and thinks in group terms of service,gradually his aura takes on more and more the colouring of his Master's aura,till he blends and has earned the right to be gathered closer to his Master'sHeart. Later I will explain the technical meaning of this phrase, when dealingwith the work of the Master with the pupil. Suffice it to say, that as the termof “accepted disciple” progresses (and it varies in different cases) thedisciple advances ever closer to the heart of the group, and finds his own placeand functional activity in that body corporate. That is the secret: the findingof one's place,—not so much one's place upon the ladder of evolution (for thatis approximately known), but in service . This is of more importance than isrealised, for it covers the period which, at the end, will definitelydemonstrate which path a man will follow after the fifth initiation.Sonship to the Master.We now come to the time when the disciple moves on to the much coveted positionof a “Son of the Master.” He is then a part consciously and at all times of theMaster's consciousness. The interplay between the Master and disciple is beingrapidly perfected, and the disciple can now consciously and at will link up withthe Master and ascertain His thoughts. He can enter into His plans, desires[272] and will. This he has won by the right of similarity of vibration, andbecause the shutting off process (necessitated earlier by discordant vibration)is practically superseded; the disciple has so purified himself that histhoughts and desires cause no disquietude to the Master, and no contraryvibration to the group. He has been tried and not been found wanting. His lifeof service in the world is more concentrated and perfected, and he is dailydeveloping his power to give, and increasing his equipment. All this concernshis relationship to some Master and to some one group soul. It is not dependentupon his taking initiation. Initiation is a technical matter and can beexpressed in terms of esoteric science. A man can take initiation and yet not bea “son of a Master.” Discipleship is a personal relationship, governed by termsof karma and affiliation, and is not dependent upon a man's status in the Lodge.Keep this clear in your mind. Cases have been known when a man hasacquired—through diligence—the technical requisites for initiation beforebecoming affiliated with any particular Master.This later relationship of “son” to some Master has a peculiar sweetness all itsown, and carries with it certain privileges. The disciple can then lift some ofthe burden off his Master's shoulders, and relieve Him of some of Hisresponsibilities, thereby setting Him free for more extended work. Hence theemphasis laid on service, for it is only as a man serves that he advances. It isthe keynote of the vibration of the second abstract level. The Master at thisperiod will confer with His “Son” and plan the work to be done upon their unitedpoint of view. In this way He will develop His pupil's discrimination andjudgment, and lighten His own load along certain lines, thus setting Himselffree for other important work. [273]The final period of those under discussion can have but little submitted aboutit. It covers the period when a man is mastering the final stages of the Pathand is entering into closer and closer touch with his group and with theHierarchy. He is not only vibrating in tune with his group and with his Master,but is beginning now to gather out his own people, and form a group himself.This group will be at first only on emotional and physical levels and on thelower mental. After the fifth initiation he will enclose within his aura thesegroups and those on egoic levels who are his own. This in no way prevents hisbeing one with his Master and group, but the method of interblending is one ofthe secrets of initiation.All this, coupled with what has been earlier imparted, will give you some ideaof the rights and powers acquired on the Probationary Path and on the Path ofInitiation. The means of development are ever the same:—occult meditation andservice; the inner life of concentration and the outer life of practice; theinner ability to contact the higher, and the outer ability to express thatfaculty in terms of holy living; the inner irradiation from the Spirit, and theouter shining before men.September 17th, 1920.......The subject that we have for the past few days been studying, though notso technical as some of the earlier imparted data, yet carries with it avibration that will make this eighth letter one of those with the most potentappeals in the series. We have dealt with the facts as to the Masters and WhoThey are, and Their place in the scheme of things, and we have touched brieflyupon what access to a Master entails from the standpoint of a pupil. We haveseen that that access is a gradual process and carries a man from an occasionalouter contact with [274] a Master and His group to a position of the closestintimacy, and to an attitude that places the pupil within the aura and close tothe heart of his Teacher. Today we will consider for a while what this gradualchanging of position has entailed on the part of the Master and what it hasnecessitated on His side.The relationship of Master and pupil.As you have frequently been told, the attention of a Master is attracted to aman by the brilliance of the indwelling light. When that light has reached acertain intensity, when the bodies are composed of a certain grade of matter,when the aura has attained a certain hue and when the vibration has reached aspecific rate and measure, and when a man's life commences to sound occultly inthe three worlds (which sound is to be heard through the life of service), someone particular Master begins to test him out by the application of some highervibration, and by the study of his reaction to that vibration. The choice of apupil by a Master is governed by past karma and by old association, by the rayon which they both may be found, and by the need of the hour. The Master's work(as much of it as may wisely be made exoteric) is varied and interesting, and isbased on a scientific comprehension of human nature. What is it that a Masterhas to do with a pupil? By enumerating the chief things to be done we may getsome idea of the scope of His work:—He has to accustom the pupil to raise his rate of vibration till he cancontinuously carry a high one, and then assist him until that high vibrationbecomes the stable measure of the pupil's bodies.He has to assist the pupil to effect the transfer of polarisation from the lowerthree atoms of the Personality to the higher ones of the Spiritual Triad. [275]He has to watch over the work accomplished by the pupil whilst making thechannel between higher and lower mind, whilst he builds and employs this channel(the antahkarana). This channel eventually supersedes the causal body as a meansof communication between the higher and the lower. The causal body is itselfeventually done away with when the pupil takes the fourth initiation and canfreely create his own body of manifestation.He definitely assists at the vivification of the various centres and theircorrect awakening, and He later aids the pupil to work consciously through thosecentres, and to carry the circulating fire in right geometrical progression fromthe base of the spine to the head centre.He superintends the work of the pupil on different planes and makes records ofthe extent of the work accomplished, and the far-reaching effect of the spokenword as enunciated by the pupil. This is (putting it occultly) the effect on theinner planes of the note of the pupil's exoteric life.He enlarges the consciousness of the pupil in various ways, and develops hiscapacity to include and contact other rates of vibration than the human, tounderstand the consciousness of other evolutions than the human, and move withfacility in other spheres than the earth sphere.His immediate goal in working with the pupil is to prepare him for the firstinitiation. This takes place when the capacity of the pupil to hold a certainrate of vibration for a specific length of time is developed, the length of timebeing that wherein he must stand before the Lord of the first two initiations.This is accomplished by a gradual raising of the vibration at few and statedintervals, and later more frequently, until the pupil can vibrate with greaterease and comfort to the vibration of his Master, and can hold the vibration foran ever increasing [276] length of time. When he can hold it for this period(the length of which is of course one of the secrets of the first initiation) heis subjected to the application of a still higher vibration which—when held—willenable him to stand before the Great Lord for a length of time sufficient topermit of the initiation ceremony. The application then of the Rod of Initiationeffects something that stabilises vibration, and makes it easier to progress inthe task of vibrating to the higher measure of the subtler planes.He develops the capacity of the pupil to work in group formation. He studies hisaction and interaction on his own affiliated group. He works with the pupil'scausal body and its expansion and development, and teaches the pupil tounderstand the law of his own being and through that understanding brings him toa comprehension of the macrocosm.Now all these various aspects of the Master's work (and these are but a few ofthe points which might be considered) might be dealt with at length and wouldprove of illuminating interest to the reader. All the above paragraphs could beextended and prove of exceeding interest. But the main point I seek to make hereis in connection with the earlier stages of this work, before the pupil isadmitted into the later stages of close intimacy with his Master. The Masterduring this period works with his disciple principally:—a. At night, when he is out of the physical body.b. During the periods when the disciple is meditating.According to the success of the meditation, according to the ability of thestudent to shut off the lower and contact the higher, so will come theopportunity of the Master to accomplish successfully the scientific definitework that [277] needs His attention. Students of meditation would be astoundedand perhaps discouraged, could they realise how seldom they provide the rightconditions through meditation which will enable their watching Teacher to bringabout certain effects. By the frequency of the student's ability to do thiscomes indication of progress, and the possibility of carrying him on anotherstep. Emphasise this point in teaching, for it carries with it an incentive togreater diligence and application. If the pupil himself on his side provides notthe just conditions, the Master's hands are tied and He can do but little.Self-effort is the key to progress, coupled to conscious comprehendingapplication to the work laid down. When that effort is made with perseverance,then comes the opportunity of the Master to carry out His side of the work.As the pupil meditates with occult accuracy he brings his three lower bodiesinto alignment and—with emphasis I reiterate—only as alignment is effected isthe Master able to work with the bodies of the pupil. If naught else is effectedby the publication of these letters except the intensification of the desire tomeditate with correctness, the object in view will be largely attained. In thateffort the right conditions between pupil and Master, and a correctinterrelation will be brought about. Meditation provides these conditions, whenrightly followed. It prepares the field for labour and for work.Let us briefly consider the various periods as enumerated yesterday whenconsidering the pupil's relationship to a Master.In the period when the man is under probation and supervision.........he is leftalmost entirely to himself and is only conscious of the attention of the Masterat rare and irregular intervals. His physical brain is not often receptive tothe higher contact, and though his Ego [278] is fully aware of his position onthe Path, not yet is the physical brain in a condition to know. But on thispoint no hard and fast rule can be laid down. When a man has been for severallives making contacts with his Ego or with his Master he may be aware of it.Individuals differ so much that no universal rule in detail can be formulated.As you know, the Master makes a small image of the probationer, which image isstored in certain subterranean centres in the Himalayas. The image ismagnetically linked with the probationer, and shows all the fluctuations of hisnature. Being composed of emotion and mental matter it pulsates with everyvibration of those bodies. It shows their predominating hues, and by studying itthe Master can rapidly gauge the progress made and judge when the probationermay be admitted into a closer relationship. The Master views the image at statedintervals, rarely at first, as the progress made in the beginning stages is notso rapid, but with ever increasing frequency as the student of meditationcomprehends more readily and more consciously co-operates. The Master wheninspecting the images works with them, and through their means effects certainresults. Just as later the Rod of Initiation is applied to the bodies andcentres of the initiate, so at certain times the Master applies certain contactsto the images and via them stimulates the bodies of the pupil.A time comes when the Master sees, from His inspection of the image, that theneeded rate of vibration can be held, that the required eliminations have beenmade, and a certain depth of colour attained. He can then take the risk (forrisk it is) and admit the probationer within the periphery of His own aura. Hebecomes then an accepted disciple. [279]During the period wherein a man is an accepted disciple the work done by theMaster is of very real interest. The pupil is assigned to special classesconducted by more advanced disciples under the supervision of the Master, andthough he may attend still the larger general classes in the Ashram (theMaster's hall for teaching) he is subjected to a more intensifiedtraining..........The Master works in the earlier stages in four main ways:—a. At intervals, and when the progress of the pupil justifies it, He “gathersthe pupil to His Heart.” This is an esoteric statement of a very interestingexperience to which the pupil will be subjected. At the close of some class inthe ashram, or during some specially successful meditation wherein the pupil hasreached a certain rate of vibration, the Master will gather him close toHimself, bringing him from the periphery of His aura to the centre of Hisconsciousness. He thereby gives him a tremendous temporary expansion ofconsciousness, and enables him to vibrate at an unusual rate for him.Hence the need for meditation. The reward of such an experience far outweighsany of the strenuous parts of the work.b. The Master works upon the bodies of his pupil with colour, and brings aboutresults in those bodies that enable the pupil to make more rapid progress. Nowyou will see why......so much emphasis is laid upon colour. It is not onlybecause it holds the secret of form and manifestation (which secret must beknown by the occultist) but the emphasis is laid thus in order that he mayconsciously co-operate in the work of the [280] Master on his bodies, andintelligently follow the effects brought about. Ponder on this.c. At stated intervals the Master takes His pupils, and enables them to contactother evolutions, such as the great angels and devas, the lesser builders andthe sub-human evolutions. This can be safely done by the pupil through theprotective effect of the Master's aura. Later, when himself an initiate, thepupil will be taught how to protect himself and to make his own contacts.d. The Master presides over the work of stimulating the centres in the pupil'sbodies and the awakening of the inner fire. He teaches the pupil the meaning ofthe centres and their correct fourth dimensional rotation and in time He willbring the pupil to a point where he can consciously and with full knowledge ofthe law work with his centres, and bring them to a point where they can besafely stimulated by the Rod of Initiation. More on this subject is not yetpossible.........I have only touched in the briefest manner on a few of the things a Master hasto do with His pupils. I take not up the later stages of the pupil's progress.We lead all on by gradual steps, and as yet even accepted disciples are rare. Ifby meditation, service, and the purifying of the bodies, those now on probationcan be led to make more rapid progress, then will come the time for thecommunication of further information. What use is it to give facts of which thestudent cannot as yet make use? We waste not time in interesting intellectuallythose we seek to help. When the pupil has equipped himself, when he has purifiedhimself and is vibrating adequately, naught can withhold all knowledge from him.When he opens the [281] door and widens the channel, light and knowledge willpour in.Tomorrow we will take up our third point, methods of approach to a Master viameditation; certain types of meditation will be slightly enlarged upon whichwill facilitate contact, but forget not that the life of objective service mustkeep pace with the subjective growth; only when the two are seen together andapproved are the necessary steps for contact permitted. A Master is onlyinterested in a man from the point of view of his usefulness in the group soul,and his capacity to help.September 19th, 1920.We can today take up our last two points practically simultaneously. They dealwith methods of approach to the Masters and the objective effects on the threeplanes of human evolution. Some of the points touched upon are already wellknown. Others may not be so familiar to the general student.......In theseletters we have dealt with the student himself and what he has to bring to theendeavour; we have indicated likewise his goal—and very sketchily—the forms andmethods whereby success may be achieved. We have dealt also with those aids tomeditation, the Sacred Word, Colour and Sound, and have indicated that which(brooded upon in silence) may lead to the student making some discoveries forhimself. Lastly we have tried to bring the Masters and Their reality nearer tothe student, and thereby facilitate his approach to Them.What now remains to be done? To indicate five things that may be looked for withconviction by the student who has endeavoured to conform his life to the lineslaid down by me in these letters. If the student but provides the rightconditions, if he conforms to the necessary [282] rules, if he aims always atregularity, at calmness, at that inner concentration that holds the mystery ofthe High Places, he will on certain occasions and with ever-increasing frequencyawake to some definite realisations. These realisations will be the outerrecognition of inner results, and will be the guarantee to him that he is on theright path. But I would here point out again that these results are onlyachieved after long practice, strenuous struggle, diligent disciplining of thethreefold lower man, and consecrated service to the world.3 - METHODS OF APPROACH AND EFFECTS OBTAINED.The methods of approach are broadly three and we might indicate five resultsthat will eventuate from the employment of these methods. The three methodsare:—1. Sanctified service.2. Love demonstrating through wisdom.3. Intellectual application.They are all three but diverse methods of expressing one and the samething,—active one-pointedness that expresses itself in service for the racethrough love and wisdom. But some individuals express this in one way and somein another; some carry the outer appearance of intellectuality and others oflove, yet before the attainment is possible intellectuality must be based onlove, whilst love without mental development and that discrimination that mindaffords is apt to be unbalanced and unwise. Both love and mind must be expressedin terms of service before the full flower of either is attained. Let usconsider each of these methods separately and indicate the meditation to befollowed thereon:—Sanctified Service. This is the method of the man who wields the law, the methodof the occultist, and the rudiments of the method are laid down in raja-yoga[283] ..............The word “sanctification,” as you know, in the basic sensesignifies the complete surrender of the whole being to one object, the Lord orRuler. It means the giving wholly to the one the devotee aspires to. It meansthe consecration of the whole threefold man to the work in hand. It entails,therefore, the application of the entire time and self to the bringing of eachbody under the subjugation of the Ego, and the complete mastery of each planeand subplane. It involves the comprehension of each evolution and form of divinelife as found on those planes and sub-planes, with one aim in view and onlyone—the furthering of the plan of the Hierarchy of Light. The method followed isthat of the intensest application to the work of rounding out the bodies and ofmaking them fit instruments for service. It is perhaps the hardest way that aman can tread. It leaves no department of the life untouched. All is broughtunder law. In meditation therefore the form of that meditation will be athreefold structure:—a. The laws governing the physical body will be studied and brooded over. Thisbrooding will find expression in a rigid disciplining of the physical body. Itwill be set apart wholly for service, and subjected consequently to a processthat will attune and develop it more quickly.b. The body of the emotions will be scientifically studied and the laws of water(occultly understood) will be comprehended. The significance of the term, “thereshall be no more sea” will be known, and the sea of storm and passion will besuperseded by the sea of glass, which directly reflects the higher intuition,and mirrors it with perfect accuracy, being unruffled and immovable. Theemotional body will [284] be set apart wholly for service, and its place in thethreefold microcosm will be regarded as corresponding to that in the macrocosm,whilst the occult significance of its being the only complete unit in thethreefold lower nature will be apprehended, and the fact made use of to effectcertain results. Ponder on this.c. The place of lower mind in the scheme of things will be studied, and thequality of discrimination developed. Discrimination and fire are occultly alliedand just as the Logos by fire tries every man's work of what sort it is, so themicrocosm on a lesser scale has to do the same. Just as the Logos likewise doesthis paramountly in the fifth round of judgment and of separation, so themicrocosm on his lesser scale does the same in the last and fifth period of hisevolution,—touched upon and described earlier in these letters. Every power ofthe mind will be utilised to the uttermost for the furtherance of the plans ofevolution; first in the man's own development, then in the special field of workwherein he expresses himself, and lastly in his relationship with other units ofthe race, as he constitutes himself their guide and servant.See you therefore the synthesis of it? First the strenuous one-pointedness thatis the sign of the occultist blended with the wisdom and love which arereflected from the higher in the mirror of the emotional body, and then theintellect forced to act as the servant of the Ego through one-pointed effortanimated by love and wisdom. The result will be the true Yogi.I would point out here that the true Yogi is he who, after due carrying out ofthe set forms and times of meditation, merges that meditation in the everydayliving, and will eventually be in the attitude of meditation all the day. [285]Meditation is the means whereby the higher consciousness is contacted. When thecontact becomes continuous, meditation, as you understand it, is superseded. Inthis first method the occult student works from the periphery to the centre,from the objective to the subjective, from the form to the life within the form.Therefore through the emphasis laid in Raja Yoga on the physical body and itswise control the occultist realises the essential importance of the physical,and the uselessness of all his knowledge apart from a physical body whereby hecan express himself and serve the race. It is the line of the first ray, and itsaffiliated or complementary ray.Love and Wisdom. This method is the line of least resistance for the sons ofmen. It is the sub-ray of the synthetic ray of an analogous vibration, of whichour solar system is the objective manifestation. But I would seek to point outthat the love achieved by the student of meditation who follows this line is notthe sentimental conception that is so often discussed. It is not thenon-discriminating love that sees no limitation, nor concedes a fault. It is notthe love that seeks not to correct and that expresses itself in an ill advisedattitude to all who live. It is not the love that sweeps all into service,suitable or unsuitable, and that recognises no difference in point ofdevelopment. Much that is called love,—if logically followed out—wouldapparently dispense with the ladder of evolution, and rank all as of equalvalue. So potentially all are, but in present terms of service all are not.True love or wisdom sees with perfect clarity the deficiencies of any form, andbends every effort to aid the indwelling life to liberate itself from trammels.It wisely recognises those that need help, and those that need not itsattention. It hears with precision, and sees the thought of the heart and seeksever to blend into one whole the [286] workers in the field of the world. Thisit achieves not by blindness, but by discrimination and wisdom, separatingcontrary vibrations and placing them in position diverse. Too much emphasis hasbeen laid on that called love (interpreted by man, according to his presentplace in evolution) and not enough has been placed on wisdom, which is loveexpressing itself in service, such a service that recognises the occult law, thesignificance of time, and the point achieved.This is the line of the second ray and its affiliated and complementary rays.Later it is the all-inclusive one, and the solvent and absorber. It can befollowed, being synthetic, on either the Raja Yoga line or the Christian Gnosticline, owing to its synthetic significance....Intellectual application. Here the order is reversed and the student, beingfrequently polarised in his mental body has to learn through that mind tounderstand the other two, to dominate and control, and to utilise to theuttermost the powers inherent in the threefold man. The method here is perhapsnot so hard in some ways, but the limitations of the fifth principle have to betranscended before real progress can be made. These limitations are largelycrystallisation and that which you call pride. Both have to be broken before thestudent who progresses through intellectual application can serve his race withlove and wisdom as the animating cause.He has to learn the value of the emotions, and in so learning he has to masterthe effect of fire on water, occultly understood. He has to learn the secret ofthat plane, which secret (when known) gives him the key to the downpour ofillumination from the Triad via the causal and thence to the astral. It holdsthe key also of the fourth etheric level. This will not as yet be comprehended[287] by you, but the above hint holds for the student much of value.This is the line of the third ray and of its four subsidiary rays, and is one ofgreat activity, of frequent transference, and of much mental display in thelower worlds.Only when the student, who progresses by intellectual application, has learnedthe secret of the fifth plane, will he live the life of sanctified service, andso blend the three rays. Always synthesis most be attained, but always thefundamental colouring or tone remains. The next or fifth round will show thegreatest exposition of this method. It will be the round of supreme mentaldevelopment, and will carry its evolving Monads to heights undreamed of now.This round marks the height of the second method, that through love or wisdom.It is the fourth round, that wherein the emotional reaches a high point ofvibration, and there is direct connection between the fourth plane of harmony,between the emotional body, or the fourth principle, the quaternary, the fourthroot-race or the Atlantean which co-ordinated the astral. I give you food forthought in these correspondences.September 21st, 1920.4 - FIVE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION IN THE THREE WORLDS.Today we are to take up the five effects in the three bodies in the lower worldsthat the student of meditation will be conscious of if he has duly followed thecourse laid down.These effects are not specifically effects in the life as apparent to theonlooking world, such as greater love or [288] spirituality or capacity toserve. What I seek today to bring out are the indications in the physical brainconsciousness of the student that he has done some of the necessary work and isattaining somewhat the desired object. Keep this very clearly in mind. I do notseek to make clear all the many and various results achieved by the successfulfollowing of the occult laws of meditation. I deal here only with one phase ofthe matter, and that is, the realisation, in the physical brain consciousness,of certain results along the line of our immediate topic,—access to the Masters.This narrows down our subject to that of a conscious realisation of the Mastersand of some one particular Master by the student in his physical brain. Thisrealisation is very largely independent of his place upon the Path, of hisnearness to or distance from initiation. Some very advanced egos may be workingat this problem, and be close indeed to their Master, without being able tobring through to the physical brain specific facts proving to them thisnearness. Some effect this knowledge at earlier stages than others. It isdependent upon the type of body in use and the work done in previous lives,resulting in a physical vehicle that is a fairly just exponent of the inner man.Oft the man is of far greater calibre and attainment on the inner planes than heis on the physical. So many of our most earnest workers in this particular halfcentury are working out evil karma through the possession of inadequate bodies.Through diligence, application, high endeavour, and the long and patientfollowing of the rules laid down, there comes a time when the student issuddenly conscious—right within the physical brain—of certain unexpected events,an illumination or a seeing that has before been unknown. It is something thatis so real yet so momentarily surprising that no amount of subsequent [289]apparent disproving can take away fron him the knowledge that he saw , hecontacted, he felt.As often I have told you, it is not possible in any way in this work to do morethan widely generalise. Sixty thousand million souls in process of evolving,each following certain rounds of lives totally different from those of others,offer a wide field to choose from, and no one experience is exactly the same asanother. But it might be generally laid down that there are five ways (out ofthe many possible) which are of such frequent occurrence, comparativelyspeaking, as to warrant our enumerating them. All have been hinted at, but I maysomewhat enlarge the already imparted data.Seeing the Master and the self within the cave of the heart. As you know, thestudent has often been told to visualise himself and the Master—about the sizeof a quarter inch—within the circumference of the etheric heart. He is told topicture, toward the close of his meditation the heart etheric, and therein buildminute forms of the Master to Whom he is drawn and of himself. This he proceedsto do with due and elaborate care, with the aid of the imagination and lovingeffort, working daily on his figures till they become to him very real, andtheir building and forming becomes almost an automatic part of his meditationform. Then comes a day (usually when astrological conditions are fit and themoon approaches the full) when he becomes conscious within his brain that thosefigures are not the little puppets he thinks, but that he is within the figurerepresenting himself, and that he stands literally and in all verity before theMaster. This occurs at rare intervals at first, and the consciousness of thefact is held but for a few brief seconds; as progress is made, and everydepartment of his nature and of his service develops, with greater frequencywill come the experience, [290] with longer periods will it be marked, untilthere comes a time when the pupil can link up as easily in this manner with hisMaster as earlier he formed his figures.Just what did occur? The pupil had succeeded in doing three things:—1. Identifying himself with the figure within the heart, and aspiring to theMaster.2. Making a definite channel between the heart centre (wherein he isendeavouring to focus his consciousness) and its corresponding head centre. Eachof the seven centres in the body, as you know, has a counterpart within thehead. It is in the linking up of the centre with its counterpart in the headthat illumination comes. This,—in the case in point—has been accomplished by thestudent. He has connected the heart with its head centre.3. Not only has he accomplished the two above things but he has so purified thatpart of the physical brain that corresponds with the particular head centre thatit can respond to the higher vibration necessitated, and therefore accuratelyrecord what has transpired.Recognition of vibration. In this instance the method is not quite the same. Thestudent becomes conscious during his moments of intensest aspiration inmeditation of a certain peculiar vibration or sensation in his head. It may bein one of three places:—a. At the top of the spine.b. In the forehead.c. At the top of the head.I speak not here of the sensation that comes when psychic faculty develops,though there is an alliance between the two, but I speak of a definite vibrationthat accompanies contact with one of the Great Ones. The student at first isonly conscious of a feeling of momentary heightening, which takes the form of aripple or movement in the head. [291] At first it may be attended with somediscomfort, if felt in the forehead it may cause tears and weeping, if at thetop of the spine or base of the skull exhilaration and even dizziness, and if atthe top of the head a sense of expansion with a feeling of fullness, as if thelimiting skull were too confining. This wears off with greater use. It is allcaused by a contact, momentary at first, with some one Master. In time thestudent comes to recognise this vibration and to associate it with someparticular Great One, for each Master has His own vibration which impressesitself upon His pupils in a specific manner. This method of contact isfrequently attended by perfume. In time the pupil learns how to raise hisvibration to a certain pitch. Having done this he holds the vibration steadyuntil he senses the Master's answering vibration or the perfume. Then heendeavours to merge his consciousness with the Master's as far as may be, toascertain the Master's will, and to understand what it is that the Master has tocommunicate. As time progresses and the response of the pupil grows, the Masteron His side will attract his attention or signal to him approval (for instanceby arousing this vibration within his head)....September 23rd, 1920.......We have now our three remaining points to take up, having already dealtwith the two that touched upon contact with the Master in the cave of the heart,and the recognition of His vibration. There are still three other ways (out ofmany, forget not) whereby the earnest student may be conscious in his physicalbrain of having contacted his Master.Bringing through into the physical brain consciousness the memory of theMaster's ashram and the lessons imparted there. [292]As the student perseveres in his meditation, as he increases his facility tothrow himself into the right vibration, he builds up a pathway (if so we mayterm it) that leads him direct to his Master. This is a literal statement offact. Good work earns for the man in time the right to be with the Master atstated periods. This entails good work in meditation coupled with active servicefor the race. These intervals are rare at first but come more frequently asprogress is made. He will then become aware of this contact through remembranceon awakening. He will see the room of the Master, and remember his associates inthe work of the class. He will remember certain sentences, as spoken by hisMaster, and will bring back a recollection of work suggested or of admonition.This is one of the methods which are indicative to the pupil that he issucceeding, through the ability built up in meditation, in gaining access to theMaster.The attainment of a certain amount of causal consciousness. This is indicativeof the pupil's having developed (mayhap in small degree, yet definitelyrealised) the power to enter somewhat into Their world. The faculty of abstractthought and contemplation, the power to transcend the limitations of time andspace, are powers of the body egoic, and as all egoic groups are—asaforesaid—controlled by some one Master, the development of egoic consciousness(when consciously recognised) is indicative of contact and access. Many soulsunconsciously contact their Ego, and temporarily have flashes of egoicconsciousness but when the pupil can consciously raise himself, when he withdeliberation intensifies his vibration, and transfers his polarisation into thebody egoic, even if for a brief moment, then he can know that he is for thatbrief moment vibrating to the key of the Master of his group. He has madecontact. He may not remember [293] in his physical brain, at first, the detailsof that contact, he may not realise the appearance of the Master or the wordsthat passed His lips, but having consciously conformed to rule, and enteredwithin the silence of the high places, the law ever works, and he has made hiscontact. Some disciples know their Master intimately on the inner planes andwork under His direction, but many lives may elapse before they comprehend thelaw and with deliberation can make the channel of access, through powerdeveloped in meditation.As time elapses this ability to contact increases until the point is reachedwhen the pupil can at any time find out what is the will of the Master and haveaccess to His heart.This fifth method is not so usual but it is known to some natures. Through soundthe aspirant is aware of success. He follows his usual form of meditation. Heperseveres from day to day and works on all the three planes over the work to bedone. He continuously raises his vibration and aspires in the needed endeavour,coupling all interior effort to the external life of loving service. At some onemeditation he will suddenly become aware of a note of music, that seems to besounded within his head or to emanate from his heart. It will not be evoked bythe sounding of the Sacred Word, which Word when sounded by the man on a certainkey may call forth a musical response from the Ego, but it will come as a resultor culmination of the meditation, and the sound of the note will vibrate withinthe centre so distinctly as never to be forgotten. It is again an indication ofsuccess. The Master has been contacted, and has responded by sounding the toneof the man's own Ego. This is really the basis of the custom of the doorkeeperresponding to the would-be aspirant to the mysteries of the group. When the work[294] is properly done, the aspirant will sound the admission word in his ownkey or tone, endeavouring to strike the note that will evoke the Ego. Thedoorkeeper will respond and chant forth the reply in the same full sonoroustone, thereby, through the power of sound, linking the man up with the Master ofthe coming ceremonies. This puts each member of the group—through his own effortand through the third factor, the doorkeeper—en rapport with the Master. In timethis will be more fully understood and effort will be made to keep the tonereverberating between those who enter and those who guard the Threshold. Whenperfectly accomplished (a thing impossible now) it forms a perfect protection.Groups will be formed according to egoic formation and the particular Master.The note of the group will be known to the one who guards the entrance, and noone can get in who sounds not the note in either the higher or lower octave.This applies to groups consecrated to inner spiritual development, and that aredirectly concerned with the work of a Master with His affiliated pupils ordisciples or probationers. Other groups, formed of units diverse and underdifferent rays and Masters, will guard their door by another method, later to berevealed.When, in meditation, a student hears this inner musical note, he shouldendeavour to register it, and cultivate the faculty of both recognising it andutilising it. This is not easy at first, as the sounding is both unlooked forand too brief to catch. But as time progresses, and the pupil succeeds in againand yet again getting a similar response, then he can begin to find out themethod and watch the causes that set the vibration in motion.As I have said before, many are the methods whereby a pupil becomes aware ofsuccess in the path of access. Above are but five out of these many. Later, whenthe [295] Schools are organised and watched over by a Master in physical planeconsciousness, records will be kept of the times and modes of contact and inthis manner much knowledge will accrue. I would in conclusion point out thatalways the calling forth of the response must be the work of the pupil, and thatthe hour of that response depends upon the earnestness of his work, theconsecration of his service and his karmic liabilities. When he merits certainresponse it will be demonstrated in his stars, and naught can hinder or delay.Equally, naught can really hasten, so the pupil need not waste time in dolefulponderings upon the lack of response. His the part to obey the rules, to conformto the forms laid down, to ponder and wisely adhere to the prescribedinstructions, and to definitely work and to ardently serve his fellowmen. Whenhe has done all this, when he has built the necessary vibrating material intohis three lower bodies, when he has aligned them with the body egoic (even ifonly for a brief minute) suddenly he may see, suddenly he may hear, suddenly hemay sense a vibration, and then forever he may say that faith is merged insight, and aspiration has become recognition. [296]"},{"pageContent":"LETTER IX - FUTURE SCHOOLS OF MEDITATION.September 26th, 1920.[297] We take up today another of the series of letters on occult meditation,that dealing with “Future Schools of Meditation”. In this letter I shall attemptsomewhat to show how the training and development indicated in the other letterswill be applied and I shall deal somewhat with prophecy, pointing out what willsome day be possible and present, and not what is as yet in any wayapproachable. Always it is necessary to have high ideals, and ever the humanmind leaps forward to some appointed goal. If I here outline what may seem avisionary impossibility it is but that I seek to hold up such an ideal, and togive to the race an objective well worth their highest endeavour.Preliminary remarks.Let us pause a moment and lay down certain postulates anent the present thatwill (so to speak) clear the ground for future action.The value of meditation is becoming everywhere admitted. Schools forconcentration and methods of mental development are commonly advertised in thedaily papers.True meditation is as yet little understood. Concentration is but the foundationupon which the future work is to be based.As yet the future structure cannot be raised, due to two causes primarily:—[298]a. The inherent inability of mind at this juncture to attain the causal leveland the consciousness of the causal level.b. The absence of a Master in personal presence, able and equipped to teach thetrue scientific development which is the aim of true meditation.The troubled condition of the world at present is sufficient barrier to anygeneral acceptation of training, and of the scientific development of thevehicles.These premises are laid down here as a starting point. That some individualshere and there achieve the goal, that some people do master the system of OccultMeditation and make the desired progress is undeniable, but they are only few innumber and those numbers are inappreciable when set against the vast bulk ofhuman beings in incarnation at the same time. They achieve by right of age-longeffort, and because in previous lives they trod the Path or neared the portal ofinitiation. But even the average man of intelligence of today—the product, forinstance, of western civilisation—is far from being ready for occult training.Experiments are being made now, unknown oft to the subjects themselves, to seehow quickly a man may be pushed through experience and a general hastening ofthe evolutionary process into a position where it will be safe to train himfurther. People in many civilised countries are under supervision, and a methodof stimulation and intensification is being applied which will bring to theknowledge of the Great Ones Themselves a mass of information that may serve as aguide to Their future efforts for the race. Especially are people in America,Australia, India, Russia, Scotland and Greece being dealt with. A few inBelgium, Sweden, and Austria are likewise under observation, and should theresponse [299] be as hoped they will form a nucleus for further expansion.Future Schools of MeditationIn handling this matter we might, as is our usual custom, divide the subjectmatter under different heads:—1. The one fundamental School.2. Its national subdivisions.3. The location, personnel, and buildings of the School.4. The grades and classes.Now I would emphatically point out to you the fact that all that I now impart isa portion of a tentative plan, which has in view the hastening of the evolutionof the higher mind, and the bringing under control of the bodies of men, throughthe power of the God within. This plan has been drawn up in view of the cryingneed of a world in which the mental equipment of men is increasing out of allproportion to their emotional balance and to their physical equipment. The rapidadvance of knowledge, the spreading of the educational system which brings theproduct of many minds into the environment of the very poor, the ability of allto read and write in such a country as America or among the other Anglo-Saxonraces, has been the cause of a very real (I might almost say an unexpected)problem arising to confront the Great Ones.Mental development when paralleled by emotional stability and a strong healthybody is the aim for all. But now you have mental development paralleled by anunstable astral and a weak, underfed, badly raised physical. Hence disorder,lack of balance, the clouding of the vision and disproportionate discussion.Lower mind, instead of being a means to an end and a weapon for use, is in fair[300] way of being a ruler and a tyrant, preventing the play of the intuitionand shutting out the abstract mind.Hence the Masters, if it can in any way be accomplished, purpose a movement thathas in view the harnessing of the lower mind through the instrumentality of thepeople themselves. With this object in view They plan to utilise the incomingRay of Ceremonial Law or Organisation, and the period immediately co-incident orfollowing the coming of the Great Lord, to start these schools (in a smallinconspicuous way at first) and bring to the consciousness of men everywhere thefollowing four fundamentals:—a. The evolutionary history of man from the mental side.b. The septenary constitution of the macrocosm and the microcosm.c. The laws governing man's being.d. The method of occult development.A beginning has already been made........through the various schools at presentextant.......All these are the beginnings of the plan. When they are firmlygrounded, when they are working smoothly and with public recognition, and whenthe world of men is being somewhat coloured by them and their subjectiveemphasis, when they are producing scholars and workers, politicians andscientists and educational leaders who make their impress on their environment,then mayhap will come the time for the founding in exoteric fashion of the trueoccult school. By that I mean that if the earlier schools and colleges do theirwork satisfactorily they will have demonstrated to the world of men that thesubjective is the true reality and that the lower is but the stepping stone tothe higher. This subjective reality being universally admitted will, therefore,permit of the founding of a chain of inner schools [301] ...that will bepublicly recognised. This will never at any time obviate the necessity foralways having an esoteric and secret section, for always there will be certaintruths and facts of dangerous import to the uninitiated; but what I seek topoint out is that the mysteries will eventually be admitted as facts foruniversal recognition and for universal aim and goal. They will be prepared forand entered from schools that definitely undertake, under expert guidance, totrain novitiates for the mysteries.Such schools have existed before and in the turning of the wheel again they willbe in manifestation.You ask, when? That depends on humanity itself and on all of you who work withfaith and aspiration at the beginnings of the plan.H. P. B. laid the foundation stone of the first school in this particular lessercycle (which is nevertheless a relatively important one, being an outgrowth ofthe fifth root-race, the efflorescence of the fifth principle). This is thekeystone. The work proceeds in the founding, as aforesaid, of the variousschools, and mental science also has its place. It will go forward as desired ifeach one who is now under occult training strains every nerve and bends everyeffort to the work in hand. If all that is possible is done, when the Great Lordcomes with His Masters the work will receive a still further impetus, and willgradually expand and grow till it becomes a power in the world. Then will comethe day of the occult schools that will definitely train men for initiation.September 27th, 1920.We must today take up our first point for it is only as we lay the foundationaright that the superstructure measures up to requirements. [302]1 - THE ONE FUNDAMENTAL SCHOOL.It is therefore very essential that the emphasis is laid on the fact that nomatter what the offshoots, the basic school of occultism is that one which hasits root in the sacred centre of the planet, Shamballa . At that place, directlyunder the eyes of the One Initiator Himself, Who is—as is seldom realised—thehighest expression of the Teaching Ray upon the earth, is found what might betermed the central office for the educational disciplinary training work of theHierarchy. There will be found the Chohan Who is directly responsible for thevarious endeavours, and to Whom the Masters Who take pupils, and the Heads ofthe various occult schools are directly responsible. All proceeds under law andorder.One point that it will here be necessary to emphasise is that the Brotherhood ofLight, as represented by the Himalayan Masters, has its other representativeselsewhere who all carry out specific work under proper and adequate supervision.Too apt are the Theosophists to think that they alone are the repositories ofthe wisdom religion. Not so is the fact. At this particular moment (with the aimin view of the development and tendering of opportunity to the fifth subrace)the Himalayan Brotherhood is the main channel of effort, power and light. Butthe work with other races proceeds simultaneously and numerous other projects,all emanating from the central office at Shamballa , are paralleling theHimalayan work. Get this clearly in mind, for the point is important. TheHimalayan School and Lodge is the one that principally concerns the Occident andthe only school without any exception that should control the work and output ofthe occult students in the West. It brooks no rival nor contemporary work withits pupils, not for the [303] sake of its own teachers but to ensure the safetyof its pupils. Danger lurks in the path of the occult student and the Himalayanadepts know adequately how to protect their pupils, provided those pupils staywithin the periphery of Their united auras, and wander not out to other schools.All true occult schools demand this of their pupils, and all true Masters expectTheir pupils to refrain from taking other occult instructions at the same timeas they are receiving it from Them. They say not: “Our method is the only rightand true method.” They say: “When receiving instructions from Us it is the partof wisdom and the line of safety to refrain from occult training in anotherschool or under another Master.” Should a pupil desire so to do he is perfectlyfree to seek out other schools and teachers, but he must first break hisconnection with the old.The one fundamental school may be recognised by certain outstandingcharacteristics:—By the basic character of the truths taught as embodied in the followingpostulates:—a. The unity of all life.b. The graded steps of development as recognised in man, and by the graded stepsof its curriculum, which lead a man from one expansion of consciousness toanother until he has reached that which we call perfection.c. The relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm and its sevenfoldapplication.d. The method of this development and the place of the microcosm within themacrocosm as revealed through the study of the periodicity of all manifestationand the basic law of cause and effect.By the emphasis laid on character building and spiritual development as afoundation for the development of [304] all the faculties inherent in themicrocosm.By the requirement, demanded of all affiliated pupils without exception, thatthe life of inner unfoldment and development should be paralleled by a life ofexoteric service.By the graded expansions of consciousness that are the result of the impartedtraining; these lead a man on from step to step till he contacts his higherself, his Master, his egoic group, the First Initiator, the One ParamountInitiator, until he has contacted the Lord of his Ray and has entered into thebosom of his “Father Which is in Heaven”.These are the outstanding features that are descriptive of the one truefundamental School.This fundamental school has three main branches and a fourth that is in processof forming and which will make the four branches of this fourth round. Thesebranches are as follows:—1. The trans-Himalayan Branch.2. The southern India Branch. (these are Aryan Branches)3. A Branch that works with the fourth root-race and has two fourth root-raceadepts at its head.4. A Branch in process of forming that will have its headquarters in theOccident at some place not yet disclosed. It has for its main object theinstructing of those connected with the coming sixth root-race.These branches are and will be closely inter-allied and will work in the closestco-operation, being all focused and under the control of the Chohan at Shamballa. The heads of each of the four branches communicate with each other frequentlyand are really like the faculty of one stupendous university, the four schoolsbeing like the [305] various major departments of the foundations—likesubsidiary colleges. The aim of all is the evolution of the race, the object ofall is to lead all to the point of standing before the One Initiator, themethods employed are fundamentally the same, though varying in detail, due tothe racial characteristics of the races and types dealt with, and the fact thatcertain schools work paramountly with one ray and others with another.The trans-Himalayan school has its adepts as known to you, and others WhoseNames are not known.The southern Indian school has special work with the deva evolution, and withthe second and third sub-races of the Aryan race.The Himalayan school works with the first, fourth and fifth sub-races.The fourth root-race branch works under the Manu of that race and his brother ofthe Teaching Ray. Their headquarters are in China.The Master R.— and one of the English Masters are concerning Themselves with thegradual founding of the fourth branch of the school, with the assistance of theMaster Hilarion. Ponder on these imparted facts, for the significance is ofprofound importance.Tomorrow we will deal with the future. Today I have but imparted facts inpresent manifestation.September 28th, 1920.Today our second point comes up for consideration, and we shall in theelucidation of it enter into the realms of prophecy. I would here point out toyou that the thing which is indicated as existing in the future may not alwayswork out in detail as foreseen. I but seek to lay before you the big generalplan in its outline. The working out in the future will depend upon theintuition or high [306] perception of the thinkers of the race and upon theability of the incarnating jivas to seize upon the opportunities and fulfiltheir destiny.We touched yesterday upon the one fundamental school with its four branches.Today I would take up:—2 - THE NATIONAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE ONE SCHOOL.At the outset I would point out to you that not every nation in the world willhave its occult school. Only as the causal body of the national group hasreached a certain rate of vibration will it be possible to found and institutethese schools. Only as the educational work of the nation has reached a certainheight will it be possible to use the mental equipment of the nation as astepping stone for further expansion, and to use it as a basis for the occultschool. And, curiously enough, only those nations which originally had atraining school for the mysteries (with three exceptions) will be again, duringthe earlier stages, permitted national schools. The exceptions are:—1. Great Britain.2. Canada and the United States.3. Australia.And even these exceptions might be considered only one, the case of Australia,for the other two in Atlantean days had their occult foundations when theyformed part of the earlier continent. In the turning of the wheel, earth itselfreincarnates; places pass into pralaya and emerge into manifestation, holdingwithin them the seeds that will eventuate in similar vibration, and bring intobeing again similar modes of expression, and similar forms .It will be found later on, when the Occult Schools are founded, that they willbe situated where some of the old magnetism yet lingers, and where in some casescertain [307] old talismans have been kept by the Brotherhood with just this aimin view.Branches, affiliated with one of the four central divisions of the one occultfoundation, will be found in the following countries:1. Egypt . This will be one of the later schools founded and will be profoundlyoccult and an advanced school in direct communication with the inner grades.This will be touched upon later.2. The United States will have a preparatory school somewhere in the southernpart of the Middle West, and an extensive occult college in California in aplace later to be revealed. This school will be one of the first started whenthe Great Lord begins His earthly career, and during the next five years theseeds of it may be laid if students rightly apprehend the work to be done.3. There will be one school for the Latin countries, probably in Italy orSouthern France, but much depends on the political and educational work of thenext ten years.4. Great Britain. At one of the magnetised spots in either Scotland or Wales, abranch for occult training will be begun before so very long, which will lay thefoundation and embrace the curriculum for the earlier grades. After it has beenin existence for a few years and has proved the effectiveness of its training,and after troubled Ireland has adjusted her internal problems, a school for themore advanced grades, and for definite preparation for the mysteries will bestarted in Ireland at one of the magnetised spots there to be found. This schoolwill be very definitely a school where preparation for a major initiation may betaken, and will be under the eye of the Bodhisattva, preparing the pupil forinitiation upon the second ray. The first school in Egypt will be for those whotake initiation on the first ray in the Occident. [308]Those who take initiation on the line of the Mahachohan, or on the third ray,will take it at the advanced occult school in Italy . In this way the Occidentwill have its centre where active instruction may be given according to thethree lines of approach, and which will give preparation in the inner mysteries.5. A preparatory occult school will be found, too, in Sweden , for those of thenorthern and German races who seek the Path, and when it has been extant forsome time Russia may then be in a position to house the headquarters for themore advanced school affiliated to the preparatory one in Sweden. In connectionwith the Egyptian advanced school will be a preparatory one in Greece or inSyria .You have, therefore, the following schools as planned, and must bear in mindthat the schools wherein the preparatory work and earlier grades are found willbe first in order of time, and are in process of founding now, or will befounded during the period immediately preceding the Coming of the Great Lord.The founding of others will be definitely the outcome of His work, and that ofHis Masters, and will depend upon Their decision as to the success of theearlier endeavour.Preparatory Grades Advanced School 1. Greece or Syria leading to Egypt 2. MiddleWest, U.S.A. California 3. Southern France Italy 4. Scotland or Wales Ireland 5.Sweden Russia 6. New Zealand Australia[309] There is also planned a preparatory school for the advanced egos of thefourth root-race. This will be under the Manu of that race and will be situatedin Japan , with its most esoteric branch in western China . This makes theseventh in the group of schools outlined.It is not purposed as yet to have branches in Southern Africa or SouthernAmerica. Their day is not yet, but comes in the next cycle.Now, I would earnestly call to your attention that the schools will make butsmall beginnings and will be launched in a way that will appear at first as toounimportant to be noticeable. A beginning will be made with members of thedifferent occult schools, such as the esoteric sections of the Theosophicalmovement, and others. The work in Britain, America and Australia is already inprocess of inception, whilst that in Sweden will shortly be on foot. The otherswill follow at slightly later dates.This much of the plan has been permitted publication as an incentive to all ofyou to study with greater aspiration and to work with more strenuousapplication. Each and all has his place in the plan would he but qualify bydoing the necessary work. That work should be:—An endeavour to recognise the Divine within each one. In this manner the trueoccult obedience, which is an essential in all occult training, will be fosteredand developed, being not based, as is so oft seen, on personality, but on thatinstinctive realisation of a Master, and the willing following that comes fromthe recognition of His powers, the purity of His life and aims, and theprofundity of His knowledge.An endeavour to think in group terms and clearly for oneself, not depending uponthe word of others for clarification. [310]An endeavour to purify and refine all the bodies and make them more reliableservants.An endeavour to equip throughout the mental vehicle and to store within it thefacts upon which extended knowledge may be based.If these things are done great will be the day of opportunity.October 2nd, 1920.In the rigid disciplining of yourself comes eventual perfection. To the disciplenought is too small to undertake, for in the rigid adjustment of the details ofthe lower world life comes, at the end, attainment of the goal. The life of thedisciple becomes not easier as the Gate is neared, but ever the watch must bemore thorough, ever right action must be taken with no regard to result, andever each body in all its aggregate of detail must be wrestled with andsubjugated. Only in the thorough comprehension of the axiom “Know thyself” willcome that understanding that enables man to wield the law and know the innerworking of the system from the centre to the periphery. Struggle, strive,discipline, and rejoicingly serve with no reward save the misunderstanding andthe abuse of those who follow after —this is the role of the disciple.Today we will deal with our third point.3 - THE LOCATION, PERSONNEL, AND BUILDING OF THE OCCULT SCHOOL.Here at the outset I would remind you that much which might be said by me onthis matter must remain unsaid for lack of the ability to comprehend. I mightlay down certain approximate rules, and make certain fundamental suggestionsthat may find their place in the [311] final working out. I can lay down no rulethat must be kept. Such is not the occult law. In the establishment of theseoccult schools in their two divisions, preparatory and advanced, in thedifferent designated centres under one of the four branches of the onefundamental School of Occultism, the work will begin in an inconspicuous manner,and those pupils and advanced egos whose work it is to make the necessarybeginning must find out for themselves the method, place and manner. All must bewrought out in the furnace of endeavour and experiment, and the price paid willbe high, but only that which is thus wrought out provides the residue or nucleusupon which the further work may be based. Mistakes matter not; nought but thefleeting personalities suffer. What does matter is lack of aspiration, inabilityto attempt, and incapacity to learn the lesson that failure teaches. Whenfailures are regarded as valuable lessons, when a mistake is deemed but awarning signal that averts from disaster, and when no time is ever lost by adisciple in vain despair and useless self depreciation, then the watchingTeachers of the race know that the work the Ego seeks to do through eachexpression on the lower plane goes forward as desired, and that success mustinevitably eventuate. We will here take each detail of our subject, asenumerated above, by itself.The Location. This is a matter of very real importance but differs according tothe need of finding a situation whereon to found a preparatory or an advancedschool. Generally speaking (for national requirements vary much), the school forthe preparatory work will be situated within reasonable distance of some bigcentre or city, whilst the school for the advanced grades will be more isolated,and not so easily accessible.Let us look into this for a moment. One of the fundamental things that thenovitiate has to learn is to find his [312] centre within himself, independentof surrounding circumstances, and preferably in spite of surroundingcircumstances. The centre must be found to a considerable degree before he canpass on to the more advanced grades and work in the second school. Thepreparatory school above all things concentrates on the development of thethreefold lower man, and his training in service. The advanced school definitelyprepares for Initiation, and is concerned with occult lore, with the impartationof cosmic truth, with the abstract development of the pupil, and with work oncausal levels. One can be best accomplished in the world of men and throughcontact with the world; the other demands necessarily an environment ofcomparative seclusion and freedom from interruption. We might express itthus:—the preparatory grades deal with the kingdom of God within, whilst theadvanced school expands that training into one which includes the kingdom of Godwithout. Therefore the first will be situated amongst the working sons of men,so that by his reactions and interactions in association with them, in serviceand struggle, the pupil may learn to know himself. The other will be for thosewho have somewhat mastered these things, and are ready to learn more of otherevolutions and of the cosmos. Until a man is master of himself to a considerabledegree he may not safely work, for instance, with the deva or angel evolution.In the preparatory school he learns this mastery; in the more advanced school hecan thus be trusted to make other contacts than the human. In both theseschools, the basic instruction is meditation in all its grades. Why? Because inoccult schools information, clear instructions, or a conglomerate of facts arenever given, nor are the exoteric textbook methods ever employed. The whole aimis only to put the student in the way of finding out for himself the neededknowledge. [313] How? By developing the intuition through meditation, and by theattainment of that measure of mental control that will permit the wisdom of theTriad to pour down into the physical brain, via the causal. Therefore, in thepreparatory school emphasis will he laid on the meditation that concerns themind, and the teaching embodied in this book will be applied. This necessitatesan environment wherein many and varied human contacts will he made, and wherethe concrete knowledge of the world of men will be easily available (music,libraries, and lectures), for in the preparation of true occult training theastral and mental equipping of the student will be one of the firstconsiderations. When this has been somewhat accomplished, and when theclairvoyant head of the school sees that the rounding out of the lower auric eggapproaches the desired point, then the pupil will pass into the more advancedschool, and will be taught how from his stable centre to contact the cosmiccentre, and from the point within himself to expand his consciousness till ittouches the periphery of the system macrocosmic, and embraces all thatlives—lives in an occult sense. This necessitates, during the period oftraining, comparative seclusion, and this the advanced school will provide.Therefore the preparatory school will be located near some large city,preferably near the sea or some large expanse of water, but never within thecity; it will be on the confines of the centres of learning within the city andwill be readily accessible. The advanced school will be far from the crowdedplaces of the earth and preferably in a mountainous region, for the mountainshave a direct effect on the occultist and impart to him that quality of strengthand steadfastness that is their predominant characteristic and must be that tooof the occultist. The sea or expanse of water close to a preparatory school willconvey to his [314] mind a constant reminder of the purification which is hisparamount work, whilst the mountains will imbue the advanced student with cosmicstrength and will hold steadily before him the thought of the Mount ofInitiation which he aims soon to tread.Tomorrow we will take the important factor of the personnel and faculty of theschool and the types of building.October 7th, 1920.We deal today with that portion of our third point in the letter on “FutureSchools of Meditation,” which deals with the Personnel of the School.This term includes both those who supervise and those who are under supervision,and the subject is necessarily large. As said in the earlier parts of thisletter, the schools will be in two divisions wherever situated:—a. A preparatory school for the earlier grades in occult instruction, andsituated preferably near some large expanse of water and near some central city.b. An advanced school for the later grades, which will definitely prepare theway for initiation, and train pupils in occult lore.As you will consequently see, the personnel of both schools will necessarilydiffer, as will the curriculum. We will deal with each type of schoolseparately, and lay down certain fundamentals which must be looked for ininstructors and instructed.The Preparatory Occult School. This—to the outer world—may appear not sodifferent from an ordinary college. The differences will not be recognisable atfirst to the man of the world, though the differences will be there, and willdemonstrate themselves in the school work, to the pupils, and on the innerplanes. The fundamentals as regards the instructors are as follows:— [315]The Head of the school will be an accepted disciple; it is essential that theMaster, Who is back of the work of any particular school, should be able at alltimes to tap the consciousness of that school as focussed through the disciple.This Head will be able to act as a medium of communication between the studentsand the Master and as a focal point for His force to flow through to them. Hemust be consciously able to function on the astral plane at night and to bringthe knowledge through to the physical brain, for part of his work will be withstudents on the astral plane, guiding them to the Master's ashram at certainintervals for specialized work. He will have to train them too in this consciousfunctioning.Under him will work six instructors, of whom one at least must be a consciousclairvoyant, and able to assist the Head with his information as to the auricdevelopment of the students; he must be able to gauge the colors and expansionof the students' vehicles, and co-operate with the Head in the work of expandingand attuning those vehicles. These instructors must be on the Probationary Pathand earnestly devoted to the work of assisting evolution and devoted to theservice of some one Master. They must and will be carefully chosen so as tosupplement and complement each other, and in the school will form a miniaturehierarchy, showing on the physical plane a tiny replica of the occult prototype.As their work will be largely to develop the lower mind of the pupil and to linkit up with the higher consciousness, and as the focal point of their endeavourwill be the rapid building-in the causal body, they will be men of erudition,and of knowledge, grounded in the knowledge of the Hall of Learning, and able toteach and to compete with the trained teachers of the world universities. [316]In every college the work of these trained seven men will be aided by that ofthree women chosen for their capacity to teach, for their intuitive developmentand for the spiritual and devotional touch they will bring to the lives of thestudents. To these ten teachers will be entrusted the work of grounding thestudents in the important essentials, in superintending the acquirement of therudiments of occult lore and science, and their development in the higherpsychism. These ten must be profound students of meditation, and able tosuperintend and teach the pupils the rudiment of occult meditation, as taught,for instance, in this book. Occult facts will be imparted to these pupils bythem and the basic laws that—in the advanced school—will be the subject ofdefinite practice by the would-be initiate. Exercises in telepathy, causalcommunication, reminiscence of work undertaken during the hours of sleep, andthe recovering of the memory of past lives, through certain mental processes,will be taught by them,—themselves proficient in these arts.As you will see here, all these teachers will be devoted to the definitetraining and inner development of the threefold man.Under these will work various other teachers, who will superintend otherdepartments of the pupils' lives. Exoteric science will be taught and practisedby proficient teachers, and the lower mind will be developed as much aspossible, and kept in check by the other ten teachers who watch over theproportional development, and the aptitude for correct meditation of thestudent.Along with all this will be the life of world-service, rigidly demanded of eachand every pupil. This life of service will be carefully watched and recorded.One thing to be noted here is that in this there will be no compulsion. Thepupil will know what is expected of him and what he [317] must do if he is topass on to the more advanced schools, and the school's charts (recording thecondition of his vehicles, and his progress and his capacity to serve) will allbe available for his personal inspection, though to no one else. He will knowclearly where he stands, what he must do and what remains to be done, and itrests then with him to aid the work by the closest co-operation. A certainamount of care will be taken in the admittance of pupils to the school, and thiswill obviate the necessity of later removal for inability or lack of interest,but this I will deal with later, when taking up the grades and classes.You have, therefore, ten superintending teachers, composed of seven men andthree women, including a Head who is an accepted disciple. Under them will worka set of instructors who will deal largely with the lower mind and in theemotional, physical and mental equipping of the pupil, and his passing into theadvanced school in a condition to profit by the instructions there to beimparted. Here I would point out that I have planned out the ideal, and picturedfor you the school as it is hoped it will eventually be. But as in all occultdevelopment, the beginning will be small and of little apparent importance.Tomorrow we will take up the rules governing the admission of students and thepersonnel of the more advanced school.October 16th, 1920.......Today we will take up:—The personnel of the advanced school, and the rules of admission to both thepreparatory and advanced. This latter part will be largely technical.The first point I seek to make here is that these advanced schools will benumerically small, and this for a very long time to come, and the personnel willbe correspondingly [318] small....At the head of the school will always be foundan Initiate of the first or second degree, the aim of the school being toprepare pupils for the first initiation. This necessarily requires an Initiatehead. This Initiate head will be definitely appointed by the Master Who has theschool in charge, and he will be—within the confines of the school—sole judgeand autocrat. The risks of occult training are too great to permit of trifling,and what the Head demands must be obeyed. But this obedience will not becompulsory but voluntary, for each pupil will realise the necessity and willrender obedience from spiritual recognition. As aforesaid, these differentoccult schools will be practically ray schools, and will have for theirpersonnel teachers on some one ray or its complementary ray, with pupils on thesame ray or complementary ray. For instance, if the school is a second rayschool—such as the one in Ireland is purposed to be—teachers and pupils on thesecond, fourth and sixth rays will be found in it. At least one fifth rayteacher will be found in every school of occultism. If a first ray school, thepersonnel and pupils will be first, third and seventh ray, with again a fifthray teacher among the others.Under the initiate Head will be two other teachers who will be accepteddisciples, and every pupil under them must have passed through the preparatoryschool, and graduated from all the lower grades. Probably these three willcomprise the entire teaching staff, for the pupils under them will he relativelyfew in number and the work of the teachers is supervisory more than didactic,for the occultist is always esoterically self-taught.Much of the work done by these three will he on the inner planes, and they willwork more in the seclusion of their own rooms than in class room with thestudents [319] themselves. The pupils are—it will be presumed—ready to work forthemselves and to find the way to the portal of initiation alone. The work ofthe teachers will be advisory, and they will be available to answer questionsand to superintend work initiated by the pupil himself, and not compelled by theteacher. Stimulating vibration, aligning the bodies, superintending the work oninner planes, and the pouring in of force with the shielding from danger byoccult methods, will be the work, in part, of the Teachers, added to thesupervision of definite and strenuous meditation. At intervals they will conductthe pupils to the Master, advise as to their passing into the different gradesof discipleship, report at intervals on the quality of their life service andassist them in building their buddhic vehicle, which has to be in an embryoniccondition when the First initiation is taken. The teachers likewise superintendthe working out in practice of the theories anent the other evolution, the devaevolution, laid down in the preparatory schools; they watch over themanipulation of matter by the pupil and his demonstration of the laws ofconstruction; they safeguard him as far as may be in his contact with sub-humanand super-human evolutions, and teach him to wield the law and to transcendkarma. They enable him, through their instructions, to recover the knowledge ofpast lives and to read the akashic records, but as you will see, the pupil isthe one in this school who initiates and does the work, superintended andguarded by the teachers, and his progress and the length of his residence withinthe school depend upon his own effort and initiatory powers.The rules of admission into the preparatory school will be somewhat as follows,but I only indicate probabilities and not ascertained and fixed facts:— [320]1. The pupil must be free from obligatory karma and able to take the coursewithout neglecting his other duties and family ties.2. There will be no fees or money charged, and no money transaction. The pupilmust be somewhat self-supporting and able to earn the means of livelihood whilstin the school. The schools in both their divisions will be supported through thevoluntary contributions of people, and through a knowledge of the laws of supplyand demand occultly interpreted.3. The pupil must be able to measure up to the average educational standards ofhis day and generation and must show aptitude for some line of thought.4. He must be seen clairvoyantly to have a certain amount of co-ordination andalignment and the causal body must be of a certain grade or quality before he isadmitted. Teachers of occultism waste not time on those not ready. Only when theinner light shines forth, only when the causal body is of a certain capacity canthe pupil profit by the curriculum. Therefore, with the Head of the school willthe final verdict lie as to whether a pupil may enter or not. That word will befinal, and will be passed after due inspection of the pupil by the Head of theschool through clairvoyant and causal vision, and after reference to the man'sown Master.5. He must have demonstrated, by a previous period of service, his ability towork in group formation and to think in terms of others. [321]6. His past incarnations must he somewhat looked up, and the indications giventhrough their study will guide the Head in his final decision.7. The pupil must he over twenty-one and under forty-two years of age.8. His etheric body must be in good condition and be a good transmitter ofprana, and there must be no physical disease or handicapping physical deformity.These are the fundamental rules which it is at present possible to give. Therewill be others and the problem of selection may pass through some vicissitudesin solving.The rules for admission into the advanced school are far more esoteric and fewerin number. The pupils will be chosen from out of the preparatory school, afterhaving passed through the graded courses. But selection will depend not on themental development and the assimilation of concrete knowledge, but upon theinner comprehension and the occult understanding of the student, upon thequality of the tone of his life as it sounds forth in the inner world, upon thebrilliance of the indwelling light, and upon his power in service.This suffices for today; tomorrow we will deal with the final division of thisthird point, the buildings of the school.October 17th, 1920.In dealing today with the subject of the buildings of the two types of occultschools, little can be said and only a general outline can be given. Climaticconditions and the desired size of the schools will greatly vary and theconsequent plant will vary likewise......The buildings for the preparatory school will differ not so much from those ofan ordinary college in the exoteric [322] world. One rule only will be laiddown—each student must of necessity have his own separated chamber. The type ofbuilding matters not, provided these conditions are fulfilled. Each room must benon-communicating, save with the central corridor, and must be in threedivisions, necessarily small yet distinct. One division will be given up to thestudent's life and study; another to the bath and the third will be the placefor meditation containing the pictures of the Great Ones duly curtained. Thisthird division is kept for the sole purpose of meditation and will containlittle save the mat on which the student sits, a couch on which he will reposehis physical vehicle during certain stated exercises and a small stool in frontof the Master's pictures, on which will be found the incensor and a vase forfloral tributes.The resident teachers will reside with the students, the women taking charge ofthe women students, and the men residing with the male students. The Head of theschool will reside alone in a detached house which will contain—besides therooms in which he will live his private life—a reception room of smallproportions for his work with individuals, and a larger room for jointconcourses, besides a shrine room for the meeting of the united body of pupils.The buildings for the advanced schools, even though they concern us notintimately as yet, provide in their construction much of occult significance forthose who have eyes to see. The main feature in the occult advanced school willbe the central temple of circular shape providing for each of the pupils (andyou must remember that numerically they will not be large), a private shrineentered from the rear by a closed door and having a curtain between it and thelarge central shrine where the group meetings will be held. [323]This large central shrine will have a pavement whereon will be traced thetriangle, and within the triangle the group will sit, the three spaces outsidethe triangle having tables whereon will be found various symbols and a few ofthe fundamental books on symbols and some large parchments whereon the cosmicsymbols will be portrayed.[Image00013.jpg]The colour of this shrine will be dependent on the ray which it represents. Thecurtains which separate will be in the ray colour also and each individualshrine curtain will carry the sign of the pupil's nativity—his sign, risingsign, and controlling planets. These curtains will be the [324] property of thepupil, as will the mat within the shrine which will carry the symbol of his ray,egoic and personality.On the wall of the great circular passage will be found the signs of the zodiac,the four entrances standing for the four Maharajas.A square wall will surround the whole, enclosing a garden which will be the careof the pupils themselves. There will be but one entrance through this wall onthe north side. Outside will lie small building's to house not more than threepupils, and a house wherein will reside the three instructors. The Initiate Headwill likewise have his private residence distinguished by a domed tower at oneside. This domed tower serves two purposes:—It is the place for astronomical andastrological instruction and will have the latest appliances of science for thestudy of the planets and of microcosmic life, and will also serve as a secureshelter for those pupils who can consciously leave their physical bodies andfunction elsewhere on the physical plane.This is all I can give as yet. Record, watch and await the hour when the idealwill materialize.October 29th, 1920.Our fourth point comes up for consideration today, and in its discussion I willgive you somewhat concerning the preparatory occult school but little concerningthe advanced. This fourth point is one anent the grades and classes.4 - THE GRADES AND CLASSES.We have, in an earlier letter, touched upon the curriculum of the preparatoryschools and have seen that that curriculum deals much with the development oflower [325] mind, with the laying of the foundations upon which to build thelater work, and with the formulation, the study, and the memorising of thetheories and occult laws upon which the true occultist will later base hispractical work. We saw also that much that was taught was necessarily closelyallied with the exoteric teaching of the world, and necessitated the schoolbeing in close touch with the centres of modern thought. Today I seek to pointout certain things that will be seen in the scheme of the student's work and toshow the method whereby he is gradually led on until he is fit to pass on intothe more advanced college. We will as usual divide our subject into threeheads:—a. The times of study.b. The types of work.c. The transformation of potential faculty into active powers through practice.a. The times of study.All the work of the school will be based upon an occult knowledge of times andseasons, and two things will be carefully adhered to:—l. The school year will bedivided into two halves, one half wherein the pupils are strenuously acquiringknowledge, that period being that in which the sun moves northward or theearlier half of the year, and a second half—separated from the earlier by aninterval of six weeks—wherein he assimilates and puts into practice that whichearlier was imparted. During the earlier months of the year he goes through adrastic system of reception, of learning, of hard study, of accumulation offacts and of concrete knowledge. He attends lectures, he wades through manybooks, he studies in the laboratory, and with the aid of the microscope and ofthe [326] telescope he widens the range of his vision, and builds into hismental body a vast store of scientific data.During the six weeks' vacation he is recommended to rest entirely from allmental effort save that associated with the practice of the imparted occultmeditation. He mentally follows the cycle and goes into pralaya temporarily. Atthe end of six weeks he returns to his work with the object in view ofsystematising the mass of information, of perfecting his comprehension of thefacts earlier studied, of practicing that part of the occult lore permissible,with the object in view of becoming proficient and to discover his weak points.He writes during the “dark period” of the year the themes and essays, the booksand pamphlets that will embody the product of the assimilated information. Thebest of these books will be published yearly by the college, for the use of thepublic. In this way he serves his time and generation and educates the race inthe higher knowledge. 2. In exactly the same way his studies each month will beso arranged that the harder part (dealing with the higher mind) will beundertaken during the part of the month which is called the bright half, whilstthe work of the dark half will be more given over to the things concerning lowermind and to an effort to hold the gain of the earlier weeks. Each day will belikewise divided into set times, the earlier hours being those in which the moreabstract and occult data will be given, the latter part of the day being givenover to a more practical type of work.The basis of all occult growth is meditation, or those periods of silentgestation in which the soul grows in the silence. Therefore, during the daythere will be for every pupil in the school three periods of meditation—atsunrise, at midday, and at sunset. During the earlier part of the pupil'sattendance at the school these periods will be for [327] thirty minutes each.Later he will give one hour to the practice of occult meditation three times aday and during his final year he will be expected to give five hours a day tomeditation. When he can do this and get results he will be able to pass on intothe advanced school. It is the great test and mark of readiness.The hours of the school will begin with sunrise and end with sunset. After thesun sets, and for one hour after each of the other two periods of meditation,the pupil is permitted to relax, take his meals and recreate himself. All pupilswill be required to retire to rest at night by ten o 'clock, after thirtyminutes of careful revision of the day's work and the filling in of certaincharts that go to the completion of his record.The length of a pupil's stay in the school depends entirely upon the progressmade, the inner powers of assimilation and the outer life of service. It dependstherefore upon the point in evolution at which he enters the school. Those justentering the Path of Probation will be there for five to seven years and onoccasion even longer; those who are old disciples and those who have takeninitiation in earlier lives will be there but a brief time, pushing rapidlythrough the curriculum and simply learning to produce for use the knowledgeearlier stored. The period of their stay will be anywhere from one to fiveyears, usually about three. Their innate knowledge will be developed byencouraging them to teach the younger brethren. A pupil passes out of theschool, not as a result of an exoteric examination but simply on thenotification of the Head of the School, who bases his decision upon esotericresults in the bodies of the pupil, upon the clarity of his auric colours andupon the tone of his life and the key of his vibration. [328]b. Types of Work.First and foremost, the practice of meditation as laid down in these letters andas may be apportioned by the Head of the school. Once or twice a year theinitiate Head of the school to which the preparatory school is allied will passthe pupils in review and in conference with the Head of the school willapportion specific meditation adjusted to the pupil's need. Once a year theMaster responsible for both schools will likewise pass them in review andcommunicate to the Head any necessary adjustments. (I would here remind you thatthe relationship of a Master to a disciple is a private one and though He may bein constant touch with His pupil privately , this affects not His officialreview of the united auras of the school group.)Secondly, a graded scientific study of the microcosm, including the followingsubjects, using the microscope when needed:—The Microcosm.a. Elementary anatomy, physiology, biology.b. Ethnology.c. Study of the etheric body and its allied subjects of vitality and magnetism.d. Study of geology; of the vegetable kingdom, or botany; and of the animalkingdom.e. Study of the history of man and the development of science.f. Study of the laws of the microcosmic body.The Macrocosm.a. Study of the laws of electricity, of fohat, of prana, and of the astrallight. [329]b. Study of astronomy and of astrology.c. Study of occult cosmogony.d. Study of the human hierarchy.e. Study of the deva evolution.f. Study of the laws of the solar system.g. Study of telepathy, mental creation, psychometry.The Mind.a. The study of the mental plane.b. The study of the laws of fire.c. The study of the causal body.d. The study of the fifth principle.e. The study of colour and of sound.Synthesis.a. The study of spirit-matter-mind.b. Study of numbers and of symbology.c. Study of higher mathematics.d. Study of the laws of union.e. Study of the laws of sex.Psychic Development.a. Study of practical occultism.b. Study of psychism.c. Study of the astral light and the akashic records.d. Study of mediumship and inspiration.e. Study of past lives.f. Study of the macrocosmic and microcosmic centres.Practical Work.a. Service to the race.b. Study of group work.c. Review work. [330]d. Work on the subtler bodies with the view to producing continuity ofconsciousness.e. Study of magic.f. Study of the seventh ray.You will see for yourself that when the pupil has completed the above curriculumhe will be a potential magician, and will be a member of the Brotherhood ofLight in embryo. He will be equipped and ready to pass into the advanced school,where he will be trained in using the knowledge already acquired, where hiscentres will be scientifically developed so that he will become a consciouspsychic of the mental type, where he will be trained to contact and control thelesser evolutions and to co-operate with the other evolutions such as the deva,and where all his bodies will be so aligned and adjusted that he can at the endof a period—varying from two to three years—be ready to stand before theInitiator.c. Potencies becoming powers.This third type of work is based on the preceding curriculum and deals directlywith individual development. It covers the following matters:—a. The aligning of the bodies with a view to egoic contact.b. The building of the antahkarana, and the development of the higher mind.c. The development of the intuition, and the definite spiritual awakening of thepupil.d. The study of the pupil's vibration, ray, color and tone.e. The conscious refining of all the bodies beginning with the physical. [331]When these matters are duly studied and all acquired knowledge put intopractice, the inherent powers of the soul will become conscious powers. Aboveall, will the emphasis be laid upon the fact that the white magician is he whoutilises all power and knowledge in the service of the race. His innerdevelopment must be expressed in terms of service before he is permitted to passon into the advanced school.I have indicated enough to provide much room for interested speculation."},{"pageContent":"LETTER X - THE PURIFICATION OF THE VEHICLES.November 7th, 1920.[333] The need arises these days for tested instruments. When Those Who guidehuman evolution at this period cast Their eyes over the race in the search forsuch instruments They see few as yet ready for the service required. Butlikewise They see some who, with a certain amount of training, will fill theneed fairly adequately.As evolution proceeds the polarisation of the race changes. Men are polarisednow principally in their emotional bodies,—the feelings, desires, the concernsof the personality sway them. The emotional body is the focal point for thepersonality. It acts as the clearing house for all that concerns it, and as thejunction of the lower and the higher. It is like a busy railroad terminus, thatreceives cargo from all directions and empties it into the great city of thepersonal physical plane life. Then, as progress is made, the scene shiftshigher, and the mental body becomes the focal point. Later the causal bodybecomes the important unit, and later still comes the ultimate sacrifice of eventhat, until the man stands bereft of all that vibrates to the three worlds, andall is over as regards the personal life,—nought remains but the life of theSpirit, and the voluntary giving of that life for the helping of the world.In the speeding up of evolution, certain things have to be brought about beforethe man can be used as a reliable instrument, true as tempered steel, for thehelping of his race. Forget not that, as a rule, a man (when tested and tried)forms the best tool, because he comprehends [334] utterly the raceconsciousness, and because he enters into the problems of the day in a mannermore thorough than an Ego from an earlier period. Hence the Masters desire touse those of you who live now to heal the wounds of the present sufferinggeneration. What then has to be done? The matter I now give contains nothingvery unusual, but it does hold thought for consideration by any who may desireto help.......In preparing a soul for service the Guides of the race have todeal with each of the bodies:—1 - THE TRAINING OF THE PHYSICAL BODY.This involves certain definite requirements:—The building in of matter of the higher subplanes and the elimination of thelower and coarser matter. This is needed because it is impossible for those withcoarse bodies to contact high vibration. It is impossible for the Ego totransmit the higher knowledge and guidance through a coarse physical body. It isimpossible for the loftier currents of thought to impact the little evolvedphysical brain. Hence the refinement of the physical body is an essential. It iseffected in various ways, all of them reasonable and utilitarian.By pure food. This involves a vegetarian diet, chosen with wise discrimination;it requires the eating of only those vegetables and fruits that vitalise.Careful judgment shown in the choice of food, wise refraining from too heavyeating, and a little pure good food perfectly assimilated are all that adisciple requires. You ask what foods? Milk, honey, whole wheat bread, all thevegetables that contact the sun, oranges (above all, oranges), bananas, raisins,nuts, some potatoes, unpolished rice, and may I again reiterate, [335] just asmuch of all the above as to insure activity.By cleanliness. Much use of water, externally and internally, is vitallyrequired.By sleep. This should be always between the hours of ten in the evening and fivein the morning, and as much as possible out of doors.By sunshine. Contact with the sun should be much sought after, and thevitalisation that comes through its rays. The sun kills all germs and frees fromdisease.When these four requirements are attended to adequately a definite process ofelimination proceeds, and in the course of a few years the whole physical bodyshifts its polarisation gradually up until ultimately you will have a bodycomposed of atomic subplane matter......This may take several incarnations, butit should be borne in mind that at each fresh incarnation a body is taken of theexact quality (if I may so put it) as the one previously discarded at death.Hence time is never lost in building. Eventually two other methods will beavailable by which more rapid refining may be effected:—The use of coloured lights. These lights are played on the body of the discipleand effect a shaking-out process and a simultaneous stimulation of the atoms.This cannot be done till further information is given anent the Rays; when aman's ray is known, stimulation will come from the use of his own colour, abuilding-in will be brought about by the use of his complementary colour, anddisintegration of unwanted matter will be brought about by the use of anantagonistic colour. This knowledge will later on be communicated to the greatbodies that hold [336] custody of the Mysteries, the Church and the Masons.Wait, for the time is not yet. When the Mysteries are restored some of thisinformation will be in the hands of the two bodies I refer to.The stimulation of music. Certain sounds shatter and break. Certain other soundsstimulate and attract. When the key of a man's life is known, when the sound heresponds to is recognised, then comes the possibility of the utilisation ofsound in refinement. All that is at present possible to those of you who seek toserve is to attend to the above essentials and to seek contact with highvibration.One more point I would like to give, and that is, that in the manipulation ofelectricity lies hid much that concerns the vivification of the bodies,especially just now of the etheric. The principal use the sun has is thevitalising of the etheric. The heat of the sun is electrical force adapted tothe need of the great average majority in all the kingdoms of nature. Asprogress is made an intensification of this force will be possible in individualcases. Herein lies one of the secrets of initiation. In the old days the Rod ofInitiation acted actually as a conductor of this force to the centres of theinitiate; it was so constructed that it answered this purpose. Now, on a higherturn of the spiral, just the same need and purpose are served, though the methodof application necessarily differs, owing to the change in the polarisation ofthe race. The polarisation is now no longer physical, but is either emotional ormental. The method of application differs in all three, and hence thesafeguarding of the secret. It holds the mystery hid. [337]The refining of the etheric.This coincides with that of the physical body. The method consists principallyof living in the sunlight, in protection from cold, and in the assimilation ofcertain definite combinations of vitamins which before long will be given to therace. A combination of these vitamins will be formulated and made into tabloidform, with direct effect upon the etheric body. This will not be until thatetheric vehicle is recognised by science, and definitely included in thetraining offered by the faculty of medicine. The study of ethericdiseases—congestion and atrophy—will ere long be a recognised study, and willlead to definite treatments and formulas. As before said, all that you can nowdo in sensitising the dual physical is to attend to the above rules, and allowtime to bring about the remainder of the work.2 - THE REFINING OF THE EMOTIONAL BODY.Here the method of procedure is different. The emotional body is simply a greatreflector. It takes colour and movement from its surroundings. It receives theimpress of every passing desire. It contacts every whim and fancy in itsenvironment; every current sets it in motion; every sound causes it to vibrateunless the aspirant inhibits such a state of affairs and trains it to receiveand register only those impressions which come from the intuitional level viathe Higher Self and therefore via the atomic subplane. The aim of the aspirantshould be to so train the emotional body that it will become still and clear asa mirror, so that it may reflect perfectly. His aim should be to make it reflectonly the causal body, to take on colour only in line with the great Law, and tomove under definite direction and not just as blow the winds of [338] thought,or rise the tides of desire. What words should describe the emotional body? thewords: still, serene, unruffled, quiet, at rest, limpid and clear, of a qualitymirrorlike, of surface even, a limpid reflector,—one that accurately transmitsthe wishes, the desires, the aspirations of the Ego and not of the personality.How should this be accomplished? In several ways, some at the direction of theaspirant, and some at the direction of the Master.a. By the constant watching of all desires, motives and wishes that cross thehorizon daily, and by the subsequent emphasising of all those that are of a highorder, and by the inhibition of the lower.b. By a constant daily attempt to contact the Higher Self, and to reflect Hiswishes in the life. At first mistakes will be made, but little by little thebuilding-in process proceeds, and the polarisation in the emotional bodygradually shifts up each subplane until the atomic is reached.c. By definite periods daily directed to the stilling of the emotional body. Somuch emphasis is laid in meditation on the stilling of the mind, but it shouldbe remembered that the stilling of the emotional nature is a step preliminary tothe quieting of the mental; one succeeds the other and it is wise to begin atthe bottom of the ladder. Each aspirant must discover for himself wherein heyields most easily to violent vibrations, such as fear, worry, personalitydesire of any kind, personality love of anything or anyone, discouragement,over-sensitiveness to public opinion; then he must overcome that vibration, byimposing on it a new rhythm, definitely eliminating and constructing. [339]d. By work done on the emotional body at night under the direction of moreadvanced egos, working under the guidance of a Master. Stimulation of vibrationor the deadening of vibration follows on the application of certain colours andsounds. At this particular time two colours are being applied to many people forthe specific purpose of keying up the throat and foremost head centre, namely,violet and gold.Remember that the work is gradual, and as the polarisation shifts up, the momentof transition from one subplane to another is marked by certain tests applied atnight, what one might term a series of small initiations that eventually will beconsummated in the second great initiation, that marks the perfection of thecontrol of the body of the emotions.Four small initiations find their culmination in the initiation proper. Theseare the initiations on the emotional plane, called respectively the initiationsof earth, fire, water and air, culminating in initiation the second. The firstinitiation marks the same point of attainment on the physical plane. Eachinitiation marks the attainment of a certain proportion of atomic matter in thebodies. The four initiations, prior to that of the Adept, mark respectively theattainment of a proportionate amount, as for instance:—At the first initiationone-fourth atomic matter, at the second one-half atomic matter, and so on to theconsummation. The intuition (or buddhi) being the unifying principle and thuswelding all, at the fourth initiation the lower vehicles go, and the adeptstands in his intuitional body, and creates from thence his body ofmanifestation. [340]3 - THE REFINEMENT OF THE MENTAL BODY.This is the result of hard work and discrimination. It necessitates three thingsbefore the plane of the mental unit is achieved, and before the causalconsciousness (the full consciousness of the higher self) is reached:—Clear thinking, not just on subjects wherein interest is aroused, but on allmatters affecting the race. It involves the formulation of thought matter, andthe capacity to define. It means the ability to make thought forms out ofthought matter, and to utilise those thought forms for the helping of thepublic. He who does not think clearly, and who has an inchoate mental body,lives in a fog, and a man in a fog is but a blind leader of the blind.The ability to still the mental body so that thoughts from abstract levels andfrom the intuitional planes can find a receptive sheet whereon they may inscribethemselves. This thought has been made clear in many books on concentration andmeditation, and needs not my elucidation. It is the result of hard practicecarried over many years.A definite process brought about by the Master with the acquiescence of thedisciple which welds into a permanent shape the hard won efforts and results ofmany years. At each initiation, the electrical or magnetic force applied has astabilising effect. It renders durable the results achieved by the disciple.Like as a potter moulds and shapes the clay and then applies the fire thatsolidifies, so the aspirant shapes and moulds and builds, and prepares for thesolidifying fire. Initiation marks a permanent attainment and the beginning of anew cycle of endeavour.Above all two things should be emphasised:—1. A steady, unshaken perseverance, that recks not [341] of time nor hindrance,but goes on. This capacity to persevere explains why the non-spectacular man sofrequently attains initiation before the genius, and before the man who attractsmore notice. The capacity to plod is much to be desired.2. A progress that is made without undue self-analysis. Pull not yourselves upby the roots to see if there is growth. It takes precious time. Forget your ownprogress in conforming to the rules and in the helping of others. When this isso, sudden illumination may come, and the realisation break upon you that thepoint has been reached when the Hierophant can demand your presence and bestowinitiation upon you. You have, by hard work and sheer endeavour to conform tothe Law and to love all, built into your bodies the material that makes itpossible for you to stand in His Presence. The great Law of Attraction draws youto Him andnought can withstand the Law."},{"pageContent":"LETTER XI - THE RESULTANT LIFE OF SERVICE.September 16th, 1920.I seek to give you today, in closing this series, something of general use. Iwish to speak to you anent service and its perfect rendering. What I give you inthis connection may be of vital use. Remember always that material gain inknowledge for the individual causes stagnation, obstruction, indigestion andpain, if not passed on with wise discrimination. Food absorbed by the humanbody, if not assimilated and passed through the system, causes just the aboveconditions. The analogy is correct. Much tuition comes to many these days, butit is for the use of a needy world, and not for their own exclusive benefit.In rendering service three things are of moment:—1. The motive.2. The method.3. The attitude following action.With wrong motives and methods I deal not. To you they are known. I indicate theright, and by adjustment of the life of service to my indications comescorrection and inspiration. A life of much service opens up to many these days;see, all of you, that it commences right. A right beginning is liable toeventuate in continuous correctness, and helps much in the endeavour. Wherefailure follows in such a case, all that is needed is readjustment. In failurewhere the beginning has been at fault (an inevitable failure), the need is forthe renewal of the inner springs of action. [344]1 - THE MOTIVES FOR SERVICE.These motives are threefold in the order of their importance:—a. A realisation of God's plan of evolution, a sensing of the world's dire need,an apprehension of the immediate point of world attainment, and a consequentthrowing of the total of one's resources into the furtherance of that end.b. A definite personal goal of achievement, some great ideal—such as holiness ofcharacter—that calls forth the soul's best endeavour; or a realisation of thereality of the Masters of the Wisdom, and a strong inner determination to love,serve, and reach Them at all costs. When you have this intellectual grip ofGod's plan, coupled with the strong desire to serve the Great Ones, in physicalplane activities will come the working out.c. A realisation next of one's innate or acquired capacities and a fitting ofthose capacities to the need appreciated. Service is of many kinds, and he whowisely renders it, who seeks to find his particular sphere, and who, finding it,gives effort gladly for the benefit of the whole, is the man whose owndevelopment proceeds steadily. But nevertheless the aim of personal progressremains secondary.2 - THE METHODS OF SERVICE.These are many and varied. I can but indicate the ones of paramount importance.First and foremost comes, as I have often inculcated, the faculty ofdiscrimination. He who considers that he can attempt all things, who balks notat aught that happens his way, who rushes wildly in where wiser ones refrain,who considers he has capacity for that which [345] arises, who brings zeal butno brains to bear on this problem of service, but dissipates force; he rendersoft destructive action, he wastes the time of wiser and greater ones in thecorrecting of his well meant mistakes, and he serves no end but his own desires.The reward of good intention may be his, but it is frequently offset by theresults of foolish action. He serves with discrimination who realises wisely hisown niche, great or small, in the general scheme; who calculates soberly hismental and intellectual capacity, his emotional calibre and his physical assetsand then with the sum of the whole applies himself to fill the niche.He serves with discrimination who judges with the aid of his Higher Self and theMaster what is the nature and the measure of the problem to be solved, and isnot guided by the well meant though often ill-judged suggestions, requests anddemands of his fellow-servers.He serves with discrimination who brings a realisation of time into action, andcomprehending that each day contains but twenty-four hours and that his capacitycontains but the expenditure of just so much force and no more, wisely adjustshis capacity and the time available to each other.Next follows a wise control of the physical vehicle. A good server causes theMaster no anxiety from physical causes, and may be trusted so to guard andhusband his physical strength that he is always available for the carrying outof the Master's requests. He does not fail from physical disability. He seesthat his lower vehicle gets sufficient rest, and adequate sleep. He rises earlyand retires at a seemly hour. He relaxes whenever possible; he eats wholesomeand suitable food and refrains from heavy eating. A little food, well chosen andwell masticated, is far better than a heavy meal. The human race [346] eatsthese days, as a rule, four times as much as is required. He ceases from workwhen (through accident or the recurrence of inherited physical disability) hisbody reacts against action and cries out for attention. He then seeks rest,sleep, dietary precautions and necessary medical attention. He obeys all wiseinstruction, giving time for his recovery.The next step is a steady care and control of the emotional body . This is themost difficult of the vehicles to tend, as is well known. No excessive emotionis permitted, though strong currents of love for all that breathe are allowed tosweep through. Love, being the law of the system, is constructive andstabilising, and carries all on in line with the law. No fear or worry or careshake the emotional body of the aspiring servant of all. He cultivates serenity,stability, and a sense of secure dependence on God's law. A joyous confidencecharacterises his habitual attitude. He harbours no jealousy, no cloudy greydepression, and no greed or self-pity, but—realising that all men are brothersand that all that is exists for all—he proceeds calmly on his way.Then ensues the development of his mental vehicle. In the control of theemotional body the server takes the attitude of elimination. His aim is so totrain the emotional body that it becomes devoid of colour, has a stillvibration, and is clear and white, limpid as a pool on a still summer's day. Infitting the mental body for service the worker strives at the opposite ofelimination; he seeks to build in information, to supply knowledge and facts, totrain it intellectually and scientifically so that it may prove as time goes ona stable foundation for the divine wisdom. Wisdom supersedes knowledge, yetrequires knowledge as a preliminary step. You must remember that the serverpasses through the Hall of Learning prior [347] to entering the Hall of Wisdom.In training the mind body he seeks therefore orderly acquisition of knowledge, asupply of that which may be lacking, a sequential grasp of the innate mentalfaculty accumulated in previous lives, and lastly, a steadying of the lower mindso that the higher may dominate and the creative faculty of thought may beprojected through the stillness. From the Silence of the Absolute was projectedthe universe. From darkness issued light, from the subjective emanated theobjective. The negative stillness of the emotional body makes it receptive toimpression from above. The positive stillness of the mental body leads to thehigher inspiration.Having sought to control and wisely use his personality in its threedepartments, the lover of humanity seeks perfection in action. No magnificentdreams of martyrdom and the glorious yet ephemeral chimeras of spectacularservice engross his attention, but the instant application of all his powers tothe next duty is the line of his endeavour. He knows that perfection in theforeground of his life and in the details of his environing work will causeaccuracy in the background too, and result in a whole picture of rare beauty.Life progresses by small steps, but each step, taken at the right time, and eachmoment wisely occupied, leads to long distance covered and a life well spent.Those Who guide the human family test out all applicants for service in thesmall detail of everyday life, and he who shews a record of faithful action inthe apparently non-essential will be moved into a sphere of greater moment. How,in an emergency or crisis, can They depend on someone who in everyday mattersdoes slovenly and ill-judged work?A further method of service shews itself in adaptability . This involves areadiness to retire when other or [348] more important people are sent to fillthe niche he may be occupying, or (inversely) an ability to step out of officeinto work of greater importance, when some less competent worker can do his workwith equal facility and good judgment. It is the part of wisdom in all who serveneither to rate themselves too highly nor to underrate themselves. Bad workresults when the non-efficient fill a post, but it is equally a loss of time andpower when skilled workers hold positions where their skill has not full scopeand where less well equipped men and women would do as well. Be ready,therefore, all ye who serve, to stay a lifetime in office non-spectacular andseemingly unimportant, for such may be your destiny and the place you best mayserve; but be equally ready to step on to work of more apparent value when theMaster's word goes forth, and when circumstances—and not the server'splanning—indicate that the time is come. Ponder this last sentence.3 - THE ATTITUDE FOLLOWING ACTION.What should this attitude be? Utter dispassion, utter self-forgetfulness, andutter occupation with the next step to be taken. The perfect server is he whodoes to the utmost of his ability what he believes to be the Master's will, andthe work to be done by him in co-operation with God's plan. Then, having donehis part, he passes on to a continuance of the work, and cares not for theresult of his action. He knows that wiser eyes than his see the end from thebeginning; that insight, deeper and more loving than his, is weighing up thefruit of his service; and that judgment, more profound than his, is testing theforce and extent of the vibration set up, and is adjusting that force accordingto the motive. He does not suffer from pride over what he has done, nor fromundue depression over [349] lack of accomplishment. At all times he does hisvery best, and wastes not time in backward contemplation, but steadily pressesforward to the accomplishment of the next duty. Brooding over past deeds, andcasting the mind back over old achievement, is in the nature of involution, andthe servant seeks to work with the law of evolution. This is an important thingto note. The wise server, after action, pays no attention to what his fellowservants say, provided his superiors (either incarnating men and women, or theGreat Ones Themselves) prove content or silent; he cares not if the result isnot that which he anticipated, provided that he faithfully did the highest thinghe knew; he cares not if reproach and reproof assail him, provided his innerself remains calm and non-accusing; he cares not if he loses friends, relatives,children, the popularity once enjoyed, and the approbation of his environingassociates, provided his inner sense of contact with Those Who guide and leadremains unbroken; he cares not if he seem to work in the dark and is consciousof little result from his labours, provided the inner light increases and hisconscience has nought to say.To sum it all up:—The motive may be epitomised in these few words:—The sacrifice of the personalself for the good of the One Self.The method may also be shortly put:—Wise control of the personality, anddiscrimination in work and time.The resultant attitude will be:—Complete dispassion, and a growing love of theunseen and the real.All this will be consummated through steady application to occult Meditation."},{"pageContent":"THE ARCANE SCHOOLTraining for new age discipleshipis provided by the Arcane School.The principles of the Ageless Wisdomare presented through esoteric meditation,study and service as a way of life.Contact the publishers for information."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARYAdept.

The First; the primeval; the atomic plane of the solar system; the highestof the seven planes.Agni. The Lord of Fire in the Vedas. The oldest and most revered of the Gods inIndia. One of the three great deities Agni, Vayu and Surya, and also all thethree, as he is the triple aspect of fire; fire is the essence of the solarsystem. The Bible says: “Our God is a consuming fire.” It is also the symbol ofthe mental plane of which Agni is paramountly lord.Agnichaitans . A group of fire devas.Atlantis . The continent that was submerged in the Atlantic Ocean, according tothe occult teaching and Plato. Atlantis was the home of the Fourth Root Race,whom we now call the Atlanteans.Antahkarana .

The centre to which the Master gathers the disciples and aspirants forpersonal instruction.Atma . The Universal Spirit; the divine Monad; the seventh Principle; so calledin the septenary constitution of man. (See diagram in Introduction.) [351]Atomic subplane. The matter of the solar system is divided by the occultistsinto seven planes or states, the highest of which is the atomic plane.Similarly, each of the seven planes is divided into seven subplanes, of whichthe highest is called the atomic subplane. There are therefore forty-ninesubplanes, and seven of these are atomic.Aura . A subtle invisible essence or fluid which emanates from human and animalbodies, and even from things. It is a psychic effluvium, partaking of both mindand body. It is electro-vital, and also electro-mental.Auric egg. An appellation that has been given to the causal body owing to itsform.Bodhisattva . Literally, he whose consciousness has become intelligence, orbuddhi. Those who need but one more incarnation to become perfect buddhas. Asused in these letters the Bodhisattva is the name of the office which is atpresent occupied by the Lord Maitreya, Who is known in the Occident as theChrist. This office might be translated as that of World Teacher. TheBodhisattva is the Head of all the religions of the world, and the Master of theMasters and the Teacher of angels and of men.Buddha (The). The name given to Gautama. Born in India about B.C. 621, he becamea full buddha in B.C. 592. The Buddha is one who is the “Enlightened”, and hasattained the highest degree of knowledge possible for man in this solar system.Buddhi . The Universal Soul or Mind. It is the spiritual soul in man (the SixthPrinciple) and therefore the vehicle of Atma, the Spirit, which is the SeventhPrinciple. [352]Causal Body. This body is, from the standpoint of the physical plane, no body,either subjective or objective. It is, nevertheless, the centre of the egoicconsciousness, and is formed of the conjunction of buddhi and manas. It isrelatively permanent and lasts throughout the long cycle of incarnations, and isonly dissipated after the fourth initiation, when the need for further rebirthon the part of a human being no longer exists.Chohan . Lord, Master, a Chief. In this book it refers to those Adepts who havegone on and taken the sixth initiation.Deva (or Angel). A god. In Sanskrit a resplendent deity. A Deva is a celestialbeing, whether good, bad, or indifferent. Devas are divided into many groups,and are called not only angels and archangels, but lesser and greater builders.Egoic Groups. On the third subplane of the fifth plane, the mental, are foundthe causal bodies of the individual men and women. These bodies, which are theexpression of the Ego, or of the individualised self-consciousness, are gatheredtogether into groups according to the ray or quality of the particular Egoinvolved.Elementals . The Spirits of the Elements; the creatures involved in the fourkingdoms, or elements, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Except a few of the higherkinds and their rulers they are forces of nature more than ethereal men andwomen.Etheric body. (Etheric double.) The physical body of a human being is, accordingto occult teaching, formed of two parts, the dense physical body, and theetheric body.

That group of spiritual beings on the inner planes of the solarsystem who are the intelligent forces of nature, and who control theevolutionary processes. They are themselves divided into twelve Hierarchies.Within our planetary scheme, the earth scheme, there is a reflection of thisHierarchy which is called by the occultist the Occult Hierarchy. This Hierarchyis formed of chohans, adepts, and initiates working through their disciples,and, by this means, in the world. (See diagram, page 254.)Initiate . From the Latin root meaning the first principles of any science. Onewho is penetrating into the mysteries of the science of the Self and of the oneself in all selves.

Theseseven Kumaras manifest through the medium of a planetary scheme in the same wayas a human being manifests through the medium of a physical body. They arecalled by the Hindu “the mind-born sons of Brahma” amongst other names. They arethe sum total of intelligence and of wisdom. Within the planetary scheme thereflection of the systemic order is also seen. At the head of our worldevolution stands the first Kumara, aided by six other Kumaras, three exotericand three esoteric, Who are the focal points for the distribution of the forceof the systemic Kumaras.Kundalini .

It was the home of the third root race.Logos . The deity manifested through every nation and people. The outwardexpression, or the elect of the cause which is ever concealed. Thus, speech isthe [355] Logos of thought, hence it is aptly translated by the “verbum” and the“word” in its metaphysical sense. (See John I:1-3.)Lord of Civilisation. (See Mahachohan.)Lords of the Flame . One of the great Hierarchies of spiritual beings who guidethe solar system.

In the exoteric sense a mantram (or thatpsychic faculty or power that conveys perception or thought) is the olderportion of the Vedas, the second part of which is composed of the Brahmanas. Inesoteric phraseology mantram is the word made flesh, or rendered objective [356]through divine magic.

Those perfected beings who renounce Nirvana (the highest state ofspiritual bliss) and choose a life of self-sacrifice, becoming members of [357]that invisible host which ever protects humanity within karmic limits.Permanent atom. Those five atoms, with the mental unit, one on each of the fiveplanes of human evolution (the mental unit being also on the mental plane) whichthe monad appropriates for purposes of manifestation. They form a stable centreand are relatively permanent. Around them the various sheaths or bodies arebuilt. They are literally small force centres.Planetary Logos. This term is generally applied to the seven highest spiritscorresponding to the seven archangels of the Christian. They have all passedthrough the human stage and are now manifesting through a planet and itsevolutions, in the same way that man manifests through his physical body. Thehighest planetary spirit working through any particular globe is, in reality,the personal God of the planet.Prakriti. Derives its name from its function as the material cause of the firstevolution of the universe. It may be said to be composed of two roots, “pra” tomanifest, and “krita” to make; meaning, that which caused the universe tomanifest itself.Prana. The Life Principle, the breath of Life. The occultist believes thefollowing statement: “Life we look upon as the one form of existence,manifesting in what is called matter, or what, incorrectly separating them, wename Spirit, Soul, and Matter in man. Matter is the vehicle for themanifestation of Soul on this plane of existence; soul is the vehicle for themanifestation of spirit, and these three as a trinity are synthesised by Life,which pervades them all.” [358]Parusha . The spiritual self. The embodied self. The word literally means “Thedweller in the city”—that is, in the body. It is derived from the Sanskrit“pura” which means city or body, and “usha,” a derivative of the verb “vas,” todwell.Quaternary . The fourfold lower self, or man, in the three worlds. There arevarious divisions of this, but perhaps for our purpose the best is to enumeratethe four as follows:1. Lower mind.2. Emotional or kamic body.3. Prana, or the Life Principle.4. The etheric body, or the highest division of the twofold physical body.Raja Lord . The word “Raja” simply means King or Prince; the word has beenapplied to those great angels or entities who ensoul the seven planes.

One of the seven streams of force of the Logos; the seven great lights.Each of them is the embodiment of a great cosmic entity. The seven Rays can bedivided into the three Rays of Aspect and the four Rays of Attribute, asfollows:Rays of Aspect1. The Ray of Will, or Power.2. The Ray of Love-Wisdom.3. The Ray of Activity or Adaptability. [359]Rays of Attribute4. The Ray of Harmony, Beauty, Art, or Unity.5. The Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science.6. The Ray of Abstract Idealism or Devotion.7. The Ray of Ceremonial Magic, or Law.The above names are simply some chosen from among many, and embody the differentaspects of force by means of which the Logos manifests.Ring-pass-not. This is at the circumference of the manifested solar system, andis the periphery of the influence of the sun, both esoterically and exotericallyunderstood. The limit of the field of activity of the central life force.Root Race. One of the seven races of man which evolve upon a planet during thegreat cycle of planetary existence. This cycle is called a world period. TheAryan root race, to which the Hindu, European, and modern American races belong,is the fifth, the Chinese and Japanese belonging to the fourth race.Sensa, or Senzar. The name for the secret sacerdotal language, or the “mysteryspeech” of the initiated adepts all over the world. It is a universal language,and largely a hieroglyphic cypher.Shamballa.

It is the home of mysticism and the Secret Doctrine.Triad . The spiritual Man; the expression of the monad. It is the germinalspirit containing the potentialities of divinity. These potentialities will beunfolded [360] during the course of evolution. This Triad forms theindividualised or separated self, or Ego.Viveka . The Sanskrit “discrimination”. The very first step in the path ofoccultism......is the discrimination between the real and the unreal, betweensubstance and phenomenon, between the Self and the Not-self, between spirit andmatter.Wesak .

It is said that at this festival, at which all the members of theHierarchy are present, the Buddha, for a brief period, renews his touch andassociation with the work of our planet.Yoga . 1. One of the six schools of India, said to be founded by Patanjali, butreally of much earlier origin. 2. The practice of Meditation, as a means ofleading to spiritual liberation.Note : This glossary does not undertake fully to explain all the above terms.
