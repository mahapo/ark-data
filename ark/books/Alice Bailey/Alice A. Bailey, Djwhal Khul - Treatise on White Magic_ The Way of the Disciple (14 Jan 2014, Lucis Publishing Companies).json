Bailey"},{"pageContent":"EXTRACT FROM A STATEMENT BY THE TIBETANSuffice it to say, that I am a Tibetan disciple of a certain degree, and thistells you but little, for all are disciples from the humblest aspirant up to,and beyond, the Christ Himself. I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity,—not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"RULES FOR MAGICRULE ONEThe Solar Angel collects himself, scatters not his force, but, in meditationdeep, communicates with his reflection.RULE TWOWhen the shadow hath responded, in meditation deep the work proceedeth. Thelower light is thrown upward; the greater light illuminates the three, and thework of the four proceedeth.RULE THREEThe Energy circulates. The point of light, the product of the labours of thefour, waxeth and groweth. The myriads gather round its glowing warmth until itslight recedes. Its fire grows dim. Then shall the second sound go forth.RULE FOURSound, light, vibration, and the form blend and merge, and thus the work is one.It proceedeth under the law, and naught can hinder now the work from goingforward. The man breathes deeply. He concentrates his forces, and drives thethought-form from him.RULE FIVEThree things engage the Solar Angel before the sheath created passes downward;the condition of the waters, the safety of the one who thus creates, and steadycontemplation. Thus are the heart, the throat, and eye, allied for tripleservice. [xiii]RULE SIXThe devas of the lower four feel the force when the eye opens; they are drivenforth and lose their master.RULE SEVENThe dual forces of the plane whereon the vital power must be sought are seen;the two paths face the solar Angel; the poles vibrate. A choice confronts theone who meditates.RULE EIGHTThe Agnisuryans respond to the sound. The waters ebb and flow. Let the magicianguard himself from drowning at the point where land and water meet. The midwayspot, which is neither dry nor wet, must provide the standing place whereon hisfeet are set. When water, land and air meet, there is the place for magic to bewrought .RULE NINECondensation next ensues. The fire and waters meet, the form swells and grows.Let the magician set his form upon the proper path.RULE TENAs the waters bathe the form created, they are absorbed and used. The formincreases in its strength; let the magician thus continue until the worksuffices. Let the outer builders cease their labors then, and let the innerworkers enter on their cycle.RULE ELEVENThree things the worker with the law must now accomplish. First, ascertain theformula which will confine the lives within the ensphering wall; next, pronouncethe words which will tell them what to do and where to carry [xiv] that whichhas been made; and finally, utter forth the mystic phrase which will save himfrom their work.RULE TWELVEThe web pulsates. It contracts and expands. Let the magician seize the midwaypoint and thus release those “prisoners of the planet” whose note is right andjustly tuned to that which must be made.RULE THIRTEENThe magician must recognize the four; note in his work the shade of violet theyevidence, and thus construct the shadow. When this is so, the shadow clothesitself, and the four become the seven.RULE FOURTEENThe sound swells out. The hour of danger to the soul courageous draweth near.The waters have not hurt the white creator and naught could drown nor drenchhim. Danger from fire and flame menaces now, and dimly yet the rising smoke isseen. Let him again, after the cycle of peace, call on the solar Angel.RULE FIFTEENThe fires approach the shadow, yet burn it not. The fire sheath is completed.Let the magician chant the words that blend the fire and water.From “A Treatise on Cosmic Fire”"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTORY REMARKS[3] In the study of the ideas outlined in this book and their carefulconsideration certain basic concepts are borne in mind:First, that the matter of prime importance to each student is not the fact of aparticular teacher’s personality but the measure of truth for which he stands,and the student’s power to discriminate between truth, partial truth, andfalsity.Second, that with increased esoteric teaching comes increased exotericresponsibility. Let each student with clarity therefore take stock of himself,remembering that understanding comes through application of the measure of truthgrasped to the immediate problem and environment, and that the consciousnessexpands through use of the truth imparted.Third, that a dynamic adherence to the chosen path and a steady perseverancethat overcomes and remains unmoved by aught that may eventuate, is a primerequisite and leads to the portal admitting to a kingdom, a dimension and astate of being which is inwardly or subjectively known. It is this state ofrealisation which produces changes in form and environment commensurate with itspower.These three suggestions will merit a close consideration by all, and theirsignificance must be somewhat grasped before further real progress is possible.It is not my function to make individual and personal application of theteaching given. That must be done by each student for himself.You have wisely guarded the teaching from the taint of superimposed authority,and there lies back of your [4] books no esoteric principle of hierarchicalauthority or support, such as has produced the narrow limits of certainecclesiastical bodies and groups, differing as widely as the Catholic Church,Christian Science, those who believe in the verbal inspiration of theScriptures, and numerous (so-called) esoteric organisations. The curse of manygroups has been the whispered word that “Those who know wish....” “The Mastersays....” “The Great Ones command...” and the group of silly sheep feebly andblindly tumble over themselves to obey. They think thereby, through theirmisplaced devotion, to contact certain authoritative personages, and to get intoheaven by some short cut.You have wisely guarded your books from the reaction accorded to those who claimto be masters, adepts and initiates. My anonymity and status must be preserved,and my rank be regarded as only that of a senior student and of an aspirant tothat expansion of consciousness which is for me the next step forward. What Isay of truth alone is of moment; the inspiration and help I can accord to anypilgrim on the path is alone vital; that which I have learned through experienceis at the disposal of the earnest aspirant; and the wideness of the vision whichI can impart (owing to my having climbed higher up the mountain than some) is mymain contribution. Upon these points the students are at liberty to ponder,omitting idle speculation as to the exact details of unimportant personalities,and environing conditions.Our theme is to be that of the Magic of the Soul, and the key thought,underlying all that may appear in this book, is to be found in the words of theBhagavad Gita which runs as follows:“Though I am Unborn, the Soul that passes not away, though I am the Lord ofBeings, yet as Lord over My nature I become manifest, through the magical powerof the Soul.” Gita IV.6. [5]The statistical and the academic is a necessary basis and a preliminary step formost scientific study, but in this book we will centre our attention on the lifeaspect, and the practical application of truth to the daily life of theaspirant. Let us study how we can become practical magicians, and in what way wecan best live the life of a spiritual man, and of an aspirant to accepteddiscipleship in our own peculiar times, state and environment.To do this we will take the Fifteen Rules for Magic to be found in my earlierbook, entitled A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . I will comment on them, dealing notwith their cosmic significance or with solar and other correspondences andanalogies, but applying them to the work of the aspirant, and giving practicalsuggestions for the better development of soul contact and soul manifestation. Ishall take for granted certain knowledges and assume the students can follow andcomprehend certain technical terms that I may be led to use. I am not dealingwith babes but with matured men and women who have chosen a certain way and whoare pledged to “walk in the light.”I seek in this book to do four things, and to make appeal to three types ofpeople. It is based, as regards its teaching, upon four fundamental postulates.These are intended to:1. Teach the laws of spiritual psychology as distinguished from mental andemotional psychology.2. Make clear the nature of the soul of man and its systemic and cosmicrelationships. This will include its group relationship as a preliminary step.3. Demonstrate the relations between the self and the sheaths which that selfmay use, and thus clarify public thought as to the constitution of man.4. Elucidate the problem of the supernormal powers, [6] and give the rules fortheir safe and useful development.We stand now towards the close of a great transition period and the subtlerrealms of life are closer than ever before; unusual phenomena and inexplicablehappenings are commoner than at any time heretofore, whilst matters telepathic,psychic, and peculiar occupy the attention even of sceptics, scientists, andreligionists. Reasons for the appearance of phenomena are being everywheresought, and societies are formed for their investigation and demonstration. Manyare likewise going astray in the effort to induce in themselves psychicconditions and the energy-producing factors which give rise to the manifestationof peculiar powers. This book will endeavor to fit the information given intothe scheme of life as we today recognize it and will show how basically naturaland true is all that is termed mysterious. All is under law, and the laws needelucidation now that man’s development has reached the stage of a justerappreciation of their beauty and reality.Three types of people will respond to this book. They are:1. Those open minded investigators who are willing to accept its fundamentals asa working hypothesis until these are demonstrated to be erroneous. They will befrankly agnostic, but willing temporarily, in their search for truth, to try outthe methods and follow the suggestions laid down for their consideration.2. Aspirants and disciples . They will study this treatise in order tounderstand themselves better and because they seek to help their brother man.They will not accept its dicta blindly but will experiment, check andcorroborate with care the stages [7] and steps laid down for them in thissection of the teachings of the Ageless Wisdom.3. Initiates. These persons will arrive at a meaning which will not be apparentto those in the first group and which will only be suspected by the moreadvanced members of the second. Within themselves they know the truth of many ofits statements and will realise the subjective working out of many of the laws.These laws of nature have effects in three distinct realms:a. Physically, where they demonstrate as effects in the dense form.b. Etherically, where they demonstrate as the energy lying back of thoseeffects.c. Mentally, where they concern the impulses which produce the other two.The Treatise on Cosmic Fire dealt primarily with the solar system and onlytouched upon human aspects and correspondences insofar as they demonstrated therelation of the part to the whole, and of the unit to the totality.The present book will deal more specifically with human development andunfoldment, elucidating the causes which are responsible for the presenteffects, and pointing to the future and its possibilities, and to the nature ofthe unfolding potentialities.This book will be based also upon four fundamental postulates which must beadmitted by the student of the succeeding pages as providing an hypothesisworthy of his consideration and trial. No true investigator of the AgelessWisdom is asked to give blind adherence to any presentation of truth; he isasked, however, to have an open mind and seriously to weigh and consider thetheories and ideals, the laws and the truths which have guided so many out ofdarkness into the light of knowledge [8] and experience. The postulates might beenumerated as follows and are given in the order of their importance.I. First, that there exists in our manifested universe the expression of anEnergy or Life which is the responsible cause of the diverse forms and the vasthierarchy of sentient beings who compose the sum total of all that is. This isthe so-called hylozoistic theory, though the term but serves to confuse. Thisgreat Life is the basis of Monism, and all enlightened men are Monists. “God isOne” is the utterance of truth. One life pervades all forms and those forms arethe expressions, in time and space, of the central universal energy. Life inmanifestation produces existence and being. It is the root cause, therefore, ofduality. This duality which is seen when objectivity is present and whichdisappears when the form aspect vanishes is covered by many terms, of which forthe sake of clarity, the most usual might be here listed:Spirit............MatterLife.............. FormFather.......... MotherPositive....... NegativeDarkness..... LightStudents must clearly have this essential unity in mind e’en when they talk (asthey needs must) in finite terms of that duality which is everywhere,cyclically, apparent.II. The second postulate grows out of the first and states that the one Life,manifesting through matter, produces a third factor which is consciousness. Thisconsciousness, which is the result of the union of the two poles of spirit andmatter is the soul of all things; it permeates all substance or objectiveenergy; it underlies all forms, whether it be the form of that unit of energywhich we call an atom, or the form of man, a planet, or a solar system. This isthe Theory of Self-determination [9] or the teaching that all the lives of whichthe one life is formed, in their sphere and in their state of being, become, soto speak, grounded in matter and assume forms whereby their peculiar specificstate of consciousness may be realised and their vibration stabilised; thus theymay know themselves as existences. Thus again the one life becomes a stabilisedand conscious entity through the medium of the solar system, and is essentially,therefore the sum total of energies, of all states of consciousness, and of allforms in existence. The homogeneous becomes the heterogeneous, and yet remains aunity; the one manifests in diversity and yet is unchanged; the central unity isknown in time and space as composite and differentiated and yet, when time andspace are not (being but states of consciousness), only the unity will remain,and only spirit will persist, plus an increased vibratory action, plus capacityfor an intensification of the light when again the cycle of manifestationreturns.Within the vibratory pulsation of the one manifesting Life all the lesser livesrepeat the process of being,—Gods, angels, men, and the myriad lives whichexpress themselves through the forms of the kingdoms of nature and theactivities of the evolutionary process. All become self-centered andself-determined.III. The third basic postulate is that the object for which life takes form andthe purpose of manifested being is the unfoldment of consciousness, or therevelation of the soul. This might be called the Theory of the Evolution ofLight . When it is realised that even the modern scientist is saying that lightand matter are synonymous terms, thus echoing the teaching of the East, itbecomes apparent that through the interplay of the poles, and through thefriction of the pairs of opposites light flashes forth. The goal of evolution isfound to be a gradual series of light demonstrations. Veiled and [10] hidden byevery form lies light. As evolution proceeds, matter becomes increasingly abetter conductor of the light, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the statementof the Christ “I am the Light of the World”.IV. The fourth postulate consists of the statement that all lives manifestcyclically. This is the Theory of Rebirth or of re-incarnation , thedemonstration of the law of periodicity.Such are the great underlying truths which form the foundation of the AgelessWisdom—the existence of life, and the development of consciousness through thecyclic taking of form.In this book, however, the emphasis will be laid upon the little life; upon man“made in the image of God”, who through the method of re-incarnation unfolds hisconsciousness until it flowers forth as the perfected soul, whose nature islight and whose realisation is that of a self-conscious identity. This developedunit has eventually to be merged, with full intelligent participation, in thegreater consciousness of which it is a part.Before we take up our subject it might be of value if we defined certain wordswhich will be in constant use, so that we will know what we are talking about,and the significance of the terms we use.1. Occult. This term concerns the hidden forces of being and those springs ofconduct which produce the objective manifestation. The word “conduct” is usedhere deliberately, for all manifestation, in all the kingdoms of nature, is theexpression of the life, purpose and type of activity of some being or existence,and thus is literally the conduct (or outer nature or quality) of a life. Thesesprings of action lie hid in the purpose of any life, whether it be a solarlife, a planetary entity, a man, or that Being who is the sum total of thestates of consciousness and of the forms of any kingdom in nature.2. Laws. A law presupposes a superior being who, [11] gifted with purpose, andaided by intelligence, is so coordinating his forces that a plan is beingsequentially and steadily matured. Through a clear knowledge of the goal, thatentity sets in activity those steps and stages which when carried forward inorder will bring the plan to perfection. The word “law”, as usually understood,conveys the idea of subjection to an activity which is recognised as inexorableand undeviating, but which is not understood by the one who is subjected to it;it involves, from one standpoint, the attitude of the submersed unit in thegroup impulse and the inability of that unit to change the impulse or evade theissue; it inevitably brings about in the consciousness of the man who isconsidering these laws, a feeling of being a victim—of being driven forward likea leaf before the breeze towards an end about which speculation only ispossible, and of being governed by a force which acts apparently with anunavoidable pressure and thus produces group results, at the expense of theunit. This attitude of mind is inevitable until the consciousness of man can beso expanded that he becomes aware of the greater issues. When, through contactwith his own higher self, he participates in the knowledge of the objective, andwhen through climbing the mountain of vision his perspective changes and hishorizon enlarges, he comes to the realisation that a law is but the spiritualimpulse, incentive and life manifestation of that Being in which he lives andmoves. He learns that that impulse demonstrates an intelligent purpose, wiselydirected, and based on love. He then himself begins to wield the law or to passwisely, lovingly and intelligently through himself as much of that spirituallife impulse which his particular organism can respond to, transmit and utilise.He ceases to obstruct and begins to transfer. He brings to an end the cycle ofthe closed self-centered life, and opens the doors wide to spiritual energy. Inso doing he finds that the law [12] which he has hated and mistrusted is thevitalising, purifying agency which is sweeping him and all God’s creatures on toa glorious consummation.3. Psychic . There are two types of the above force in manifestation as far asthe human kingdom is concerned, and these must be clearly grasped. There is theforce which animates the subhuman kingdoms in nature,—the ensouling energywhich, brought into conjunction with the energy of matter and self, produces allforms. The effect of this junction is to add to the embryo intelligence ofsubstance itself a latent sentiency and responsiveness that produces thatsubjective something we call the animal soul. This exists in four degrees orstates of sentient awareness:a. The consciousness of the mineral kingdom.b. The consciousness of the vegetable kingdom.c. The consciousness of the animal kingdom.d. The consciousness of the animal form through which the spiritual manfunctions, which after all is but a department of the former group in itshighest presentation.Secondly, there is that psychic force which is the result of the union of thespirit with sentient matter in the human kingdom and which produces a psychiccentre which we call the soul of man. This psychic centre is a force centre, andthe force of which it is the custodian or which it demonstrates, brings intoplay a responsiveness and an awareness which is that of the soul of theplanetary life, a group consciousness which brings with it faculties andknowledge of a different order than that in the animal soul. These supersedeeventually the powers of the animal soul which limit, distort, and imprison, andgive man a range of contacts and a knowledge which is infallible, free fromerror, and which admits him to “the freedom of the heavens”. The effect of thefree [13] play of the soul of man serves to demonstrate the fallibility andrelative uselessness of the powers of the animal soul. All I desire to do hereis to show the two senses in which the word “psychic” is used. Later we willdeal with the growth and development of the lower psychic nature or the soul ofthe vehicles in which man functions in the three worlds, and then will seek toelucidate the true nature of the soul of man and of the powers which can bebrought into play once a man can contact his own spiritual centre, the soul, andlive in that soul consciousness.4. Unfoldment. The life at the heart of the solar system is producing anevolutionary unfoldment of the energies of that universe which it is notpossible for finite man as yet to vision. Similarly the centre of energy whichwe call the spiritual aspect in man is (through the utilisation of matter orsubstance) producing an evolutionary development of that which we call the soul,and which is the highest of the form manifestations—the human kingdom. Man isthe highest product of existence in the three worlds. By man, I mean thespiritual man, a son of God in incarnation. The forms of all the kingdoms ofnature—human, animal, vegetable and mineral—contribute to that manifestation.The energy of the third aspect of divinity tends to the revelation of the soulor the second aspect which in turn reveals the highest aspect. It must ever beremembered that The Secret Doctrine of H. P. Blavatsky expresses this withaccuracy in the words “Life we look upon as the one form of existence,manifesting in what is called Matter; or what, incorrectly separating them, wename spirit, soul and matter in man. Matter is the vehicle for the manifestationof soul on this plane of existence, and soul is the vehicle on a higher planefor the manifestation of spirit, and these three are a trinity synthesized bylife, [14] which pervades them all.” (The Secret Doctrine . Vol: I. p. 79. 80.)Through the use of matter the soul unfolds and finds its climax in the soul ofman, and this treatise will concern itself with the unfoldment of that soul andits discovery by man.5. Knowledge might be divided into three categories:—First, there is theoreticalknowledge. This includes all knowledge of which man is aware but which isaccepted by him on the statements of other people, and by the specialists in thevarious branches of knowledge. It is founded on authoritative statements and hasin it the element of trust in the writers and speakers, and in the trainedintelligences of the workers in any of the many and varied fields of thought.The truths accepted as such have not been formulated or verified by the one whoaccepts them, lacking as he does the necessary training and equipment. The dictaof science, the theologies of religion, and the findings of the philosophers andthinkers everywhere colour the point of view and meet with a ready acquiescencefrom the untrained mind, and that is the average mind.Then, secondly, we have discriminative knowledge , which has in it a selectivequality and which posits the intelligent appreciation and practical applicationof the more specifically scientific method, and the utilisation of test, theelimination of that which cannot be proved, and the isolation of those factorswhich will bear investigation and are in conformity with what is understood aslaw. The rational, argumentative, scholastic, and concretising mind is broughtinto play with the result that much that is childish, impossible andunverifiable is rejected and a consequent clarifying of the fields of thoughtresults. This discriminating and scientific process has enabled man to arrive atmuch truth in relation to the three worlds. The scientific method is, inrelation to the [15] mind of humanity, playing the same function as the occultmethod of meditation (in its first two stages of concentration and prolongedconcentration or meditation) plays in relation to the individual. Through itright processes of thought are engendered, non-essentials and incorrectformulations of truth are ultimately eliminated or corrected, and the steadyfocussing of the attention either upon a seed thought, a scientific problem, aphilosophy or a world situation results in an ultimate clarifying and the steadyseeping in of right ideas and sound conclusions. The foremost thinkers in any ofthe great schools of thought are simply exponents of occult meditation and thebrilliant discoveries of science, the correct interpretations of nature’s laws,and the formulations of correct conclusions whether in the fields of science, ofeconomics, of philosophy, psychology or elsewhere is but the registering by themind (and subsequently by the brain) of the eternal verities, and the indicationthat the race is beginning also to bridge the gap between the objective and thesubjective, between the world of form and the world of ideas.This leads inevitably to the emergence of the third branch of knowledge, theintuitive . The intuition is in reality only the appreciation by the mind ofsome factor in creation, some law of manifestation and some aspect of truth,known by the soul, emanating from the world of ideas, and being of the nature ofthose energies which produce all that is known and seen. These truths are alwayspresent, and these laws are ever active, but only as the mind is trained anddeveloped, focussed, and open-minded can they be recognized, later understood,and finally adjusted to the needs and demands of the cycle and time. Those whohave thus trained the mind in the art of clear thinking, the focussing of theattention, and consequent receptivity to truth have always been with us, buthitherto have been few and far between. They [16] are the outstanding minds ofthe ages. But now they are many and increasingly found. The minds of the raceare in process of training and many are hovering on the borders of a newknowledge. The intuition which guides all advanced thinkers into the newerfields of learning is but the forerunner of that omniscience which characterisesthe soul. The truth about all things exists, and we call it omniscience,infallibility, the “correct knowledge” of the Hindu philosophy. When man graspsa fragment of it and absorbs it into the racial consciousness we call it theformulation of a law, a discovery of one or other of nature’s processes.Hitherto this has been a slow and piecemeal undertaking. Later, and before sovery long, light will pour in, truth will be revealed and the race will enterupon its heritage—the heritage of the soul.In some of our considerations, speculation must perforce enter in. Those who seea vision that is withheld from those lacking the necessary equipment for itsapprehension are regarded as fanciful, and unreliable. When many see the vision,its possibility is admitted, but when humanity itself has the awakened and openeye, the vision is no longer emphasised but a fact is stated and a lawenunciated. Such has been the history of the past and such will be the processin the future.The past is purely speculative from the standpoint of the average man and thefuture is equally so, but he himself is the result of that past and the futurewill work out of the sum total of his present characteristics and qualities. Ifthis is true of the individual it is then also equally true of mankind as awhole. That unit in nature, which we call the fourth or human kingdom,represents that which is the product of its physical heritage; itscharacteristics are the sum of its emotional and mental unfoldments and itsassets are those which it has succeeded in accumulating during the cycleswherein it has [17] been wrestling with its environment—the sum total of theother kingdoms in nature. Within the human kingdom lie potentialities andlatencies, characteristics and assets which the future will reveal and which intheir turn determine that future.I have purposely chosen to begin with the undefinable and the unrecognised. Thesoul is as yet an unknown quantity. It has no real place in the theories of theacademic and scientific investigators. It is unproven and regarded by even themore open-minded of the academicians as a possible hypothesis, but lackingdemonstration. It is not accepted as a fact in the consciousness of the race.Only two groups of people accept it as a fact; one is the gullible, undeveloped,childlike person who, brought up on a scripture of the world, and beingreligiously inclined, accepts the postulates of religion—such as the soul, Godand immortality—without questioning. The other is that small but steadilygrowing band of Knowers of God, and of reality, who know the soul to be a factin their own experience but are unable to prove its existence satisfactorily tothe man who admits only that which the concrete mind can grasp, analyse,criticise and test.The ignorant and the wise meet on common ground as extremes always do. Inbetween are those who are neither totally ignorant nor intuitively wise. Theyare the mass of the educated people who have knowledge but not understanding,and who have yet to learn the distinction between that which can be grasped bythe rational mind, that which can be seen by the mind’s eye, and that which onlythe higher or abstract mind can formulate and know. This ultimately merges inthe intuition, which is the “knowing faculty” of the intelligent and practicalmystic who—relegating the emotional and feeling nature to its own place—uses themind as a focussing [18] point and looks out through that lens upon the world ofthe soul.MAN’S THREE ASPECTSOne of the main means whereby man arrives at an understanding of that great sumtotal we call the Macrocosm—God, functioning through a solar system—is by anunderstanding of himself, and the Delphic injunction “Man, know thyself” was aninspired utterance, intended to give man the clue to the mystery of deity.Through the Law of Analogy, or correspondences, the cosmic processes, and thenature of the cosmic principles are indicated in the functions, structure, andcharacteristics of a human being. They are indicated but not explained orelaborated. They serve simply as sign posts, directing man along the pathwhereon future sign posts may be found and more definite indications noted.The comprehension of that triplicity of spirit, soul, and body lies as yetbeyond man’s achievement, but an idea as to their relationship and their generalcoordinated function may be indicated by a consideration of man from thephysical side, and his objective functioning.There are three aspects of man’s organism which are symbols, and symbols only,of the three aspects of being.1. The energy, or activating principle, which withdraws mysteriously at death,partially withdraws in the hours of sleep or of unconsciousness, and which seemsto use the brain as its main seat of activity and from there to direct thefunctioning of the organism. This energy has a primary direct relation with thethree parts of the organism which we call the brain, the heart, and thebreathing apparatus. This is the microcosmic symbol of spirit.2. The nervous system, with its complexities of nerves, nerve centres and thatmultiplicity of interrelated and sensitive parts which serve to coordinate theorganism, [19] to produce the sensitive response which exists between the manyorgans and parts which form the organism as a whole, and which serve also tomake the man aware of, and sensitive to, his environment. This entire sensoryapparatus is that which produces the organised awareness and coordinatedsensitivity of the entire human being, first, within itself as a unit, andsecondly, its responsiveness and sensitive reaction to the world within which itplays its part. This nervous structure, coordinating, correlating, and producingan outer and inner group activity demonstrates primarily through the three partsof the nervous system.a. Cerebro-spinal system.b. Sensory system of nerves.c. Peripheral system of nerves.It is closely associated with the energy aspect, being the apparatus utilised bythat energy to vitalise the body, to produce its coordinated activity andfunctioning, and to bring about an intelligent rapport with the world in whichit has to play its part. It lies back, if one might use such an expression, ofthe body-nature proper, back of the mass of the flesh and bone and muscle. It inits turn, is motivated by and controlled by two factors:a. The sum total of the energy which is the individual quota of vital energy.b. The energy of the environment in which the individual finds himself andwithin which he has to function and to play his part.This coordinating nervous system, this network of interrelating and sensitivenerves is the symbol in man of the soul, and an outer and visible form of aninner spiritual reality.3. There is finally what might be described as the body, the sum total of flesh,of muscle, and of bone which the [20] man carries around, correlated by thenervous system and energised by what we vaguely call his “life”.In these three, the life, the nervous system and the body mass we find thereflection and the symbol of the greater whole, and by a close study of these,and a comprehension of their functions and group relation, we can arrive at anunderstanding of some of the laws and principles which direct the activities of“God in nature”—a phrase, sublimely true and equally finitely false.The three aspects of divinity, the central energy, or spirit, the coordinatingforce or soul, and that which these two use and unify are in reality one vitalprinciple manifesting in diversity. These are the Three in One, the One inThree, God in nature, and nature itself in God.Carrying the concept, for the sake of illustration, into other realms of thoughtthis trinity of aspects can be seen functioning in the religious world as theesoteric teaching, the fundamental symbology and doctrines of the great worldreligions and the exoteric organisations; in government it is the sum total ofthe will of the people whatever that will may be, the formulated laws, and theexoteric administration; in education it is the will to learn, the arts andsciences, and the great exoteric educational systems; in philosophy it is theurge to wisdom, the interrelated schools of thought, and the outer presentationof the teachings. Thus this eternal triplicity runs through every department ofthe manifested world, whether viewed as that which is tangible, or as that whichis sensitive and coherent, or that which is energising. It is that intelligentactivity which has been clumsily called “awareness”; it is the capacity ofawareness itself, involving as it does sensitive response to environment, andthe apparatus of that response, the divine duality of the soul; it is finallythe sum total of that which is contacted and known; it is that of which thesensitive apparatus [21] becomes aware. This, as we shall see later, is agradually growing realisation, shifting ever into more esoteric and innerrealms.These three aspects are seen in man, the divine unit of life. First herecognises them in himself; then he sees them in every form in his environment,and finally he learns to relate these aspects of himself to the similar aspectsin other forms of divine manifestation. Correct relation between forms willresult in the harmonising and right adjustment of physical plane life. Correctresponse to one’s environment will result in correct rapport with the soulaspect, hidden in every form, and will produce right relations between thevarious parts of the inner nervous structure to be found in every kingdom ofnature, subhuman and superhuman. This is as yet practically unknown but israpidly coming into recognition, and when it is proven and realised it will bediscovered that therein lies the basis of brotherhood and of unity. As theliver, the heart, the lungs, the stomach, and other organs in the body areseparate in existence and in function and yet are unified and brought intorelation through the medium of the nervous system throughout the body, so willit be found that in the world such organisms as the kingdoms in nature havetheir separate life and functions yet are correlated and coordinated by a vastintricate sensory system which is sometimes called the soul of all things, theanima mundi, the underlying consciousness.In dealing with the triplicities so often used when speaking of deity, such asspirit, soul, and body,—life, consciousness, and form,—it is of value toremember that they refer to differentiations of the one life, and that the moreof these triplicities with which one can familiarise oneself the more one willbe in rapport with a wider circle of men. But when one is dealing with thingsoccult and subjective, and when the subject about which [22] one writes dealswith the undefinable, then difficulty is encountered. It is no difficult matterto describe a man’s personal appearance, his clothing, his form, and the thingswith which he is surrounded. Language suffices satisfactorily to deal with theconcrete and with the world of form. But when one endeavours to convey an ideaof his quality, character, and nature one is immediately faced with the problemof the unknown, with that undefinable unseen part which we sense, but whichremains in a large sense unrevealed, and unrealised even by the man himself. Howthen shall we describe him through the medium of language?If this is so of man, how much greater is the difficulty when we seek throughwords to express that inexpressible sum total of which the terms spirit, soul,and body are regarded as the main component differentiations? How shall wedefine that undefinable life that men have (for the sake of understanding)limited and separated into a trinity of aspects, or persons, calling the wholeby the name of God?Yet where this differentiation of God into a trinity is universal and age-longin use, where every people—ancient and modern—employ the same triplicity ofideation to express an intuitive realisation, there is warrant for the usage.That some day we may think and express the truth differently may indeed be so,but for the average thinker of today the terms spirit, soul, and body stand forthe aggregate of divine manifestation, both in the deity of the universe and inthat lesser divinity, man himself. As this treatise is intended for the thinkinghuman being and not for the crystallised theologians or the theoreticallybiassed scientists we will adhere to the well-used terminology and seek tounderstand what has lain back of the phrases in which man has sought to explainGod Himself.“God is Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship [23] Him in Spirit and inTruth,” states one of the scriptures of the world. “Man became a living soul,”is to be found in another place in the same scripture. “I pray God your wholespirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless,” said a great initiate ofthe White Lodge; and the greatest of them all yet present with us in physicalform on earth, repeated the words of an earlier sage when He said: “I have saidye are Gods, and ye are all the children of the most High”. In those words thetriplicity of man, his divinity and his relationship to the life in Whom helives and moves and has his being, is touched upon from the Christianstandpoint, and all the great religions deal in analogous phrases with thatrelationship.a. Spirit, Life, Energy.The word spirit is applied to that undefinable, elusive, essential impulse orLife which is the cause of all manifestation. It is the breath of Life and isthat rhythmic inflow of vital energy which manifests in its turn as theattractive force, as the consciousness, or soul, and is the sum total of atomicsubstance. It is the correspondence in the great Existence or Macrocosm of thatwhich in the little existence or microcosm is the vital inspiring factor whichwe call the life of man; this is indicated by the breath in his body, which isabstracted or withdrawn when the life course is run.What this something is, who shall say? We trace it back to the soul orconsciousness aspect, and from the soul to the spirit (as we call the threeaspects of the one breath) but what these words really signify, who has thecourage to declare? We call this unknown something by differing names, accordingto our particular school of thought; we seek to express it in words, and end bycall it Spirit, the One Life, the Monad, Energy. Again we must remember thatunderstanding as to the nature [24] of this one life is purely relative. Thosewho are engrossed in the form side of existence think in terms of physicalvitality, of feeling, impulse, or of mental force and do not pass beyond thatunified life-consciousness of which all the above are differentiations. Thoseagain who are interested in the more metaphysical approach and in the soul-lifemore than in the form aspect express their concept in terms of soulmanifestation and—passing beyond the personal selfish reactions of the bodynature—think in terms of life, in terms of quality, of group will or power,group coordination or love-wisdom, and of group intelligence or knowledge,covering all by the generic term of brotherhood.But even that is found to be separative, through the separation into largerunits than the lower is capable of grasping. Therefore the initiate, especiallyafter the third initiation, begins to think even more synthetically and toexpress truth to himself in terms of Spirit, Life, the One. These terms mean tohim something significant, but something so far removed from the concept ofordinary thinking humanity that it is needless for me to enlarge further uponit.This brings me to a point, that should be dealt with here, prior to any furtherexpansion of our subject. In the Treatise on Cosmic Fire and in the abovepassage it frequently appears that teaching is carried forward to a certainpoint and then dropped with the statement that, owing to the point in evolutionof the average man, his reaction to truth and the reaction of thedisciple-student or the initiate will differ. This is necessarily so; each willread into the words his own state of consciousness; each will fail to interpretin terms of the more advanced reaction of those on a higher stage of the ladderof evolution. The average reader, however, objects to being forced to recognisewider points of view than his own, and the phraseology which says: “It isneedless to enlarge on [25] this for it would only be understood by theinitiate”, serves only to aggravate him, tends to make him believe that evasionis intended, and that the writer (having got out of his depth) is seeking tosave his face by some such statement. Just as a scientific treatise would provemeaningless and a mere jumble of words to the average grammar school child, butwould carry a clear definition and meaning to experts in the subject owing totraining and mental development, so there are those to whom the subject of thesoul and its nature as dealt with in such an instruction as this is as clear andlucid as current literature is to the average reader, and the best sellers, asyou call them, to the general public. Equally, though fewer in number, there arethose advanced souls to whom the spirit and its nature is also a rational andunderstandable subject, to be appreciated and comprehended through the medium ofthe soul and its powers just as it is possible to arrive at an understanding ofthe soul through the medium of the mind, correctly employed. On a lower levelaltogether, we know it is easy to understand the nature of the physical bodythrough a study and right use of the desire nature. It is a form of pride, and arefusal to recognize one’s temporary limitations that awakens in readers adislike for phrases which aptly and truly say: “When you are further developed,you will understand the above.” This should be made clear.To the Master of the Wisdom, the nature of the spirit, or that positive centreof life which every form hides is no more a mystery than is the nature of thesoul to the esoteric psychologist. The source of the one life, the plane, orstate from which that life emanates is the great Hidden Mystery to the membersof the hierarchy of adepts. The nature of spirit, its quality and type of cosmicenergy, its rate of vibration and its basic cosmic differentiations are thestudy of initiates above the third degree and the subject of theirinvestigations. They [26] bring to that study a fully developed intuition, plusthat mental interpretive capacity which their cycle of incarnation hasdeveloped. They employ the awakened and developed inner light of their souls tointerpret and comprehend that life which (divorced from the world of form)persists on the higher levels of consciousness and penetrates into our solarsystem from some exterior centre of being. They throw this light (which is inthem and which they manipulate and use) in two directions therefore, standing asthey do in the midmost state and functioning as they choose to function on theplane of the intuition or of buddhi. They cast that light into the world of formand know all things, interpreting all with correctness; they cast that lightinto the formless realms of the higher three planes (formless from thestandpoint of man in the three worlds below the intuitional plane) and seek tounderstand, through steady expansive growth, the nature and purpose of thatwhich is neither body nor soul, neither force nor matter, but which is the causeof both in the universe.Eventually, when the initiate has undergone the higher solar initiations and canfunction in the full consciousness of the monad, awareness of that which isdivorced even from group form and from those nebulous sheaths which veil andhide the One, becomes possible. The highest types of consciousness work from theplane of the monad as the initiate of lower degree works from the plane of thesoul and uses the organs of perception (if such an unsatisfactory phrase islegitimate) and means of knowledge of which average man has no idea; theypenetrate or include within their radius of awareness that sum total of life,consciousness and form which we designate God. These initiates of high degreethen begin to be aware of a vibration, a revealing light, a note or directionalindicating sound which emanates from outside our solar system altogether. Theonly way in which [27] we can get an appreciation of the process followed in theexpansion of the divine consciousness in man is to study the relation of themind and the brain and note what follows when the brain becomes the intelligentinstrument of the mind; then study the relation of the soul to the mind and whateventuates when man is directed by his soul and utilises the mind to control thephysical plane activities through the medium of the brain. In these three—soul,mind and brain—we have the analogy and the clue to the understanding of spirit,soul and body, and their mutual functions. This was the subject matter of thebook, The Light of the Soul. Upon the perfecting of the conditions dealt with inthat book there follows still another expansion when the spirit aspect, man’semanating source of energy, begins to use the soul (via the intuition) and toimpress upon the soul-consciousness those laws, knowledges, forces andinspirations which will make the soul the instrument of the spirit or monad,just as the personal man became, at an earlier stage (via the mind), theinstrument of the soul. In that earlier stage the development was two-fold. Asthe soul assumed control, via the mind, so the brain became responsive to thesoul. Man was awakened to a knowledge of himself as he really was and to thethree worlds of his normal evolution; later he became group conscious and was nolonger a separated individual. As the soul is brought under the dominance of thespirit, an analogous two stages are likewise seen:First, the disciple becomes aware not only of his group and allied groups, buthis consciousness is expanded until it might be called planetary consciousness.Secondly, he begins to merge that planetary awareness into something moresynthetic still, and gradually develops the consciousness of the greater lifewhich [28] includes the planetary life as man includes in his physicalexpression such living organisms as his heart or brain. When this takes place,he begins to comprehend the significance of spirit, the one life back of allforms, the central energy which is the cause of all manifestation.The first reaction of the average student on reading the above is to thinkimmediately of the body nature as it expresses some type or other of energy.Thus the duality is the thing noted, and that which employs the thing is presentin his mind. Yet one of the main necessities before occult aspirants at thistime is to endeavour to think in terms of the one reality which is energy itselfand nothing else. Therefore, it is of value to emphasise in our discussion ofthis abstruse subject, the fact that spirit and energy are synonymous terms andare interchangeable. Only in the realisation of this can we arrive at thereconciliation of science and religion and at a true understanding of the worldof active phenomena by which we are surrounded and in which we move.The terms, organic and inorganic, are largely responsible for much of theconfusion and the sharp differentiation existing in the minds of many peoplebetween body and spirit, between life and form, and have led to a refusal toadmit the essential identity in nature of these two. The world in which we liveis regarded by the majority as really solid and tangible, yet possessing somemysterious power (lying concealed within it) which produces movement, activityand change. This is of course putting it crudely, but it suffices to sum up theunintelligent attitude.The orthodox scientist is largely occupied with structures and relationships,with the composition of forms and with the activity produced by the componentform parts and their interrelations and dependencies. The [29] chemicals andelements, and the functions and parts they play, and their mutual interactionsas they compose all forms in all the kingdoms of nature, are the subject oftheir investigation. The nature of the atom, of the molecule, and the cell,their functions, the qualities of their force manifestations and the varyingtypes of activity, the solving of the problem as to the character and nature ofthe energies—focalised or localised in the differing forms of the natural ormaterial world—demand the consideration of the ablest minds in the world ofthought. Yet, the questions, What is Life? or What is Energy? or What is theprocess of Becoming and the nature of Being? remain unanswered. The problem asto the Why and the Wherefore is regarded as fruitless and speculative and almostinsoluble.Nevertheless, through pure reason, and through the correct functioning of theintuition these problems can be solved and these questions answered. Theirsolution is one of the ordinary revelations and attainments of initiation. Theonly true biologists are initiates of the mysteries, for they have anunderstanding of life and its purpose and are so identified with the lifeprinciple that they think and speak in terms of energy and its effects, and alltheir activities in connection with the work of the planetary hierarchy arebased on a few fundamental formulas which concern life as it makes itself feltthrough its three differentiations or aspects:—energy, force, matter.It should be noted here, that only as a man understands himself can he arrive atan understanding of that which is the sum total that we call God. This is atruism and an occult platitude but when acted upon leads to a revelation whichmakes the present ‘Unknown God’ a recognised reality. Let me illustrate.Man knows himself to be a living being and calls death that mysterious processwherein something which he [30] commonly designates as the breath of life iswithdrawn. On its withdrawal, the form disintegrates. The cohesive vitalisingforce is gone and this produces a falling apart into its essential elements ofthat which has hitherto been regarded as the body.This life principle, this basic essential of Being, and this mysterious elusivefactor is the correspondence in man of that which we call spirit or life in themacrocosm. Just as the life in man holds together, animates, vitalises anddrives into activity the form and so makes of him a living being, so the life ofGod—as the Christian calls it,—performs the same purpose in the universe andproduces that coherent, living, vital ensemble which we call a solar system.This life principle in man manifests in a triple manner:1. As the directional will, purpose, basic incentive. This is the dynamic energywhich sets his being functioning, brings him into existence, fixes the term ofhis life, carries him through the years, long or short, and abstracts itself atthe close of his life cycle. This is the spirit in man, manifesting as the willto live, to be, to act, to pursue, to evolve. In its lowest aspect this worksthrough the mental body or nature, and in connection with the dense physicalmakes itself felt through the brain.2. As the coherent force. It is that significant essential quality which makeseach man different, which produces that complex manifestation of moods, desires,qualities, complexes, inhibitions, feelings, and characteristics which produce aman’s peculiar psychology. This is the result of the interplay between thespirit or energy aspect and the matter or body nature. This is the distinctivesubjective man, his colouring, or individual note; this it is which sets the[31] rate of vibratory activity of his body, produces his particular type ofform, is responsible for the condition and nature of his organs, his glands, andhis outer aspects. This is the soul and—in its lowest aspect—is to be seenworking through the emotional or astral nature and, in connection with the densephysical body, through the heart.3. As the activity of the atoms and cells of which the physical body iscomposed. It is the sum total of those little lives of which the human organs,comprising the entire man, are composed. These have a life of their own and aconsciousness which is strictly individual and identified. This aspect of thelife principle works through the etheric or vital body and, in connection withthe solid mechanism of the tangible form, through the spleen.Therefore let us remember that the definition of spirit is not possible ofaccomplishment, nor is the definition of God. When one says that spirit is theinexpressible, undefinable cause, the emanating energy, the one life and sourceof being, the totality of all forces, of all states of consciousness and of allforms, the aggregate of life and that which is actively manifested of that life,the self and the not-self, force, and all that force motivates, one is inreality evading the issue, attempting the impossible and hiding truth behind aform of words. This cannot however be avoided until such time as thesoul-consciousness is touched and known and the formless One can be perceivedthrough the clear light of the intuition.One of the first lessons we need to learn is that our minds, being as yetunresponsive to the hidden intuitions, make it impossible for us to say withassurance that such a condition is this, that or the other; that, until we canfunction in our soul-consciousness, it is not for us to say what is or what isnot; that until we have submitted ourselves [32] to the needed training we arein no position to deny or affirm anything. Our attitude should be that ofreasonable enquiry and our interest that of the investigating philosopher,willing to accept an hypothesis on the basis of its possibility, but beingunwilling to acknowledge as proven truth anything until we know it for and inourselves. I, an aspirant to the higher mysteries, and one who has searched intothem for a longer period than has been possible as yet to many, may write ofthings as yet impossible of demonstration to you or to the public who may readthese instructions. To me they may be and are truth and proven fact and for methat may suffice. For you they should be regarded as significant possibilitiesand hints as to the direction in which truth may be sought, but beyond that youshould not permit yourself to go. The value of these instructions lies in theirsum total and is to be found in the underlying structure or skeleton ofcoordinated and correlated statements which must be considered as a whole andnot in detail and this for two reasons:1. Language, as earlier said, hides truth and does not reveal it. If truth isrecognised, it is because the investigating student has found a point of truthin himself which serves to illumine his steps as he slowly and gradually pressesforward.2. There are many types of minds, and it is not to be expected that theinformation given, for instance, in this Treatise will appeal to all. It shouldbe remembered that all people are units of consciousness breathed forth on oneof the seven emanations from God. Therefore, even their monads or spiritualaspects are inherently different just as in the prism (which is one) there arethe seven differentiated colours. Even this is so only because of the nature andpoint of view and the perceiving apparatus of the man whose eye [33] registersand differentiates the varying rates of vibratory light. These seven subsidiarygroups again produce a varying outlook, mentality, and approach, all equallyright, but all presenting a slightly different angle of vision. When the aboverealisation is coupled to such factors as the different points in evolution,varying nationalities and characteristics, the inherent distinctions broughtabout through the interplay between the physical body involved and theenvironment, it will be apparent that no approach to such abstruse subjects asthe nature of spirit and soul could have a general definition and submitthemselves to a universal terminology.b. The Soul, the Mediator or Middle Principle.There are two angles or points of view from which the nature of the soul must begrasped: one is the aspect of the soul in relation to the fourth kingdom innature, i.e. the human, and the other that of the subhuman kingdoms in nature,which, it must be remembered, are reflections of the three higher.It should be borne in mind that the soul of matter, the anima mundi, is thesentient factor in substance itself. It is the responsiveness of matterthroughout the universe and that innate faculty in all forms, from the atom ofthe physicist, to the solar system of the astronomer, which produces theundeniable intelligent activity which all demonstrate. It can be calledattractive energy, coherency, sentiency, aliveness, awareness or consciousness,but perhaps the most illuminating term is that the soul is the quality whichevery form manifests. It is that subtle something which distinguishes oneelement from another, one mineral from another. It is the intangible essentialnature of the form which in the vegetable kingdom determines whether a rose or acauliflower, an elm [34] or a watercress shall come into being; it is a type ofenergy which distinguishes the varying species of the animal kingdom and makesone man different from another in his appearance, nature and character. Thescientist has tabulated, investigated and analysed the forms; names have beenselected and given to the elements, and the minerals, the forms of vegetablelife and the varying species of animals; the structure of the forms and thehistory of their evolutionary progress have been studied and deductions andconclusions have been reached, but the solution of the problem of life itselfstill eludes the wisest, and until the understanding of the “web of life” or ofthe body of vitality which underlies every form and links every part of a formwith every other part is recognised and known to be a fact in nature, theproblem will remain unsolved.The definition of the soul may be regarded as somewhat more feasible than thatof spirit owing to the fact that there are many people who have experienced atsometime or another an illumination, an unfoldment, an uplifting, and abeatitude which has convinced them that there is a state of consciousness so farremoved from that normally experienced as to bring them into a new state ofbeing and a new level of awareness. It is something felt and experienced, andinvolves that psychic expansion which the mystic has registered down the ages,and which St. Paul referred to when he spoke of being “caught up to the thirdHeaven,” and of hearing things there which it is not lawful for man to utter.When hearing and sight on those levels are both producing registered experiencethen we have the occultist plus the mystic.1. The soul, macrocosmic and microcosmic, universal and human, is that entitywhich is brought into being when the spirit aspect and the matter aspect arerelated to each other. [35]a. The soul therefore is neither spirit nor matter but is the relation betweenthem.b. The soul is the mediator between this duality; it is the middle principle,the link between God and His form.c. Therefore the soul is another name for the Christ principle, whether innature or in man.2. The soul is the attractive force of the created universe and (whenfunctioning) holds all forms together so that the life of God may manifest orexpress itself through them.a. Therefore the soul is the form-building aspect, and is that attractive factorin every form in the universe, in the planet, in the kingdoms of nature and inman (who sums up in himself all the aspects) which brings the form into being,which enables it to develop and grow so as to house more adequately theindwelling life, and which drives all God’s creatures forward along the path ofevolution, through one kingdom after another, towards an eventual goal and aglorious consummation.b. The soul is the force of evolution itself and this was in the mind of St.Paul when he spoke of the “Christ in you, the hope of glory.”3. This soul manifests differently in the various kingdoms of nature, but itsfunction is ever the same, whether we are dealing with an atom of substance andits power to preserve its identity and form, and carry forward its activityalong its own lines, or whether we deal with a form in one of the three kingdomsof nature, held coherently together, demonstrating characteristics, pursuing itsown instinctual life and working as a whole towards something higher and better.[36]a. Therefore the soul is that which gives distinctive characteristics anddiffering form manifestations.b. The soul plays upon matter, forcing it to assume certain shapes, to respondto certain vibrations and to build those specified phenomenal forms which werecognise in the world of the physical plane as mineral, vegetable, animal andhuman,—and for the initiate certain other forms as well.4. The qualities, vibrations, colours, and characteristics in all the kingdomsof nature are soul qualities, as are the latent powers in any form seekingexpression, and demonstrating potentiality. In their sum total at the close ofthe evolutionary period, they will reveal what is the nature of the divine lifeand of the world soul,—that oversoul which is revealing the character of God.a. Therefore the soul, through these qualities and characteristics, manifests asconscious response to matter, for the qualities are brought into being throughthe interplay of the pairs of opposites, spirit and matter, and their effectupon each other. This is the basis of consciousness.b. The soul is the conscious factor in all forms, the source of that awarenesswhich all forms register and of that responsiveness to surrounding groupconditions which the forms in every kingdom of nature demonstrate.c. Therefore the soul might be defined as that significant aspect in every form(made through this union of spirit and matter) which feels, registers awareness,attracts and repels, responds or denies response and keeps all forms in aconstant condition of vibratory activity.d. The soul is the perceiving entity produced through the union of Father-Spiritand Mother-Matter. It is that which in the vegetable world, for instance,produces [37] response to the sun’s rays, and the unfolding of the bud; it isthat in the animal kingdom which enables it to love its master, hunt its prey,and follow out its instinctual life; it is that in man which makes him aware ofhis environment and his group, which enables him to live his life in the threeworlds of his normal evolution as the onlooker, the perceiver, the actor. Thisit is which enables him eventually to discover that this soul in him is dual andthat part of him responds to the animal soul and part of him recognises hisdivine soul. The majority however, at this time will be found to be functioningfully as neither purely animal nor purely divine, but can be regarded as humansouls.5. The soul of the universe is—for the sake of clarity—capable ofdifferentiation or rather (owing to the limitations of the form through whichthat soul has to function) capable of recognition at differing rates ofvibration and stages of development. The soul nature in the universe thereforemanifests in certain great states of awareness with many intermediateconditions, of which the major can be enumerated as follows:a. Consciousness , or that state of awareness in matter itself, due to the factthat Mother-Matter has been fecundated by Father-Spirit and thus life and matterhave been brought together. This type of consciousness concerns the atom,molecule and cell of which all forms are constructed. Thus the form of the solarsystem, of a planet, and of all that is found upon or within a planet isproduced.b. Intelligent sentient consciousness , i.e. that evidenced in the mineral andvegetable kingdoms. It is this which is responsible for the quality, shape, andcolouring of the vegetable and mineral forms and for their specific natures.c. Animal consciousness, the awareness of soul response [38] of all forms in theanimal kingdom, producing their distinctions, species and nature.d. Human consciousness, or self-consciousness , towards which the development ofthe life, form and awareness in the other three kingdoms has gradually tended.This term concerns the individual consciousness of man; and in the early stagesis more animal than divine, owing to the dominance of the animal body with itsinstincts and tendencies. H.P.B. defines man accurately as “an animal plus aGod”. Later it is more strictly human, neither purely animal nor entirelydivine, but fluctuating between the two stages, thus making the human kingdomthe great battleground between the pairs of opposites, between the urge or pullof spirit and the lure of matter or mother-nature, and between that called thelower self and the spiritual man.e. Group consciousness, which is the consciousness of the great sum totals, isarrived at by man through the development, first of all, of his individualconsciousness, the sum total of the lives of his animal, emotional and mentalnatures, plus the spark of divinity dwelling within the form which they make.Then comes awareness of his group, as specified for him in that group ofdisciples, working under some one Master who represents to him the Hierarchy.The Hierarchy might be defined as the sum total of those sons of men who are nolonger centered in the individualised self-consciousness, but who have enteredinto a wider realisation, that of the planetary group life. There are stages inthis realisation, mounting all the way from that tiny group recognition of theprobationary disciple up to the completed group awareness of the life in Whomall forms have their being, the consciousness of the planetary Logos, that“Spirit before the Throne” Who manifests through the form of a planet, [39] asman manifests through his form in the human kingdom.The soul therefore may be regarded as the unified sentiency and the relativeawareness of that which lies back of the form of a planet and of a solar system.These latter are the sum total of all forms, organic or inorganic, as thematerialist differentiates them. The soul, though constituting one great total,is, however, limited in its expression by the nature and quality of the form inwhich it is found and there are consequently forms which are highly responsiveto and expressive of the soul, and others which—owing to their density and thequality of the atoms of which they are composed—are incapable of recognising thehigher aspects of the soul or of expressing more than its lower vibration, toneor color. The infinitely small is recognised, the infinitely vast is assumed;but it remains as yet a concept until such time as the consciousness of man isinclusive, as well as exclusive. This concept will be understood when the secondaspect is contacted and men understand the nature of the soul. It must be alsoremembered that just as the basic triplicity of manifestation worked outsymbolically in man as his quota of energy (physical energy), his nervous systemand the body mass, so the soul can also be known as a triplicity, the highercorrespondences of the lower.There is first of all what might be called the spiritual will, —that quota ofthe universal will which any one soul can express, and which is adequate for thepurpose of enabling the spiritual man to co-operate in the plan and purpose ofthe great life in which he has his being. There is also the second soul qualitywhich is spiritual love , the quality of group consciousness, of inclusiveness,of mediatorship, of attraction and of unification. This is the paramount soulcharacteristic, for only the soul has [40] it as the dynamic factor. The spirit,or monad is primarily the expression of will with love and intelligence assecondary principles, and the body nature, the personality, is paramountlydistinguished by intelligence, but the soul has outstandingly the quality oflove which demonstrates as wisdom also when the intelligence of the body natureis fused with the love of the soul. The following tabulation may make thethought clearer.Monad . . . . . . . . .Will . . . . . . . . .Purpose1st Aspect Will, enabling the Monad to participate in the universal purpose. 2ndAspect Love, the energy which is poured forth into the soul, making it what itis. 3rd Aspect Intelligence, transmitted via the soul and brought intomanifestation through the medium of the body.Soul . . . . . . . . .Love . . . . . . . . .the Method1st Aspect Will, held in abeyance but expressing itself through the mind aspectof the personality and through Kundalini, which when aroused correctly makespossible the final initiations into the consciousness of the Monad. 2nd AspectLove, the dominating force of the soul life; through this possession and thistype of energy, the soul can be en rapport with all souls. Through the emotionalbody, the soul can be in touch with all animal or subhuman souls, through itswork on its own plane, with the meditating souls of all men; and through theprinciple of buddhi, with the second aspect of the Monad. 3rd Aspect Knowledge.This aspect is brought into touch with the intelligence of all cells in thethreefold body mechanism.By a close study of the above it becomes apparent in what way the soul acts asthe mediator between the soul and the personality. The personality hides within itself, as a casket hides [41] the jewel, thatpoint of soul light which we call the light in the head. This is found withinthe brain, and is only discovered and later used when the highest aspect of thepersonality, the mind, is developed and functioning. Then the union with thesoul is made and the soul functions through the lower personal nature.The soul hides within itself, as the “jewel in the lotus,” that faculty ofdynamic energy which is the manifested attribute of the monad, the will. Whenthe soul has unfolded all its powers and has learnt to include within itsconsciousness all that is connoted by the “myriad forms that Being takes,” thenin turn a higher or more inclusive state becomes possible and soul life issuperseded by monadic life. This involves an ability to know, to love, and toparticipate in the plans of a life which has the power to include within itsradius of consciousness not only the sum total of the lives and consciousness ofthe life of the Logos of our planet, but all the lives and consciousnesseswithin our solar system. The nature of this awareness is only possible ofcomprehension by the man who has arrived at soul-knowledge. The great need atthis time is for experts in the life of the soul and for a group of men andwomen who, undertaking the great experiment and transition, add their testimonyto the truth of the statements of the mystics and occultists of the ages.c. The Body, the Phenomenal Appearance.Not much need be written here anent this, for the body nature and the formaspect have been the object of investigation and the subject of thought anddiscussion of thinking men for many centuries. Much at which they have arrivedis basically correct. The modern investigator will admit the Law of Analogy asthe basis of his premises and recognise sometimes the Hermetic theory that “Asabove, so below” may throw much light on the [42] present problems. Thefollowing postulates may serve to clarify:—1. Man, in his body nature, is a sum total, a unity.2. This sum total is subdivided into many parts and organisms.3. Yet these many subdivisions function in a unified manner and the body is acorrelated whole.4. Each of its parts differs in form and in function but all areinter-dependent.5. Each part and each organism is, in its turn, composed of molecules, cells,and atoms and these are held together in the form of the organism by the life ofthe sum total.6. The sum total called man is roughly divided into five parts some of greaterimportance than others, but all completing that living organism we call a humanbeing.a. The head.b. The upper torso, or that part which lies above the diaphragm.c. The lower torso, or that part lying below the diaphragm.d. The arms.e. The legs.7. These organisms serve varied purposes and upon their due functioning andproper adjustment the comfort of the whole depends.8. Each of these has its own life which is the sumtotal of the life of itsatomic structure and is also animated by the unified life of the whole, directedfrom the head by the intelligent will or energy of the spiritual man.9. The important part of the body is that triple division, the head, upper andlower torso. A man can function and live without his arms and legs.10. Each of these three parts is also triple from the [43] physical side, makingthe analogy to the three parts of man’s nature and the nine of perfected monadiclife. There are other organs, but those enumerated are those which have anesoteric significance of greater value than the other parts.a. Within the head are:1. The five ventricles of the brain, or what we might call the brain as aunified organism.2. The three glands, carotid, pineal and pituitary.3. The two eyes.b. within the upper body are:1. The throat.2. The lungs.3. The heart.c. Within the lower body are:1. The spleen.2. The stomach.3. The sex organs.11. The sum total of the body is also triple:a. The skin and bony structure.b. The vascular or blood system.c. The three-fold nervous system.12. Each of these triplicities corresponds to the three parts of man’s nature:a. Physical nature:—The skin and bony structure are the analogy to the dense andetheric body of man.b. Soul nature:—The blood vessels and circulatory system are the analogy to thatall pervading soul which penetrates to all parts of the solar system, as theblood goes to all parts of the body.c. Spirit nature:—The nervous system, as it energises and acts throughout thephysical man is the correspondence to the energy of spirit.13. In the head we have the analogy to the spirit aspect, the directing will,the monad, the one: [44]a. The brain with its five ventricles is the analogy to the physical form whichthe spirit animates in connection with man, that fivefold sum total which is themedium through which the spirit on the physical plane has to express itself.b. The three glands in the head are closely related to the soul or psychicnature (higher and lower).c. The two eyes are the physical plane correspondences to the monad, who is willand love-wisdom, or atma-buddhi, according to the occult terminology.14. In the upper body we have an analogy to the triple soul nature.a. The throat, corresponding to the third creative aspect or the body nature,the active intelligence of the soul.b. The heart, the love wisdom of the soul, the buddhi or Christ principle.c. The lungs, the analogy for the breath of life, is the correspondence ofspirit.15. In the lower torso again we have this triple system carried out:a. The sex organs, the creative aspect, the fashioner of the body.b. The stomach, as the physical manifestation of the solar plexus is the analogyto the soul nature.c. The spleen, the receiver of energy and therefore the physical planeexpression of the centre which receives this energy is the analogy to theenergising spirit.The vital body is the expression of the soul energy and has the followingfunction:1. It unifies and links into one whole the sum total of all forms. [45]2. It gives to every form its particular quality, and this is due to:a. The type of matter drawn into that particular part of the web of life.b. The position in the body of the planetary Logos, for instance, of anyspecific form.c. The particular kingdom in nature which is being vitalised.3. It is the principle of integration and the cohesive force of manifestation,from the strictly physical sense.4. This web of life is the subjective analogy to the nervous system, andbeginners in the esoteric sciences can, if they remember this, picture tothemselves a network of nerves and plexus running throughout the entire body, orthe sum total of all forms, coordinating and linking, and producing an essentialunity.5. Within that unity is diversity. Just as the varied organs of the human bodyare inter-related by the ramification of the nervous system, so within the bodyof the planetary Logos are the various kingdoms in nature and the multiplicityof forms. Back of the objective universe is the subtler sensitive body—oneorganism, not many, one sentient, responsive, connected form.6. This sensitive form is not only that which responds to the environment but isthe transmitter (from inner sources) of certain types of energy, and the objectof the Treatise might here be stated to be that of considering the various typesof energy transmitted to the form in the human kingdom, the responsiveness ofthe form to the types of force, the effects of that force upon man, and hisgradual responsiveness to force emanating: [46]a. From his environment, plus his own outer physical body.b. From the emotional plane, or astral force.c. The mental plane or thought currents.d. Egoic force, a force only registered by man and of which the fourth kingdomin nature is the custodian and which has mysterious and peculiar effects.e. The type of energy which produces the concretion of ideas on the physicalplane.f. Strictly spiritual energy, or force from the plane of the monad.The different types of force can all be registered in the human kingdom. Some ofthem can be registered in the subhuman kingdoms, and the apparatus of the vitalbody in man is so constructed that through its three objective manifestations,the triple nervous system, through the seven major plexi, the lesser nerveganglia, and the many thousands of nerves, the entire objective man can beresponsive to:a. The above mentioned types of force.b. Energies generated in and emanating from any part of the planetary ethericweb of life.c. The solar web of life.d. The constellations of the Zodiac which appear to have a real effect upon ourplanet and of which astrology is as yet the immature study.e. Certain cosmic forces which, it will be recognised later, play upon andproduce changes in our solar system and consequently upon our planet and uponall forms upon and within that planetary life. This has been touched upon in theTreatise on Cosmic Fire.To all of these the planetary web of life is responsive, and, when astrologerswork in the occult way and consider [47] the planetary horoscope, they willarrive more quickly at an understanding of the zodiacal and cosmic influences.The anima mundi is that which lies back of the web of life. The latter is butthe physical symbol of that universal soul; it is the outer and visible sign ofthe inner reality, the concretion of the sensitive responsive entity which linksspirit and matter together. This entity we call the Universal Soul, the middleprinciple from the standpoint of the planetary life. When we narrow the conceptdown to the human family, and consider the individual man, we call it themediating principle, for the soul of mankind is not only an entity linkingspirit and matter, and mediating between monad and personality, but the soul ofhumanity has a unique function to perform in mediating between the higher threekingdoms in nature and the lower three. The higher three are:1. The Spiritual Hierarchy of our planet, nature spirits or angels and humanspirits, who stand at a peculiar point on the ladder of evolution. Of theseSanat Kumara, embodying a principle of the planetary Logos is the highest, andan initiate of the first degree is the lowest, with corresponding entities inwhat we call the angel or deva kingdom.2. The Hierarchy of Rays—certain groupings of the seven rays in relation to ourplanet.3. A Hierarchy of Lives, gathered by an evolutionary process out of ourplanetary evolution and from four other planets, who embody in themselves thepurpose and plan of the solar Logos in relation to the five planets involved.In narrowing the concept down to the microcosm, the ego or soul acts verily asthe middle principle connecting [48] the Hierarchy of Monads with outerdiversified forms which they use sequentially in the process of:a. Gaining certain experiences, resulting in acquired attributes.b. Working out certain effects, initiated in an earlier system.c. Cooperating in the plan of the solar Logos in relation to His (if one may usea pronoun in speaking of a life which is an existence and yet is an extendedconcept) Karma—a point oft overlooked. This Karma of His must be worked outthrough the method of incarnation and the subsequent result of the incarnatedenergy upon the substance of the form. This is symbolised for us, if we couldbut grasp it, in the relation of the sun to the moon. “The Solar Lord with hiswarmth and light galvanises the moribund Lunar Lords into a spurious life. Thisis the great deception; and the Maya of His Presence.”—So runs the OldCommentary oft quoted by me in earlier books. The above concept has in it truthfor the individual soul likewise.This middle principle is in process of revelation now. The lower aspect isfunctioning. The higher remains unknown, but that which links them (and at thesame time reveals the nature of the higher) is on the verge of discovery. Thestructure, the mechanism, is now ready and developed to its point of usefulness;the vital life that can guide and motivate the machine is likewise present, andman now can intelligently use and control, not only the machine, but the activeprinciple.The great symbol of the soul in man is his vital or etheric body and for thefollowing reasons:1. It is the physical correspondence to the inner light body we call the soulbody, the spiritual body. It [49] is called the “golden bowl” in the Bible andis distinguished by:a. Its light quality.b. Its rate of vibration, which synchronises always with the development of thesoul.c. Its coherent force, linking and connecting every part of the body structure.2. It is the microcosmic “web of life” for it underlies every part of thephysical structure and has three purposes:a. To carry throughout the body the life principle, the energy which producesactivity. This it does through the medium of the blood, and the focal point forthis distribution is the heart. It is the conveyor of physical vitality.b. To enable the soul, or human yet spiritual man to be en rapport with hisenvironment. This is carried forward through the medium of the entire nervoussystem and the focal point of that activity is the brain. This is the seat ofconscious receptivity.c. To produce eventually, through life and consciousness, a radiant activity, ormanifestation of glory which will make of each human being a centre of activityfor the distribution of light and attractive energy to others in the humankingdom, and through the human kingdom, to the subhuman kingdoms. This is a partof the plan of the planetary Logos for the vitalising and renewing of thevibration of those forms which we designate subhuman.3. This microcosmic symbol of the soul not only underlies the entire physicalstructure and thus is a symbol of the anima mundi, or the world soul, but isindivisible, coherent and a unified entity, thereby symbolising the unity andhomogeneity [50] of God. There are no separated organisms in it, but it issimply a body of freely flowing force, that force being a blend or unificationof two types of energy in varying quantities, dynamic energy, and attractive ormagnetic energy. These two types characterise the universal soul likewise—theforce of will, and of love, or of atma and buddhi, and it is the play of thesetwo forces on matter that attracts to the etheric body of all forms the neededphysical atoms and that—having so attracted them—by the will force drives theminto certain activities.4. This coherent unified body of light and energy is the symbol of the soul inthat it has within it seven focal points, wherein the condensation, if it mustbe so called, of the two blended energies is intensified. These correspond tothe seven focal points in the solar system, wherein the Solar Logos, through theseven Planetary Logoi, focusses His energies. This will be later elaborated. Thepoint to be noted here is simply the symbolic nature of the etheric or vitalbody, for it is by understanding the nature of the energies displayed and theunified nature of the form and work that some idea as to the work of the soul,the middle principle in nature, can be grasped.5. The symbolism is also carried forward when one remembers that the ethericbody links the purely physical, or dense body with the purely subtle, the astralor emotional body. In this is seen the reflection of the soul in man which linksthe three worlds (corresponding to the solid, liquid and gaseous aspects of thestrictly physical body of man) to the higher planes in the solar system, linkingthus the mental to the buddhic and the mind to the intuitional states ofconsciousness."},{"pageContent":"RULE ONETHE SOLAR ANGEL COLLECTS HIMSELF, SCATTERS NOT HIS FORCE BUT, IN MEDITATIONDEEP, COMMUNICATES WITH HIS REFLECTION.SOME BASIC ASSUMPTIONS[53] We are entering upon a course of study wherein the entire tendency will beto throw the student back upon himself, and thus upon that larger self which hasonly, in most cases, made its presence felt at rare and highly emotionalintervals. When the self is known and not simply felt and, when the realisationis mental as well as sensory, then truly can the aspirant be prepared forinitiation.I would like to point out that I am basing my words upon certain basicassumptions, which for the sake of clarity, I want briefly to state.Firstly, that the student is sincere in his aspiration, and is determined to goforward no matter what may be the reaction of and upon the lower self. Onlythose who can clearly differentiate between the two aspects of their nature, thereal self and the illusory self, can work intelligently. This has been wellexpressed in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali .“Experience (of the pairs of opposites) comes from the inability of the soul todistinguish between the personal self, and the purusa (or spirit). The objectiveforms exist for the use and experience of the spiritual man. By meditation uponthis arises the intuitive perception of the spiritual man.” Book III.35.The forty-eighth Sutra in the same book gives a statement covering a later stageof this discriminative realisation. This discerning quality is fostered by are-collected attitude of mind, and by careful attention to the method of aconstant review of the life. [54]Secondly, I am acting upon the assumption that all have lived long enough andbattled sufficiently with deterrent forces of life to have enabled them todevelop a fairly true sense of values. I assume they are endeavouring to live asthose who know something of the true eternal values of the soul. They are not tobe kept back by any happenings to the personality or by the pressure of time andcircumstance, by age or physical disability. They have wisely learnt thatenthusiastic rushing forward and a violent energetic progress has its drawbacks,and that a steady, regular, persistent endeavour will carry them further in thelong run. Spasmodic spurts of effort and temporary pressure peter out intodisappointment and a weighty sense of failure. It is the tortoise and not thehare that arrives first at the goal, though both achieve eventually.Thirdly, I assume that those who set themselves seriously to benefit by theinstructions in this book are prepared to carry out the simple requirements, toread what is written thoughtfully, to attempt to organise their minds and adhereto their meditation work. The organising of the mind is an all-day affair, andthe application of the mind to the thing in hand throughout the dailyavocations, is the best way to make study and meditation periods fruitful andbring about fitness for the vocation of disciple.With these assumptions clearly understood, my words are for those who areseeking to measure up to the need for trained servers. I say not, you note,those who measure up. Intention and effort are considered by us of primeimportance, and are the two main requisites for all disciples, initiates andmasters, plus the power of persistence.In our consideration of these rules, I am not so much interested in theirapplication to the magical work itself as in training the magician, and indeveloping him from [55] the standpoint of his own character. Later we may getdown to the application of knowledge to the outer manifestation of world forces,but now our objective is something different; I seek to interest the minds andbrains (and therefore the lower self) of students in the higher self, therebykeying up their mental interest so that sufficient impetus is generated toenable them to go forward.Also, let it not be forgotten that once the magic of the soul is grasped by thepersonality, that soul steadily dominates and can be trusted to carry forwardthe training of the man to fruition, unhampered (as you necessarily are) bythoughts of time and space, and by an ignorance of the past career of the soulconcerned. It should always be borne in mind that, when dealing withindividuals, the work required is twofold:1. To teach them how to link up the personal lower self with the overshadowingsoul so that in the physical brain there is an assured consciousness as to thereality of that divine fact. This knowledge renders the hitherto assumed realityof the three worlds futile to attract and hold, and is the first step, out ofthe fourth, into the fifth kingdom.2. To give such practical instruction as will enable the aspirant to—a. Understand his own nature. This involves some knowledge of the teaching ofthe past as to the constitution of man and an appreciation of theinterpretations of modern Eastern and Western investigators.b. Control the forces of his own nature and learn something of the forces withwhich he is surrounded.c. Enable him so to unfold his latent powers that he can deal with his ownspecific problems, stand on his own feet, handle his own life, solve his [56]own difficulties and become so strong and poised in spirit that he forcesrecognition of his fitness to be recognized as a worker in the plan ofevolution, as a white magician, and as one of that band of consecrated discipleswhom we call the “hierarchy of our planet”.Students of these matters are therefore begged to extend their concept of thathierarchy of souls so that they include all the exoteric fields of human life(political, social, economic, and religious). They are begged not to narrow downthe concept as so many do, to only those who have brought their own littleparticular organisation into being, or to those who are working purely on thesubjective side of life, and along what are reoognised by the conservative asthe so-called religious or spiritual lines. All that tends to lift the status ofhumanity on any plane of manifestation is religious work and has a spiritualgoal, for matter is but spirit on the lowest plane, and spirit, we are told, isbut matter on the highest. All is spirit and these differentiations are but theproducts of the finite mind. Therefore, all workers and knowers of God in or outof fleshly bodies, and working in any field of divine manifestation form part ofthe planetary hierarchy and are integral units in that great cloud of witnesseswho are the “onlookers and observers”. They possess the power of spiritualinsight or perception as well as objective or physical vision.In studying Rule I we could summarize it simply yet profoundly under thefollowing words:—1. Egoic Communication.2. Cyclic Meditation.3. Coordination, or At-one-ment.The rules start off in A Treatise on Cosmic Fir e with a brief summary of theprocess and a statement as to the nature of the white magician.[57]I would like in this first consideration of our subject to enumerate briefly thefacts given in the commentary so as to demonstrate to the aspirant how much isgiven him for his consideration and helping if he knows how to read and ponderupon that which he reads. The brief exegesis of Rule I gives the followingstatements:1. The white magician is one who is in touch with his soul.2. He is receptive to and aware of the purpose and the plan of his soul.3. He is capable of receiving impressions from the realm of spirit and ofregistering them in his physical brain.4. It is stated also that white magic—a. Works from above downwards.b. Is the result of solar vibration, and therefore of egoic energy.c. Is not an effect of the vibration of the form side of life, being divorcedfrom emotion and mental impulse.5. The downflow of energy from the soul is the result ofa. Constant internal re-collectedness.b. Concentrated one-pointed communication by the soul with the mind and thebrain.c. Steady meditation upon the plan of evolution.6. The soul is, therefore, in deep meditation during the whole cycle of physicalincarnation, which is all that concerns the student here.7. This meditation is rhythmic and cyclic in nature as is all else in thecosmos. The soul breathes and its form lives thereby.8. When the communication between the soul and its instrument is conscious andsteady, the man becomes a white magician.9. Therefore workers in white magic are invariably, and through the very natureof things, advanced human beings, for it takes many cycles of lives to train amagician.10. The soul dominates its form through the medium of the sutratma or lifethread, and (through it) vitalises its triple instrument (mental, emotional andphysical) and thus sets up a communication with the [58] brain. Through thebrain, consciously controlled, the man is galvanised into intelligent activityon the physical plane.The above is a brief analysis of the first rule for magic and I would like tosuggest that in the future as the students meditate on the rules that they makesuch an analysis themselves. If they do this during their consideration of eachrule they will approach the whole matter with greater interest and knowledge.They will also save themselves much looking back and reference.It will be seen from a consideration of the above analysis that a very clearsummation is given and that the student is started in his study of magic with abrief understanding of the past situation, his equipment and the method ofapproach. Let us realize from the start the simplicity of the idea intended tobe conveyed by my remarks hitherto. Just as in the past the instrument and itsrelation to the outer world has been the paramount fact in the experience of thespiritual man, so now it is possible for a readjustment to take place whereinthe outstanding fact will be the spiritual man, the solar angel or soul. It willalso be realised that his relationship (through the form side) will be to theinner as well as the outer worlds. Man has included in his relation only theform side of the field of average human evolution.He has used it and has been dominated by it. He has also suffered from it andconsequently in time revolted, through utter satiety, from all that pertains tothe material world. Dissatisfaction, disgust, distaste, and a deep fatigue arecharacteristic very frequently of those who are on the verge of discipleship.For what is a disciple? He is one who seeks to learn a new rhythm, to enter anew field of experience, and to follow the steps of that advanced humanity whohave trodden ahead of him the path, leading from darkness to light, from theunreal to the real. He has tasted the joys of life in the [59] world of illusionand has learnt their powerlessness to satisfy and hold him. Now he is in a stateof transition between the new and the old states of being. He is vibratingbetween the condition of soul awareness and form awareness. He is “seeingdouble”.His spiritual perception grows slowly and surely as the brain becomes capable ofillumination from the soul, via the mind. As the intuition develops, the radiusof awareness grows and new fields of knowledge unfold.The first field of knowledge receiving illumination might be described ascomprising the totality of forms to be found in the three worlds of humanendeavour, etheric, astral and mental. The would-be disciple, through thisprocess, becomes aware of his lower nature and begins to realize the extent ofhis imprisonment and (as Patanjali puts it) “the modifications of the versatilepsychic nature.” The hindrances to achievement and the obstacles to progress arerevealed to him and his problem becomes specific. Frequently then he reaches theposition in which Arjuna found himself, confronted by enemies who are those ofhis own household, confused as to his duty and discouraged as he seeks tobalance himself between the pairs of opposites. His prayer then should be thefamous prayer of India, uttered by the heart, comprehended by the head, andsupplemented by an ardent life of service to humanity.“Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun,Hidden by a disk of golden light,That we may know the truth and do our whole dutyAs we journey to Thy sacred feet.”As he perseveres and struggles, surmounts his problems and brings his desiresand thoughts under control, the second field of knowledge is revealed—knowledgeof the self in the spiritual body, knowledge of the ego as it expresses itselfthrough the medium of the causal body, [60] the Karana Sarira, and awareness ofthat source of spiritual energy which is the motivating impulse behind the lowermanifestation. The “disk of golden light” is pierced; the true sun is seen; thepath is found and the aspirant struggles forward into ever clearer light.As the knowledge of the self and as the consciousness of that which the selfsees, hears, knows and contacts is stabilized, the Master is found; his group ofdisciples is contacted; the plan for the immediate share of work he must assumeis realized and gradually worked out on the physical plane. Thus the activity ofthe lower nature decreases, and the man little by little enters into consciouscontact with his Master and his group. But this follows upon the “lighting ofthe lamp”—the aligning of the lower and higher and the downflow of illuminationto the brain.It is essential that these points should be grasped and studied by all aspirantsso that they may take the needed steps and develop the desired awareness. Untilthis is done, the Master, no matter how willing He may be, is powerless, and cantake no steps to admit a man to His group and thus take him into His auricinfluence, making him an outpost of His consciousness. Every step of the way hasto be carried out by a man himself, and there is no short or easy road out ofdarkness into light.THE WAY OF THE DISCIPLEThe white magician is ever one who, through conscious alignment with his ego,with his “angel”, is receptive to his plans and purposes, and therefore capableof receiving the higher impression. We must remember that while magic works fromabove downwards, and is the result of solar vibration, and not the impulsesemanating from one or the other of the lunar pitris, the downflow of theimpressing energy from the solar pitri is the result of his internalrecollectedness, the indrawing of his [61] forces, prior to sending themconcentratedly to his shadow, man, and his steady meditation upon the purposeand the plan. It may be of use to the student if he here remembers that the ego(as well as the Logos) is in deep meditation during the whole cycle of physicalincarnation. This meditation is cyclic in nature, the pitri involved sending outto his “reflection” rhythmic streams of energy, which streams are recognised bythe man concerned as his “high impulses,” his dreams and aspirations. Therefore,it will be apparent why workers in white magic are ever advanced and spiritualmen, for the “reflection” is seldom responsive to the ego or the solar angeluntil many cycles of incarnation have transpired. The solar pitri communicateswith his “shadow” or reflection by means of the sutratma, which passes downthrough the bodies to a point of entrance in the physical brain, if I might soexpress it, but the man, as yet, cannot focus or see clearly in any direction.If he looks backward he can see only the fogs and miasmas of the planes ofillusion, and fails to be interested. If he looks forward he sees a distantlight which attracts him, but he cannot as yet see that which the light reveals.If he looks around, he sees but shifting forms and the cinematograph of the formside of life. If he looks within, he sees the shadows cast by the light, andbecomes aware of much impedimenta which must be discarded before the light hesees in the distance can be approached, and then enter within him. Then he canknow himself as light itself, and walk in that light and transmit it likewise toothers.It is perhaps well to remember that the stage of discipleship is in many waysthe most difficult part of the entire ladder of evolution. The solar angel isunceasingly in deep meditation. The impulses of energy, emanating from him areincreasing in vibratory rate and are becoming more and more powerful. The energyis [62] affecting more and more the forms through which the soul is seekingexpression, and endeavouring to control.This brings me to the consideration of the seventh point I made in my earlieranalysis of Rule I. I said, “The soul’s meditation is rhythmic and cyclic in itsnature as is all else in the cosmos. The soul breathes and its form livesthereby”. The rhythmic nature of the soul’s meditation must not be overlooked inthe life of the aspirant. There is an ebb and flow in all nature, and in thetides of the ocean we have a wonderful picturing of an eternal law. As theaspirant adjusts himself to the tides of the soul life he begins to realise thatthere is ever a flowing in, a vitalising and a stimulating which is followed bya flowing out as sure and as inevitable as the immutable laws of force. This ebband flow can be seen functioning in the processes of death and incarnation. Itcan be seen also over the entire process of a man’s lives, for some lives can beseen to be apparently static and uneventful, slow and inert from the angle ofthe soul’s experience, whilst others are vibrant, full of experience and ofgrowth. This should be remembered by all of you who are workers when you areseeking to help others to live rightly. Are they on the ebb or are they beingsubjected to the flow of the soul energy? Are they passing through a period oftemporary quiescence, preparatory to greater impulse and effort, so that thework to be done must be that of strengthening and stabilising in order to enablethem to “stand in spiritual being”, or are they being subjected to a cyclicinflow of forces? In this case the worker must seek to aid in the direction andutilisation of the energy which (if misdirected) will eventuate in wrecked livesbut which when wisely utilised will produce a full and fruitful service.The above thoughts can also be applied by the student of humanity to the greatracial cycles and much of interest will be discovered. Again, and of more vitalimportance [63] to us, these cyclic impulses in the life of the disciple are ofa greater frequency and speed and forcefulness than in the life of the averageman. They alternate with a distressing rapidity. The hill and valley experienceof the mystic is but one way of expressing this ebb and flow. Sometimes thedisciple is walking in the sunlight and at other times in the dark; sometimes heknows the joy of full communion and again all seems dull and sterile; hisservice is on occasion a fruitful and satisfying experience and he seems to beable to really aid; at other times he feels that he has naught to offer and hisservice is arid and apparently without results. All is clear to him some daysand he seems to stand on the mountain top looking out over a sunlit landscape,where all is clear to his vision. He knows and feels himself to be a son of God.Later, however, the clouds seem to descend and he is sure of nothing, and seemsto know nothing. He walks in the sunlight and is almost overpowered by thebrilliance and heat of the solar rays, and wonders how long this unevenexperience and the violent alternation of these opposites is to go on.Once however that he grasps the fact he is watching the effect of the cyclicimpulses and the effect of the soul’s meditation upon his form nature, themeaning becomes clearer and he realises that it is that form aspect which isfailing in its response, and re-acting to energy with unevenness. He then learnsthat once he can live in the soul consciousness and attain that ‘high altitude’(if I might so express it) at will, the fluctuations of the form life will nottouch him. He then perceives the narrow-edged razor path which leads from theplane of physical life to the soul realm, and finds that when he can tread itwith steadiness it leads him out of the ever changing world of the senses intothe clear light of day and into the world of reality.The form side of life then becomes to him simply a [64] field for service andnot a field of sensuous perception. Let the student ponder upon this lastsentence. Let him aim to live as a soul. Then the cyclic impulses, emanatingfrom the soul, are known to be impulses for which he himself is responsible andwhich he has sent forth; he then knows himself to be the initiating cause and isnot subject to the effects.Looked at from another angle we get two factors, the breath and the form whichthe breath energises and drives into activity. Upon careful study, it becomesapparent that we have, for aeons of time, identified ourselves with the form; wehave emphasised the effects of the imparted activity but have not understood thenature of the breath, nor known the nature of the One who breathes. Now in ourwork we are concerning ourselves with that One Who, breathing rhythmically, willdrive the form into right action and right control. This is our objective andour goal. A right understanding is necessary nevertheless if we are toappreciate intelligently our task and its effects.Much more could be said on this rule but enough has been here given for theaverage applicant to discipleship to consider and upon which to base action.Most of us are average, are we not? If we regard ourselves otherwise, we divorceourselves from others and become guilty of the sin of separateness—the one realsin.An appreciation of the above thoughts should build in the aspirant a realisationof the value of his meditation work, whilst the idea of a cyclic response tosoul impulse lies back of the activities of a morning meditation, a noondayrecollection, and an evening review. A larger ebb and flow is also indicated inthe two aspects of the full moon and the new moon. Let this be borne in mind.May there be a full and steady play of cyclic force from the kingdom of spiritupon each one of us calling us forth into the realm of light, love and serviceand producing [65] a cyclic response from each one! May there be a constantinterchange between those who teach and the disciple who seeks instruction!Much preliminary work will have to be done. The disciple on the physical planeand the inner teacher (whether one of the Great Ones or the “Master within theHeart”) need to know each other somewhat, and to accustom themselves to eachother’s vibration. Teachers on the inner planes have much to contend with owingto the slowness of the mental processes of students in physical bodies. Butconfidence and trust will set up the right vibration which will produceeventually accurate work. Lack of faith, of calmness, of application, and thepresence of emotional unrest will hinder. Long patience those on the inner sideneed in dealing with all who must, for lack of other and better material, beutilized. Some physical injudiciousness may make the physical bodynon-receptive; some worry or care may cause the astral body to vibrate to arhythm impossible for the right reception of the inner purpose; some prejudice,some criticism, some pride, may be present that will make the mental vehicle ofno use. Aspirants to this difficult work must watch themselves with infinitecare, and keep the inner serenity and peace and a mental pliability that willtend to make them of some use in the guarding and guiding of humanity.The following rules might therefore be given:1. It is essential that there should be an endeavor to arrive at absolute purityof motive.2. The ability to enter the silence of the high places will follow next. Thestilling of the mind depends upon the law of rhythm. If you are vibrating inmany directions and registering thoughts from all sides, this law will be unableto touch you. Balance and poise must be restored before equilibrium can bereached. The law of vibration and the study of atomic substance are closely [66]intertwined. When more is known about these atoms and their action, reaction andinter-action, then people will control their bodies scientifically,synchronizing the laws of vibration and of rhythm. They are the same and yetunlike. They are phases of the law of gravitation. The earth is itself an entitywhich, by the force of will, holds all things to itself. This is an obscurematter, little has been learned about it as yet. The inbreathing andoutbreathing of the entity of the earth affects vibration potently,—that is thevibration of the physical plane matter. There is a connection also between thisand the moon. Those members of humanity who are specially under lunar influencerespond to this attraction more than any others, and they are difficult to useas transmitters. The silence that comes from the inner calm is the one tocultivate. Aspirants are urged to remember that the time will come when they toowill form part of the group of teachers on the inner side of the veil. If thenthey have not learnt the silence that comes from strength and from knowledge,how will they bear the apparent lack of communication that they will then findexists between them and those on the outer side? Learn therefore, how to keepquiet or usefulness will be hampered by astral fretfulness when on the otherside of death.3. Remember always that lack of calm in the daily life prevents the teachers onegoic levels from reaching you. Endeavor therefore to remain quiescent as lifeunrolls, work, toil, strive, aspire, and hold the inner calm. Withdraw steadilyinto interior work and so cultivate a responsiveness with the higher planes. Aperfect steadiness of inner poise is what the Masters need in those whom Theyseek to use. It is an inner poise that holds to the vision yet does its outerwork on the physical plane with a concentrated physical brain attention which isin no way deviated by the inner receptiveness. It involves a dual activity. [67]4. Learn to control thought. It is necessary to guard what you think. These aredays when the race as a whole is becoming sensitive and telepathic andresponsive to thought interplay. The time is approaching when thought willbecome public property, and others will sense what you think. Thought has,therefore, to be carefully guarded. Those who are contacting the higher truthsand becoming sensitive to the Universal Mind must protect some of theirknowledge from the intrusion of other minds. Aspirants must learn to inhibitcertain thoughts, and prevent certain knowledge from leaking out into the publicconsciousness when in contact with their fellow men.It is of course of vital interest to appreciate the significance of the words“scatters not his force.” There are so many lines of activity into which thesoul-inspired disciple may throw himself. Assurance as to varying lines ofactivity is not easy to reach and every aspirant knows perplexity. Let us putthe problem in the form of a question, relegating it to the plane of every-dayendeavour, as we are not yet in a position to comprehend in what way a soul can“scatter its forces” on the higher planes.What is the criterion whereby a man may know which out of several lines ofactivity is the right line to take? Is there, in other words, a revealingsomething which will enable a man unerringly to choose the right action and gothe right way? The question has no reference to a choice existing between thepath of spiritual endeavour and the way of the man of the world. It refers toright action when faced with a choice.There is no question but that a man is faced, in his progress, with increasinglysubtle distinctions. The crude discrimination between right and wrong whichoccupies the child soul is succeeded by the finer distinctions of right, or ofmore right, of high, or higher, and the [68] moral or spiritual values have tobe faced with the most meticulous spiritual perception. In the stress and toilof life and in the constant pressure on each one from those who constitute theirgroup, the complexity of the problem is very great.In solving such problems, certain broad discriminations can precede the moresubtle and when these decisions have been made the more subtle can then taketheir place. The choice between selfish and unselfish action is the most obviousone to follow upon the choice between right and wrong, and is easily settled bythe honest soul. A choice which involves discrimination between individualbenefit and group responsibility rapidly eliminates other factors, and is easyto the man who shoulders his just responsibility. Note the use of the words“just responsibility.” We are considering the normal, sane man and not theover-conscientious morbid fanatic. There follows next the distinction betweenthe expedient, involving factors of physical plane relations of business and offinance, leading up to a consideration of the highest good for all partiesconcerned. But having through this triple eliminative process arrived at acertain position, cases arise where choice still remains in which neither commonsense nor logical, discerning reason seem to help. The desire is only to do theright thing; the intent is to act in the highest possible way and to take thatline of action which will produce the best good of the group apart from personalconsiderations altogether. Yet light upon the path, which must be trodden, isnot seen; the door which should be entered is unrecognized and the man remainsin the state of constant indecision. What, then, must be done? One of twothings:First the aspirant can follow his inclination and choose that line of action outof the residue of possible lines which seems to him the wisest and the best.This involves belief in the working of the law of Karma and also [69] ademonstration of that firm decisiveness which is the best way in which hispersonality can learn to abide by the decisions of his own soul. It involvesalso the ability to go forward upon the grounds of the decision made, and so toabide by the results without forebodings or regrets.Secondly, he can wait, resting back upon an inner sense of direction, knowingthat in due time he will ascertain, through the closing of all doors but one,which is the way he should go. For there is only one open door through whichsuch a man can go. Intuition is needed for its recognition. In the first casemistakes may be made, and the man thereby learns and is enriched; in the secondcase, mistakes are impossible and only right action can be taken.It is obvious, therefore, that all resolves itself into an understanding ofone’s place upon the ladder of evolution. Only the highly advanced man can knowthe times and seasons and can adequately discern the subtle distinction betweena psychic inclination and the intuition.In considering these two ways of ultimate decision let not the man who shoulduse his common sense and take a line of action based upon the use of theconcrete mind, practice the higher method of waiting for a door to open. He isexpecting too much in the place where he is. He has to learn through rightdecision and right use of the mind to solve his problems. Through this method hewill grow, for the roots of intuitive knowledge are laid deep within the souland the soul, therefore, must be contacted before the intuition can work. Onehint only can here be given:—the intuition ever concerns itself with groupactivity and not with petty personal affairs. If you are still a man centered inthe personality, recognize it, and with the equipment available, govern youractions. If you know yourself to be functioning as a soul and are lost in theinterest of others, untrammeled by selfish desire, then [70] your justobligation will be met, your responsibilities shouldered, your group workcarried forward, and the way will unfold before you, whilst you do the nextthing and fulfill the nest duty. Out of duty, perfectly performed, will emergethose larger duties which we call world work; out of the carrying of familyresponsibilities will come that strengthening of our shoulders which will enableus to carry those of the larger group. What, then, is the criterion?For the high grade aspirant, let me repeat, the choice of action depends upon asound use of the lower mind, the employment of a sane common-sense and theforgetfulness of selfish comfort and personal ambition. This leads to thefulfilment of duty. For the disciple there will be the automatic and necessarycarrying forward of all the above, plus the use of the intuition which willreveal the moment when wider group responsibilities can be justly shouldered andcarried simultaneously with those of the smaller group. Ponder on this. Theintuition reveals not the way ambition can be fed, nor the manner in whichdesire for selfish advancement can be gratified."},{"pageContent":"RULE TWOWHEN THE SHADOW HATH RESPONDED, IN MEDITATION DEEP THE WORK PROCEEDETH. THELOWER LIGHT IS THROWN UPWARD; THE GREATER LIGHT ILLUMINATES THE THREE, AND THEWORK OF THE FOUR PROCEEDETH.HINDRANCES TO OCCULT STUDY[73] This rule is one of the most difficult in the book and yet one of the mostcomprehensive. It will take us some time rightly to handle it. We have in it aninteresting illustration of the microcosmic correspondence to the macrocosm. Itcan be elucidated in two ways in relation to the light it mentions.Reference is made to the “greater light” which illuminates the three and,secondly, to the throwing upward of the “lower light”.The “greater light” is that of the soul, who is light itself illuminating themanifestation of the three-fold personality. Herein lies the correspondence tothe macrocosm as it is symbolized for us in God, the manifesting light of thesolar system. The solar system is three in one, or one in three, and the lightof the Logos illuminates the whole. The “lower light” is that which is hiddenwithin the human being on the physical plane. This light, at a certain stage ofman’s experience, is awakened throughout the physical body and blends eventuallywith the “greater light”. The light and life of God Himself may emanate from thecentral Spiritual Sun, but it is only as the light within the solar systemitself is awakened and aroused that there will come that eventual blazing forthwhich will typify the glory of the Sun shining in its strength. Similarly, thelight of the soul may emanate from the Monad, but it is only as the light withinthe little system (directed by the soul) is awakened and aroused that there willcome the eventual shining forth of a son of God.[74] In these instructions, however, we are dealing primarily with the microcosmand the light within it; we shall not enlarge upon the macrocosmic analogies.In considering this second rule, we must note that a conscious relation has beenestablished between the soul and its shadow, the man on the physical plane. Bothhave been meditating. Students would do well to note this and to remember thatone of the objectives of the daily meditation is to enable the brain and mind tovibrate in unison with the soul as it seeks “in meditation deep” to communicatewith its reflection.The correspondence to this relation, or synchronizing vibration is interesting:Soul......................Man on the Physical PlaneMind.....................BrainPineal Gland.........Pituitary BodyThe relation also between the centers, and their synchronization is interestingand in it is epitomized the evolution of the race as well as the racial unit,man.Head Center...........Base of the SpineHeart Center...........Solar PlexusThroat Center..........Sacral CenterIn the above lies a hint for the more advanced student (and he is the one whohesitates so to regard himself). It is also symbolized for us in the relationbetween the Eastern and the Western hemispheres and between those great bodiesof truth which we call Religion and Science.The life of meditation proceeds and the rapport between the soul and its tripleinstrument becomes steadily closer, and the resulting vibration more powerful.How many lives this will take depends upon various factors, which are toonumerous to be mentioned here but which the student will find it useful toconsider. Let him list the factors which he feels he needs to take into accountas he seeks to decide his evolutionary standpoint. [75]The result of this response is a reorientation of the lower man in order toproduce a synthesis of the Three and the One so that the work of the Four mayproceed. Here you have the reflection consummated in the microcosm of that withwhich the Solar Logos started, the “Sacred Four” of the Cosmos; man in his turnbecomes a “Sacred Four”—spirit and the three of manifestation.Four words should be pondered upon here:1. Communication2. Response3. Reorientation4.UnionThe Old Commentary expresses it in the following terms:“When communion is established, words are forthwith used, and mantric lawassumes its rightful place, provided that the One communicates the words and thethree remain in silence.“When response is recognized as emanating from the three, the One, in silence,listens. The roles are changed. A three-fold word issues from out the tripleform. A turning round is caused. The eyes no longer look upon the world of form;they turn within, focus the light, and see, revealed, an inner world of being.With this the Manas stills itself, for eyes and mind are one.“The heart no longer beats in tune with low desire, nor wastes its love upon thethings that group and hide the Real. It beats with rhythm new; it pours its loveupon the Real, and Maya fades away. Kama and heart are close allied; love anddesire form one whole—one seen at night, the other in the light of day . . . .. . . . . . .“When fire and love and mind submit themselves, sounding the three-fold word,there comes response.“The One enunciates a word which drowns the triple sound. God speaks. Aquivering and a shaking in the form responds. The new stands forth, a manremade; the form rebuilt; the house prepared. The fires unite, and [76] greatthe light that shines: the three merge with the One and through the blaze afour-fold fire is seen.”In this pictorial writing which I have sought to convey in modern English, thesages of old embodied an idea. The Old Commentary from which these words aretaken has no assignable date. Should I endeavor to tell you its age I have nomeans of proving the truth of my words and hence would be faced with credulity—athing aspirants must avoid in their search for the essential and Real. I havesought in the above few phrases to give the gist of what is expressed in theCommentary, through the means of a few symbols and a cryptic text. These oldScriptures are not read in the way modern students read books. They are seen,touched and realized. The meaning is disclosed in a flash. Let meillustrate:—The words “the One enunciates the word which drowns the triplesound” are depicted by a shaft of light ending in a symbolic word in goldsuperimposed over three symbols in black, rose and green. Thus are the secretsguarded with care.I felt it might be of interest to students to know this much about this ancienttest book of the Adepts.Our consideration of this rule will fall into two parts:The relation between the soul and the personality. This will be handledparticularly with reference to meditation in the daily life, more than from thetheoretical and the academical.The significance of the words, “the lower light is thrown upward.” These dealwith the centers and the Kundalini Fire.I would like here to point out the advisability of each student arriving at anunderstanding of his etheric body, and this for certain reasons.First, the etheric body is the next aspect of the world substance to be studiedby scientists and investigators. This time will be hastened if thinking men andwomen [77] can formulate intelligent ideas anent this interesting subject. Wecan aid in the revelation of the truth by our clear thinking and from thestandpoint of the present pronouncements about the ether, scientists willeventually arrive at an understanding of etheric forms or bodies.Secondly, the etheric body is composed of force currents, and in it are vitalcenters linked by lines of force with each other and with the nervous system ofthe physical man. Through these lines of force, it is connected also with theetheric body of the environing system. Note that in this lies the basis for abelief in immortality, for the law of brotherhood or unity and for astrologicaltruth.Thirdly, the need of realizing that the etheric body is vitalized and controlledby thought and can (through thought) be brought into full functioning activity.This is done by right thinking and not by breathing exercises and holding thenose. When this is grasped, much dangerous practice will be avoided and peoplewill come into a normal and safe control of that most potent instrument, thevital body. That this end may rapidly be consummated is my earnest wish.Occult study is of profound importance, and students of these sciences mustbring to bear upon them, all that they have of mental application andconcentrated attention. It involves also the steady working out of the truthslearnt.Occult study, as understood in the Occident, is intellectually investigated butnot practically followed. Theoretically some glimmering of light may beappreciated by the man who aspires to the occult path, but the systematicworking out of the laws involved has made small progress as yet.Wherein lies the hindrance? It may be of value if we study three things: [78]1. The Occidental hindrances to correct occult study.2. How these hindrances may be surmounted.3. Certain things the aspirant may safely undertake in the equipping of himselffor treading the occult path, for that is the stage, and for the majority, theonly stage at present possible.One of the main hindrances to the correct apprehension of the laws of occultismand their practical application lies in the fact of the comparative newness ofthe occident, and the rapid changes which have been the outstanding feature ofEuropean and American civilisation. The history of Europe dates back a barethree thousand years, and that of America, as we know, barely as many centuries.Occultism flourishes in a prepared atmosphere, in a highly magnetisedenvironment, and in a settled condition which is the result of age-long workupon the mental plane.This is one reason why India provides such an adequate school of endeavour.There knowledge of occultism dates back tens of thousands of years and time hasset its mark even upon the physique of the people, providing them with bodieswhich offer not that resistance which occidental bodies so oft afford. Theenvironment has been long permeated with the strong vibrations of the great Oneswho reside within its borders and who, in Their passage to and fro, and throughTheir proximity, continuously magnetise the environing ether. This in itselfaffords another line of least resistance, for this etheric magnetisation affectsthe etheric bodies of the contacted population. These two facts, of time and ofhigh vibration, result in that stability of rhythm which facilitates occultwork, and offer a quiet field for mantric and ceremonial enterprise.These conditions are not to be found in the West, where constant change in everybranch of life is found, where [79] frequent rapid shifting of the scene ofaction causes wide areas of disturbance which militate against any work of amagic nature. The amount of force required to effect certain results does notwarrant their use, and time has been allowed to elapse in an effort to producean equilibrising effect.The climax of the disturbed condition has been passed, and a more stable stateof affairs is gradually being brought about, and this may permit of definiteoccult work being attempted with success. The Master R. is working upon thisproblem, and likewise the Master of the English race,—not the Master whooccupies Himself with the Labour Movement or the betterment of socialconditions. They are aided by a disciple of rare capability in Sweden, and by aninitiate in the southern part of Russia, who works much on the mental levels.Their aim is so to tap the resources of force stored up by the Nirmanakayas thatits downflow may sweep out lower grade matter, and thus permit the free play ofa higher vibration.Another hindrance may be found in the strong development of the concrete mind. Iwould here impress upon you that this development must in no way be considered adetriment. All has been in due course of evolution, and later when the Orientand the Occident have reached a point of better understanding and interplaytheir interaction will be of mutual benefit; the East will profit from themental stimulation afforded by the strong mental vibration of its Westernbrother, whilst the Occidental will gain much from the abstract reasoning of theOriental, and, through the effort to grasp that which the first subrace of theAryan root race so easily apprehended, he will contact his higher mind, and thusbuild with greater facility the bridge between the higher and the lower mind.The two types need each other, and their effect upon each other tends toeventual synthesis. [80]The concrete mind, in itself, offers opportunity for a treatise of great length,but here it will suffice to point out a few of the ways in which it hindersthose races who so paramountly represent it.a. By its intense activity and stimulated action it hinders the downflow ofinspiration from on high. It acts as a dark curtain that shuts out the higherillumination. Only through steadiness and a stable restfulness can thatillumination percolate, via the higher bodies, to the physical brain and so beavailable for practical service.b. The wisdom of the Triad exists for the use of the personality, but is barredby the disquisitions of the lower mind. When the fire of mind burns toofiercely, it forms a current which counteracts the higher downflow, and forcesthe lower fire back into seclusion. Only when the three fires meet, through theregulation of the middle fire of mind, can a full light be achieved, and thewhole body be full of light, the fire from above—the triadal light—the fire ofthe lower self,—kundalini—and the fire of mind,—cosmic manas—must meet upon thealtar. In their union comes the burning away of all that hinders and thecompleted emancipation.c. By discrimination—a faculty of the concrete mental body—the lower bodies aretrained in the art of distinguishing illusion from the centre of reality, thereal from the unreal, the self from the not-self. Then ensues, consequently, aperiod that must be surmounted wherein the attention of the Ego is centrednecessarily on the lower self and its vehicles, and wherein, therefore, thevibrations of the Triad, the laws that deal with macrocosmic evolution, and thesubjugation of fire for the use of the [81] Divine, have temporarily to be inabeyance. When man quickly sees the truth in all that he contacts, andautomatically chooses truth or the real, then he learns next the lesson ofjoyful action, and the path of bliss opens before him. When this is so, the pathof occultism becomes possible for him, for the concrete mind has served itspurpose, and has become his instrument and not his master, his interpreter andnot his hinderer.d. The concrete mind hinders in another and more unusual way, and one that isnot realised by the student who attempts, at first, to tread the thorny road ofoccult development. When the concrete mind is rampant, and dominates the entirepersonality the aspirant cannot cooperate with these other lives and diverseevolutions until love supersedes concrete mind (even though he may, in theory,comprehend the laws that govern the evolution of the Logoic plan and thedevelopment of other solar entities besides his own Hierarchy). Mind separates;love attracts. Mind creates a barrier betwixt a man and every suppliant deva.Love breaks down every barrier, and fuses diverse groups in union. Mind repelsby a powerful, strong vibration, casting off all that is contacted, as a wheelcasts off all that hinders its whirling periphery. Love gathers all to itself,and carries all on with itself, welding separated units into a unifiedhomogeneous whole. Mind repels through its own abundant heat, scorching andburning aught that approaches it. Love soothes and heals by the similarity ofits heat to the heat in that which it contacts, and blends its warmth and flamewith the warmth and flame of other evolving lives. Finally, mind disrupts anddestroys whilst love produces coherence and heals. [82]Every change, in human life, is subject to immutable laws, if such a paradoxicalstatement may be permitted. In the attempt to find out those laws, in order toconform to them, the occultist begins to offset karma, and thus colours not theastral light. The only method whereby these laws can as yet be apprehended bythe many who are interested is by a close study of the vicissitudes of dailyexistence, as spread over a long period of years. By the outstanding features ofa cycle of ten years, for instance, as they are contrasted with the preceding orsucceeding similar period a student can approximate the trend of affairs andguide himself thereby. When the point in evolution is reached where the studentcan contrast preceding lives, and gain knowledge of the basic colouring of hisprevious life cycle, then rapid progress in adjusting the life to law is made.When succeeding lives can be likewise apprehended by the student, and theircolouring seen and known, then karma (as known in the three worlds) ceases, andthe adept stands master of all causes and effects as they condition and regulatehis lower vehicle.He aspires to the occult path and considers changes and events in the light ofall preceding events, and the longer and more accurate his memory the more hecan dominate all possible situations.Thus two of the hindrances will be found to be:a. The comparative newness and change which is characteristic of the Occident.b. The development of the concrete mind.Our third hindrance grows out of the preceding one. It consists of the emphasisthat has been laid in the West upon the material side of things. This hasresulted in a three-fold condition of affairs. First, the world of spirit, orthe formless abstract world of subjective consciousness is not recognised in ascientific sense. It is recognised [83] innately by those of mystic temperament,and by those who are able to study the subjective history of men and races, butscience recognises not this aspect of manifestation, nor do scientific men, as awhole, believe in a world of super-physical endeavour. All that in the earlierraces held paramount place in the lives and thought of the peoples is nowapproached sceptically, and discussions are preceded by a question mark. Butprogress has been made and much has arisen out of the war. The question, forinstance, is rapidly changing from the formula “Is there a life after death?” tothe enquiry “Of what nature is the future life?” and this is a portent of muchencouragement.Secondly, the masses of the people are suffering from suppression and from theeffects of inhibition. Science has said, There is no God and no spirit withinman. Religion has said, There must be a God, but where may He be found? Themasses say, We desire not a God constructed by the brains of theologians.Therefore the true inner comprehension finds no room for expansion, and theactivity that should be finding its legitimate expression in the higheraspiration, turns itself to the deification of things,—things pertaining toflesh, connected with the emotions, or having a relation to the mind. The war,again, has accomplished much by relegating things to their just position, and,by the removal of possessions, many have learnt the value of essentials, and thenecessity of eliminating that which is superfluous.A third condition of affairs grows out of the above two. A right apprehension ofthe future does not exist. When the life of the spirit is negated, when themanifesting life concentrates itself on things concrete and apparent then thetrue goal of existence disappears, the true incentive to right living is lost,and the sarcastic words of the initiate, Paul, “Let us eat and drink fortomorrow we die” characterise the attitude of the majority of men. [84]Men deaden the inner voice that bears witness to the life hereafter, and theydrown the words that echo in the silence by the noise and whirl of business,pleasure and excitement.The whole secret of success in treading the occult path depends upon an attitudeof mind; when the attitude is one of concrete materialism, of concentration uponform, and a desire for the things of the present moment, little progress can bemade in apprehending the higher esoteric truth.A fourth hindrance is found in the physical body, which has been built up by theaid of meat and fermented foods and drinks, and nurtured in an environment inwhich fresh air and sunlight are not paramount factors. I am here generalising,and speaking for the masses of men, and not for the would-be earnest occultstudent. For long centuries food that has been decomposing, and hence in acondition of fermentation, has been the basic food of the occidental races; andthe result can be seen in bodies unfitted for any strain such as occultismimposes, and which form a barrier to the clear shining forth of the life within.When fresh fruit and vegetables, clear water, nuts and grains, cooked anduncooked, form the sole diet of the evolving sons of men, then will be builtbodies fitted to be vehicles for highly evolved Egos. They patiently await theturning of the wheel, and the coming in of a cycle which will permit of theirfulfilling their destiny. The time is not yet, and the work of elimination andadjustment must be slow and tedious.THE OVERCOMING OF THE HINDRANCESCertain paramount realisations must precede this work of removing hindrances,and they might be enumerated as follows:a. A realisation that in obedience to the next duty and [85] adherence to thehighest known form of truth lies the path of further revelation.b. A realisation that dispassion is the great thing to cultivate, and that awillingness to undergo joyously any amount of temporary inconvenience, pain oragony, must be developed, having in view the future glory which will blot outthe clouds of the passing hour.c. A realisation that synthesis is the method whereby comprehension is attained,and that, by blending the pairs of opposites, the middle path is gained thatleads straight to the heart of the citadel.With these three things paramountly controlling his views on life, the studentmay hope, by strenuous endeavour, to overcome the four hindrances which we havetouched upon.In taking up our consideration of the second Rule we will deal first with therelation of the soul to the personality, primarily from the standpoint ofmeditation. We are dealing therefore with “the greater light” and will take uplater the “throwing upward of the lower light”. This is in line also with thelaw of occult knowledge that one begins with universals.It should be borne in mind that these rules are only for those whose personalityis coordinated and whose minds are gradually being brought under control. Theman therefore is utilising the lower mind, the reasoning mind, whilst the soulis utilising the higher or abstract mind. Both units are working with twoaspects of the universal principle of mind, and on this ground their relationbecomes possible. The man’s work with his mind is to render it negative andreceptive to the soul, and this is his positive occupation (note the use here ofthe word ‘positive’ in the attempt to make the mind receptive, for herein liesthe clue to right action). The soul’s work in [86] meditation is to make thepoint of that meditation so positive that the lower mind can be impressed, andso the lower man can be brought into line with the Eternal Plan.Thus, again, we have a relation established between a positive and a negativevibration, and the study of these relations carries much information to thestudent, and is part of the teaching given in preparation for the firstinitiation. A list of these related situations might here be given showing themin their progressive relation on the path of evolution.1. The relation between male and female physical bodies, called by man, the sexrelation, and deemed of such paramount importance at this time. In the vale ofillusion, the symbol oft engrosses attention and that which it represents isforgotten. In the solving of this relationship will come racial initiation, andit is with this that the race is now engrossed.2. The relation between the astral body and the physical, which, for themajority, is the control, by the positive astral nature, of the negativeautomatic physical. The physical body, the instrument of desire, is swayed andcontrolled by desire,—desire for physical life, and desire for the acquisitionof the tangible.3. The relation between the mind and the brain, which constitutes the problem ofthe more advanced men and races and of which the vast system of schools,colleges, and universities indicate the importance. Much progress in thisrelation has been made during the past fifty years, and the work of thepsychologists marks its highest point. When this is understood, the mind will beregarded as the positive factor and the other two aspects of the form naturewill respond receptively. They will be the automatons of the mind.4. The relation between the soul and the personality, which is the problemengrossing the attention of aspirants now, for they are the pioneers of thehuman family, the pathfinders into the world of the soul. With this [87]relation, the mystics and the occultists concern themselves.5. The relation between the centres below the diaphragm and those above, orbetween:a. The centre at the base of the spine and the thousand petalled lotus, the headcentre. In this the four petals of the basic centre become the many, or thequaternary is lost in the universal.b. The sacral centre and the throat. In this there comes a union between thetwelve Creative Hierarchies and the quaternary, and the secret of the sixteenpetals of the throat lotus is seen.c. The solar plexus centre and the heart, in which the ten of the perfect man inthis solar system is lost in the consummated twelve. As the twelve CreativeHierarchies (in their outer and creative aspect) are contacted by the man, whois the perfected quaternary from the standpoint of the form, so in the relationbetween the solar plexus and heart is the second aspect perfected; the love ofthe soul can express itself perfectly through the emotional nature.6. The relation between the two head centres, or between the centre between theeyebrows and the centre above the head. This relation is set up and stabilisedwhen soul and body are a functioning unit.7. The relation between the pineal gland and the pituitary body as a result ofthe above.8. The relation between the higher and the lower mind, involving steady andincreasing soul contact. The meditative attitude of the soul is duplicated inthe three bodies (or by the spiritual man) and the steady meditation of the soulgoes on also on its own plane. It is with this and with its effects that we areprimarily concerned in this rule.A later relationship, which in no way concerns us, is [88] set up after thethird initiation between the soul and the monad, and throughout the course ofcosmic evolution these relationships will emerge. The race as a whole is,however, only concerned with the setting up of a relation between soul and bodyand beyond this there is no need to go.As the man seeks to reach control of the mind, the soul in its turn becomes moreactively aggressive. The work of the solar Angel has hitherto been largely inits own world and concerned with its relation to spirit, and with this the man,working through his cycles on the physical plane, has had no concern. The mainexpenditure of energy by the soul has been general, and outward-going into thefifth kingdom. Now the solar Angel approaches a time of crisis and ofre-orientation. In the early history of humanity there was a great crisis whichwe call individualisation. At that time the solar Angels, in response to ademand or a pull from the race of animal-men (as a whole, note that), sent aportion of their energy, embodying the quality of mentalisation, to theseanimal-men. They fecundated, if I might so express it, the brain. Thus washumanity brought into being. This germ, however, carried within it two otherpotentialities, that of spiritual love and spiritual life. These must in duetime make their appearance.The flowering forth of the mind in men, which so distinguishes the present age,indicates to the solar Angel a second crisis, of which the first was but thesymbol. That for which the solar Angel exists is making its presence felt withinhumanity, and another strong pull is being exerted upon the solar Angel whichthis time will produce a second fecundation. This will give to man thosequalities which will enable him to transcend human limitations, and become apart of the fifth or spiritual Kingdom in nature. The first effort of the solarAngel turned animal-men into human beings; the second will [89] turn humanbeings into spiritual entities, plus the gains of experience in the humanfamily.For this the solar Angel, the soul, is organising itself and re-orienting itselfso that its power can be redirected into the world of men. Contact must be madeby the soul between the lower aspect of its triple nature and the aspect whichhas already found lodgment in the brain of man. Intelligent activity and lovewisdom must be united, and the union must take place on the physical plane. Inorder to do this the soul is entering into “meditation deep”, in union with allother souls who may have brought their instrument into a responsive state. Thisis the basic group meditation, and when a man achieves what the oriental bookscall “samadhi”, he has succeeded in participating, as a soul, in this groupmeditation, and enters upon that cycle of service which expresses itself throughthe planetary Hierarchy. The rational mind and the abstract mind function as aunit, and the motivating principle is love. The soul, expressing love andabstract intelligence, is at one with its expression on the physical planethrough the brain, and, when this is the case, the lower man has synchronisedhis meditation with that of the soul.This is the objective of our work. Let this not be forgotten, and let everyeffort be made to bring mind and brain into such a functioning condition that aman can slip out of his own meditation and (losing sight of his own thoughts)become the soul, the thinker in the kingdom of the soul.It is perhaps a new thought to some that the soul is organising itself foreffort, re-orienting its forces, and preparing for a fresh and powerful impulse,but so it is. All forms of life under the force of evolution pass frominitiation to initiation and the soul is not exempt from the process. Just asthe soul of animal-man became united with another divine principle, and sobrought into [90] being the fourth kingdom in nature, so the soul in humanity isseeking contact with another divine aspect. When that contact is made theKingdom of God will come on earth; the physical plane will thereby betransformed and that peculiar period, presented symbolically under the termmillennium, will come.The Knowers of God in that era will preponderate over those who are simplyaspiring to that knowledge, and their contact and the results of the force theytransmit will be felt in all the kingdoms of nature. Dominion over all forms,and the power to act as transmitters of that spiritual energy we call love isthe promised reward of the triumphant solar Angels, and the prized goal of theirmeditation work. The Sons of God will triumph on earth in full incarnatedexpression, and will bring light (therefore life) to all the manifested forms.This is the “life more abundant” of which the Christ speaks. This is theachievement of the true Nirvanee who, living in unbroken meditation in thespiritual realm yet can work on earth. The work of initiation is to enable a manto live ever at the centre, but to act as a distributor of divine energy in anydirection and—after the later initiations—in all directions.We will now, in our consideration of the next rule, take up the work of the“lesser light” of man on the physical plane. I, who have entered somewhat intoan understanding of the life of the solar Angel, seek to assure my fellowpilgrims that the passing things of the senses are but trivial, and of no valuecompared to the rewards, here and in this life, to the man who seeks to mergehis everyday consciousness with that of his own soul. He enters then into thecommunity of souls, and stands not alone. The only lonely periods are the resultof wrong orientation and the holding on to that which hides the vision, andfills the hands so full that they cannot grasp what has been called “the jewelin the lotus.”"},{"pageContent":"RULE THREETHE ENERGY CIRCULATES. THE POINT OF LIGHT, THE PRODUCT OF THE LABOURS OF THEFOUR, WAXETH AND GROWETH. THE MYRIADS GATHER ROUND ITA GLOWING WARMTH UNTIL ITSLIGHT RECEDES. ITS FIRE GROWS DIM. THEN SHALL THE SECOND SOUND GO FORTH.SOUL LIGHT AND BODY LIGHT[93] In these Rules for Magic, the laws of creative work are embodied and themeans whereby man can function as an incarnated soul. They do not deal primarilywith the rules governing man's development. Incidentally, of course, much may belearnt in this connection, for man grows through creative work andunderstanding, but this is not the primary objective of the teaching.Through the gradually growing synthesis of the meditation process carried on bythe soul on its own plane and that of the aspirant the man manifests (in thephysical brain) a point of light which has been occultly lighted on the plane ofthe mind. Light ever signifies two things, energy and its manifestation in formof some kind, for light and matter are synonymous terms. The thought of the manand the idea of the soul have found a point of rapport, and the germ of athought form has come into being. This thought form, when completed, will embodyas much of the great plan (on which the Hierarchy is working) as the man canvision, grasp, and embody on the mental plane. This, in the early stages of aman's aspiration, in his first steps along the Path of Discipleship, and for thefirst two initiations, is covered by the word “Service”. He grasps, gropingly atfirst, the idea of the unity of the Life, and its manifestation as theBrotherhood existing between all forms of that divine Life. This subjectiveideal gradually leads to an appreciation of the way in which this essentialrelationship can work out practically. This can be seen finding its expressionin the great humanitarian efforts, in the organisations [94] for the relief ofhuman and animal suffering, and in world wide efforts for the betterment of theinternal relations of nations, religions and groups.Enough human units have now contacted the hierarchical plan so that it may besafely concluded that the collective brain of the human family (that entitywhich we call the fourth Kingdom of Nature) is susceptible to the vision, andhas fashioned its lighted form on the mental plane. Later, the thought ofservice and of self will be found inadequate, and a more suitable form ofexpression will be found, but this suffices for the present.This thought form, created by the aspirant, is brought into being by thefocussed energies of the soul and the re-oriented forces of the personality.This is pictured as covering three stages.1. The period wherein the aspirant struggles to achieve that inner quiet anddirected attentiveness which will enable him to hear the Voice of the Silence.That voice expresses to him, through symbol and interpreted life experience thepurposes and plans with which he may cooperate. According to his stage ofdevelopment those plans will express either:a. The already materialized plans, taking group form on the physical plane, withwhich he may cooperate and in whose interest he may submerge his own.b. The plan, or fraction of a plan, which is his individual privilege to bringthrough into manifestation and thus cause to materialize as a group activity onthe physical plane. It is the function of some aspirants to aid and help thosegroups which are already in functioning activity. It is the function of othersto bring into being those forms of activity which are, as yet, on the subjectiveplane. Only those aspirants who are freed from personal [95] ambition can trulycooperate in this second aspect of the work. Therefore “Kill out ambition.”2. The period wherein he habituates himself to the clear hearing and correctinterpretation of the inner voice of the soul and broods reflectively upon theimparted message. During this period “the Energy circulates.” A constantrhythmic response to the thought energy of the soul is set up, and, figurativelyspeaking, there is a steady flow of force between that centre of energy we callthe soul on its own plane, and that centre of force which is a human being. Theenergy travels along the “thread” we call the sutratma and sets up a vibratoryresponse between the brain and the soul.An interesting angle of information might here be given, as it is my intent inthese Instructions ever to link up the analogies between the different aspectsof divinity, as they express themselves in man or in the macrocosm, the HeavenlyMan.The ancient yoga of Atlantean days (which has come down to us in the necessarilyfragmentary teaching of the yoga of the centres) conveys to us the informationthat the reflection of the sutratma in the human organism is called the spinalcord, and expresses itself in three nerve channels. These three are called ida,pingala, and the central channel, the sushumna. When the negative and positiveforces of the body, which express themselves via the ida and pingala nerveroutes, are equilibrized, the forces can ascend and descend by the centralchannel to and from the brain, passing through the centres up the spine withouthindrance. When this is the case we have perfected soul expression in thephysical man.This is in reality a correspondence to the sutratma as it links the physical manand the soul, for the sutratma in its turn expresses the positive energy ofspirit, the negative energy of matter, and the equilibrized energy [96] of thesoul—the attainment of equilibrium being the present objective of humanity.During the period of the later initiations, the positive use of the spiritualenergy supersedes the equilibrized use of soul force, but that is a later stagewith which the aspirant need not as yet trouble himself. Let him find the “noblemiddle Path” between the pairs of opposites, and incidentally he will find thatthe forces he uses on the physical plane will employ the central nerve channelup the spine. This will occur as the transmission of light and truth to thephysical brain, via the central channel of the linking sutratma, really worksout into satisfactory usefulness. Those ideas and concepts (speaking in symbol)which come via the sutratmic negative channel are well meaning, but lack forceand peter out into insignificance. They are emotionally coloured, and lack theorganized form which pure mind can give. Those which come via the oppositechannel (speaking figuratively) produce too rapid concretion, and are motivatedby the personal ambition of a ruling mentality. The mind is ever egoistic,self-seeking, and expresses that personal ambition which carries within it thegerm of its own destruction.When, however, the sutratmic sushumna, the central nerve channel and its energyis employed, the soul, as a magnetic intelligent creator, transmits itsenergies. The plans can then mature according to divine purpose and proceed withtheir building activities “in the light”. The point of egoic and lunar contactemits ever the point of light, as we have seen from our Rules for Magic, andthat has its focus at the point in the sutratma which has its correspondence inthe light in the head of the aspirant.3. The period wherein he sounds the sacred Word and—blending it with the voiceof the Ego or Soul—sets in motion mental matter for the building of his thoughtform. It is the man on the physical plane who now sounds the Word, and he doesit in four ways: [97]a. He becomes the Word incarnated, and endeavours “to be what he is.”b. He sounds the Word within himself, seeking to do it as the soul. Hevisualizes himself as the soul breathing out energy through the medium of thatWord through the entire system which his soul animates—his mental, emotional,vital, and physical instruments.c. He sounds the Word literally on the physical plane, thus affecting the threegrades of matter in his environment. All the time that he is thus occupied he is“holding the mind steady in the light”, and is keeping his consciousnessimmovably in the realm of the soul.d. Also he carries forward (and this is the most difficult stage) a parallelingactivity of a steady visualization of the thought form through which he hopes toexpress that aspect of the plan which he has contacted, and which he hopes tobring into active being through his own life and in his own environment.This is only truly possible when a steady rapport has been established betweenthe soul and the brain. The process involves the capacity of the brain toregister what the soul is visioning and becoming aware of in the Kingdom of theSoul. It involves also a paralleling activity in the mind, for the aspirant mustinterpret the vision and utilize the concrete intelligent faculty for the wiseadaptation of time and of form to the true expression of that which has beenlearnt. This is by no means an easy thing to do, but the aspirant has eventuallyto learn to express himself in full consciousness in more than one way and thatsimultaneously. He begins to learn a triple activity in this manner. This theOld Commentary expresses as follows:[98] The Solar Orb shines forth in radiant splendor. The illuminated mindreflects the solar glory. The lunar orb rises from the centre to the summit, andis transformed into a radiant sun of light. When these three suns are one,Brahma breaks forth. A lighted world is born.This literally means that when the soul (symbolized as the Solar Orb) the mind,and the light in the head form one unit, the creative power of the solar Angelcan express itself in the three worlds, and can construct a form through whichits energy can actively express itself. The lunar orb is a symbolic way ofexpressing the solar plexus which eventually must do two things:1. Blend and fuse the energies of the lower two centres of force, and2. Raise these fused energies and so, blending with the energies of the otherand higher centres, reach the head.All the above embodies a teaching and a theory. This has to be wrought out inthe practical experiment and experience and conscious activity of the aspirant.I would like also to point out the nature of the service humanity as a whole isrendering in the general plan of evolution. The rule under our considerationapplies not only to the individual man but to the predestined activity of thefourth Kingdom in Nature. Through his meditation, discipline and service, manfans into radiant light, illuminating the three worlds, that point of lightwhich flickered into being at the time of his individualization in past ages.This finds its reflection in the light in the head. Thus a rapport is set up,which permits not only of vibratory synchronization but of a radiation anddisplay of magnetic force, permitting of its recognition in the three worlds ofa man's immediate environment.So it is with the human kingdom. As its illumination increases, as its lightwaxes more potent, its effect upon [99] the sub-human kingdoms is analogous tothat of the individual soul, its reflection, upon man in physical incarnation. Isay analogous as a causative force, though not a correspondence in effects. Notethis difference. Humanity is macrocosmic in relation to the sub-human states ofconsciousness, and this H. P. B. has well pointed out. The effect upon theselesser and more material states is primarily four-fold.1. The stimulating of the spiritual aspect, expressing itself as the soul in allforms, such as the form of a mineral, a flower, or an animal. The positiveaspect of energy in all these forms will wax stronger, producing radiation, forinstance, increasingly in the mineral kingdom. In this lies a hint of the natureof the process that will set a term to our own planetary existence andeventually, to our solar system. In the vegetable kingdom, the effect will bethe demonstration of increased beauty and diversity, and the evolution of newspecies with an objective impossible to explain to those not yet initiate. Theproduction of nutritive forms which will serve the needs of the lesser devas andangels will be one of the results.In the animal kingdom the effect will be the elimination of pain and sufferingand a return to the ideal conditions of the Garden of Eden. When man functionsas a soul, he heals; he stimulates and vitalizes; he transmits the spiritualforces of the universe, and all harmful emanations and all destructive forcesfind in the human kingdom a barrier. Evil and its effects are largely dependentupon humanity for a functioning channel. Humanity's function is to transmit andhandle force. This is done in the early and ignorant stages destructively andwith harmful results. Later when acting under the influence of the soul, forceis rightly and wisely handled and good eventuates. True indeed it is that “thewhole creation travaileth in pain until now, waiting for the manifestation ofthe sons of God.” [100]2. The bringing of light. Humanity is the planetary light bearer, transmittingthe light of knowledge, of wisdom, and of understanding, and this in theesoteric sense. These three aspects of light carry three aspects of soul energyto the soul in all forms, through the medium of the anima mundi, the world soul.Physically speaking, this can be realized if we can appreciate the differencebetween our planetary illumination today and that of five hundred years ago—ourbrilliantly lit cities, our rural districts, shining through the night withtheir lighted streets and homes; our airways, outlined with their search-lightsand fields of blazing globes; our oceans, dotted with their lighted ships, andincreasingly our lighted airships will be seen, darting through the skies.These are but the result of man's growing illumination. His knowledge aspect oflight has brought this into being. Who shall say what will eventuate when thewisdom aspect predominates? When these are welded by understanding, the soulwill control in the three worlds and in all kingdoms of nature.3. The transmission of energy. The clue to the significance of this can begrasped as a concept, though as yet it will fail of comprehension, in therealization that the human kingdom acts upon and affects the three sub-humankingdoms. The downpouring spiritual Triangle and the upraising matter Trianglemeet point to point in humanity when the point of balance can be found. In man'sachievement and spiritualization is the hope of the world. Mankind itself is theworld Saviour, of which all world Saviours have been but the symbol and theguarantee.4. The blending of the deva or angel evolution and the human. This is a mysterywhich will be solved as man arrives at the consciousness of his own solar Angel,only to discover that that too is also but a form of life which, [101] havingserved its purpose, must be left behind. The angel or deva evolution is one ofthe great lines of force, contained in the divine expression and the solarAngels, the Agnishvattas of The Secret Doctrine and of A Treatise on Cosmic Firebelong—in their form aspect—to this line.Thus humanity serves, and in the development of a conscious aptitude forservice, in the growth of a conscious understanding of the individual part to beplayed in the working out of the plan and in the rendering of the personalitysubject to the soul, will come the steady progress of humanity towards its goalof world service.May I speak a word here so as to make this consummation a practical goal in yourlife? Harmful magnetic conditions, as the result of man's wrong handling offorce are the causes of evil in the world around us, including the threesub-human kingdoms. How can we, as individuals, change this? By the developmentin ourselves of Harmlessness. Therefore, study yourself from this angle. Studyyour daily conduct and words and thoughts so as to make them utterly harmless.Set yourself to think those thoughts about yourself and others which will beconstructive and positive, and hence harmless in their effects. Study youremotional effect on others so that by no mood, no depression, and no emotionalreaction can you harm a fellow-man. Remember in this connection, violentspiritual aspiration and enthusiasm, misplaced or misdirected, may quite easilyharm a fellow-man, so look not only at your wrong tendencies but at the use ofyour virtues.If harmlessness is the keynote of your life, you will do more to produce rightharmonious conditions in your personality than any amount of discipline alongother lines. The drastic purgation brought about by the attempt to be harmlesswill go far to eliminate wrong [102] states of consciousness. See to ittherefore, and bring this idea in your evening review.I would like to urge each one who reads these pages to make a fresh beginning inspiritual living. I would say to him, forget all past achievements, realizefervour, and concentrate upon the Plan.By this time some progress in group realization has surely been made, and lessinterest in the separated self has been gained. More faith in the Good Law whichguides all creation to ultimate perfection has been visioned without doubt, and,through this vision, has come the capacity to take one's eyes off the affairs ofindividual experience, and fasten them on the working out of the purpose for thewhole. This is the objective and the goal. Breadth of vision, inclusiveness ofunderstanding and a widened horizon are the preliminary essentials to all workunder the guidance of the hierarchy of adepts; the stabilizing of theconsciousness in the one life, and the recognition of the basic unity of allcreation has to be somewhat developed before any one can be trusted with certainknowledges and Words of Power and the manipulation of those forces which bringthe subjective reality into outer manifestation.Therefore, I say to you at this time, I—an older and perhaps more experienceddisciple and worker in the great vineyard of the Lord—practice harmlessness withzest and understanding, for it is (if truly carried out) the destroyer of alllimitation. Harmfulness is based on selfishness, and on an ego-centric attitude.It is the demonstration of forces concentrated for self-enforcement,self-aggrandisement, and self-gratification. Harmlessness is the expression ofthe life of the man who realizes himself to be everywhere, who lives consciouslyas a soul, whose nature is love, whose method is inclusiveness, and to whom allforms are alike in that they veil and hide the light, and are butexternalizations of [103] the one Infinite Being. This realization, let meremind you, will demonstrate in a true comprehension of a brother's need,divorced from sentiment and expediency. It will lead to that silence of thetongue which grows out of non-reference to the separate self. It will producethat instantaneous response to true need which characterizes the Great Ones who(passing beneath the outer appearance) see the inner cause which produces theconditions noted in the outer life, and so, from that point of wisdom, true helpand guidance can be given. Harmlessness brings about in the life caution injudgment, reticence in speech, ability to refrain from impulsive action, and thedemonstration of a non-critical spirit. So, free passage can be given to theforces of true love, and to those spiritual energies which seem to vitalize thepersonality, leading consequently to right action.Let harmlessness, therefore, be the keynote of your life. An evening reviewshould be carried forward entirely along this line; divide the review work inthree parts and consider:1. Harmlessness in thought. This will primarily result in the control of speech.2. Harmlessness in emotional reaction. This will result in being a channel forthe love aspect of the soul.3. Harmlessness in act. This will produce poise, skill in action and the releaseof the creative will.These three approaches to the subject should be studied from their effects uponone's own self and development, and from their effect upon those whom onecontacts and upon one's environing associates.May I interpolate here the remark that I make suggestions, based on experiencein occult work. There is no obligation to obey. We seek to train intelligentservers of the race, and these are developed by self-initiated [104] effort,freedom in action and discrimination in method and not by unquestioningobedience, negative acquiescence, and blind following. Let this not beforgotten. If any command may ever emanate from the subjective band of teachersof whom I am a humble member, let it be to follow the dictates of your own souland the promptings of your higher self.Before we proceed to an analysis of this Rule and of the previous one, for RulesII and III are the two halves of a whole, I would like to remind you that, inthis series of meditations upon these ancient formulas, we are concerned withthe magical work of the aspirant as a co-worker in the enterprises of the GreatWhite Lodge. We are dealing with the methods of white magic. Let me remind youalso, that the magical work of our planetary Hierarchy consists of tending thepsyche in the world of forms, so that the unfolding flower of the soul may benurtured and fostered in such wise that radiant glory, magnetic force and(ultimately) spiritual energy may be demonstrated through the medium of theform. Thus the power of the three Rays of divine Manifestation may be seen.First Ray . . . . . . . . . . . Spiritual EnergySecond Ray . . . . . . . . . Magnetic ForceThird Ray . . . . . . . . . . . Radiant GloryThese rays likewise find their microcosmic reflections in the aura of perfectedman.First Ray . . . Monadic . . . Spiritual Energy . . . Head CentreSecond Ray . Egoic . . . . . Magnetic Force . . . Heart CentreThird Ray . . Personality . .Radiant Glory . . . . Solar PlexusYou inquire, Why do I not say the throat centre? Because the centres below thediaphragm symbolize primarily the personal lower self, and in their synthesisingcentre, the solar plexus, express the magnetic force of the matter aspect inman. The throat centre is swept [105] into increasing creative activity as thepersonality vibrates to the soul.Let us now consider the words at the end of the previous rule: “The lower lightis thrown upward and the greater light illuminates the three; the work of thefour proceedeth.”What of this lower light? The student should remember that for the presentpurposes he has three bodies of light to consider:There is the radiant body of the soul itself, found on its own plane, andcalled, frequently, the Karana Sarira or the causal body.There is the vital or etheric body, the vehicle of prana which is the body ofgolden light, or rather the flame coloured vehicle.There is the body of “dark light”, which is the occult way of referring to thehidden light of the physical body, and to the light latent in the atom itself.These three types of energy are referred to in the Old Commentary under thefollowing symbolic terms:“When the radiant light of the Solar Angel is fused with the golden light of thecosmic intermediary, it awakens from darkness the rush light of anu, the speck.”The “cosmic intermediary” is the term given to the etheric body, which is partand parcel of the universal ether. It is through the etheric body that all theenergies flow, whether emanating from the soul, or from the sun, or from aplanet. Along those living lines of fiery essence pass all the contacts that donot emanate specifically from the tangible world.The dark light of the tiny atoms of which the physical vehicle is constructed isresponsive to the stimulation passing down from the soul into its vehicle, and,when the man is under control of the soul, there eventuates the shining forth ofthe light throughout the body. This [106] shows as the radiance emanating fromthe bodies of adepts and saints, giving the effect of bright and shining light.When the radiant light of the soul is blended with the magnetic light of thevital body, it stimulates the atoms of the physical body to such an extent thateach atom becomes in turn a tiny radiant centre. This only becomes possible whenthe head, heart, the solar plexus and the centre at the base of the spine areconnected in a peculiar fashion, which is one of the secrets of the firstinitiation. When these four are in close cooperation the “floor of the triangle”as it is symbolically called, is prepared for the magical work. In otherwords—these can be enumerated as follows:a. The physical material form with its centre at the base of the spine.b. The vital body working through the heart centre where the life principle hasits seat. The activities of the body which are due to this stimulation arecarried through the circulation of the blood.c. The emotional body, working through the solar plexus centre.d. The head centre, the direct agent of the soul and its interpreter, the mind.These four are in complete accord and alignment.When this is the case, the work of initiation and its interludes of activediscipleship become possible. Before this time the work cannot proceed. This isforeshadowed in the aspirant when there is enacted a symbolic happening in thelight in the head which is the forerunner of the later stage of initiation.In this stage, the soul light penetrates into the region of the pineal gland;there it produces an irradiation of the ethers of the head, of the vital airs;this produces a stimulation of the atoms of the brain so that their light [107]is fused and blended with the other two, the etheric light and the soul light,and there is then produced that inner radiant sun of which the aspirant becomesconscious in his physical brain experience. Frequently students speak of adiffused light or glow, this is the light of the physical plane atoms of whichthe brain is composed; later they may speak of seeing what appears to be like asun in the head. This is the contacting of the etheric light, plus the physicalatomic light. Later they become aware of an intensely bright electric light;this is the soul light, plus the etheric and the atomic. When that is seen, theyfrequently become aware of a dark centre within the radiant sun. This is theentrance to the Path disclosed by the “shining of the light upon the door.”Students must remember that it is possible to have reached a high stage ofspiritual consciousness without seeing any of this brain radiance. This isaltogether in the nature of phenomena, and is largely determined by the calibreof the physical body, by past karma and achievement, and by the ability of theaspirant to bring down “power from on high”, and to hold that energy steady inthe brain centre whilst he himself in meditation is detached from the formaspect, and can look serenely at it.When this has been accomplished (and it is not an objective to be worked for,but is simply an indication to be registered in the consciousness and thendismissed) the consequent stimulation produces a reaction of the physical body.The magnetic power of the light in the head, and the radiant force of the soulproduce stimulation. The centres begin to vibrate, and their vibration awakensthe atoms of the material body until eventually the powers of the vibratingetheric body have swung even the lowest centre into line with the highest. Thusthe fires of the body (the sum total of the energy of the atoms) are swept intoincreased activity until such time [108] as there is a rising up the spine ofthat fiery energy. This is brought about by the magnetic control of the soul,seated “on the throne between the eyebrows”.Here enters in the work of one of the means of yoga, abstraction or withdrawal.Where the three lights are blended, where the centres are aroused and the atomsare also vibrating, it becomes possible for the man to centre all three in thehead at will. Then, by the act of the will and the knowledge of certain words ofPower he can enter into samadhi and be withdrawn from his body, carrying thelight with him. In this way the greater light (the three fused and blended)illuminates the three worlds of man's endeavours and “the light is thrownupward” and illuminates all the spheres of man's conscious and unconsciousexperience. This is spoken of in the occult writings of the Masters in thesewords:“Then the Bull of God carries the light in his forehead, and his eye transmitsthe radiance; His head, with magnetic force, resembles the blazing sun, and fromthe lotus of the head, the path of light issues. It enters into the GreaterBeing, producing a living fire. The Bull of God sees the Solar Angel, and knowsthat Angel to be the light wherein he walks.”Then the work of the four proceeds. The four are at-one. The Solar Angel isidentified with his instrument; the life of the sheaths is subordinated to thelife of the inner divinity; the light of the sheaths is fused with the light ofthe soul. The head, the heart, and the base of the spine are geometricallyaligned and certain developments then become possible.In these two Rules, the foundation of the magical work of the soul has been laiddown. Let us list, for the sake of clarity, the steps outlined:1. The Solar Angel begins the work of initiating the Personality.[109]2. He withdraws his forces from soul enterprises in the spiritual Kingdom, andcentres his attention on the work to be done.3. He enters into deep meditation.4. Magnetic rapport with the instrument in the three worlds is instituted.5. The instrument, man, responds, and also enters into meditation.6. The work proceeds in ordered stages and with cyclic activity.7. The light of the soul is thrown downwards.8. The light of the vital body and the physical form is synchronised with thatof the head.9. The centres swing into activity.10. The light of the soul and the two other aspects of light are so intense thatnow all life in the three worlds is illumined.11. Alignment is produced, the work of discipleship and of initiation becomespossible and proceeds according to the Law of Being.PRINCIPLES AND PERSONALITIESThere is, however, a point which merits consideration and which could beapproached in the form of a question. The student might well enquire into thematter as follows:“Some people approach the problem of Being through mental appreciation; othersthrough heart understanding; some are motivated through the head and othersthrough the heart; some do things or avoid doing them because they know, ratherthan feel; some react to their surroundings mentally rather than emotionally.“The point on which to seek illumination is whether the path for some is not toserve because they know rather than love God, Who, after all, is but theirinnermost selves. Is [110] this not the path of the occultist and of the sagerather than of the mystic and the saint? When all is said and done, is it not aquestion, primarily, of the ray one is on and the Master under whom one servesone's apprenticeship? Is not true knowledge a species of intellectual love? If apoet can pen an ode to intellectual beauty why may not we express appreciationof a unity that is conceived of the head rather than of the heart? Hearts arewell enough in their way but they are not suited to the world's rough usage.“Can one do aught but accept his present limitation while seeking suchtranscendence as is his by the Divine Law of evolution? Is there not such athing (by comparison) as a spiritual inferiority complex on the part of such asare sensible (and perhaps over-sensitive) of the fact that while their livesintellectually are replete with interest, the desert of their hearts has not yetbeen made to blossom like the rose?“In other words, provided one repairs to his appointed station and there servesin his acceptance of Brotherhood in the Presence of Fatherhood, what differencedoes it make that the fundamental postulate is with him a thing of the headrather than of the heart?”I would answer such a questioning as follows:It is not a question of ray or even of the basic distinction between theoccultist and the mystic. In the rounded-out individual both head and heart mustfunction with equal power. In time and space, however, and during the process ofevolution, individuals are distinguished by a predominating tendency in any onelife; it is only because we do not see all the picture that we draw thesetemporary distinctions. In one life a man may be predominantly mental and forhim the path of the Love of God would be unsuited. The Love of God is shedabroad in his heart and to a considerable degree his occult approach is based onthe mystic perception of past lives. For him the problem is to know God, withthe view of interpreting that knowledge in love to all. Responsible [111] love,demonstrated in duty to group and family, is therefore for him the line of leastresistance. Universal love, raying out to all nature and all forms of life, willfollow on a more developed knowledge of God, but this will be part of hisdevelopment in another life.Students of human nature (and this all aspirants should be) would do well tobear in mind that there are temporary differences. People differ in:a. Ray (which affects predominantly the magnetism of the life).b. Approach to truth, either the occult or the mystic path having the strongerdrawing power.c. Polarisation, deciding the emotional, mental or physical intent of a life.d. Status in evolution, leading to the diversities seen among men.e. Astrological sign, determining the trend of any particular life.f. Race, bringing the personality under the peculiar racial thought form.The sub-ray on which a man is found, that minor ray which varies fromincarnation to incarnation, largely gives him his coloring for this life. It ishis secondary hue. Forget not, the primary ray of the Monad continues throughthe aeon. It changes not. It is one of the three primary rays that eventuallysynthesise the sons of men. The ray of the ego varies from round to round, and,in more evolved souls, from race to race, and comprises one of the five rays ofour present evolution. It is the predominating ray to which a man's causal bodyvibrates. It may correspond to the ray of the monad, or it may be one of thecomplementary colours to the primary. The ray of the personality varies from[112] life to life, till the gamut of the seven sub-rays of the Monadic ray hasbeen passed through.Therefore, in dealing with people whose monads are on a similar or complementaryray it will be found that they approach each other sympathetically. We mustremember however that evolution must be far advanced for the ray of the monad toinfluence extensively. So the majority of cases come not under this category.With average advanced men, who are struggling to approximate themselves to theideal, similarity of the egoic ray will produce mutual comprehension, andfriendship follows. It is easy for two people on the same egoic ray tocomprehend each other's point of view, and they become great friends, withunshaken faith in each other, for each recognizes the other acting as he himselfwould act.But when (added to the egoic similarity of ray) you have the same ray ofpersonality, then you have one of those rare things a perfect friendship, asuccessful marriage, an unbreakable link between two. This is rare indeed.When you have two people on the same personality ray but with the egoic raydissimilar, you may have those brief and sudden friendships and affinities, thatare as ephemeral as a butterfly. These things need bearing in mind and withtheir recognition comes the ability to be adaptable. Clarity of vision resultsin a circumspect attitude.Another cause of difference can be due to the polarization of the bodies. Unlessthis too meets with recognition in dealing with people lack of comprehensionensues. When you use the term: “a man polarized in his astral body”—you reallymean a man whose ego works principally through that vehicle. Polarity indicatesthe clarity of the channel. Let me illustrate. The ego of the average [113] manhas its home on the third sub-plane of the mental plane. If a man has an astralvehicle largely composed of third sub-plane astral matter, and a mental vehiclemostly on the fifth sub-plane, the ego will centre his endeavour on the astralbody. If he has a mental body of fourth sub-plane matter and an astral body offifth sub-plane, the polarization will be mental.When you speak of the ego taking more or less control of a man you really meanthat he has built into his bodies matter of the higher sub-planes.The ego takes control with interest only when the man has almost entirelyeliminated matter of the seventh, sixth, and fifth sub-planes from his vehicles.When he has built in a certain proportion of matter of the fourth sub-plane theego extends his control; when there is a certain proportion of the thirdsub-plane, then the man is on the Path; when second sub-plane matterpredominates then he takes initiation, and when he has matter only of atomicsubstance, he becomes a Master. Therefore, the sub-plane a man is on is ofimportance, and the recognition of his polarization elucidates life.The third thing you need to remember is that even when these two points areadmitted, the age of the soul's experience frequently causes lack ofcomprehension. The above two points do not carry us very far, for the capacityto sense a man's ray is not for this race as yet. Approximate supposition andthe use of the intuition is all that is now possible. The little evolved cannotcomprehend completely the much evolved, and in a lesser degree, the advanced egocomprehends not an initiate. The greater can apprehend the lesser but thereverse is not the case.As regards the action of those whose point of attainment greatly transcends yourown, I can only ask you to do three things: [114]a. Reserve judgment. Their vision is greater. Forget not that one of thegreatest qualities members of the Lodge have achieved is their ability to viewthe destruction of form as unimportant. Their concern is with the evolving life.b. Realize that all events are brought around by the Brothers with a wisepurpose in view. Lesser grade initiates, though utterly free agents, fit intothe plans of their superiors just as do you in your lesser way. They have theirlessons to learn, and the rule of learning is that all experience has to bebought. Apprehension comes by the punishment that follows an ill-judged act.Their superiors stand by to turn to good account situations brought about by theerrors of those inferior in point of development.c. Remember also that the Law of Rebirth holds hidden the secret of the presentcrisis. Groups of egos come together to work out certain karma involved in pastdays. Men have erred grievously in the past. Punishment and transmutation arethe natural working out. Violence and cruelty in the past will reap its heavykarma, but it lies in the hands of you all now to transmute the old mistakes.Also bear in mind that principles are eternal, personalities temporal.Principles are to be viewed in the light of eternity; personalities from thestandpoint of time. The trouble is that, in many situations, two principles areinvolved, one of which is secondary. The difficulty lies in the fact that (bothbeing principles) both are right. It is a rule for safe guidance always toremember that usually basic principles (for their wise comprehension andfruitful working out) call for the play of the intuition whilst secondaryprinciples are more purely mental. The methods hence necessarily differ. Whenholding to the basic principles, the wisest methods are [115] silence and ajoyful confidence that the Law works, an avoidance of all personality innuendoexcept wise and loving comment, and a determination to see all in the light ofeternity and not of time, coupled with a constant endeavour to follow the law oflove and see only the divine in your brothers, e'en if on an opposing side.In secondary principles, which all opposing forces are at present emphasizing,the use of the lower mind involves the danger of criticism, the employment ofmethods sanctioned by time in the three worlds—methods involving personalattack, invective and the expenditure of force along destructive lines, and aspirit contrary to the law of the plane of unity. The term “opposing forces” isused rightly if you employ it only in a scientific sense and mean thecontrasting pole that leads to equilibrium. Remember therefore, that opposinggroups may be quite sincere, but the concrete mind acts in them as a barrier tothe free play of the higher vision. Their sincerity is great but their point ofattainment along some lines less than that of those who adhere to basicprinciples, seen in the light of the intuition.A principle is that which embodies some aspect of the truth on which this systemof ours is based; it is the seeping through to the consciousness of the man of alittle of the idea on which our Logos bases all He does. The basis of all Logoicaction is love in activity, and the fundamental idea on which He bases actionconnected with the human Hierarchy is the power of love to drive onward,—call itevolution, if you like, call it inherent urge, should you so prefer, but it islove causing motion and urging onward to completion. It is the driving of oneand all to further expression. Hence, this principle should underlie allactivity, and the government of the lesser organizations, if founded on loveleading to activity, would lead to a divine urge in all its members, drivingthem likewise on to fullest expression, and thus tend [116] to more adequatecompleteness and more satisfactory endeavour.A principle, when really fundamental, appeals at once to the intuition and callsout an immediate re-action of assent from the man's higher Self. It makes littleor no appeal to the personality. It embodies a conception of the ego in hisrelationship to others. A principle is that which governs always the action ofthe ego on his own plane, and it is only as we come more and more under theguidance of that ego that our personality conceives of, and responds to theseideas. This is a point to be borne in mind in all dealings with others andshould modify judgments. To apprehend a principle justly marks a point inevolution.A principle is that which ensouls a statement dealing with the highest good ofthe greatest number. That a man should love his wife is a statement of aprinciple governing the personality but it must later be transmuted into thegreater principle that a man must love his fellow men. Principles are of threekinds and the higher must be reached via the lower:(a) Principles governing the lower personal self, dealing with the actions oractive life of that lower self. They embody the third aspect or the activityaspect of logoic manifestation and form the basis of later progress. Theycontrol the man during his little evolved state, and during his period ofthoughtlessness and might be comprehended more easily if I were to say that theyare embodied in the commonly accepted rules of decent living. Thou shalt notkill, thou shalt not steal, have to do with a man's active life, with thebuilding up of character.(b) Principles governing the higher self and dealing with the love or wisdomaspect. It is with these that we are now concerned and half the troubles in[117] the world at present arise from the fact that these higher principles,having to do with love or wisdom in all their fullness, are only now beginningto be apprehended by the rank and file of mankind. In the quick recognition oftheir truthfulness and the attempt to make them facts, without previouslyadjusting the environment to those ideals, comes the frequent clashing andwarfare between those actuated by the principles governing the personality andthose governing the higher Self. Until more of the race are governed by the soulconsciousness this warfare is inevitable and cannot be avoided. When theemotional plane is dominated by the intuitional, then will come universalcomprehension.The first set of principles is learnt by the man through grasping, and thesubsequent disaster that results from that seizure. He stole, he suffered thepenalty and he stole no more. The principle was wrought into him by pain and helearnt that only that which was his by right and not by seizure could beenjoyed. The world is learning this lesson in groups now, for, as itsrevolutionaries seize and unlawfully hold, they find the stolen propertysuffices not but brings sorrow. Thus in time they learn the principles.The second set of principles is learnt through renunciation and service. A manlooks away (having learnt first principles) from the things of the personalityand in service learns the power of love in its occult significance. He spendsand consequently receives; he lives the life of renunciation and the wealth ofthe heavens pours in on him; he gives all and is full to completeness; he asksnothing for himself and is the richest man on earth.First principles deal with the differentiated unit and with evolution throughheterogeneity. Principles such as the race is learning now have to do withgroups; the [118] question is not—”What will be best for the man?” but “Whatwill be best for the many?” and only those who can think with vision of the manyas one, can state these principles satisfactorily. They are the most important,for they are the basic principles of this love system. The trouble today is thatmen are confused. Certain first principles, the lower activity fundamentals areingrained and inherent now, and a few of the higher egoic or love principles areseeping through into their bewildered brains causing an apparent momentaryclashing of ideas. Therefore like Pilate they say: “What is truth?” If they willbut remember that the higher principles deal with the good of the group and thelower with the good of the individual, mayhap clarity, will ensue. The loweractivity of personal life, no matter how good or how worthy, must eventually betranscended by the higher love life that seeks the good of the group and not ofthe unit.All that tends to synthesis and divine expression in collections of units isapproaching closer to the ideal and approximating the higher principles. Inthinking out these ideas may come some helpfulness. You have an illustration ofwhat I say in the fact that many of the struggles that arise in organizationsare based on the fact that some worthy people follow personalities, sacrificingthemselves for a principle, yes, but a principle governing the personality life.Others, dimly glimpsing something higher and seeking the good of the groups andnot of a person, stumble onto a higher principle, and in so doing bring in theforce of the ego. They are working for others and aiming at the helping of theirgroup. When egos and personalities clash, the victory of the higher is sure; thelower principle must give way to the higher. One is concentrated on what seemsto him to be of paramount value, the fulfilling of the wish of the personallife, and (at this period) is only secondarily [119] interested in the good ofthe many though he may have moments when he thinks that is his primary intent.The other cares naught for what becomes of the personal self and is onlyinterested in the helping of the many. It boils down, to use an apt expression,to the question of selfish or unselfish motive, and, as you know, motives varyas time speeds by and the man nears the goal of the probationary path.(c) Still higher principles are those comprehended by the Spirit and are onlyreadily comprehended by the monadic consciousness. Only as the man transcendshis active personal life and substitutes the life of love or wisdom as led bythe ego can he begin to understand the scope of that life of love and know it asdemonstrated power. Just as the personality deals with the principles governingthe life of activity of the lower self, and the ego works with the law of loveas demonstrated in group work, or love showing itself in the synthesis of themany into the few, so the Monad deals with the active life of love shown inpower through the synthesis of the few into the one.One deals with the life of the man on the physical plane, or in the threeworlds, the second with his life on causal levels, and the last with his lifeafter the attainment of the goal of present human endeavour. One deals withunits, another with groups and the last with unity. One deals withdifferentiation at its most diverse point, the second with the many resolvedinto the egoic groups, whilst the third sees the differentiation resolved backinto the seven, which marks unity for the human hierarchy.All these factors and many others produce differences among human beings, and insizing himself up a man must needs bring them into his consideration.It should therefore be borne in mind that a disciple of any of the Masters willhave his peculiar equipment, and his individual assets and deficiencies. He cannevertheless [120] rest assured that, until the path of Knowledge has been addedto the path of Love, he can never take the major initiations, for these areundergone on the higher levels of the mental plane. Until the path of light isunited to the path of life the great transition from the fourth into the fifthkingdom cannot be taken. Certain expansions of consciousness are possible;initiations on the astral and lower mental planes can be taken; some of thevision can be seen, the sense of the Presence can be felt; the Beloved can bereached by love, and the bliss and the joy of this contact can carry with it itsabiding joy, but that clear perception which comes from the experience undergoneon the Mount of Illumination is a different thing to the joy experienced on theMount of Blessing. The Heart leads in the one, the Head leads in the other.To answer categorically: The path of knowledge is that of the occultist and thesage; that of love is that of the mystic and the saint. The head or the heartapproach is not dependent upon the ray, for both ways must be known; the mysticmust become the occultist; the white occultist has been the saintly mystic. Trueknowledge is intelligent love, for it is the blending of the intellect and thedevotion. Unity is sensed in the heart; its intelligent application to life hasto be worked out through knowledge.It is of prime value to recognize the tendency of the life purpose, and to knowwhether the head or the heart method is the objective of any specific life. Afine spiritual discrimination is needed here however, lest the glamour ofillusion tempt to the path of inertia. Ponder these words with care, and seethat the question is based on a true foundation and does not grow out of aninferiority complex, the consideration of a brother's enterprise and aconsequent jealous tendency, or upon a placid complacency which negatesactivity. [121]As a general rule for the average aspirant to discipleship, it may be safelyassumed that the past has seen much application of the heart way, and that inthis incarnation the mental unfoldment is of prime importance.An ancient Scripture says:“Seek not, Oh twice-blessed One, to attain the spiritual essence before the mindabsorbs. Not thus is wisdom sought. Only he who hath the mind in leash, andseeth the world as in a mirror can be safely trusted with the inner senses. Onlyhe who knoweth the five senses to be illusion, and that naught remaineth savethe two ahead, can be admitted into the secret of the Cruciform transposed.“The path that is trodden by the Server is the path of fire that passeth throughhis heart and leadeth to the head. It is not on the path of pleasure, nor on thepath of pain that liberation may be taken nor that wisdom cometh. It is by thetranscendence of the two, by the blending of pain with pleasure, that the goalis reached, that goal that lieth ahead, like a point of light seen in thedarkness of a winter's night. That point of light may call to mind the tinycandle in some attic drear, but—as the path that leadeth to that light istrodden through the blending of the pairs of opposites—that pin-point, cold andflickering, groweth with steady radiance till the warm light of some blazinglamp cometh to the mind of the wanderer by the way.“Pass on, O Pilgrim, with steady perseverance. No candle is there nor earth lampfed with oil. Ever the radiance groweth till the path ends within a blaze ofglory, and the wanderer through the night becometh the child of the sun, andentereth within the portals of that radiant orb.”"},{"pageContent":"RULE FOURSound, light, vibration, and the form blend and merge, and thus the work is one.It proceedeth under the law, and naught can hinder now the work from goingforward. The man breathes deeply. He concentrates his forces, and drives thethought-form from him.THE CREATIVE WORK OF SOUND[125] Before centering our attention upon this rule, it would be well torecollect certain things, so that our reflection on the rule may proceed withprofit.First, the rule we are at present considering concerns work on the mental plane,and before such work is possible it is important to have a developed mind, awell-nurtured intelligence, and also to have achieved some measure of mindcontrol. These rules are not for beginners in the occult sciences; they are forthose who are ready for magical work and for labour on the plane of mind. Loveis the great unifier, the prime attractive impulse, cosmic and microcosmic, butthe mind is the main creative factor and the utiliser of the energies of thecosmos. Love attracts, but the mind attracts, repels and co-ordinates, so thatits potency is inconceivable. Is it not possible dimly to sense a state ofaffairs in mental realms analogous to that now seen in the emotional? Can wepicture the condition of the world when the intellect is as potent and ascompelling as is the emotional nature at this time? The race is progressing intoan era wherein men will function as minds; when intelligence will be strongerthan desire, and when thought powers will be used for appeal and for theguidance of the world, as now physical and emotional means are employed.There lies in this thought a profoundly necessary incentive for a rightunderstanding of the laws of thought, and a correct instruction to be given ofthe use of mental [126] matter, and the building of that matter into thoughtforms.These rules concern themselves with this information. The second necessaryrecollection is that the worker in magic and the potent entity wielding theseforces must be the soul, the spiritual man, and this for the following reasons:1. Only the soul has a direct and clear understanding of the creative purposeand of the plan.2. Only the soul, whose nature is intelligent love can be trusted with theknowledge, the symbols and the formulas which are necessary to the correctconditioning of the magical work.3. Only the soul has power to work in all three worlds at once, and yet remaindetached, and therefore karmically free from the results of such work.4. Only the soul is truly group-conscious and actuated by pure unselfishpurpose.5. Only the soul, with the open eye of vision, can see the end from thebeginning, and can hold in steadiness the true picture of the ultimateconsummation.You ask, whether workers in black magic possess not an equal power? I answer,no. They can work in the three worlds, but they work from and in the plane ofmind, and do not function, therefore, outside their field of endeavour, as doesthe soul. They can achieve, from their proximity and identification with theirworking materials, results more potent temporarily and more rapid inaccomplishment than the worker in the White Brotherhood, but the results areephemeral; they carry destruction and disaster in their wake, and the blackmagician is eventually submerged in the resulting cataclysm.Let us therefore remember the necessity of a correct [127] use of the mind, and(at the same time) let us ever hold a position beyond and detached from thecreative work of our minds, desires and physical accomplishment.Four words stand forth as one considers Rule IV. First, sound, the formula, orword of power which the soul communicates and so starts the work. This word isdual. It is sounded forth on the note to which the soul responds, his ownpeculiar note, blended with that of his personality. This chord of two notes isthe producer of the resulting effects, and is more important than the set phrasecomposing the word of power.Herein lies the problem—to sound these two notes synchronously and with the mindfocussed. Herein lies a clue to the significance of the AUM or OM. In the earlystages of meditation work, the word is sounded audibly, whilst later it issounded inaudibly. This training in the sound of the AUM is an unconsciouspreparation for the dual work of spiritual creation; and facility comes as theattentive aspirant accustoms himself to hear within his brain the soundlesssound of OM.I would suggest here, that students accustom themselves to work in this manner,sounding the word audibly and with much frequency at the close of the morningmeditation, but emphasizing in the early part that close attention to theinaudible hearing which will develop the sensitivity of the inner ear, theetheric ear. Later, when the personal note or sound is established and the innersound is sensed, there can be definite practise in blending the two. Thisentails the closest attention and the power to perform two activitiessimultaneously, with the mental attitude of attention to both.Students whose aspiration is keen and clear would do well to face the issuewhere the magical work is concerned, and study their aptitude in meditation andtheir willingness to proceed with stability and caution with the neededdiscipline. To facilitate this I would suggest [128] that any who are deeplyconcerned in the work should study and answer the following questions in thelight of their souls, and to their higher selves make reply.1. Do you feel you have reached the stage wherein you can:a. Eliminate the meditation form as you now have it.b. Enter with relative facility into the state of contemplation.c. Recognize the vibration of your own soul.2. Does the Sacred Word mean anything to you, and could you formulate clearlythe reason you sound it?3. Are you anxious to proceed in this work because your personality aspires, orbecause your soul is beginning consciously to utilize its mechanism?In connection with this last question, a close analysis is called for, and Iconjure you to speak truth to yourself and thus clearly ascertain the trueposition. This question lies between a man’s soul and himself.I would like to interpolate here a few words in connection with myself. Studentscan side-track their energies in idle speculation as to my identity. Of whatmoment is it? My province in relation to the group is to give needed assistanceto those who seek to fit themselves for active work as disciples. I am adisciple and, having progressed further along the Path of Return than theaspirants who study these instructions, know somewhat the pitfalls, understandwhat is needed, and can aid in the preparation for the momentous moment whenthey pass the portal. Is more necessary? Is not truth of equal value ifenunciated by an aspirant, a disciple or a Master, or e’en a Christ? Mayhap thenearer I am to you the greater may be my usefulness. My anonymity will not bebroken and speculations as to my identity are fruitless [129] waste of time.Suffice it that I am an Oriental, that I am on the Teaching Ray, and closelyassociated with the Master K. H., that part of my work is the steady search foraspirants of strong heart, fervent devotion and trained minds, and that I am adisciple, as are all from the humblest probationer up to the greatest of theGreat Ones. One lesson all aspirants need to learn and to learn early and thatis, that concentration upon the personality of the Teacher, hoping for personalcontact with him, and constant visioning of that condition called “acceptedchelaship” serves to postpone that contact and delay the acceptance. Seek toequip your instrument, learn to function in quietness, fulfill your obligationsand do your duty, develop restraint of speech and that calm poise that comesfrom an unselfish life motive and forget the selfish satisfaction that mightwell up in the heart when recognition of faithfulness comes from the watchingHierarchy.Give this Instruction careful consideration. These are days wherein manyadjustments and changes are being wrought in the world of men. In the resultingconfusion, individuals are appreciating the necessity for the uniting of theirforces and for cooperation in their efforts, and the need for group work is moreapparent than ever before. These are days, therefore, wherein quietness andconfidence must be your strength, and wherein the only safeguard lies in a closesearching of all underlying motives. As seen on the surface, many apparentlydiverse principles emerge and the surge of battle appears to go, first one wayand then another. As seen on the inner side, the emerging factors are simpler.The contest leads primarily to a testing of motives, and through this testing itis made apparent (to the watching Guides) who, in every group, are capable ofclear thinking, accurate discrimination, patient endurance, and an ability toproceed along the probationary path toward the portal of initiation, [130]untrammelled and undisturbed in their inner life by the upheavals on thesurface. Could you but see it, the unrest and difficulty everywhere is producinga good which far outweighs the seeming evil. Souls are finding themselves andlearning dependence upon the inner Ruler. When all outward props fail and whenall the apparent authorities differ in the solution proffered, then souls arethrown back upon themselves and learn to seek within. This inner contact withthe higher self is becoming apparent in gradually unfolding degree, and leads tothat self-reliance and inward calm which is based upon the rule of the inner Godand which, therefore, makes a man an instrument for service in the world.Several things are apparent at this juncture to the careful thoughtful studentof men and of motives.First: That idealism and the sensing of the plan for humanity have a closerelationship. Idealism is analogous to the thought that precedes creation. Thecapacity for abstract thought and for concentration on the ideal is only now inprocess of development, for this capacity involves the utilization of certainatoms, the employment of matter of the higher sub-planes and the ability tosynchronize one’s vibrations with the Great Ones. Only a few people in the raceare true idealists (though their numbers are increasing); the small minorityonly, employ the concrete mind; while the masses are swayed entirely by theemotions. The time is coming when the intuitional body (the buddhic vehicle)will be organized, utilizing the higher spiritual mind as its medium. When thatorganization is completed the lower concrete mind will be nothing but atransmitter or an interpreter. Even abstract or concrete thought will besuperseded, and we shall have simply the inflow of the intuition, taking formthrough the medium of the mind stuff. We shall, therefore, have the apprehensionof much that is now incomprehensible to our lower plane vision.[131] In all great movements you have some thought or aggregation of thoughtscast into the minds of the so-called idealists by the Great White Brotherhood.The idea is sounded forth by Them. They choose a man or a group of men and castinto their minds some idea. There it germinates and is embodied by them in otherthoughts, not so pure or so wise but necessarily colored by the individuality ofthe thinker. These thought-forms are, in their turn, picked up by the concretethinkers of the world who—grasping the main outline of the idea—crystallize itand build it into more definite shape, into one more easily apprehended by thegeneral public. It has therefore now reached the lower levels of the mentalplane, and a further development becomes possible. It is then seized upon asdesirable by those who are focussed upon the astral plane; to them it makes anemotional appeal, becoming public opinion. It is now practically ready to takeshape upon the physical plane, and we have the practical adaptation of an idealto the needs of the physical life. It has been stepped down; it has lost much ofits original beauty; it is not as pure and as lovely as when first conceived,and it is distorted from its original shape but it is, nevertheless, moreadapted to public use and can be employed as a stepping-stone to higher things.Secondly: In this sensing of the plan and its later materialization, human unitsare involved and men have perforce to be employed. A vision is given oftremendous possibilities and indications are also granted of the manner in whichthese possibilities may become facts, but beyond that the Great Ones do not go.The detail and the method of concretizing the ideal and the necessary work isleft to the sons of men. To the disciple who is an organizer and transmitter ofthe Plan falls the work of filling in the details and of taking the necessaryaction. At this point it is wise for him to remember that he comes (with hislittle plans) under the same law as do the Great [132] Ones in Their largeendeavours, and that it is in his dealings with people and his manipulation ofthe human equation that the difficulties arise.Units for work fall into three groups:(a) Those who can sense the plan and are commissioned to work it out.(b) Those who can be used but who are blind to the greater issues.(c) Those who can sense nothing except those things which concern their ownselfish interests.The first group the Masters can contact. They work with these units of the humanfamily and expect fair promise of average success. These both hear the sound,and vision the Plan. The second group have to be utilized as best may be, by thedisciples of the world. The final group are frequently to be offset from theenergy standpoint, and only used when necessary.One of the primary conditions that a disciple has to cultivate, in order tosense the plan and be used by the Master, is solitude. In solitude the rose ofthe soul flourishes; in solitude the divine self can speak; in solitude thefaculties and the graces of the higher self can take root and blossom in thepersonality. In solitude also the Master can approach and impress upon thequiescent soul the knowledge that He seeks to impart, the lesson that must belearnt, the method and plan for work that the disciple must grasp. In solitudethe sound is heard. The Great Ones have to work through human instruments andthe plan and the vision are much handicapped by failure on the part of theseinstruments.Third: This brings me to the third point, the problems and the difficulties withwhich the Masters have to contend as They seek to further the plans of evolutionthrough the medium of the sons of men. In conclave wise They make Their plans;with judgment, after due [133] discussion, They apportion the tasks; then, tothose who offer themselves for service and who have some measure of soulcontact, They seek to transmit as much of the plan as possible. They impress theplan and some suggestion as to its scope upon the mind of some man or some womanupon the physical plane. If that mind is unstable or oversatisfied, if it isfilled with pride, with despair, or with self-depreciation, the vision does notcome through with clarity of outline; if the emotional body is vibratingviolently with some rhythm set up by the personality, or if the physical vehicleis ailing and concentrated attention is therefore prevented, what will happen?The Master will turn sadly away, distressed to think of the opportunity forservice that the worker has lost through his own fault, and He will seek someoneelse to fill the need,—someone perhaps not so fundamentally suitable, but theonly one available on account of the failure of the first one approached.It might incidentally be of value here to remind aspirants to service that muchwork done by many is the result of over-zealousness and is not a carryingforward of the Master’s work. With wise discrimination He apportions the workand never lays upon one human being more than he can adequately accomplish. Hecan and does train His disciple so that it appears to the on-looking world as ifhe accomplishes miracles but forget not that the vast amount of workaccomplished by one useful disciple only becomes possible when the control ofall his three bodies is co-ordinated and his alignment accomplished. He who hasa stable mental body that is strongly positive in reception from above, whilstnegative to lower vibrations, he who has an astral body that is clear,uncoloured and still, he who also has a physical body with steady nerves andstable rhythm (it will be like a casket, beautiful, yet strong as steel) willserve as a vessel meet for the Master’s use, a channel [134] through which Hecan unhindered pour His blessing upon the world.Fourth: It should be noted that even the Great Ones Themselves have to lay Theirplans largely allowing for the lack of perception of those on the physical planethrough whom They have to work. They are handicapped and dependent upon Theirphysical plane instruments and Their main trouble concerns the point ofevolution reached by the mass of men in the Occident.Remember that this point is indicative of the success of the evolutionaryprocess and not of its failure but, because much yet remains to be done, thework of the Lodge is often hindered. The point reached at this time might beexpressed as a swinging from the rank materialism of the past into a growing andprofound realization of the unseen worlds without the balance that comes fromself-acquired knowledge. The forces that have been set in motion by thethinkers—the scientists of the world, the truly advanced religious men, theSpiritualists, the Christian Scientists, the New Thought workers, theTheosophists and the modern philosophers and workers in other fields of humanthought—are gradually and steadily affecting the subtler bodies of humanity andare bringing them to a point where they are beginning to realize three things:a. The reality of the unseen worlds.b. The terrific power of thought.c. The need for scientific knowledge on these two matters.Fifth: Certain dangers which aspirants must watch as they seek to be of useshould here be mentioned:They must guard against overemphasizing one aspect at the expense of anotherpart of the plan or vision.They must avoid unequal concentration of thought [135] upon that part of theplan which appeals the most to them personally.They must recognize the inability of the workers to continue to bring throughthe plans and to work together peacefully and steadily. Friction is oftunavoidable.They must watch for the creeping in of self-interest and of ambition.They must guard against fatigue, due to long effort in materializing the planand the strain incident upon high endeavour.They must develop the capacity to recognize those who are sent to help them inthe work.They must above all watch against failure to keep in touch with the higher selfand with the Master.Another point that has to be remembered is that the problem to be solved by allwho are seeking to co-operate with the Great White Lodge has four objects inview.First, that in the working out of the plan there is also the working out ofkarma. This karma is not merely individual nor purely national, but is part ofthe total working out of world karma.Second. Another object is the preparing of an instrument for service in theinauguration of the New Age during the next two hundred years. The integrationof a group of knowers and of mystics is going on steadily in all parts of theworld and in all organizations. One group is being gathered but its membersbelong to many groups. To this group of knowers and mystics is given theopportunity of being the channel through which the Hierarchy can work, andthrough which the Great Ones can send Their illuminating thought. Through italso they can work for the uplift (in the occult sense) of humanity and thus aidevolution on every plane. According to the response of disciples, of mystics andof knowers everywhere, so will be the rapid coming in of the New Age.[136] I here seek to sound a word of warning: In the failure to respond, in thefailure to adjust, construct and refine, in the failure to turn the inner ear tothose voices on the subtler planes which utter “the Words of Reconstruction” maycome the ultimate transference of the forces of reconstruction to otherchannels, the consequent withholding of opportunities and the ultimatediscarding of the instrumentality of the group as a medium of service. I wouldlike to emphasize the statement anent “the Words of Reconstruction,” begging allof you who earnestly desire to hear these words to study the Introduction to thebook, Light on the Path. Let it be remembered that if the Great Ones have tochange Their plans as to this integrating group of mystics, it will be changedby the mystics themselves—viewed as a group.The third objective is the development of the intuition and discrimination ofthe disciples in the world, and their ability to sense the higher vision and toachieve at the cost of the lower, the consciousness of that higher plane. Theywill have to remember that the lower objective, owing to its proximity, willloom in many ways more attractive, and can only be transcended at infinite cost.Intuition must be developed in many people, and their sense of values adequatelyadjusted before this group, which must inaugurate the New Age, can measure up tothe requirements.Present day troubles are largely due to the lack of intuitive perception in thepast and this fault lies primarily among the mystics of the world and not somuch among the lower aspirants. The trouble has not lain in lack of idealism oreven in a lack of intelligence and sincerity, it consists in the failure tosacrifice the personality at all times in order to make the intuitiverealization demonstrate its realities. Compromise has been permitted and in theoccult world compromise is forbidden. When indulged in, it leads to disaster andsweeps away eventually, [137] in ruin and in storm, the personalities of thosewho so stoop. People have sought to adjust the truth to the hour instead ofadjusting the hour to the truth, and in diplomacy they have endeavored to bringabout as much of the reality as they deem wise. The Masters are looking out forthose with clear vision, uncompromising adherence to the truth as sensed, andcapacity to drive steadily forward toward the ideal. This entails the followingfactors:1. A recognition of that ideal through meditation.2. Its application to the present through one-pointedness.3. Removal of the old and hindering thought-forms through self-sacrifice.4. A refusal to compromise, through clear vision.5. A discrimination that enables the disciple always to distinguish between theacts of an individual and the individual himself.6. Realization that, in the occult work, it is not permitted to interfere withpersonal karma any more than it is permitted to shield from the consequences ofaction. This entails therefore a refusal to interfere in anyone’s business—thatis, as regards the personality life, and yet involves a refusal to shirk thebusiness of the larger cause. It is essential that the workers learn todiscriminate between the factors which make for personal liberty and those whichmilitate against group liberty.The fourth result to be brought about by the present opportunity to work is thebringing in the new cycle and the new group of participants. Workers in the newera will be drawn from all groups and the test of their choice depends largelyupon the measure of impersonality with which they work and the strength of their[138] inner contact with the soul. It is not easy for any of you, therefore,submerged as you are in the smoke and roar of battle, to judge results withaccuracy or to judge people with perfect propriety. These things have to bedealt with on the inner planes and are noted by the watching guides of the race.I would like here briefly to point out a few of the things for which the GreatOnes look.They look to see whether the inner flame—the result of effort wisely to work andthink and do—burns with increased brilliance; they note whether it remainshidden and dim through the whirl of astral currents and by thought forms ofpersonal antagonism, ambition and envy. As a result of world work some will bedrawn into closer connection with the work of the Hierarchy, and others will betemporarily set back. Capacity to dominate the astral and to work from mentallevels will largely count.They look to see who can struggle and contend for principle with personalities,and yet keep the link of love intact. This counts perhaps more than men realizeand a man who can stand for principle and yet love all human beings—refusingcompromise and yet refusing hate—has something rare to offer in these days andthe Great Ones can use him. See to it, therefore, all of you who work, that withclear vision, upright purpose and firm undeviating action you forge ahead. Seeto it that you deal with patience and forbearance with those of your brotherswho choose the lesser principle and the lesser right, who sacrifice the good ofthe group for their own personal ends or who use unworthy methods. Give to themlove and care and a ready helping hand, for they will stumble on the way andsound the depth of the law. Stand ready then to lift them up and to offer tothem opportunities for service, knowing that service is the great healer andteacher.[139] The Great Ones look to see the faculty of pliability and adaptabilityworking out, that faculty of adaptation that is one of the fundamental laws ofspecies which nature so wonderfully demonstrates. The transference of this lawto the inner planes and its working out in the new cycle of effort must beundertaken. This law of adaptation involves the appreciation of the need, therecognition of the new force coming in with the new cycle and the consequentbringing together in wide synthesis of the need and of the force, regarding thepersonal self simply as a focal point for action and transmutation. It involvesthe transmutation of the five senses and their extension into the subtler planesso that sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell are welded into one syntheticcooperating whole, for use in the great work. On the physical plane, these tendto the unification of the personal life and to the adaptation of the physicalworld to the needs of the personal self. On the subtler planes they must betransmuted until they are adequate to the needs of the group of which theindividual forms a fragmentary part. The ability to do this is one of the thingsthat the Great Ones look for in those individuals whose privilege it may be toinaugurate the New Age.Above all, They look for an enlarged channel from the soul to the physicalbrain, via the mind. Such an enlarged channel indicates that a man can be used.One might almost express it by saying that They look for the perfecting of theantaskarana, that channel of communication between the soul consciousness andthe brain whose possessor is one whom the Masters can successfully use. They areguided in their choice of workers by a man’s personally achieved capacity and byhis own hard won ability. When there is capacity, ability, and faculty, then theGreat Ones joyfully employ him. The wrong angle has been, at times,over-emphasized and the reverse of this taught. The Masters must not be sought[140] because a man seeks capacity. They will be found when a man hascapacity—capacity that makes him available for group work and that can beextended under careful instruction into the higher powers of the soul.Leadership in groups controlling the work of the New Age will grow out of thediscipline of the individual, and leaders will be found among those who sensethe inner issue. Leadership that endures does not come to those who strive forplace and power nor for those who have their eyes only on outward conditions andoverlook the underlying causes. Leadership does not come to those who place thepersonal self and its position and power before the good of the group. It comesenduringly to those who seek nothing for the separated self, to those who losethemselves in the good of the whole.To resume our consideration of the AUM. The Sound or the Sacred Word whencorrectly used has various effects which might be touched upon here.OM sounded forth, with intent thought behind it, acts as a disturber, a loosenerof the coarse matter of the body of thought, of emotion, and of the physicalbody. When sounded forth with intense spiritual aspiration behind it, it acts asan attractive medium, and gathers in particles of pure matter to fill the placesof those earlier thrown out. Students should strive to have these two activitiesin their minds as they use the Word in their meditation. This utilization of theWord is of practical value, and results in the building of good bodies for theuse of the soul.The use of the OM serves also to indicate to the workers on the universalplanes, and to those in the outer world who are gifted with spiritual perceptionthat a disciple is available for work and can be utilized actively in the neededplaces of the earth. This should be borne in mind by all aspirants and shouldserve as an [141] incentive in making the outer phenomenal life coincide withthe spiritual impulse.The use of the Sacred Word has its place also in the magical work of theHierarchy. Thought forms are created for the embodiment of ideas and theseembodied forms are sent forth to contact the minds of the disciples who areresponsible in the group of a Master for the carrying forward of the plan.Through the cultivated receptivity of the developed and controlled mental body,aspirants become aware of the ideas which the Masters bring through from theplane of the Universal Mind, and hence are in a position to co-operateintelligently. They, in their turn, as this Rule seeks to indicate, createthought forms of those received ideas, and utilize them in their groups for thehelping of the world. The main work of a disciple on the mental plane is totrain himself to do four things:1. To be receptive to the mind of the Master.2. To cultivate a right intuitive understanding of the thoughts sent him by theMaster.3. To embody the ideas received in such form as will be suitable for those he isengaged in helping.4. Through sound, light and vibration to make his thought form active (embodyingas much of the universal thought as is desirable) so that other minds maycontact it.Thus are groups gathered, organized, taught and lifted, and thus the Hierarchyof Adepts can reach the world.There are many other uses, of course, but if the students will ponder on thesethree they will make it possible for further uses to be imparted later.May I add, that the sound is only truly potent when the disciple has learnt tosubordinate the lesser sounds. Only as the sounds he sends forth normally intothe [142] three worlds are reduced in volume and in activity, as well as inquantity will it be possible for the Sound to be heard, and so to accomplish itspurpose. Only as the multitude of spoken words is reduced, and silence in speechis cultivated, will it be possible for the Word to make its power felt on thephysical plane. Only when the many voices of the lower nature and of ourenvironment are silenced, will the “Voice that speaketh in the stillness” makeits presence felt. Only when the sound of many waters dies away in theadjustment of the emotions will the clear note of the God of the waters beheard.People seldom realize the potency of a word, yet it is stated, “In the beginningwas the Word, and the Word was God. Without Him was not anything made that wasmade.” When therefore we read those words our minds go back to the dawn of thecreative process when, through the medium of sound, God spoke and the worldswere made.It has been said that, “the chief agency by which Nature’s wheel is moved in aphenomenal direction is sound,” for the original sound or word sets in vibrationthe matter of which all forms are made and initiates that activity whichcharacterizes even the atom of substance.The literature and the scriptures of all the ancient nations and great religionsbear testimony to the efficacy of sound in producing all that is tangible andvisible. The Hindus say very beautifully that “the Great Singer built theworlds, and the Universe is His Song.” This is another way of expressing thesame idea. If this is realized and the science of this concept somewhatunderstood, the significance of our own words and the utterance of sound inspeech, becomes almost a momentous happening.Sound or speech and the use of words have been regarded [143] by the ancientphilosophers (and are increasingly so regarded by modern thinkers) as thehighest agent used by man in moulding himself and his surroundings. Thought,speech and the resultant activity on the physical plane complete the triplicitywhich make a man what he is, and place him where he is.The purpose of all speech is to clothe thought and thus make our thoughtsavailable for others. When we speak we evoke a thought and make it present, andwe bring that which is concealed within us into audible expression. Speechreveals, and right speech can create a form of beneficent purpose, just as wrongspeech can produce a form which has a malignant objective. Without realizingthis, however, ceaselessly and irresponsibly, day after day, we speak; we usewords; we multiply sounds; and surround ourselves with form worlds of our owncreation. Is it not essential, therefore, that before we speak we should think,thus remembering the injunction, “You must attain to knowledge, ere you canattain to speech”? Having thought, let us then choose the right words to expressthe right thought, attempting to give correct pronunciation, proper values, andtrue tonal quality to every word we utter.Then will our spoken word create a thought form which will embody the idea wehave in our minds. Then too will our words carry no discord, but will add theirquota to that great harmonizing chord or unifying word which it is the functionof mankind ultimately to utter. Wrong speech separates, and it is interesting tobear in mind that the word, the symbol of unity, is divine, whereas speech inits many diversifications is human.As evolution proceeds, and the human family rises into its true position in thegreat plan of the universe, right and correct speech will be increasinglycultivated, because we shall think more before we utter words, or, as a greatteacher has said, “through meditation we shall [144] rectify the mistakes ofwrong speech;” and the significance of word forms, true and correct sounds, andvocal quality will become ever more apparent.The second word of importance in this fourth Rule is the word light. First thesound and then the first effect of sound, the pouring forth of light, causingthe revelation of the thought form.Light is known by what is revealed. The absence of light produces the fadingaway, into apparent non-existence, of the phenomenal world.The thought form created by the Sound is intended to be a source of revelation.It must reveal truth, and bring an aspect of reality to the cognisance of theonlooker. Hence the second quality of the thought form in its highest use isthat it brings light to those who need it, to those who walk in darkness.I deal not here with light as the soul, cosmically or individually. I touch notupon light as the universal second aspect of divinity. I seek only in theseInstructions to deal with that aspect of truth which will make the aspirant apractical worker, and so enable him to work with intelligence. His main work(and increasingly he will find this to be so) is to create thought-forms tocarry revelation to thinking human beings. To do this he must work occultly, andthrough the sound of his breathed forth work, through the truth revealed inform, will he carry light and illumination into the dark places of the earthThen he finally makes his thought form live through the power of his ownassurance, spiritual understanding and vitality. Thus the significance of thethird word, vibration, appears. His message is heard, for it is sounded forth;it carries illumination, for it conveys the Truth and reveals Reality; it is ofvital import, for it vibrates with the life of its creator, and is held in beingas long as his thought and sound and intelligence animate [145] it. This is trueof a message, of an organization, and of all forms of life, which are but theembodied ideas of a cosmic or a human creator.Students would find it of value to take these three vital words and trace theirrelation to all embodied thought forms—a cosmos, a plane, a kingdom in nature, arace, a nation, a human being. Consider the diverse groups of creatingagencies—solar Logoi, solar Angels, human beings, and others. Consider thespheres of the creative process and see how true the Old Commentary is when itsays:“The sound reverberated amidst varying wheels of uncreated matter; and lo, thesun and all the lesser wheels appeared. The light shone forth amidst the manywheels, and thus the many forms of God, the diverse aspects of his radiant robeblazed forth.“The vibrant palpitating wheels turned over. Life, in its many stages and in itsmany grades commenced the process of unfolding, and lo, the law began to work.Forms arose, and disappeared, but life moved on. Kingdoms arose, holding theirmany forms which drew together, turned together, and later separated, but stillthe life moved on.“Mankind, hiding the Son of God, the Word incarnate, broke forth into the lightof revelation. Races appeared and disappeared. The forms, veiling the radiantsoul, emerged, achieved their purpose and vanished into night, but lo, the lifemoved on, blended this time with light. Life merged with light, both blending toreveal a beauty and a power, an active liberating force, a wisdom and a lovethat we call a Son of God.“Through the many Sons of God, who in their inmost centre are but one, God inhis Fatherhood is known. Yet still that lighted life moved on to a dread pointof power, of force creative, concerning which we say: It is the All, theContainer of the Universe, the persistent centre of the Spheres, the One.”We have touched upon two words of significance in the fourth Rule,—sound andlight,—and one paramount idea emerges. The soul is to be known as light, as the[146] revealer, whilst the Spirit aspect will later be recognized as sound.Complete light and illumination is the right of the disciple who attains to thethird initiation, whilst the true comprehension of the sound, of the triple AUM,the synthesizing factor in manifestation appears only to the one who standsmaster of the three worlds.The word vibration must next engage our attention but it may not be dissociatedfrom the next word in the sequence form . Vibration, the effect of divineactivity, is two-fold. There is the first effect in which the vibration (issuingfrom the realm of subjectivity in response to sound and light) produces responsein matter, and therefore attracts or calls together the atoms out of whichmolecules, cells, organisms and finally the integrated form can be built. Thiseffected, the aspect of vibration is to be noted as a duality.The form, through the medium of the five senses, becomes aware of the vibratoryaspect of all forms in the environment wherein it, itself, is a functioningentity. Later, in time and space, that functioning form becomes increasinglyaware of its own interior vibration, and by tracing back that vibration to itsoriginating source becomes aware of the Self, and later of the Kingdom of theSelf. Humanity as a whole is aware of its environment and, through theinformation conveyed by the sense of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, thephenomenal world, the outer garment of God, is known, and communication betweenthe Self and what we call the natural world is set up. As the mind appropriatesand synthesizes this knowledge, the dweller in the form passes through thefollowing stages:1. Vibration is registered, and the environment has its effect upon the form.2. This effect is noted, but not understood. The man, under the slow and steadyimpact of this vibratory [147] effect, slowly awakens to consciousness orawareness.3. The environment begins to interest the man and he regards it as desirable.Steadily the attraction of the three worlds grows and holds the man inreiterated incarnation. (The word “re-iterated” is literally and moreacademically correct than the word “repeated.” Each of us is really are-iterated word, sounding in time and space.)4. Later, when the vibration of the environing forms of the natural worldbecomes monotonous through constant impact over many lives, the man begins toturn a deaf ear and an un-seeing eye upon the familiar phenomenal world ofdesire. He becomes insensitive to its vibratory impact and increasingly aware ofthe vibration of the Self.5. Later, on the Path of Probation and of Discipleship, this subtler vibratoryactivity exerts an increasing allure. The outer world ceases to attract. Theinner world of the self assumes paramount place in the desire nature.6. Little by little, using the language of modern psychology, within the outerform, which is the response apparatus for the process of becoming aware of thephenomenal world, the disciple builds a new subtler response apparatus wherebythe subjective worlds can be known.When this stage is reached there ensues a steady turning away from vibratorycontact with the outer worlds of form, and an atrophying of desire in thatdirection. All seems arid and undesirable, and all fails to satisfy the ardentand aspiring soul. The difficult process of re-orientation toward a new world, anew state of being and a new condition of awareness is set up, and because theinner subtle response apparatus is only in an embryonic [148] condition there isa devastating sense of loss, a groping in the dark, and a period of spiritualwrestling and exploration that tests the endurance and steadfastness of purposeof the aspirant to the very limits.But (and this is the encouraging point to be remembered) all “proceedeth underthe law and naught can hinder the work from going forward.” Note these words inRule IV. There comes a stage when a man is verily and indeed “founded on therock,” and though he may experience the alternation of light and shade, thoughthe waves of the purifying waters may roll over him, and threaten to sweep himoff his feet, and though he may feel himself deaf and dumb and blind, naught canultimately defeat the purpose of the soul. All that is lacking is the developedspiritual body which is equipped to respond to the vibration of the innerspiritual world. It exists in embryo, and the secret of its use lies in theattitude of the brain to the functions of the etheric body, as it exists as anintermediary between the brain, nervous system and the mind, or between thesoul, mind and the brain. This cannot be elaborated here but the hint can begiven for the reflection of the keen aspirant.We have therefore the following stages dealt with in Rule IV and pointed outwith lucid clarity, yet with that parsimony of phrase which distinguishes alloccult and symbolic writings:1. The integration of the form, as the result of the activity of the soul,through the use ofa. Sound,b. Light,c. Vibration.2. The development of a response apparatus for use in the phenomenal world.3. The eventual turning away from the phenomenal world, as the result of use andconsequent satiety, [149] and the gradual use of the subtler response apparatus.4. The response apparatus of the soul—mind, etheric body, brain and nervoussystem—is re-oriented, and the man becomes aware of the kingdom of the soul,another kingdom in nature.5. The turning away from the kingdom of the world to the kingdom of the soulbecomes an esoteric habit, and in this thought lies hid the secret of esotericpsychology. The man is stabilized in the spiritual life. Naught can now hinder.THE SCIENCE OF THE BREATHNow we come to the significant words in Rule IV. “The man breathes deeply.” Thisis a phrase covering many aspects of rhythmic living. It is the magical formulafor the science of pranayama. It covers the art of the creative life. It sweepsa man into tune with the pulsating life of God Himself, and this throughdetachment and re-orientation.It is notably interesting as a demonstration of the succinctness andinclusiveness of occult phrases as in Rule IV. The art of breathing is dealtwith in three phases, and these I commend to each of you for the most carefulconsideration.There is first the aspect of Inhalation . “The man breathes deeply.” From thevery depths of his being he draws the breath. In the process of phenomenalliving, he draws the very breath of life from the soul. This is the first stage.In the process of detaching himself from phenomenal living, he draws from thedepths of his being and experiences the life, that it may be rendered again backto the source from whence it came. In the occult life of the disciple, as hedevelops a new and subtler use of his response apparatus, he practices thescience of the breath, and discovers that through deep [150] breathing(including the three stages of the deep, middle, and top breath) he can bringinto activity, in the world of esoteric experiences, his vital body with itsforce centres. Thus the three aspects of “deep breathing” cover the entire soulexperience, and the relationship to the three types of breath, touched uponabove, can be worked out by the interested aspirant.Next we read “he concentrates his forces.” Here we have the stage indicatedwhich can be called retention of the breath. It is a holding of all the forcesof the life steadily in the place of silence, and when this can be done withease and with forgetfulness of process through familiarity and experience, thenthe man can see and hear and know in a realm other than the phenomenal world. Inthe higher sense this is the stage of contemplation, that “lull between twoactivities” as it has been so aptly called. The soul, the breath, the life haswithdrawn out of the three worlds, and in the “secret place of the most high” isat rest and at peace, contemplating the beatific vision. In the life of theactive disciple it produces those interludes which every disciple knows, when(through detachment and the capacity to withdraw) he is held by nothing in theworld of form. As he is but wrestling toward perfection and has not yetattained, these interludes of silence, withdrawingness, and of detachment arefrequently difficult and dark. All is silence and he stands appalled by theunknown, and by the apparently empty stillness in which he finds himself. Thisis called, in advanced cases, “the dark night of the soul”—the moment before thedawn, the hour before the light streams forth.In the science of Pranayama it is the moment following upon inhalation whereinall the forces of the body have (through the medium of the breath) been carriedupward to the head and concentrated there, prior to the stage of breathingforth. This moment of retention, when [151] properly carried forward, producesan interlude of intense concentration and it is in this moment that the aspirantmust seize opportunity. Herein lies a hint.Then comes the process of exhalation. We read in Rule IV “he drives thethought-form from him.” This is ever the result of the final stage of thescience of the breath. The form, vitalized by the one who breathes in correctrhythm, is sent forth to do its work and fulfil its mission. Study this ideawith care, for it holds the secret of creative work.In the experience of the soul, the form for manifestation in the three worlds iscreated through intense meditation, which is ever the paralleling activity ofbreathing. Then by an act of the will, resulting in a “breathing forth”, andengendered or arrived at dynamically in the interlude of contemplation orretention of the breath, the created form is sent forth into the phenomenalworld, to serve as a channel of experience, a medium of expression and aresponse apparatus in the three worlds of human living.In the life of the disciple, through meditation and discipline he learns toreach high moments of interlude whenever he concentrates his forces on the planeof soul life, and then again by an act of his will, he breathes forth hisspiritual purposes, plans and life into the world of experience. The thoughtform that he has constructed as to the part he has to play, and theconcentration of energy which he has succeeded in bringing about becomeeffective. The energy needed for the next step is breathed forth by the soul andpasses down into the vital body, thus galvanizing the physical instrument withthe needed constructive activity. That aspect of the plan which he hasappreciated in contemplation, and that part of the general purpose of theHierarchy in which his soul feels called upon to co-operate is breathed forthsimultaneously, [152] via the mind into the brain, and thus “he drives thethought forms from him.”Finally, in the science of Pranayama, this stage covers that exhaling breathwhich, when carried forward with thought and conscious purpose behind it, servesto vitalize the centres and fill each of them with dynamic life. More need notbe said here.Thus, in this science of “breathing deeply” we have the whole process ofcreative work and of the evolutionary unfoldment of God in nature covered. It isthe process whereby the Life, the One Existence, has brought the phenomenalworld into being, and Rule IV is a digest of the Creation. It is equally theformula under which the individual soul works as it centres its forces formanifestation in the three worlds of human experience.The right use of the Life-Breath is the whole art at which the aspirant, thedisciple, and the initiate work, bearing in mind however that the science of thephysical breath is the least important aspect and follows sequentially upon theright use of energy, which is the word we apply to the divine breath or life.Finally, in the mental life of the disciple, and in the great work of learningto be a conscious creator in mental matter and so produce results in thephenomenal world, this fourth Rule holds the instructions upon which the work isbased. It embodies the science of the entire magical work.Therefore, this Rule warrants the closest consideration and study. Rightlyunderstood and rightly studied it would lead each aspirant out of the phenomenalworld into the kingdom of the soul. Its instructions, if carried out, would leadthe soul back again into the phenomenal world as the creating force in soulmagic and as the manipulator and dominating factor of, and through, the mediumof the form.In the training of the occidental student, blind unquestioning [153] obedienceis never asked. Suggestions are made as to method and as to a technique whichhas proved effective for thousands of years and with many disciples. Some rulesas to breathing, as to helpful process and as to practical living on thephysical plane will be imparted, but in the training of the new type of discipleduring the coming age, it is the will of the watching Gurus and Rishis that theybe left freer than has heretofore been the case. This may mean a slightly slowerdevelopment at the beginning but will result, it is hoped, in a more rapidunfoldment during the later stages upon the Path of Initiation.Therefore, students are urged to go forward during their period of training withcourage and with joy, knowing that they are members of a band of disciples,knowing that they are not alone but that the strength of the band is theirs, theknowledge of the band is theirs too as they develop the capacity to apprehendit,—and knowing also that the love and wisdom and understanding of the watchingElder Brothers are back of every aspiring Son of God, e’en though apparently(and wisely) he is left to wrestle through to the light in the strength of hisown omnipotent soul."},{"pageContent":"RULE FIVEThree things engage the Solar Angel before the sheath created passes downward;the condition of the waters, the safety of the one who thus creates, and steadycontemplation. Thus are the heart, the throat, and eye, allied for tripleservice.THE SOUL AND ITS THOUGHT-FORMS[157] We have been dealing with the processes of creation as they concern:1. The Creator of a solar system or a planetary scheme.2. The Ego, as it creates its body of manifestation. It should here beremembered that the entire human family has been brought into manifestation by aparalleling group of egos.3. Man, as he creates those thought-forms by which he expresses himself, throughwhich he works, and by which he is surrounded. It should also here be borne inmind that this definite creative work is only possible to those who function onmental levels—the thinkers of the world and the disciples of the Masters.In every case, as we have seen, the objective form has been the result ofmeditation on the part of the creating agency, of response from the materialacted upon by the force generated in meditation, thus producing the building ofthe form, and its utilization through sound. This is succeeded by the stagewherein the form is seen objectively and becomes a vibrant living entity. Thusis “the Word made Flesh,” and thus do all forms—universes, men, and ensouledthoughts—come into being.This fifth rule touches upon three factors which engage the attention of thecreating agent before the physical form emerges into view on the exterior plane.These three are: [158]1. The condition of the waters.2. The safety of the one who thus creates.3. Steady contemplation.We will deal briefly with these three and then we will consider the threefactors which the disciple needs to relate if he ever aims to become an activeand potent co-operator with the Hierarchy. These are the Eye, the Heart, theThroat. The interpretation and significance of these rules can be carriedforward along several lines. For our purposes, the one followed will be thatrelating to the disciple and his work, and will deal with his training in themagical work of the ego, as that ego occupies and employs a physical form. Theseteachings are intended to be practical; they will emphasize the training anddiscipline of the disciple, and, scattered throughout, will be found those hintsand esoteric suggestions which, when followed, will lead the aspirant on toexperiment and to experience of truth. Those who are not true aspirants willfail to recognize the hints and thus will be preserved from danger and prematureexperience.Let us therefore take up the three factors which engage our attention, and letus consider them from the standpoint of the human being who is creatingthought-forms, and not primarily from the standpoint of a solar Creator or of anego, preparing to take incarnation through the medium of form. Two collateralthoughts are here of value. One is that the process of creating thought-forms ispart of the work done by every aspirant in the daily meditation process. If thestudent would remember that every time he sits down to his morning meditation heis learning to build and vitalize thought-forms, his work might assume greaterinterest. The tendency of most aspirants is to be occupied with theirdeficiencies in the work of meditation and their inability to control theirminds, whereas both those aspects of their endeavour [159] would be aided ifthey were to be occupied by the profoundly engrossing work of thought-formbuilding.A secondary and less important thought is that as egos, preparing to take humanbodies, are deeply engaged in meditation work, it is highly improbable that theycan be reached by the ordinary medium in the ordinary seance. At the most, onlythose who have passed over quite recently can be thus contacted, and they are,in most cases, in a condition of deep abstraction of a different kind. There isno time or purpose in enlarging upon this theme here but it is of interest tothose investigating these matters.1. The Condition of the WatersThe creating agency, man, has through the incentives of a co-ordinating purpose,intent meditation, and creative activity built the thought-form which he isensouling with his own vitality and directing with his will. The time has comefor that thought-form to be sent upon its mission and to carry out the purposeof its being. As we saw in the earlier rule, the form is “driven” from itscreator by the power of the expulsive breath. This is a symbolic statement but,at the same time, an experimental fact in the magical work. In the disciple’swork, there is often failure owing to his inability to understand both theesoteric and the literal significance of this expulsive breath as he carriesforward his meditation work. This expulsive breath is the result of a precedingperiod of rhythmic breathing, paralleled by concentrated meditation work, then adefinite focussing of the attention and the breath, as the purpose of thecreated form is mentally defined, and finally, the vitalizing of thethought-form, by its creator, and its consequent energizing into independentlife and activity.The first hindrance to the potency of the work comes through the failure of thedisciple to carry on these activities [160] simultaneously. The second cause offailure lies in his neglecting to consider the condition of the waters or thestate of the emotional substance into which this mental form must go and sogather to itself the matter of the astral plane which will enable it to become afunctioning entity on that plane. If it cannot do this, it becomes simply andeventually a dead form on the plane of mind, for it will lack that motivatingpower of desire which is necessary to carry it forward to completion on thephysical plane.It is interesting to remember this: If a thought-form is sent forth into theemotional world to gather to itself a body of desire (the impelling force whichproduces all objectivity) and is immersed in a “condition of the waters” whichcan best be described as purely selfish, all that occurs is as follows: It islost, by being drawn into the astral body of the disciple, which is the focalpoint for all astral energy employed by the disciple. It is swept into a vortexof which the individual astral body is the centre and loses its separateexistence. The simile of the whirlpool is of value here. The thinker is like aman throwing a toy boat from the shore into a stream of water. If he throws itinto a whirlpool, it is sucked in time into the central vortex and sodisappears. Many forms, thus constructed by an aspirant in his meditation workare lost and fail in their objective because of the chaotic and whirling stateof the aspirant’s emotional body. Thus good intentions come to naught; thus goodpurpose and planned work for the Master fail to materialize because, as thethought-form passes downward on to the plane of desire and emotion, it contactsonly the seething waters of fear, of suspicion, of hatred, of vicious or purelyphysical desire. These being more potent than the little form, drown it, and itpasses out of sight and out of existence, and the man becomes conscious ofanother abortive effort.[161] Or again, the “condition of the waters” is not that of a self-engenderedwhirlpool, but is more allied to that of a pool, stirred into a frothy andboiling surge, through the activities of others. There are many disciples whohave achieved a fair measure of self-control and of personal disinterestedness.They are not the victims of personality desire and aims, and are comparativelyfree from the whirlpool of selfish tendencies. But their astral bodies are againand again swept into a state of agitation by the group for, and in which, theywork. They are elated or depressed, satisfied or dissatisfied by the resultsthey achieve or fail to achieve; this achievement or lack of achievement and thesteadiness or disloyalties of their fellow servers produce agitation andemotional upset, and on this powerful reaction their thought-forms, constructedso diligently and prayerfully, come to naught. Their “skill in action” is lost,because they are tied to the desired result and so their labour producesnothing.There are many other “conditions of the waters” which each aspirant can forhimself supply. There is one more however upon which I would like to touch. Theemotional body of the disciple which must feed and nurture the baby thought-form(with its mental nucleus) is necessarily part of the planetary emotional formand hence vibrates in unison with that form. This should also be carefullyconsidered, for the emotional body is thrown into a state of activity by thegeneral astral condition and must be handled wisely from this angle.At this time there are three qualities predominating in the planetary form—fear,expectancy and a climaxing desire (in the human family) for material possession.Note the word “climaxing”. The summation of human desire for material happinesshas been reached, and the peak of that desire has been passed; thus mankind hasachieved and surmounted much. But the rhythm of the ages is strong.[162] These three qualities have to be grasped and discounted by the aspirant ashe seeks to serve from mental levels. In the place of fear he must substitutethat peace which is the prerogative of those who live always in the Light of theEternal; in the place of questioning expectancy he must substitute that placid,yet active, assurance of the ultimate objective which comes from a vision of thePlan and his contact with other disciples and later with the Master. Desire formaterial possession must be superseded by aspiration for those possessions whichare the joy of the soul—wisdom, love and power to serve. Peace, assurance andright aspiration! These three words, when understood and experienced in the lifeof every day, will bring about that right “condition of the waters” which willensure the survival of every thought-form, rightly engendered in meditation bythe man, functioning as a soul.2. The Safety of the One Who Thus CreatesIt might be said here with emphasis, even if it is a recognized truism, thatpeople are frequently slain (in the occult and therefore in the more importantsense) by their own thought-forms. Thought creation, through concentration andmeditation, is a potently dangerous matter. This must never be forgotten. Thereare forms of thought, unencumbered by much desire matter, which, failing to passdownward, poison the man on mental levels. This they do in two ways:1. By growing so potent on the mental plane that the man falls a victim to thething he has created. This is the “idée fixe” of the psychiatrist; the obsessionwhich drives to lunacy; the one-pointed line of thought which eventuallyterrorises its creator.2. By multiplying so fast that the mental aura of the man becomes like unto athick and dense cloud, through [163] which the light of the soul must fail topenetrate, and through which the love of human beings, the lovely and beautifuland comforting activities of nature and of life in the three worlds equally failto pierce. The man is smothered, is suffocated by his own thought-forms, andsuccumbs to the miasma which he himself has engendered.Or again, there are lines of thought which draw forth from the emotional body areaction of a poisonous nature. A certain line of thought is followed by a humanbeing in relation to his brethren. It breeds hatred, jealousy and envy, andworks through into manifestation in such a manner that it produces thosephysical plane activities which cause the death of their creator. This may beliteral as in the case of murder, which is in many cases the result ofcrystallised intent, or it may result in disease. Pure thought, right motive andloving desire are the true correctives of disease, and where the desire forthese (which does animate many) is raised to constructive thinking there will bethe gradual elimination of disease. As yet, though many desire, few think. Letit never be forgotten that the Great Ones do not look for those who only desireand aspire. They look for those who blend with their desire the determination tolearn to use their mental bodies and become creators, and who will workconstructively towards these ends.Thus it will be seen why, in all systems of true occult training, the emphasisis laid on right thinking, loving desire, and pure, clean living. Only thus canthe creative work be carried forward with safety, and only thus can thethought-form pass downward into objectivity, and be a constructive agent on theplane of human existence.3. Steady ContemplationYou will note here that the word ‘meditation’ is not used. The thought is adifferent one. The meditation [164] process, involving the use of thought andthe mental building of the form so that it can be completed and rounded out andin line with the thought-form of the disciple’s group of co-disciples, andtherefore with the Plan, has been completed to the best of the man’s ability.Now he must, with steadiness, contemplate that which he has created, and withequal steadiness inspire it with needed life, so that it can fulfill itsfunction.He ceases to reason, to think, to formulate, and to build in mental matter. Hesimply pours his life into the form and sends it forth to carry out his will.Just as long as he can contemplate and hold steady, so will his creation fulfillhis intention and act as his agent.Just so long as he can focus his attention on the ideal for which he created histhought-form and can link the form and the ideal together in one steady vision,just so long will it serve his purpose and express his ideal. Herein lies thesecret of all successful co-operation with the Plan.We will now study for a while the words “heart, throat, and eye,” for they havea peculiar significance. These three form the apparatus to be employed by alldisciples during the world cycle which is so rapidly coming.That there is not as yet a very large body of disciples in incarnation at thistime, and that the apparatus with many who are functioning on the level ofdiscipleship is but in embryo, is profoundly true. It should be rememberedhowever, that the world cycle has only just been inaugurated and will cover avast period of time. There are only about four hundred accepted disciples in theworld at this time—that is, men and women who really know they are disciples andknow what their work is and are doing it. There are nevertheless many hundreds(out of the present generation of young people) who stand on the verge ofacceptance, and thousands are upon the probationary path.[165] In all truly esoteric groups, there should be forming a group in which anintellectual understanding of this mechanism of heart, throat, and eye, will befound. It should be constituted of those who are submitting themselves to adiscipline and a training which will make its use a demonstrated fact in natureto them. I would call attention to those words, and request their careful study.A mechanism in the natural body comes into use in two ways: First, its use isinvoluntary, and there is no comprehension of how, or why, or when, theapparatus is used. An animal employs a mechanism, analogous in many respects tothat employed by man. He sees, and hears and functions organically along similarlines to the human, but lacks the mental understanding and the linking of causeand effect which are characteristic of the higher kingdom in nature.A similar state of affairs exists in the early stages of the path ofdiscipleship, and the final stages of the probationary path. The disciplebecomes aware of capacities and powers which are not as yet intelligently underhis control. He experiences flashes of insight, and of knowledge which seemunaccountable and of no immediate value. He contacts vibrations and thephenomena of other realms but remains unaware of the process whereby he has doneso, and is incompetent either to renew or recall the experience. Within hisetheric body, he senses active forces. Sometimes he can localise them, and inany case he admits theoretically that there is awakening into consciousactivity, a sevenfold structure, which is symbolic in form, and potent whenemployed. He cannot as yet control it and he is quite incapable of calling itinto intelligent co-operation with his purposes and ideas, no matter how hard hetries. All that he can do is to register such phenomena and keep a record ofthese experiences, bearing always in mind that in the early stages of hisunfoldment only the coarsest and most material [166] of the vibrations will beregistered on his brain consciousness. He simply has to wait and to bring hismind to bear upon the purifying of his vehicles and the elimination of all thathe recognises as liable to distort his vision. This period may be long or shortaccording as the aspirant is entering into the subjective consciousness for thefirst time or is taking up the thread of an older or partially achievedundertaking.I would like here, to make perfectly clear to all true and earnest aspirantsthat, in the training to be given during the next few decades, the unfoldment ofastral vision and hearing will be entirely ruled out, or (if it exists) willeventually have to be overcome. The true disciple has endeavoured to centrehimself on the mental plane with the object in view of transferring hisconsciousness higher still, into the wider and inclusive awareness of the soul.His aim is to include the higher, and there is no need for him, at this stage,to regain that astral facility which was the possession, as you well know, ofthe little evolved races of the earth, and of many of the higher animals. Lateron, when adeptship has been reached, he can function on the astral plane shouldhe so choose, but it should be remembered, that the Master works with the soulaspect of humanity (and of all forms) and does not work with their astralbodies. This has been oft forgotten by teachers both in the East and in theWest.In working with souls the true technique of evolution is carried forward, for itis the soul within the forms in every kingdom in nature which is responsible forthe developing work of, and within, the form. May I say therefore to studentsthat their main objective is to become aware of the soul, to cultivate soulconsciousness, and to learn to live and work as souls. Until such time as theiruse of their apparatus becomes voluntary they would be well advised to traintheir minds, study the [167] laws governing manifestation, and learn to includeall that which we now cover by the word ‘higher’—a misnomer, but it mustsuffice.Second, when the use of the subjective instrument becomes voluntary and a manknows how it should be employed, when he is using it, and can discontinue itsuse or resume it at will, then his whole status changes and his usefulnessincreases. Through the use of the mind, humanity has become aware of thepurposes and employment of the physical apparatus. Now through the use of astill higher faculty, which is a characteristic of the soul, he enters intovoluntary and intelligent control of his instrument and learns to understand thepurposes for which it exists. This higher faculty is the intuition .May I add with emphasis that only as the man becomes intuitive does he become ofuse in a Master’s group and I commend to all aspirants that they most carefullystudy the meaning and significance of the intuition. When it is beginning tofunction, then the disciple can pass from the stage of probation to that ofacceptance in a Master’s group.You might ask here how this can be known or ascertained by the probationer.A great deal of training is given to a probationer without his reallyrecognising it consciously. Fault tendencies are indicated to him as he seekswith sincerity to train himself for service, and the analysis of motive whentruthfully undertaken, serves amazingly to lift the would-be disciple out of theastral or emotional world into that of the mind. It is in the mental world thatthe Masters are first contacted, and there They must be sought.But the time has come when the Light in the head is not only present but can besomewhat used. The karma of the aspirant is such that it becomes possible forhim, through strenuously applied effort, to handle his life in [168] such a waythat he can not only fulfill his karma and carry out his obligations, but hassufficient determination to enable him to handle the problems and obligations ofdiscipleship also. His service to others is carried out with the right motive,and is beginning to count and make its power felt, and he is losing sight of hisown interests in those of others. When this occurs certain esoteric happeningstake place.The Master confers with some of His senior disciples as to the advisability ofadmitting the aspirant within the group aura, and of blending his vibration withthat of the group. Then, if decision is arrived at, for the space of two years asenior disciple acts as the intermediary betwixt the Master and the newlyaccepted aspirant. He works with the new disciple, stepping down (if I so mightexpress it) the vibration of the Master so as to accustom the disciple’s bodiesto the higher increased rate. He impresses the disciple’s mind, via his Ego,with the group plans and ideals, and he watches his reaction to life’soccurrences and opportunities. He practically assumes, pro tem, the duties andposition of Master.All this time the aspirant remains in ignorance of what has happened and isunaware of his subjective contacts. He, however, recognizes in himself threethings:Increased mental activity. This at first will give him much trouble, and he willfeel as if he were losing in mind control instead of gaining it, but this isonly a temporary condition and gradually he will assume command.Increased responsiveness to ideas and increased capacity to vision the plan ofthe Hierarchy. This will make him, in the early stages, fanatical to a degree.He will be continually swept off his feet with new ideals, new isms, new modesof living, new dreams for race betterment. He will take up one cult afteranother as they seem to make possible the coming millennium. But after [169] atime he regains his poise, and purpose assumes control of his life. He works athis own job, and carries forward his contribution to the activity of the whole,to the best of his ability.Increased psychic sensitiveness. This is both an indication of growth and at thesame time a test. He is apt to be taken in by the allurements of the psychicpowers; he will be tempted to side-track his efforts from specialised service tothe race into the exploitation of the psychic powers, and their use for selfassertion. The aspirant has to grow in all parts of his nature, but until he canfunction as the soul, the psyche, consciously and with the use of cooperativeintelligence, the lower powers must be quiescent. They can only be safely usedby advanced disciples and initiates. They are weapons and instruments of serviceto be then used in the three worlds by those who are still tied by the Law ofRebirth to those worlds. Those who have passed through the great Liberation andhave “occultly crossed the bridge” have no need to employ the powers inherent inthe lower sheaths. They can use the infallible knowledge of the intuition, andthe illumination of the principle of Light.There is much misapprehension in people’s minds as to how a Master lets anaccepted disciple become aware that he is accepted. An impression is abroad thathe is told so and that an interview is accorded wherein the Master accepts himand starts him to work. Such is not the case. The occult law holds good indiscipleship as in initiation, and the man goes forward blindly. He hopes, buthe does not know; he expects that it may be so, but no tangible assurance isgiven; from a study of himself and of the requirements he arrives at theconclusion that perhaps he has reached the status of accepted disciple. Hetherefore acts on that assumption and with care he watches his acts, guards hiswords, and controls his thoughts so that no overt act, unnecessary word orunkind [170] thought will break the rhythm which he believes has been set up. Heproceeds with his work but intensifies his meditation; he searches his motives;he seeks to equip his mental body; he sets before himself the ideal of serviceand seeks ever to serve; and then (when he is so engrossed in the work on handthat he has forgotten himself), suddenly one day he sees the One Who has for solong seen him.This may come in two ways: in full waking consciousness or by the registering ofthe interview on the physical brain as it has been participated in during thehours of sleep.But accompanying this recognition of the event by the disciples will comecertain other recognitions.1. The event is recognised as fact past all controversy. No doubt remains in thedisciple’s mind.2. There is recognised an inhibition on the disciple’s part to mention thehappening to any one. Months or years may slip away before the disciple willmention it, and then only to those who are also recognised as disciples or tosome fellow worker, also under the same group influence, whose right it is toknow and whose right is sanctioned by the Master of the group.3. Certain factors, governing the Master’s relation to the disciple, aregradually recognised and begin increasingly to govern the disciple’s life.a. He recognises that his points of contact with his Master are governed bygroup emergency and need, and deal with his group service. It gradually dawns onhim that his Master is only interested in him insofar as his ego can be used inservice, through the personality on the physical plane. He begins to realisethat his Master works with his soul and that it is his ego, therefore, which isen rapport with the Master and not the personal self. His problem, therefore,becomes increasingly clear and this is the problem of all disciples. It is tokeep the [171] channel of communication open between the soul and the brain, viathe mind, so that when the Master seeks to communicate, He can do so at once andeasily. Sometimes a Master has to wait weeks before He can get His disciple’sear, for the channel upward is closed and the soul is not en rapport with thebrain. This is especially true of the early stages of discipleship.b. He finds that it is he who shuts the door in the majority of cases throughlower psychism, physical disability, and lack of mind control, and he thereforediscovers that he has to work constantly and ceaselessly with his lower self.c. He finds that one of the first things he has to do is to learn todiscriminate between:His own soul’s vibration.The vibration of the group of disciples with whom he is associated.The vibration of the Master.All three are different and it is easy to confuse them, especially at first. Itis a safe rule for aspirants to assume when they contact a high vibration andstimulus, that it is their own soul contacting them, the Master in the heart,and not run off with the idea (so flattering to their pride and personality)that the Master is endeavouring to reach them.d. He finds also that it is not the habit of the Masters to flatter or to makepromises to their disciples. They are too busy and too wise, nor do They troubleThemselves to tell Their disciples that they are destined for high office, orthat they are Their intermediaries and that the Hierarchy is depending uponthem. Ambition, love of power, and the self-sufficiency which characterises manymental types test out the struggling aspirant, and he gets from his personalityall that he needs in that line. These qualities delude him and lead him astray,forcing [172] him onto a pedestal from which eventually he must descend. TheMasters say nothing to feed pride in Their disciples, nor do They speak words tothem which could foster in Their chelas the spirit of separateness.e. The disciple soon finds also that the Masters are not easily accessible. Theyare busy men, ill able to spare even a few moments in which to communicate withthe disciple, and only in emergencies, in the case of a beginner on the Path ofDiscipleship, do the Masters expend the necessary energy with which to get enrapport. With old and tried disciples, the contacts are more frequent, beingmore easily achieved and bearing more rapid results. It should be remembered,however, that the newer the disciple the more he demands attention and considershe should have it. The old and more experienced servers seek to fulfil theirobligations and carry forward their work with as little contact with the Mastersas possible. They seek to save the Master’s time and frequently consider aninterview with the Master as demonstrating failure on their part, and producing,therefore, regret that they have had to take the Master’s precious time, andforce Him to use His energy in order to safeguard the work from error and thedisciple perhaps from harm. The aim of every high disciple is to carry out hiswork and be en rapport with the spiritual force centre which is his group, andthus in steady touch with the Master, without interviews and phenomenalcontacts. Many only expect to contact their Master once a year, usually at thetime of the full moon in May.f. He finds also that the relationship between Master and disciple is governedby law and that there are definite stages of contact and grades in the desiredrapport. These can be enumerated, but cannot be enlarged upon.1. The stage wherein a disciple is contacted by the Master through another chelaon the physical plane. This is the stage of “Little Chelaship”.[173] 2. The stage wherein a higher disciple directs the chela from the egoiclevel. This is the stage called a “Chela in the Light”.3. The stage wherein, according to necessity, the Master contacts the chelathrough:a. A vivid dream experience.b. A symbolic teaching.c. A using of a thought form of the Master.d. A contact in meditation.e. A definite, remembered interview in the Master’s Ashram.This is definitely the stage of Accepted Disciple.4. The stage wherein, having shown his wisdom in work, and his appreciation ofthe Master’s problem, the disciple is taught how (in emergencies) to attract theMaster’s attention and thus draw on His strength and knowledge and advice. Thisis an instantaneous happening, and practically takes none of the Master’s time.This stage has the peculiar name of “a chela on the Thread, or Sutratma.”5. The stage wherein he is permitted to know the method whereby he may set up avibration and a call which will entitle him to an interview with the Master.This is only permitted to those trusted chelas who can be depended upon not touse the knowledge for anything except the need of the work; no personalityreason or distress would prompt them to use it. At this stage the disciple iscalled “one within the aura.”6. The stage wherein the disciple can get his Master’s ear at any time. He is inclose touch always. This is the stage wherein a chela is being definitelyprepared for an immediate initiation or, having taken initiation, is being givenspecialised work to do in collaboration with his ——. At this stage he isdescribed as “one within his Master’s heart.”[174] There is a later stage of a still closer identification, where there is ablending of the Lights, but there is no adequate paraphrase of the terms used tocover the name. The six stages above mentioned have been paraphrased foroccidental understanding and must in no way be considered as translations of theancient terms.Such are some of the teachings concerning disciples and their recognitions andit is valuable for aspirants to ponder them. It should be realised that thoughgood character, high ethics, sound morality and spiritual aspiration are basicand unalterable requirements, yet more is needed if the right to enter theMaster’s Ashram is to be granted.To be admitted to the privilege of being an outpost of His consciousnessrequires an unselfishness and a self-surrender for which few are prepared; to bedrawn within His aura so that the disciple’s aura forms an integral part of thegroup aura presupposes a purity which few can cultivate; to have the ear of theMaster and to earn the right to contact Him at will necessitates a sensitivenessand a fine discrimination which few would care to purchase at the price. Yet adoor stands wide open to all who care to come, and no earnest, sincere soul, whomeets the requirements, ever receives a rebuff.There is no question at this time that those who are in any way advanced inevolution are having that evolution hastened as never before in the history ofthe world. The crisis is so grave and the need of the world so great, that thosewho can contact the inner side of life, who can even in a small way sense thevibrations of the senior disciples and the Elder Brothers of the race, and whocan bring down the ideals, as known on the higher planes, are being verycarefully, forcefully, yet strenuously trained. It is necessary that they shouldbe enabled to act accurately and adequately as transmitters and interpreters.I would like to point out certain factors and methods [175] which should beborne in mind in connection with inspirational writing and mediumship, and whichhave a bearing on the writing of such books as The Secret Doctrine, theScriptures of the world and those transmitted volumes which potently affect thethought of the race. The interpretation of the process arises from many causes;the status of the writers can be overestimated or not sufficiently appreciated;the terms used by the transmitter being dependent upon his educational statusmay also be incorrect or give rise to misinterpretation. It is necessary,therefore, that some understanding of the process should be found.Some transmitters work entirely on astral levels and their work is necessarilypart of the great illusion. They are unconscious mediums and are unable to checkthe source from whence the teachings come; if they claim to know that source,they are frequently in error. Some receive teaching from discarnate entities ofno higher evolution, and frequently of lower, than themselves. Some are simplyabstracting the content of their own subconsciousnesses, and hence we have thebeautiful platitudes, couched in Christian phraseology, and tinctured by themystical writings of the past, which litter the desks of disciples, workingconsciously on the physical plane.Some work only on mental levels, learning, through telepathy, that which theElder Brothers of the race and their own souls have to impart. They tap thesources of knowledge stored in the egoic consciousness. They become aware of theknowledge stored up in the brains of disciples on the same ray as themselves.Some of them, being outposts of the Master’s consciousness, become alsocognizant of His thought. Some use several of the methods, either consciously orunconsciously. When they work consciously, it is then possible for them tocorrelate the teaching given and, under the Law of Correspondences [176] andthrough the use of symbols (which they see through mental clairvoyance), toascertain the accuracy of their teaching. Those who work unconsciously (I refernot to astral psychics), can use only trust and discrimination until they arefurther evolved. They must accept nothing that contradicts facts impartedthrough the Lodge’s great Messengers, and they must be ready to superimpose uponthe modicum of knowledge which they possess a further structure of greaterextent.Each generation now should produce its seers. I like the word spelt “see-ers”,for to see is to know. The fault of all of you is that you see not; you perceivean angle, a point of vision, a partial aspect of the great fabric of truth, butall that lies hidden behind is occult to your three dimensional vision. It isnecessary for those who want to act as true transmitters and intermediariesbetween the Knowers of the race and the “little ones” that they keep their eyeson the horizon and seek thus to extend their vision; that they hold steadily theinner realization that they already have and seek to increase its scope; thatthey hold on to the truth that all things are headed towards the revelation, andthat the form matters not. They must seek pre-eminently to be dependableinstruments, unswayed by passing storms. They must endeavor to remain free fromdepression, no matter what occurs; liberated from discouragement; with a keensense of proportion; a right judgment in all things; a regulated life; adisciplined physical body and a whole-hearted devotion to humanity. Where thesequalities are present, the Masters can begin to use Their destined workers;where they are absent, other instruments must be found.Some people learn at night and regularly bring over into their physical brainconsciousness the facts they need to know and the teachings they shouldtransmit. Many methods are tried, suited to the nature of the aspirant [177] orchela. Some have brains that act telepathically as transmitters. I deal withsafer and rarer methods which utilize the mental vehicle as the intermediarybetween the soul and the brain, or between the teacher and the disciple. Methodsof communication on the astral level, such as the ouija board, the planchettepencil, automatic writing, the direct voice and statements made by thetemporarily obsessed medium are not utilized as a rule by chelas, though thedirect voice has had its use at times. The higher mental methods are moreadvanced and surer—even if rarer.The true transmitters from the higher egoic levels to the physical plane proceedin one or other of the following ways:1. They write from personal knowledge, and therefore employ their concrete mindsat the task of stating this knowledge in terms that will reveal the truth tothose that have the eyes to see, and yet will conceal that which is dangerousfrom the curious and the blind. This is a hard task to accomplish, for theconcrete mind expresses the abstract most inadequately and, in the task ofembodying the truth in words, much of the true significance is lost.2. They write because they are inspired. Because of their physical equipment,their purity of life, their singleness of purpose, their devotion to humanityand the very karma of service itself, they have developed the capacity to touchthe higher sources from which pure truth, or symbolic truth, flows. They can tapthought currents that have been set in motion by that great band ofContemplators, called Nirmanakayas, or those definite, specialized thoughtcurrents originated by one of the great staff of teachers. Their brains, beingreceptive transmitters, enable them to express these contacted thoughts onpaper—the accuracy of the transmission being dependent upon the receptivity ofthe instrument (that is, [178] the mind and the brain) of the transmitter. Inthese cases, the form of words and the sentences are largely left to the writer.Therefore, the appropriateness of the terms used and the correctness of thephraseology will depend upon his mental equipment, his educational advantages,the extent of his vocabulary and his inherent capacity to understand the natureand quality of the imparted thought and ideas.3. They write because of the development of the inner hearing. Their work islargely stenographic, yet is also partially dependent upon their standard ofdevelopment and their education. A certain definite unfoldment of the centres,coupled with karmic availability, constitutes the basis of choice by the teacheron the subtler planes who seeks to impart a definite instruction and aspecialized line of thought. The responsibility as to accuracy is thereforedivided between the one who imparts the teaching and the transmitting agent. Thephysical plane agent must be carefully chosen and the accuracy of the impartedinformation, as expressed on the physical plane, will depend upon hiswillingness to be used, his positive mental polarization, and his freedom fromastralism. To this must be added the fact that the better educated a man may be,the wider his range of knowledge and scope of world interests, the easier itwill be for the teacher on the inner side to render, through his agency, theknowledge to be imparted. Frequently the dictated data may be entirely foreignto the receiver. He must have a certain amount, therefore, of education, and behimself a profound seeker of truth before he will be chosen to be the recipientof teachings that are intended for the general public or for esoteric use. Aboveeverything else, he must have learnt through meditation to focus himself on themental plane. Similarity of vibration and of interests hold the clue to thechoice of a transmitter. [179] Note that I say; similarity of vibration and ofinterests and not equality of vibration and of interests.This form of work might be divided into three methods: There is first the higherclairaudience that speaks directly from mind to mind. This is not exactlytelepathy but a form of direct hearing. The teacher will speak to the discipleas person to person. A conversation is therefore carried on entirely on mentallevels with the higher faculties as the focusing point. The use of the headcentres is involved and they must both be vivified before this method can beemployed. In the astral body the centres corresponding to the physical have tobe awakened before astral psychism is possible. The work that I refer to hereinvolves a corresponding vivification in the mental body counterparts.Secondly, we have telepathic communication. This is the registry in the physicalbrain consciousness of information imparted:a. Direct from Master to pupil; from disciple to disciple; from student tostudent.b. From Master or disciple to the ego and thence to the personality, via theatomic sub-planes. You will note therefore that only those in whose bodiesatomic sub-plane matter is found can work this way. Safety and accuracy lie inthis equipment.c. From ego to ego via the causal body and transmitted direct according to thepreceding method or stored up to work through gradually and at need.Thirdly, we have inspiration. This involves another aspect of development.Inspiration is analogous to mediumship, but is entirely egoic. It utilizes themind as the medium of transmission to the brain of that which the soul knows.Mediumship usually describes the process when confined entirely to the astrallevels. On the egoic plane this involves inspiration. Ponder on this explanationfor it explains much. Mediumship is dangerous. [180] Why is this so? Because themental body is not involved and so the soul is not in control. The medium is anunconscious instrument, he is not himself the controlling factor; he iscontrolled. Frequently also the discarnate entities who employ this method ofcommunication, utilizing the brain or voice apparatus of the medium, are nothighly evolved, and are quite incapable of employing mental plane methods.Some people combine the method of inspiration and of receiving instruction alongvarious lines and, when this is the case, great accuracy of transmission isfound. Occasionally again, as in the case of H. P. B. you have deep knowledge,ability to be inspired and mental clairaudience combined. When this is the caseyou have a rare and useful instrument for the aiding of humanity.Inspiration originates on the higher levels; it presupposes a very high point inevolution, for it involves the egoic consciousness and necessitates the use ofatomic matter, thus opening up a wide range of communicators. It spells safety.It should be remembered that the soul is always good; it may lack knowledge inthe three worlds and in this way be deficient; but it harbors no evil.Inspiration is always safe, whereas mediumship is always to be avoided.Inspiration may involve telepathy, for the person inspiring may do three things:a. He may use the brain of the appointed channel, throwing thoughts into it.b. He may occupy his disciple’s body, the latter standing aside, consciously, inhis subtler bodies, but surrendering his physical body.c. A third method is one of a temporary fusing, if I might so call it,—anintermingling when the user and the used alternate or supplement, as needed, todo the appointed work. I cannot explain more clearly.4. They write what they see. This method is not of such a high order. You willnote that in the first case [181] you have wisdom or availability on buddhic orintuitional levels; in the second case you have transmission from the causalbody, from the higher mental levels; in the third case you have sufficientdevelopment to enable the aspirant to receive dictation. In the fourth case, youhave the ability to read in the astral light but frequently no ability todifferentiate between that which is past, that which is, and that which will be.Therefore you have illusion and inaccuracy. This is a method, however, sometimesused but—unless directly used under stimulation applied by a Master—it is liableto be most misleading, as is its corollary, astral clairaudience. It is themethod of mental clairvoyance, and requires a trained interpreting mind, whichis rare indeed to find.In all these cases that I have cited error may creep in owing to physicallimitation and the handicap of words, but in the case of those who write frompersonal knowledge the errors in expression will be of no real moment; whilst inthe second and third cases the errors will be dependent upon the point inevolution of the transmitting agent. If, however, he couples intelligence,devotion and service, with his capacity to receive and hear, he will sooncorrect the errors himself and his understanding will grow.Later two new methods will be employed which will facilitate the transmission oftruth from the inner side to the outer plane. Precipitated writing will be givento those who can be trusted, but the time is not yet for its general use. Itwill be necessary to wait until the work of the esoteric schools has reached amore definite phase of development. Conditions as yet are not appropriate, buthumanity is urged to be ready and open-minded and prepared for this development.Later will come the power to materialize thought-forms. People will come intoincarnation who will have the ability temporarily to create and vitalize thesethought-forms, and [182] so enable the general public to see them. The time,however, is not yet. There is too much fear, and not enough experience of truthin the world. More knowledge must be acquired as to the nature of thought and ofmatter, and this must be followed experimentally by those with acute trainedminds, a high rate of vibration, and bodies built of the finest matter. Theattainment of this will involve discipline, pain, self-abnegation andabstinence. See you to it.The group of Teachers with whom the average aspirants and probationary disciplesmay be in touch on the mental plane are but men of like passions but with alonger experience upon the path and a wiser control of themselves. They do notwork with aspirants because They personally like or care for them, but becausethe need is great and They seek those whom They can train. The attitude of mindthat They look for is that of teachableness and the ability to record andrefrain from questioning until more is known. Then the aspirant is urged toquestion everything. May I remind you of the words of one Teacher who said,“Know us for sane and balanced men who teach as we taught on earth, notflattering our pupils but disciplining them. We lead them on, not forcing themforward by feeding their ambitions by promises of power, but giving theminformation and leading them to use it in their work, knowing that right use ofknowledge leads to experience and achievement of the goal.”How often does one find a student more occupied with the Master and what He willdo than he is with his own side of the question! And yet the fitting of himselffor service and the equipping of himself for useful cooperation is, or shouldbe, his main preoccupation.Inquiry about the Master is more interesting than inquiry about the neededqualifications for discipleship. Interest for the data available in relation tothe Adepts is more potent than the steadfast investigation into limitations[183] and disabilities which should engross the aspirant’s attention. Curiosityas to the habits and methods of specific Masters and Their ways of handlingTheir disciples is more prone to be displayed than patient application to righthabits and ways of work in the life of the would-be disciple. All these mattersare side issues and only handicap and limit, and one of the first things weadvise one who would enter into communication with the Masters is to take hiseyes off those things which concern him not, focus his attention on the neededsteps and stages which should demonstrate in his life, and eliminate thosewasted moments, moods and thought periods which so often occupy the major partof his thought life.When a Master seeks to find those fitted to be instructed and taught by Him, Helooks for three things first of all. Unless these are present, no amount ofdevotion or aspiration, and no purity of life and mode of living suffices. It isessential that all aspirants should grasp these three factors and so savethemselves much distress of mind and wasted motion.1. The Master looks for the light in the head.2. He investigates the karma of the aspirant.3. He notes his service in the world.Unless there is indication that the man is what is termed esoterically “alighted lamp” it is useless for the Master to waste His time. The light in thehead, when present, is indicative of:a. The functioning to a greater or less extent of the pineal gland, which is (asis well known) the seat of the soul and the organ of spiritual perception. It isin this gland that the first physiological changes take place incident upon soulcontact and this contact is brought about through definite work along meditationlines, mind control, and the inflow of spiritual force.[184] b. The aligning of the man on the physical plane with his ego, soul orhigher self, on the mental plane and the subordination of the physical planelife and nature to the impress and control of the soul. This is coveredsufficiently in the first two or three chapters of Letters on Occult Meditationand these should be studied by aspirants.c. The downflow of force via the sutratma, magnetic cord, or thread from thesoul to the brain via the mind body. The whole secret of spiritual vision,correct perception and right contact lies in the proper appreciation of theabove statement, and therefore the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are ever thetext-book of disciples, initiates and adepts, for therein are found those rulesand methods which bring the mind under control, stabilize the astral body and sodevelop and strengthen the thread soul that it can and does become a veritablechannel of communication between the man and his ego. The light of illuminationstreams down into the brain cavity and throws into objectivity three fields ofknowledge. This is often forgotten and hence the undue distress and prematureinterpretations of the partially illuminated disciple or probationer.The light first throws into relief and brings into the foreground ofconsciousness those thought-forms and entities which depict the lower life, andwhich (in their aggregate) form the Dweller on the Threshold.Thus the first thing of which the aspirant becomes aware is that which he knowsto be undesirable and the revelation of his own unworthiness and limitations,and the undesirable constituents of his own aura burst on his vision. Thedarkness which is in him is intensified by the light which glimmers faintly fromthe centre of his being and frequently he despairs of himself and descends intothe depths of depression. All mystics bear witness to this and it is a periodwhich must be [185] lived through until the pure light of day drives all shadowsand darkness away and little by little the life is brightened and lighteneduntil the sun in the head is shining in all its glory.d. Finally, the light in the head is indicative of the finding of the Path andthere remains then for the man to study and understand the technique whereby thelight is centralized, intensified, entered and eventually becomes that magneticline (like unto a spider’s thread) which can be followed back until the sourceof the lower manifestation is reached and the soul consciousness is entered. Theabove language is symbolic and yet vitally accurate but is expressed thus inorder to convey information to those who know, and protect those who as yet knownot.“The path of the just is as a shining Light” and yet at the same time a man hasto become that path itself. He enters the light and becomes the light andfunctions then as a lamp set in a dark place, carrying illumination to othersand lighting the way before them.The next point that a Master has to consider before admitting a man into Hisgroup is whether or no such a step is karmically possible or whether there existin a man’s record those conditions which negate his admission in this life.There are three main factors to be considered separately and in their relationto each other.First, are there such karmic obligations in a man’s present life as would renderit impossible for him to function as a disciple? In this connection it must becarefully borne in mind that a man can become a disciple and merit the attentionof a Master only when his life counts for something in the world of men, when heis an influence in his sphere, and when he is moulding and acting upon the mindsand hearts of other men.Until that is the case it is waste of a Master’s time to [186] personally dealwith him, for he can be adequately helped in other ways and has, for instance,much knowledge from books and teachers which is as yet theory and not practice,and much experience to pass through under the guidance of his own ego, theMaster in his heart. When a man is a disciple he is one because he can be usedfor working out the plan of the Hierarchy, and can be influenced to materializethose endeavours which are planned to enable humanity to make the needed forwardsteps. This involves (in his physical plane life) time, and thought, rightcircumstance, and other considerations and it is quite possible for a man tohave reached the stage from the character standpoint, where he merits therecognition of a Master, and yet have obligations and duties to work throughwhich would handicap him for active service in some particular life. This theMaster has to consider and this a man’s own ego also considers.The result quite frequently at this time is that (perhaps unconsciously to thephysical brain) a man will shoulder a great amount of experience, and undertakethe working out of an abnormal amount of responsibility in one particular life,in order to free himself for service and chelaship in a later life. He worksthen at the equipping of himself for the next life, and at the patientperformance of duty in his home, his circle of friends, and his business. Herealises that from the egoic standpoint one life is but a short matter and soongone and that by study, intelligent activity, loving service, and patientendurance, he is working out of those conditions which are preventing his promptacceptance in a Master’s group.A Master also studies the condition of an aspirant’s physical body and of thesubtler bodies to see whether in them are to be found states of consciousnesswhich would hinder usefulness and act as obstacles. These conditions arelikewise karmic and must be adjusted before his admission among other chelasbecomes possible. A sick [187] physical body, an astral body prone to moods,emotions and psychic delusions, and a mental body uncontrolled or ill-equippedare all dangerous to the student unless straightened out and perfected. A chelais subjected constantly to the play of force coming to him from three mainsources:1. His own ego,2. His Master,3. The group of co-disciples,and unless he is strong, purified and controlled, these forces will serve but tostimulate undesirable conditions, to foster that which should be eliminated andto bring to the surface all the hidden weaknesses. That this has to be doneinevitably is so, but much must be done along this line before admission into agroup of disciples; otherwise much of the Master’s valuable time will perforcebe given to the elimination and nullifying of the effects of the chela’s violentreactions on other chelas in the same group. It is better to wait and workgradually and intelligently oneself than force one’s way unprepared into linesof forces before one can handle either them or their consequences.Another factor that an adept has to consider is whether there are in incarnationthose chelas with whom a man has to work and who are karmically linked to him byancient ties and old familiarity in similar work.Sometimes it may be deemed wiser for a man to wait a little while before beingpermitted to step off the physical path until a life comes in which his ownco-workers, keyed to his vibration, and accustomed to work with him, are also inphysical bodies, for a Master’s group is entered in service to be rendered andspecific work to be done, and not because a man is to receive a culturaltraining which will make him an adept some day. Chelas train themselves and whenready for any work a Master uses [188] them. They develop themselves and workout their own salvation and as step by step is taken their particular Masterlays more and more responsibility upon them. He will train them in servicetechnique, and in vibratory response to the Plan, but they learn to controlthemselves and to fit themselves for service.There are other karmic factors to be considered by a Master but these are thethree paramount ones and of the most importance for aspirants to consider now.They are specified so that no true and earnest worker need be depressed anddiscouraged if he has no conscious link with the Master and is unaware of anyaffiliation with an esoteric group of chelas. It may not be because he is notfit. It may simply be because his ego has chosen this life to clear the decksfor later action, to eliminate hindrances in one or other, or all of the threelower bodies, or to wait for that time when his admission may count the most.The third factor, that of service, for which the Master looks is one upon whichthe aspirant has the least to say and may very probably misinterpret. Spiritualambition, the desire to function as the centre of a group, the longing to hearoneself speaking, teaching, lecturing, or writing are often wrongly interpretedby the aspirant as service. The Master looks not at a worker’s worldly force orstatus, not at the numbers of people who are gathered around his personality butat the motives which prompt his activity and at the effect of his influence uponhis fellowmen. True service is the spontaneous outflow of a loving heart and anintelligent mind; it is the result of being in the right place and stayingthere; it is produced by the inevitable inflow of spiritual force and not bystrenuous physical plane activity; it is the effect of a man’s being what hetruly is, a divine Son of God, and not by the studied effect of his words ordeeds. A true server gathers around him those whom it is his duty to serve [189]and aid by the force of his life and his spiritualised personality, and not byhis claims or loud speaking. In self-forgetfulness he serves; in self-abnegationhe walks the earth, and he gives no thought to the magnitude or the reverse ofhis accomplishment and has no pre-conceived ideas as to his own value orusefulness. He lives, serves, works and influences, asking nothing for theseparated self.When a Master sees this manifestation in a man’s life, as the result of theawakening of the inner light and the adjustment of his karmic obligations, thenHe sounds out a note and waits to see if the man recognises his own group note.On this recognition, he is admitted into his own group of co-workers, and canstand in the presence of his Master.HEART, THROAT AND EYELater, when the knowledge here conveyed is assimilated, the aspirant will cometo an understanding of the true meaning of the heart, the throat, and theeye—which it is the object of the Guides of the race to stimulate intofunctioning activity at this time. We will therefore consider now:1. The heart centre, the throat centre, and the centre between the eyes.2. Their awakening and co-ordination.3. To what uses they will be put in the coming world cycle.This subject is of vital importance to the modern aspirant, for the mechanism ofthe heart, the throat, and the eye—constituting part of the inner structurewhich he must learn to use—has to be mastered and consciously employed by himbefore any true creative work is possible. When I use the words ‘creative work’I am speaking esoterically and am not referring to the valuable work [190] doneby the artists of the world in their many lines of expression. Their efforts, tothe seer, are indicative of an inner stirring, of an inner co-ordination and amotivated activity which will lead to true esoteric endeavour and to creativework on the subtler planes.I am assuming in the student an elementary knowledge of the vital body and ofits force centres and I am assuming that these seven centres or lotuses have,theoretically, a place in his imagination. I use the word imagination withpurposeful intent, for until there is knowledge and clear vision, imaginativeassumption is a potent factor in bringing about the activity of the centres.Let us, for the sake of clarity, list these lotuses with their petal numbers,and their location. Their colours are immaterial at present from the standpointof the student, for much that has been given out is erroneous or in the natureof a blind, and in any case, the esoteric colours are widely different from theexoteric.1. The base of the spine..............4 petals.2. The sacral centre.....................6 petals.3. The solar plexus centre...........10 petals.Diaphragm.4. Heart centre.............................12 petals.5. Throat centre...........................16 petals.6. Centre between the eyebrows..2 petals.7. Head centre..............................1000 petals.Next, let the student remember two important facts, which may be regarded aselementary and preliminary but which nevertheless have to be worked out intoconscious realisation and become part of the purposed intent of the aspirant’straining. It is easy to generalise. It is difficult to realise. It is simple tograsp the informative intellectual data regarding the centres of force; it ismost difficult to bring about the rearrangement of the forces flowing throughthese vortices, and to learn to function consciously through the higher centres,subordinating the [191] lower ones. This has to be done also without laying theemphasis upon the form aspect as is the case in many practices used to vitalisethe centres. The two facts of importance are:1. The three centres below the diaphragm,a. Base of spine,b. Sacral centre,c. Solar plexus centre,which are, at present, the most potent in average humanity and the most ‘alive’,require to be re-organised, re-oriented, and to be brought from a state ofpositivity into that of negativity.Equally, the four centres above the diaphragm,a. The heart centre,b. The throat centre,c. The centre between the eyebrows,d. The head centre,must be awakened and brought fr om a state of negativity into that ofpositivity.This has to be brought about in two ways. First, by the transference of thepositive energy of the lower centres into that of the higher, and secondly bythe awakening of the head centre by the demonstration of the activity of thewill. The first effect is produced by character building, and by thepurification of the bodies, as used by the soul in the three worlds. The secondis the result of meditation and the development of organised purpose, imposed bythe will upon the daily life. Character building, clean living, controlledemotional reactions, and right thinking are the platitudes of all religioussystems and have lost weight from our very familiarity with them. It is not easyto remember that as we live purely and rightly, we are verily and indeed workingwith forces, subjecting energies to our needs, subordinating [192] elementallives to the requirements of spiritual being, and bringing into activity amechanism and a vital structure which has hitherto been only latent andquiescent. Nevertheless, it remains a fact that when the energies, latent at thebase of the spine, are carried to the head and are brought (via the solarplexus, that clearing house of energy, and the medulla oblongata) to the centrebetween the eyebrows, then the personality, the matter aspect, reaches itsapotheosis and the Virgin Mary—in the individual sense, which is a finiteparallel of an infinite Reality—is “carried up into Heaven” there to sit by theside of her son, the Christ, the soul.When the energies of the sacral centre, focussed hitherto on the work ofphysical creation and generation and therefore the source of physical sex lifeand interest, are sublimated, re-oriented and carried up to the throat centre,then the aspirant becomes a conscious creative force in the higher worlds; heenters within the veil, and begins to create the pattern of things which willbring about eventually the new heavens and the new earth.When the energies of the solar plexus—expressions hitherto of the potent desirenature, feeding the emotional life of the personality—are equally transmuted andre-oriented, then they are carried to the heart centre and there is broughtabout as a result a realisation of group consciousness, of group love, and grouppurpose which makes the aspirant a server of humanity and a fit associate of theElder Brethren of the race.When these three transfers have been consummated then an activity transpires inthe head centre, the ultimate governing factor, and by an act of the will of theindwelling ruling soul, certain happenings take place which we can considerlater in our studies.2. The second fact to bear in mind is that as these changes and re-orientationstake place, the disciple begins to awaken psychologically to new states ofconsciousness, [193] to new states of existence, and to new states of being. Itwill be apparent therefore how necessary it is to go slowly in these matters, sothat the mental apprehension and ability to reason logically and sanely mayparallel the growth of the intuition and of spiritual perception. Many schoolsare simply forcing schools, prematurely developing the higher faculties andleading the aspirant (if I might express it in mystical language) directly outof the realm of feeling and of desire into that of the intuition, but leavingthe intellectual faculties and the mental apparatus totally undeveloped andlatent. When this is the case then—again speaking mystically—an hiatus or a gapoccurs, in part of the equipment which the soul must perforce use in the threeworlds of its endeavour. The interpreting, organising, understanding mind isunable to play its part. Where there is lack of understanding and of mentalability, there is danger of misapprehension, of credulity and of wronginterpretation of the phenomena of other states of being. A sense of values willbe lacking, and the aspirant will over-estimate the non-essentials and fail tograsp the value of the spiritual realities.Energy may pour into the force centres in these cases, but because there is nodirecting intelligence it will run riot and we then have those sad cases whichstrew the path of occult endeavour and have brought the work of the Lodge intodisrepute—cases of over-emphasized personalities, of superstitious devotees, ofcredulous followers of leaders, of fanatical unbalanced idealists, and of thosewarped minds which arrogate to themselves powers which are not theirs. Men andwomen become swayed by astralism and wander in the vale of illusion regardingthemselves as different from other men, placing themselves upon a pedestal farabove average humanity. They fall consciously into the sin of separateness. Addto the above category, the cases of sex perversion, [194] brought about byover-stimulation of the sacral centre, the cases of neuroticism andover-sensitivity and emotionalism, brought about by the premature vitalisationof the solar plexus centre, and lastly the cases of insanity, brought about byover-stimulation of the brain cells through unwise meditation work, and it willbecome increasingly clear why it is deemed necessary to proceed slowly and todevelop the mental processes as well as the spiritual nature.The average student starts with the knowledge that he has centres, and with adesire for purity of character. He is assured by those who know that, as hestrives, meditates, studies and serves, certain changes will take place withinhim, and that there will arise from the depths of his being, an awakening whichwill be dynamic. He is told that there will follow a breathing forth, a stirringand a vitalising which will bring his subjective spiritual life into prominence.This subjective life expresses itself as spiritual energy, through the medium ofthe energy or vital body and the energy thus expressed will change his lifefocus and interests, and produce a magnetic and dynamic effect which willattract and lift humanity. This energy is sevenfold in nature and utilises sevenfocal points in the etheric body as its agents.It is not possible for the aspirant to work with and utilise all these seventypes of energy intelligently in the early stages of the Path of Discipleship.The emphasis, for training purposes, is laid upon only three of them. These are:1. That of Will, strength or power, through the medium of the head centre. Thisis the energy of the spiritual man, and comes directly from the Monad, via thesoul. Up to the third initiation however, all that the disciple needs to graspis that the will aspect of the soul should control the personality, via themental [195] body to the head centre. When this is the case thethousand-petalled lotus begins to function. The line of this stream of force is:Monad.Atma. Spiritual will.The inner circle of petals in the egoic lotus, the will petals.The mental body.The head centre in the etheric body.The nervous system and brain.2. That of Love-Wisdom , through the medium of the heart centre. This centre,when awakened, leads to that expansion of consciousness which initiates a maninto his group life. He loses the sense of separateness, and finally emergesinto the full light of realisation—a realisation of unity with his ownindwelling God, with all humanity, with all souls in all forms of nature, and sowith the Oversoul. This force stream comes likewise from the Monad, via thesoul, and its line is as follows:Monad.Buddhi. Spiritual love. The intuition.The second circle of petals in the egoic lotus, the love petals.The astral body.The heart centre. The blood stream.In the little evolved man, this force stream simply passes through the heartcentre direct to the solar plexus and expends its two aspects of vital life andof soul quality, one energising the blood stream and the other awakening thesolar plexus centre. This then becomes the dominant factor in the energy life ofthe man, and the force through which his desire nature expresses itself, untilsuch time as the aspirant brings [196] about the needed transmutation andre-orientation of his emotional desire nature. Then the heart awakens intoactivity and the life of the solar plexus centre becomes subordinated to that ofthe heart. This is brought about by the development of group interests, by thecultivation of inclusiveness and the steady loss of interest in the personality,and in things separative and selfish.3. That of active intelligence, or the energy which animates the form aspect,and which creates forms in line with the subjective purposes of the presidingintelligence—God or man, human or divine. This also proceeds from the thirdaspect of the Monad, and the line of its contact is:Monad.Manas. Spiritual intelligence. The higher mind.The third or outer circle of petals in the egoic lotus, the knowledge petals.The etheric body as a whole, as it pervades the dense physical body.The throat centre.The cells of the body.In the little evolved man, as in the case of the second aspect and itsunfoldment, the energy simply passes through the throat centre and goes directlyto the sacral centre, and thus brings into activity the generative processes andcreative faculties, utilised in the reproductive work and sex life of the race.This is a broad and general outline of the three main streams of force or divineenergy and their direction.The relationship of the head centre to the base of the spine, where lies thesleeping fire, will not be considered here, nor will the function of the solarplexus centre as a clearing-house for the lower energies be touched upon. I[197] am anxious for the students simply to grasp the general idea and theskeleton of the teaching.Every human being in the course of time works his way back on the Path of Returnto one of the three major rays. All have eventually to express intelligentcreative faculty, to be animated by divine love, and to bring into functioningactivity the Will, as it works out divine purpose and plan.The first centre which the aspirant seeks consciously to energise and on whichhe concentrates during the early stages of his novitiate, is the heart centre.He has to learn to be group conscious, to be sensitive to group ideals, and tobe inclusive in his plans and concepts; he has to learn to love collectively andpurely, and not be actuated by personality attraction, and the motive of reward.Until there is this awakening in the heart, he cannot be trusted to wield thecreative powers of the throat centre, for they would be subordinated toself-aggrandisement and ambitions of various kinds.Here it should be noted that none of these unfoldments can ever be approachedfrom the standpoint of complete static passivity or from the angle of anentirely new undertaking. We are in process of evolution. Certain aspects of ourforce centres are already awakened, and functioning in relation to the formaspect, but are not yet expressing soul qualities. We have behind us a long andfruitful past. We are none of us purely selfish or separative. Human society isnow cohesive and inter-dependent. Humanity, as a whole, has already done much inbringing the heart centre into partial activity, and in awakening some of themore important aspects of the throat centre.The problem with many aspirants today is that of the solar plexus, for it iswide open, actively functioning and almost fully awakened. The work oftransmutation is however going on simultaneously, leading—as one might [198]naturally suppose—to a good deal of difficulty and to chaotic conditions. Theheart centre is also beginning to vibrate, but is not yet awakened; the throatcentre is frequently prematurely awakened, through the transfer of energy fromthe sacral centre. This is due to several causes—sometimes to spiritual purposeand intent, but more frequently to a negation of the normal sex life, owing toeconomic conditions, or to a lack of physical vitality, which predisposes tocelibacy. This lack of vital force is in its turn due to many factors, butprimarily to a long heredity, producing a degeneracy of the physical body, or toenforced celibacy in past lives; this enforced celibacy was very often theresult of monasticism and the living of the mystical life. When this creativeawakening finds expression through any of the arts—literature, painting,music,—or in group organization and executive work there is no harm wrought, forthe energy finds a normal creative outlet. These points should he remembered bythe aspirant. He is facing a most complex problem. He enters blindly into asituation which is the result of a long evolutionary process and to which he hasnot the key. Especially in the early stages and prior to the first initiation isthis the case, for he has no knowledge of the history of the past, nor anyprevision as to the future. He has simply to take his equipment and hisopportunity and do the best he can, guided by the age-old rules of Raja Yoga,and the light of his own soul.As the heart centre is awakened and the throat centre swings into creative work,a definite relation is set up and there is an interplay of energy between thetwo. This activity in its turn brings about a response from that aspect of thethousand petalled lotus (a synthetic lotus) through which the energy alwaysanimating the heart and throat centres normally passes. This responsive [199]activity and inter-action brings about two results, and these should be mostcarefully noted.First, the light in the head makes its appearance. A sparking (if I might soexpress it) is set up between the higher positive over-shadowing energy as it iscentralised within the form of the thousand-petalled lotus, and the steadilyheightening vibration of the heart and throat centres or lotuses. These twolower centres in their turn are responding to the energies being lifted andraised from the centres below the diaphragm.Secondly, the centre between the eyebrows also begins to make its presence felt,and this significant two-petalled lotus begins to vibrate. It symbolises thework of at-one-ing the soul and the body, the subjective and the objective. Insome occult books it is called the lotus with the ninety-six petals, but this isonly a differentiation dealing with the energies focussed in the two petals. Itwill be noted that the sum total of the force petals in the centres (excludingthe two head centres) amount in all to forty-eight petals. These energies intheir two aspects of physical vital energy and soul qualities make up theninety-six aspects or vibrations of the two petals of the Ajna or eyebrowcentre. It must be remembered also that the word ‘petal’ only symbolises anexpression of force and its apparent effect in matter.The five centres with their forty-eight petals are synthesised therefore intothe two-petalled lotus, and then we have forty-eight plus two equals fifty, thenumber of the perfected personality, for five is the number of man and ten isthat of perfection. Symbolically also, if the sum total of the forty-eightpetals of the five centres is added to the ninety-six petals of the centrebetween the eyebrows, the number one hundred and forty-four appears. This numbersignifies the completed work of the twelve creative Hierarchies, twelve timestwelve, and thus the bringing together of the subjective soul and the [200]objective body in perfect union and at-one-ment. This is the consummation. Tothese figures, one hundred and forty-four add that of the number one thousand(the number of the petals in the lotus of the head centre) and you have thenumber of the saved in the Book of Revelations, the one hundred and forty-fourthousand who can stand before God, for the three ciphers which are foundindicate the personality. When man has completed within himself the great work,when the number one hundred and forty-four thousand is seen as symbolising hispoint of attainment, then he can stand before God—standing now not only beforethe Angel of the Presence, but before the very Presence Itself.THE AWAKENING OF THE CENTRESThe question now arises: How can this awakening and co-ordination be broughtabout? What steps must be taken in order to produce this vitalisation and theeventual synthetic activity of the three centres? Faced with these questions,the true teacher finds a difficulty. It is not easy to make clear the esotericand paralleling activities which are the result of character building. So oftthe aspirant is anxious to be told some new thing and when he is told some oldtruth—so old and so familiar that it fails to call forth a registeringresponse—he feels that the teacher has failed him and so succumbs to a sense offutility and depression. However, this must be met and the questions must beanswered. I will state therefore the necessary requirements as succinctly aspossible, giving them in their sequential order and according to theirimportance from the standpoint of the average aspirant. Let us then enumeratethem in tabulated form, and then we will deal briefly with each pointafterwards.1. Character building, the first and essential requisite.2. Right motive. [201]3. Service.4. Meditation.5. A technical study of the science of the centres.6. Breathing exercises.7. Learning the technique of the Will.8. The development of the power to employ time.9. The arousing of the Kundalini fire.This last and ninth point will not be considered at this stage of our training.The reason is obvious. Most aspirants are at the stage of the third and fourthpoints and are just beginning to work at the fifth and sixth. Let us touchbriefly upon each of these necessary steps, and let me enjoin upon you the needthere is to realise in some measure the responsibility entailed by knowledge. Doyou appreciate the fact that if you were making full use of each piece ofinformation given in the course of the training, and making it a fact in yourexperience, and were living out in your daily life the teaching so steadilyimparted, you would be standing ere now before the Portal of Initiation? Do yourealise that truth has to be wrought out in the texture of daily living beforenew truth can be safely imparted?1. Character building. These nine points are to be studied from their forceaspect, and not from their ethical or spiritual import. It is the “world offorce into which the initiate enters,” and it is the training he receives as anaspirant that makes such a step possible. Each of us enters life with a certainequipment—the product of past lives of endeavour and of experience. Thatequipment has in it certain deficiencies or lacks, and is seldom of a balancednature. One man is too mental. Another is too psychic. A third is primarilyphysical, and still another is too mystical. One man is sensitive, irritable,and impressionable. Another is the reverse of all these qualities. One person iscentred in [202] his animal nature, or is strictly material in his outlook onlife, whilst another is visionary and free from the sins of the flesh. Thediversities among men are innumerable, but in each life there is a predominanttrend towards which all the energies of his nature turn. Perhaps he is swayedstrongly by his physical forces and lives consequently the life of an animal. Orhe is swayed by astral energy and lives a potently emotional and psychic life.Perhaps—like so many—he is swayed by three types of energy, physical, emotionaland an occasional flow of soul energy. The point to be remembered is that thebodies in which we, as souls, are functioning, constitute primarily energybodies. They are composed of energy units, atoms in a state of constant flux andmovement and find their place in an environment of a similar nature. Acting asthe positive nucleus in these energy bodies, and at present, in the majority ofcases relatively static, is the soul. It exerts as yet little pressure upon itssheaths and identifies itself with them, thus temporarily negating its ownintrinsic life.The day comes, however, when the soul awakens to the need of dominating thesituation and of asserting its own authority. Then the man (spasmodically at thebeginning) takes stock of the situation. He has to discover first which type ofenergy preponderates and is the motivating force in his daily experience. Havingdiscovered this, he begins to re-organize, to re-orient and to re-build hisbodies. The whole of this teaching can be summed up in two words: Vice andVirtue.Vice is the energy of the sheaths, individual or synthesised in the personality,as it controls the life activities and subordinates the soul to the sheaths andto the impulses and tendencies of the lower self.Virtue is the calling in of new energies and of a new vibratory rhythm so thatthe soul becomes the positive controlling factor and the soul forces supersedethose of [203] the bodies. This process is that of character building. Let meillustrate! A man is the victim of an irritable and nervous disposition. We sayto him that he needs to be calm and peaceful and to cultivate detachment and sogain control of himself. We teach him that in place of a cross disposition thereshould be sweetness and calm. This sounds a platitude and most uninteresting.Yet what is really being stated is that in place of the restless self-centeredemotional nature and the activity of the solar plexus centre (carrying thepowerful forces of the astral plane) there should be imposed the steady detachedand harmonising rhythm of the soul, the higher self. This work of imposing thehigher vibration on the lower is character building, the first pre-requisiteupon the Path of Probation. On reading this the earnest student can begin to sumup his energy assets; he can tabulate the forces which he feels control hislife, and thus arrive at a reasonable and truthful understanding of the forceswhich require to be subordinated and those which require to be strengthened.Then in the light of true knowledge, let him go forward upon the path of hisdestiny.2. Right Motive . The Master of the Wisdom, we are told, is the “rareefflorescence of a generation of enquirers.” The question which the seeker nowasks and which he only has the right to answer is: What is the motive governingmy aspiration and my endeavour? Why do I seek to build upon a true foundation?Why do I so diligently invoke my soul?The development of right motive is a progressive effort, and constantly oneshifts the focus of one’s incentive when one discovers himself, as the Lightshines ever more steadily upon one’s way, and constantly a newer and highermotive emerges. Again, let me illustrate: An aspirant in the early stages ispractically always a devotee. To measure up to the standard set by a lovedfriend and teacher, he struggles and strives and gains [204] ground. Later, thisobject of his devotion and ardent effort is superseded by devotion to one of theGreat Ones, the Elder Brothers of the race. He bends all his powers and theforces of his nature to Their service. This incentive is, in its turn, surelyand steadily superseded by a vital love for humanity, and love of one individual(be he ever so perfect) is lost sight of in love for the whole brotherhood ofmen. Unceasingly, as the soul takes more and more control of its instrument andthe soul nature steadily manifests, this too is superseded by love of the ideal,of the Plan, and of the purposes underlying the universe itself. The man comesto know himself as naught but a channel through which spiritual agencies canwork, and realises himself as a corporate part of the One Life. Then he seeseven humanity as relative and fractional, and becomes immersed in the greatWill.3. Service . A study of right motive leads naturally to right service, and oftenparallels in its objective form, the motivating consciousness. From service toan individual as an expression of love, to the family, or to the nation, theregrows service to a member of the Hierarchy, to a Master’s group and thenceservice to humanity. Eventually there is developed a consciousness of andservice of the Plan, and a consecration to the underlying purpose of the greatExistence Who has brought all into being for the fulfilment of some specificobjective.4. Meditation. Upon this matter we will not enlarge as it has formed the basisof much of the teaching in my other books and many of you are working steadilyupon the work of meditation. I have placed it fourth upon the list, formeditation is dangerous and unprofitable to the man who enters upon it withoutthe basis of a good character and of clean living. Meditation then becomes onlya medium for the bringing in of energies which but serve to stimulate theundesirable aspects of his life, just [205] as the fertilising of a garden fullof weeds will produce a stupendous crop of them, and so crush out the weak andtiny flowers. Meditation is dangerous where there is wrong motive, such asdesire for personal growth and for spiritual powers, for it produces, underthese conditions only a strengthening of the shadows in the vale of illusion andbrings to full growth the serpent of pride, lurking in the valley of selfishdesire. Meditation is dangerous when the desire to serve is lacking. Service isanother word for the utilisation of soul force for the good of the group. Wherethis impulse is lacking, energy may pour into the bodies, but—lacking use andfinding no outlet—will tend to over-stimulate the centres, and produceconditions disastrous to the neophyte. Assimilation and elimination are laws ofthe soul life as well as of the physical life, and when this simple law isdisregarded serious consequences will follow as inevitably as in the physicalbody.5. Study of the centres. This we are now beginning. It is a study as yet in itsinfancy in the West, and little applied in the East. Our approach will besomewhat new, for though we will accustom ourselves to the names, locations andrelationships of the centres we shall do no meditation work upon them.Eventually we shall arrive at an appreciation of their vibration, of their toneand colours and of the astrological significances. We shall not work with thecentres down the spinal column, nor aim at their conscious utilisation as doesthe clairvoyant and clairaudient person. All the work done by students must bedone entirely in the head and from the head. There is the seat of the Will, orSpirit aspect, working through the soul. There also is the synthetic expressionof the personality, and in the understanding of the relation of the two headcentres and their mutual interplay will come gradually the domination of thepersonality by the soul. This will lead to the consequent and subsequent [206]guided activity of the five other centres. The work in these five centres willeventually be as automatic as the present functioning of the heart and the lungsin the physical body.The presiding Intelligence, the Self, “seated on the throne between theeyebrows” and guided by the Light in the head will be awake to the interests ofthe soul and as alert as is the ‘I’ consciousness of the average self-centeredman. By the rhythm of his divine life and by his conscious cooperation with thePlan, and functioning through the use of the Will, must the disciple inincarnation act as the agent of his soul in the three worlds.6. Breathing Exercises . Little by little as progress is made will the neededinstruction be imparted. Let me point out however that no breathing exercisescan be safely used where there is no attempt to impose rhythm upon the life ofevery day. The two activities must go hand in hand.The effect of breathing exercises is varied:a. There is an oxygenating effect. The blood stream is purified and pressure isrelieved. A symbolism underlies this:—for as the blood is oxygenated so is thelife of the man in the three worlds permeated by spiritual energy.b. There is the imposition of a peculiar rhythm, brought about by the particularspacing and time limit of the breaths—inhalation, retention, and exhalation—andthis will vary according to the counts.c. There is a subtle effect of prana (which is the subjective element underlyingthe air breathed in and out) which affects most potently the body of prana, thevital or etheric body. Students should remember that subtle effects are morepowerful than the physical effects. They produce results [207] in twodirections; on the physical body and on the etheric body. The entire vital bodyassumes a particular rhythm according to the breathing exercises. This kept upfor a long period of time will have a shattering or a cohesive effect upon thephysical body, and devitalise or vitalise the etheric body correspondingly.d. There is the effect upon the centres, which is most effectual and whichfollows the trend of the aspirant’s thought. If, for instance, a man thinks uponthe solar plexus, that centre will inevitably be vitalised and his emotionalnature be strengthened. Hence the need for students to hold their meditationsteady in the head and so awaken the head centre.Let no one doubt the effect of breathing exercises upon the vital body. Assurely as eating and drinking build or destroy the physical body, and aid orhinder its right functioning, so do breathing exercises produce potent effects,if rightly used over a long enough period of time.And what shall I say about the last three requirements? Nothing much, for thetime is not yet ripe for their correct understanding. Step by step must theaspirant proceed and his theory must not persistently run ahead of hisexperience. Perhaps I can give the clue to each of these three through theformulation of a simple rule for daily living. This will be grasped by those forwhom it is intended and will not work harm to the unevolved. This rule, whenfollowed will bring about, gently and subjectively, the necessary conditions forthe manifestation of the requirement.Learn to use the will through the development of steady purpose and theorganising of the daily life, so that that purpose may reach fulfilment.Learn to do something else with time besides organise [208] it and use it. Learnto do several things simultaneously, and utilise therefore all the three bodiessynchronously. Let me illustrate:—When you are practicing your daily breathingexercise keep your count with accuracy, listen attentively for the sound that“soundeth in the silence” of the interlude. At the same time think of yourselfas the soul, the imposer of rhythm, and the voice that speaks. This is somethingwhich can be acquired by practice by each of you.Discover the serpent of illusion by the help of the serpent of wisdom and thenwill the sleeping serpent mount upwards to the place of meeting."},{"pageContent":"RULE SIXThe devas of the lower four feel the force when the eye opens; they are drivenforth and lose their master.THE WORK OF THE EYE[211] We have for consideration now one of the simplest of the Rules for Magicyet at the same time one of the most practical, and one upon which the entiresuccess of all magical work depends.I would like to point out to the investigating aspirant that the key to thesituation depicted in the rule lies in the word contemplation found in thepreceding one. Let us therefore study that word with care and seek its accuratedefinition.To contemplate involves steady vision, one-pointedly directed towards a specificobjective. The soul or solar angel might be regarded as gazing in threedirections.1. Towards the Light Supernal, towards that central Life or Energy which holdshid within Itself the purpose and plan towards which all Being tends. I know nothow to express this more clearly. What that directive force may be, what is thesecret of Being Itself is only revealed during the more advanced initiations,and is only finally grasped when the causal body itself, the karana sarira,disintegrates and the final limitation slips away. With this direction of thesolar Angel’s vision we need not concern ourselves.2. Over the kingdom wherein the solar Angel reigns supreme, over the world ofsouls, or egoic impulses, of hierarchical work and of pure thought. This is theKingdom of God, the world of heavenly Being. It is the state whereof disciplesare becoming increasingly aware, wherein initiates work, and from which theMasters in Their graded ranks direct the evolutionary process of [212] theplanet. These two directions in which the soul looks constitute the world of itsspiritual experience and the object of its aspiration. Let it not be forgottenthat the spiritual man, the solar Angel, has also his goal of endeavour, andthat his becomes the predominant impulse once the subjugation of the vehicle inthe three worlds is brought about. Just as the fully intelligent human being canonly begin consciously to function as a soul and to contact the kingdom of thesoul, so only the fully active and dominant soul, in which the buddhic principleis potentially controlling, can begin to contact the state of pure Being inwhich the monad or spirit eternally rests.The development of the intellect in man marks his fitness for the work oftreading the Path, back to full soul consciousness. The development of thebuddhic or wisdom-love aspect in the solar Angel demonstrates his fitness forfurther progression in the awareness of the state of pure Being.3. The third direction in which the soul looks and wherein he exercises thefaculty of contemplative vision is towards his reflection in the three worlds.The object of the long struggle between the higher and the lower man has been tomake the lower responsive to and sensitively aware of the forces emanating fromthe soul as the soul “contemplates” his triple instrument.There is an interesting relation between these three “directions ofcontemplation” and the awakening in the three major centres. This cannot be morethan hinted at owing to the abstruseness of the subject. So many factors governthis awakening, and each aspirant has to determine for himself the order andmode of his awakening.The centre between the eyebrows, commonly called the third eye has a unique andpeculiar function. As I have pointed out elsewhere, students must not confoundthe pineal gland with the third eye. They are related, but not the same. In TheSecret Doctrine they are apparently [213] regarded as the same, and the casualreader can easily confound them but they are by no means identical. This H. P.B. knew, but the apparent confusion was permitted until more of the ethericnature of forms was known. The third eye manifests as a result of the vibratoryinteraction between the forces of the soul, working through the pineal gland,and the forces of the personality, working through the pituitary body. Thesenegative and positive forces interact, and when potent enough produce the lightin the head. Just as the physical eye came into being in response to the lightof the sun so the spiritual eye equally comes into being in response to thelight of the spiritual sun. As the aspirant develops he becomes aware of thelight. I refer to the light in all forms, veiled by all sheaths and expressionsof the divine life, and not just to the light within the aspirant himself. Ashis awareness of this light increases so does the apparatus of vision develop,and the mechanism whereby he can see things in the spiritual light comes intobeing in the etheric body.This is the eye of Shiva, for it is only fully utilized in the magical work whenthe monadic aspect, the will aspect, is controlling.By means of the third eye the soul accomplishes three activities:1. It is the eye of vision . By its means, the spiritual man sees behind theforms of all aspects of divine expression. He becomes aware of the light of theworld, and contacts the soul within all forms. Just as the physical eyeregisters forms, so does the spiritual eye register the illumination withinthose forms which “illumination” indicates a specific state of being. It opensup the world of radiance.2. It is the controlling factor of the magical work. All white magical work iscarried forward with a definitely constructive purpose, made possible throughthe use of the intelligent will. In other words, the soul knows the [214] plan,and when the alignment is right and the attitude correct, the will aspect of thedivine man can function and bring about results in the three worlds. The organused is the third eye. The analogy to this can be seen in the often noticedpower of the human eye as it controls other human beings and animals by a look,and through steady gazing can act magnetically. Force flows through the focusedhuman eye. Force flows through the focused third eye.3. It has a destructive aspect and the energy flowing through the third eye canhave a disintegrating and destroying effect. It can, through its focusedattention, directed by the intelligent will, drive out physical matter. It isthe agent of the soul in the purificatory work.It should be noted here that in each of the subtle bodies in the three worldsthere is a corresponding point of focus, and the centre between the eyebrows isbut the physical counterpart (for etheric matter is physical) of innercorrespondences.Through this point of focus the soul looks out upon, or contemplates the mentalplane, including the mental mechanism. Similarly on the emotional plane, thesoul is brought into a state of awareness or vision of its emotional sheath andthe world of astral phenomena, and the physical parallel exists for the ethericbody.It is this third work of the soul that is touched upon here, the destructivework of getting rid of the old forms, of shaking out of the bodies matter of anundesirable nature and of breaking down the barriers and limitations to truesoul activity.These three activities of the soul, through the medium of the third eye, are thecorrespondences to the three aspects, and students would find it of interest towork these out.The seeing of the light within all forms through the agency of the third eye(brought into being through the realization of the light in the head, thespiritual light) is [215] but the correspondence to the physical eye, revealingforms in the light of the physical sun. This corresponds to the personality.The aspect of control through magnetic energy and the attractive force in thespiritual eye, which is the dominant factor in magical work, is thecorrespondence to the soul. In a most mysterious sense, the soul is the eye ofthe monad, enabling the monad, which is pure Being, to work, to contact, toknow, and to see.The aspect of destruction is the correspondence to the monad or will aspect; inthe last analysis it is the monad that brings about the final abstraction,destroys all forms, withdraws itself from manifestation and ends the cycle ofcreative work.Bringing these concepts down to practical expression in relation to the Ruleunder consideration, it can be noted that all these three activities are dealtwith in this Rule. The third eye opens as the result of conscious development,right alignment and the inflow of soul life. Then its magnetic controlling forcemakes itself felt, controlling the lives of the lower bodies, driving forth thelower four elementals (of earth, water, fire, air) and forcing the lunar lordsto abdicate. The personality, which has hitherto been the master, no longer cancontrol, and the soul comes into full domination in the three worlds.The elemental of earth, who is the sum total of the many lives which form thephysical body, is controlled and feels the eye of the Master (the one Master inthe head) upon it. The gross elements constituting that body are “driven forth”and better and more adequate atoms or lives are built in.The elemental of the astral or body of water undergoes a similar activity plus astabilising effect which brings to an end the restlessness and fluidictempestuousness which have hitherto characterised it. Through the controllingmagnetic power of the spiritual eye, the soul [216] rebuilds the astral body andholds it steady and coherent through its focused attention.Again, an analogous process goes forward in the mental body. Old forms disappearbefore the clear light in which the spiritual man is working and as the OldCommentary puts it:“One glance the soul doth cast upon the forms of mind. A ray of light streamsout and darkness disappears; distortions and evil forms fade out, and all thelittle fires die out; the lesser lights are no more seen.“The eye through light awakens into life the needed modes of Being. To thedisciple this will carry knowledge. To the ignorant no sense is seen for a senselacks.”The elemental of the air symbolically understood is that substratum of energywhich works through the forms of the etheric body, which is dealt with throughthe breath, and handled through the science of pranayama. This elemental form isthe intricate etheric structure, the nadis and centres, and all advancedstudents know well how these are controlled by the focused attention of the soulin contemplation, acting through the head centre, focused in the region of thethird eye and swept into right and specific activity by an act of the will. Inthe above sentence I have concentrated the formula for all magical work on thephysical plane. It is through the etheric body and the force, directed throughone or other of the centres, that the soul carries on the work in magic.It is through the intense focusing of intention in the head and the turning ofthe attention through the third eye towards the centre to be used that the forcefinds its correct outlet. That force is made potent by the energising, directedintelligent will. Study these points, for in them you will find the clue to themagical work in your own life reconstruction, to the magical work of humanreconstruction which certain adepts are carrying on, and to the magical work ofthe evolution of the divine plan which is the motivating power of the occultHierarchy."},{"pageContent":"RULE SEVENThe dual forces on the plane (whereon the vital power must be sought) are seen;the two paths face the solar Angel; the poles vibrate. A choice confronts theone who meditates.THE BATTLEGROUND OF THE ASTRAL PLANE[219] We must start our study and consideration of the seventh Rule for Magic.We have completed the first six Rules which deal specifically with work on themental plane, and hence have a practical value only for those who are beginningto utilize the power of the mind in the magical work of creation.It is interesting to note in this connection that, as humanity enters into itsheritage of mind, there appears simultaneously a growing tendency towardsmagical work. Schools of affirmation are cropping up on all sides, whoseannounced intent is to create those natural conditions wherein a man may havewhat he deems to be admirable and advisable. Books on the subject of thecreative mind are flooding the markets, and discussions on the force back of thecreative arts are deemed of vital interest. Psychologists are giving the entirematter much consideration, and though at present the ideal is viewed almostentirely in terms of the physical plane, yet the sum total indicates a vibratoryactivity in the world soul, as it expresses itself through humanity, and issuesforth from the mental realm. The pioneers of the race, and the foremost thinkersand creative workers of humanity are but the sensitives who respond most readilyto the mental impulses. They are in the minority as yet, and most people respondto the forces and vibrations emanating from the plane of the emotions and ofdesire. More and more however are awakening, and the significance of the sixfirst Rules of Magic will become increasingly apparent.[220] These fifteen rules are divided into:Six rules on the mental plane.Five rules on the desire or astral plane.Four rules on the physical plane.The main thought to be held clearly in the mind is that they confine themselvesto the use of energy in the three worlds, and that this energy is eitherconsciously manipulated by the governing soul or is swept into activity by theforce inherent in the matter of the three worlds, independently of the soul.When this is the case, the man is a victim of his own form energies and thematter aspect of all manifestation. In the other case, he is the intelligentruler, controller of his own destinies, and swings the lower energies into formsand activities through the power of his mind impulses, and the focussedattention of his own soul. In the six rules already considered one or twothoughts most clearly emerge and might be summed up in the following terms:Rule 1—Recollection, resulting in concentration.Rule 2—Response, resulting in an interaction between higher and lower.Rule 3—Radiation, resulting in a sounding forth.Rule 4—Respiration, resulting in creative work.Rule 5—Re-union, resulting in the at-one-ment.Rule 6—Re-orientation, resulting in a clear vision of the Plan.Students would do well to consider these relationships, and to work out theunderlying synthesis.In the words of this rule the astral plane, with its function and problem, isably synthesized. Note the terms used in the description given in a few shortphrases:1. The plane of dual forces.2. The plane of the two paths.3. The plane whereon the vital power is sought. [221]4. The plane of the vibrating poles.5. The plane whereon a choice is made.One of the most vital things every aspirant has to do is to learn to understandthe astral plane, to comprehend its nature and to learn both to stand free fromit and then to work on it. In this instruction, I seek to give some clearteaching on this plane, for the moment a man can “see” on the astral plane, andcan achieve equilibrium and hold steady in the midst of its vibrating forces,that moment he is ready for initiation.First, let us gather together some of the terms which are used to describe thissphere of divine Being wherewith a man has first to identify himself, penetrateto the centre, pierce through its veiled illusion, and eventually stand poised,untouched, detached, uninfluenced and free.The term “astral” so often used is in reality a misnomer. H. P. B. was basicallyright when she used the term in connection with the etheric or vital planes ofthe physical plane. When contact is made with the etheric world, the firstimpression given is always of a starry light, of brilliance, of scintillation.Gradually, however, the word became identified with Kama or desire, and so wasused for the plane of emotional reaction.It is interesting to note this for it is in itself an instance of the effect ofthe astral plane upon the human brain, which in its uninformed conditionreverses the reality and sees things in an upside down state. The appearance ofthe astral plane when first definitely seen by the “opened eye” of the aspirantis one of dense fog, confusion, changing forms, interpenetrating andintermingling colours, and is of such a kaleidoscopic appearance that thehopelessness of the enterprise seems overwhelming. It is not light, or starry orclear. It is apparently impenetrable disorder, for it is the meeting ground offorces. Because the forces in the aspirant’s [222] own body are equally indisorder, he blends in with the surrounding chaos to such an extent that it isat first almost impossible for the onlooking soul to dissociate its own astralmechanism from the astral mechanism of humanity as a whole, and from the astralmechanism of the world.One of the first things then that the aspirant has to learn is to dissociate hisown aura in the emotional sense from that of his surroundings and much time isexpended in learning to do this. It is for this reason that one of the firstqualifications of discipleship is discrimination , for it is through the use ofthe mind, as analyzer and separator, that the astral body is brought undercontrol.Secondly, the astral plane is the plane of illusion, of glamour, and of adistorted presentation of reality. The reason for this is that every individualin the world is busy working in astral matter, and the potency of human desireand of world desire produces that constant “out-picturing” and form buildingwhich leads to the most concrete effects of astral matter. Individual desire,national desire, racial desire, the desire of humanity as a whole, plus theinstinctual desire of all subhuman lives causes a constant changing and shiftingof the substance of the plane; there is a building of the temporary forms, someof rare beauty, some of no beauty, and a vitalising by the astral energy of itscreator. Add to these forms that persistent and steadily growing scenario wecall the “akashic records” which concern the emotional history of the past, addthe activities of the discarnate lives which are passing through the astralplane, either out of or towards incarnation, add the potent desire, purified andintelligent, of all superhuman Lives, including those of the occult planetaryHierarchy, and the sum total of forces present is stupendous. All play upon,around and through every human being, and according to the calibre of hisphysical body, and the condition of his centres [223] will be his response.Through this illusory panorama, the aspirant has to make his way, finding theclue or thread which will lead him out of the maze, and holding fast to eachtiny fragment of reality as it presents itself to him, learning to distinguishtruth from glamour, the permanent from the impermanent and the certainty fromthe unreal. As the Old Commentary puts it:“Let the disciple seize hold of the tail of the serpent of wisdom, and havingwith firmness grasped it, let him follow it into the deepest centre of the Hallof Wisdom. Let him not be betrayed into the trap set for him by the serpent ofillusion, but let him shut his eyes to the colourful tracery upon its back, andhis ears to the melody of its voice. Let him discern the jewel, set in theforehead of the serpent whose tail he holds, and by its radiance traverse themiry halls of maya.”No glamour, no illusion can long hold the man who has set himself the task oftreading the razor-edged Path which leads through the wilderness, through thethick-set forest, through the deep waters of sorrow and distress, through thevalley of sacrifice and over the mountains of vision to the gate of Deliverance.He may travel sometimes in the dark (and the illusion of darkness is very real);he may travel sometimes in a light so dazzling and bewildering that he canscarcely see the way ahead; he may know what it is to falter on the Path, and todrop under the fatigue of service and of strife; he may be temporarilysidetracked and wander down the by-paths of ambition, of self-interest and ofmaterial enchantment, but the lapse will be but brief. Nothing in heaven orhell, on earth or elsewhere can prevent the progress of the man who has awakenedto the illusion, who has glimpsed the reality beyond the glamour of the astralplane, and who has heard, even if only once, the clarion call of his own soul.The astral plane is also the Kurukshetra, both of humanity [224] as a whole andof the individual human unit. It is the battle-ground whereon must be found theWaterloo of every aspirant. In some one life, there comes an emotional crisis inwhich decisive action is taken, and the disciple proves his control of hisemotional nature. This may take the form of some great and vital test, coveringa brief time but calling forth every resource of wisdom and of purity that thedisciple possesses, or it may be a long and protracted emotional strain, carriedover many years of living. But in the attaining of success and in theachievement of clear vision and right discernment (through right discrimination)the disciple testifies to his fitness for the second initiation.I would like to point out that it is this test and crisis through which humanityis now passing, and which began in those conditions which culminated in theworld war and the present world strain. The first initiation of humanity, as anentity, took place when individualization became possible, and the soul was bornin the body of humanity. This was preceded by a period of fearful stress andstrain, dimly sensed by the pioneers into the human kingdom from the ranks ofthe animal-men. Should this crisis be successfully passed, the second initiationof humanity will be the result—the passing through the baptism and the enteringof the stream. So the world war and its resulting effects constitute theKurukshetra of the world Arjuna, and the outcome is still in the balance. Letthis not be forgotten. There is however no cause for pessimism. The outcome ofgood is inevitable. It is however a question of a slow or a rapid realizationand liberation from the great world illusion, and to this end every aspirant isbegged to work strenuously and to lend his aid. Every man who liberates himself,who sees clearly, and who releases himself from the glamour of illusion aids inthe Great Work. [225]Again, the astral plane is that whereon the pairs of opposites act and interact,and whereon the pull of the great dualities is most potently felt. Primarily,the interaction is between the soul and its vehicle, matter, but there are manylesser dualities which play their part and are more easily recognized by theaverage man.Light and darkness interact, as do pleasure and pain; good and evil meet andform the playground of the Gods, and poverty and riches are offset one againstthe other. The entire modern economic situation is of an astral nature; it isthe outcome of desire and the result of a certain selfish use of the forces ofmatter. Heat and cold, as we understand the term, in a most peculiar manner arethe result of the interplay of the pairs of opposites, and an interesting lineof occult study concerns itself with the effects of racial emotions on climaticconditions. We most truly make our climate in one significant sense. When desirehas burnt itself out, planetary life comes to an end, as climatic conditionswill negate form-life as we understand it.In relation to the human unit, the secret of liberation lies in the balancing ofthe forces and the equilibrising of the pairs of opposites. The Path is thenarrow line between these pairs which the aspirant finds and treads, turningneither to the right nor to the left.It must be remembered always that when the pairs of opposites are discerned,when a man balances the forces of his own nature, when he has found the Path andbecome the Path, then he can work with the world forces, can preserve thebalance and the equilibrium of the energies of the three worlds and so become aco-worker with the Masters of the Wisdom. Let us pray and hope that this may bethe practical outcome of our understanding of the nature of the battleground ofthe astral plane.THE TWO PATHS[226] Passing from our consideration of the nature of the astral plane we willdeal with its functions and the relation of the disciple to its activities. Letus remember certain things about it. First, it is pre-eminently thebattle-ground, and on it is fought the warfare which eventuates in the finalrelease of the imprisoned soul. It is useful to have in mind the outstandingcharacteristics of the three planes and the three bodies which function on them.The physical plane is the plane of active experience in and through matter. Itis the plane of externalisation and, according to the condition and point ofdevelopment of the inner man, so will be the outer form and its activities.The astral plane is the plane whereon the man passes through three stages ofconsciousness:a. He gains, through his sensory apparatus, consciousness in the world of forms,and develops ability to re-act to those forms with wisdom and intelligence. Thisconsciousness he shares with the animal world, though he goes far beyond them insome respects, owing to his possession of a correlating and co-ordinating mind.b. Sensitivity, or awareness of moods, emotions and feelings, desires andaspirations which have their roots within him in the principle ofself-consciousness, or in the ahamkara principle, as the occultist (who lovesdifficult phrases) is apt to call it. This he shares in common with hisfellow-men.c. Spiritual awareness or sensitiveness to the spiritual world, and the feelingaspect of the higher consciousness. This has its roots in the soul, presupposesthe dominance of the mental nature, and is that faculty [227] which constituteshim a mystic. This awareness he shares in common with all disciples and it isthe reward of the gained victories of his astral plane experience.The mental plane comes next. In it the right use of the intellect is theoutstanding achievement. This is also characterised by three stages:a. The stage wherein the mind is the receiver of impressions from the outerworld, via the five senses and the brain. This is a negative condition, and, init, the “modifications of the thinking principle” are brought about through theimpacts of the external world, and the re-actions of the astral world.b. The stage wherein the mind initiates its own activities, and wherein theintellect is a dominating factor. Though thrown into activity by the factorsenumerated above, it is responsive also to the thought currents of the mentalplane as well, and becomes exceedingly active as the result of these twocontacts. Out of these a third activity supervenes wherein the reasoningprinciple acts upon the information gained in these two ways, sets its ownstreams of thoughts, and formulates its own thought forms, as well asregistering those of others.c. The stage wherein the soul, through concentration and meditation succeeds inimposing its ideas and impressions upon the mind held “steady in the light” andso enables the mental body to respond to impressions and contacts emanating fromthe subjective and spiritual worlds.Yet the battle, par excellence, is fought out in the astral body, and onlyreaches its most intense point and its potent fierceness when there is a goodphysical instrument and a well-equipped mentality. The greater the sensitivityof the astral body, the greater its reactions to [228] the physical world and tothe mental condition and hence the fact emerges that disciples and the morehighly evolved people in the world have a more potent astral body and work undergreater emotional strain than the less highly evolved and the liberated sons ofGod.Students are therefore begged to deal drastically and potently with theiremotional natures, remembering that victory descends from above and cannot beworked up to from below. The soul must govern and its instrument in the warfareis the consecrated mind.It is interesting to note the occult sequence in the description given of thisplane in the rule under consideration.It is first of all the plane of dual forces. The first thing the aspirantbecomes aware of is duality. The little evolved man is aware of synthesis, butit is the synthesis of his material nature. The highly spiritual man is awarealso of synthesis but it is that in his soul, whose consciousness is that ofunity. But in between is the wretched aspirant, conscious of duality above allelse and pulled hither and thither between the two. His first step has, for itsobjective, to make him aware of the pairs of opposites and of the necessity tochoose between them. Through the light, which he has discovered in himself, hebecomes aware of the dark. Through the good which attracts him, he sees the evilwhich is for him the line of least resistance. Through the activity of pain, hecan visualize and become aware of pleasure, and heaven and hell become to himrealities. Through the activity of the attractive life of his soul, he realizesthe attraction of matter and of form, and is forced to recognize the urge andpull of both of them. He learns to feel himself as “pendant ‘twixt the two greatforces”, and, once the dualities are grasped, it dawns on him slowly and surelythat the deciding factor in the struggle is his divine will, incontradistinction to his selfish will. [229] Thus the dual forces play theirpart until they are seen as two great streams of divine energy, pulling inopposite directions, and he becomes then aware of the two paths, mentioned inour rule. One path leads back into the dreary land of rebirth, and the otherleads through the golden gate to the city of free souls. One is thereforeinvolutionary and involves him in deepest matter; the other leads him out of thebody nature, and makes him eventually aware of his spiritual body, through whichhe can function in the kingdom of the soul. One path, later on (when he is atrue and pledged chela) is known to him as the left hand path and the other thepath of right activity. On one path, he becomes proficient in black magic, whichis only the developed powers of the personality, subordinated to the selfishpurposes of a man whose motives are those of self interest and worldly ambition.These confine him to the three worlds and shut the door which opens on to life.On the other path, he subordinates his personality and exercises the magic ofthe White Brotherhood, working always in the light of the soul with the soul inall forms, and laying no emphasis upon the ambitions of the personal self. Cleardiscrimination of these two paths reveals what is called in some occult booksthat “narrow razor-edged Path” which lies between the two. This is the “noblemiddle Path” of the Buddha and marks the fine line of demarcation between thepairs of opposites, and between the two streams which he has learnt torecognize—one going up unto the gates of heaven, and the other passing down intothe nethermost hell.By the exercise of the two main weapons of the aspirant, discrimination anddispassion, he gains that quality which is called in this rule “the vitalpower”. Just as the eye is the instrument of choice in choosing the way oftravel on the physical plane and has besides a potency all its own whereby itattracts and develops its [230] own sign language, so a vital power is felt inthe aspirant. This eventually brings the third eye into activity, and so thereis gained a potency and a clear vision which make right choice and quickprogress upon the way a steady progression. We are told that power is grown ordeveloped in silence, and only he who can find a centre of peace within hishead, where the paths of the bodily forces and the spiritual inflowing tidesmeet, can rightly practice true discrimination and that dispassion which bringthe controlled astral and mental bodies under the guidance of the soul.Then he can understand the significance of “the vibrating poles”, and achievethat point of equilibrium which is the result of their interaction andvibration.The sensing of the dual forces and the clear discrimination of the two pathsleads to the development of the vital power. This vital power demonstrates itsfirst activity in enabling the aspirant to achieve a point of balance and sostand on that pinnacle of achievement whereon “a choice is made”.What is that choice? For the aspirant, it is that between rapid and slowprogress. For the disciple, accepted and loyal, it is the choice between methodsof service. For the initiate it oft lies betwixt spiritual advancement and thearduous work of staying with the group and working out the plan. For the Masterit is the choice between the seven Paths, and it will therefore be apparent howmuch more strenuous and difficult is his problem.All however prepares the aspirant for right choice through right discriminationleading to right action, and made possible through practiced dispassion. In thissentence is summed up the technique of the warrior upon the battle-field of thedesire plane.It should here be noted that in the steadily developing power of choice, and theloyally fought battle of the astral [231] plane, the consciousness in the manshifts stage by stage. First, it is the battered earth-weary aspirant who has tostruggle with desire, with glamour, with ambition and with his sensitiveemotional body. He thinks the battle is stupendous but from the wider angle itis relatively small—yet all that he can stand.Later, it is the experienced probationary disciple who wrestles in the vale ofillusion, and deals not alone with his own nature but with the forces of thatvale also, recognising its dual nature. Then, the disciple comes forth to battleand faces with courage (and often with clear vision) the forces arrayed againsthim. They involve not only those in his own nature and in those aspects of theastral plane to which he naturally re-acts, but also involve the forces ofillusion arrayed against the group of disciples to which he belongs. Let alldisciples take note of this and have it in mind in these difficult and strenuousdays. Such disciples are in conscious contact at times with their soul forcesand for them there is no defeat nor turning back. They are the tried warriors,scarred and tired, yet knowing that triumphant victory lies ahead, for the soulis omnipotent. Accepted disciples, who battle all the above enumerated factors,plus the black forces arrayed against the Elder Brothers, can call upon thespiritual energies of their group and at rare and indicated moments upon theMaster under whom they work. Thus the work and labour expands; thus theresponsibility and struggle steadily increases; yet at the same time there isalso a steadily growing reception of potencies which can be contacted andutilized and which when correctly contacted insure victory at the end.The phrase “the one who meditates” relates to the soul. Arjuna, the aspiringdisciple, resigns the struggle and hands the weapons and the reins of governmentto Krishna, the soul, and is rewarded at last by understanding [232] and by avision of the divine form which veils the Son of God Who is Himself.When this battle has been fought and won the disciple steps into the ranks ofthe white magicians of our planet and can wield forces, cooperate with the plan,command the elementals, and bring order out of chaos. He is no longer immersedin the world illusion but has risen above it. He can no longer be held down bythe chains of his own past habits and his karma. He has gained the vital powerand stands forth an Elder Brother.Such is the path ahead of each and all who dare to tread it. Such is theopportunity offered to all students who have made their choice with dispassionand are prompted by love and the desire to serve."},{"pageContent":"RULE EIGHTThe Agnisuryans respond to the sound. The waters ebb and flow. Let the magicianguard himself from drowning, at the point where land and water meet. The midwayspot, which is neither dry nor wet, must provide the standing place whereon hisfeet are set. When water, land and air meet there is the place for magic to bewrought.TYPES OF ASTRAL FORCE[235] It would be advisable for the student to read with care the commentary onthis rule as given in the Treatise on Cosmic Fire. It will be noted howextremely abstruse it is and how full of almost blind occult information. Thisshould however be studied. The word “astral plane” should also be looked up anda general idea gained as to its nature and its function as the battle-ground ofthe senses, and as the place from which magic is wrought. The intelligent andconstructive desire of the white magician, acting under the instruction of hisown soul and therefore occupied with group work, is the motivating power back ofall magical phenomena. This magical work is begun in the magician’s own life,extends to the world of the astral plane and from thence (when potent there) canbegin to demonstrate on the physical plane and on the higher planes eventually.We shall, therefore, take a good deal of time over this rule for it covers theimmediate work and activity of the intelligent aspirant. It is the mostimportant in the book from the standpoint of the average student. It cannot beunderstood where there is no soul contact, nor can the magical force of the soulwork out in manifestation upon the physical plane until the meaning of itsesoteric phrases has been somewhat wrought out in the inner experience of themagician.Most true aspirants are now at the midway spot, and can either drown (and somake no further progress this life), stand and so hold the ground gained, orbecome true practicing magicians, efficient in white magic, which is [236] basedon love, animated by wisdom and intelligently applied to forms.We will, therefore, divide this rule into several parts, the more easily tostudy it and take them up step by step, so as to grasp their application to theaverage life of the probationary disciple, and to gain a wise understanding oftheir wide implications.These three divisions are:1. The response of the astral elementals and the consequent ebb and flow of thewaters.2. The dangers of the midway spot, its nature and the opportunity it affords.3. The place where magic is wrought.We will study now the first point which is summed up for us in the words:“The Agnisuryans respond to the sound.The waters ebb and flow.”The situation might be stated in the following terse statements. The rulesalready studied convey the truth anent the magician.1. The soul has communicated with his instrument in the three worlds.2. The man on the physical plane recognises the contact, and the light in thehead shines forth, sometimes recognised and sometimes unrecognised by theaspirant.3. The soul sounds forth its note. A thought-form is created in consonance withthe united meditation of the soul and the man, his instrument.4. This thought-form, embodying the will of the ego or soul, cooperating withthe personality, takes to itself a triple form, constituted of the matter of allthree planes, and vitalized through the activity and by the emanations from theheart, throat and [237] ajna centres of the white magician—the soul inconjunction with its instrument.5. The personality sheaths, each with its own individual life, feel they arelosing their power and the battle between the forces of matter and the force ofthe soul is violently renewed.6. This battle must be fought out on the astral plane and will decide threethings:a. Whether the soul will, in any one life (for some life holds the criticalstage), be the dominant factor and the personality from henceforth be theservant of the soul.b. Whether the astral plane is no longer the plane of illusion, but can becomethe field of service.c. Whether the man can become an active co-operator with the Hierarchy, able tocreate and to wield mental matter, and so work out the purposes of the UniversalMind, which are prompted by boundless and infinite love, and are the expressionof the One Life.This is the crux of the entire situation, and when the man has mastered theforces opposed to him, he is ready for the second initiation which marks therelease of the soul from the prison of the astral body. Henceforth the soul willuse the astral body, and mould desire into line with divine purpose.It is of value for the student to know where he stands and what his particularproblem is. The average man is learning the control of the physical body and theorganizing of his physical plane life. The student on the probationary path islearning a similar lesson in relation to his astral body, its focus, its desiresand its work. The student on the path of accepted discipleship has todemonstrate this control and begin to discipline the mind nature and so functionconsciously in the mental body. [238] The work of the initiate and the adeptgrows out of these achievements and they need not be dealt with here.The battle is spread over quite a series of lives, but in some one life itbecomes critical; the final stand is made and Arjuna triumphs in the fight, butonly by letting Krishna assume the reins of control, by learning mind controland by the revelation of the form of God. By distinguishing between the soul andthe form, and by a vision of the perfection of the glory which can radiate fromthe forms “indwelt by God”, he learns to choose the way of light and to see hisform and all forms as custodians of the light. So he buckles down to the work ofmaking the astral body simply a reflector of that light and by the quelling ofdesire, through the subjugation of the “Agnisuryans” who constitute his astralbody and are the living substance of the astral plane, he learns to function asan adept on that plane, to pierce through its illusion and to see life true .Speaking symbolically the substance of the astral plane is animated by threetypes of divine force, which, when brought together, produce the great Illusion.These are:First, the force of selfish desire. This involutionary energy plays a big partin bringing about evolution, for selfishness is the nursery of infant souls.Hence the aspirant refuses to be held by it.Second, the force of fear. This is the product of ignorance, and in its initialstages it is not the product of wrong thinking. It is basically instinctual andis found dominating in the non-mental animal kingdom as well as in the humankingdom. But in the human, its power is increased potently through the powers ofthe mind, and through memory of past pain and grievance and through anticipationof those we foresee, the power of fear is enormously aggravated by thethought-form we ourselves have built of our own individual fears and [239]phobias. This thought form grows in power as we pay attention to it, for “energyfollows thought” till we become dominated by it. Second ray people arepeculiarly a prey to this. For the majority of them it constitutes the “dwelleron the threshold”, just as ambition and love of power, backed by frantic desireand unscrupulousness form the “Dweller” for the first ray types. Thecrystallized thought form of intellectual achievement for selfish ends, and theuse of knowledge for personality objectives stand before the portal of the pathin the case of the third ray person, and unless broken up and destroyed willdominate him and turn him into a black magician.You oft have been told that fear is an illusion. Yet this statement does nothelp. It is a generalisation that one can admit, yet which remains profoundlydifficult to apply individually. The fears to which aspirants are subject (notethe mode of wording this) are seldom of a selfish nature except insofar assuffering has caused them to recoil from a further continuation of untowardhappenings. Their fears are wrapt in seeming love around their loved ones. Yetshould each disciple ask himself a most practical question: How many of thetorturing hours have been expended on realities and on tangible happenings, andhow many on illusory premonitions and on doubts and questionings, based on thatwhich has never happened? I would like to point out to my brothers that theyneed to do two things: To meditate on truth in daily life, using the concept oftruth practised and lived by as their seed thought in meditation; to this end Iwould suggest that they memorise and use at all times when swept by illusoryfears and needless foreboding the following formula or prayer:“Let reality govern my every thought, and truth be the master of my life.”Let each say this to himself as constantly as need requires, [240] forcing hismind to focus attention upon the significance of these spoken words.I would suggest also sound common sense and the cultivation of an attitude ofmind which refuses to permit time for illusory fears to grow.Fear is the main obstacle frequently to a very vital step forward which could betaken in this life, but may have to be delayed to another if due opportunity isnot taken and the will nature powerfully excited.The first ray aspirant who fails to overcome his Dweller may become a “destroyerof souls”, as it is called, and be condemned (until he learns his lesson) towork in the forces of matter, and with the forms which hold all souls in prison.This is the occult significance of the misunderstood words, death anddestruction. Of this type, the Devil is the great prototype.The second ray aspirant who builds his Dweller and permits its steady andincreasing control becomes a “deluder of souls”. He is the true Anti-Christ, andthrough false teaching and the working of so-called miracles, through hypnotismand mass suggestion he draws a veil over the world and forces men to walk in thegreat illusion. It is interesting to note that the work of the Devil, theimprisoner of souls, is beginning to lose its power, for the race is on theverge of understanding that true death is immersion in form, and that matter isbut a part of the divine whole. The thought form of this “Dweller on theThreshold” which humanity has built for millions of years is on the verge ofdestruction. But the work of Anti-Christ is only rising now to its height, andthe delusion of riches, of possession, of false teaching will increasingly holdsway but the term of the delusion will be shorter than the term of destruction,for all these factors function under their own cycles and have their own ebb andflow.The third ray person who also fails to shatter his [241] “Dweller” becomes whatis called a “manipulator of souls” and uses the mind to destroy the real and toput a veil between the man and reality. It must be remembered that none of thesenames and these activities refer to the soul on its own plane but only to humansouls in incarnation on the physical plane. This must be stressed, for on itsown plane the souls of all men stand free from illusion, and neither can bedestroyed, deluded nor manipulated. It is only “the souls in prison” who aresubject to the activities of the forces of evil and only for a term. The firstgroup works through governments, through politics, and the interplay betweennations and is relatively small in number. The second ray group who delude anddeceive, work through religious agencies, through mass psychology, and themisuse and misapplication of devotion and of the arts. They are largest innumber. The third group work primarily through commercial relations in thebusiness world, and through the use of money, the concretisation of prana oruniversal energy, and the outer symbol of the universal flux and flow. Thesethoughts are suggestive but not vital, dealing as they do with the cosmictendencies.Thirdly, the force of sex attraction. This is a pull from the physical plane andthe swinging back of a type of involutionary energy on to the path of return.Cosmically speaking, it manifests as the attractive force between spirit andmatter; spiritually speaking, it is demonstrated as the activity of the soul, asit seeks to draw the lower self into full realisation. Physically speaking, itis the urge which tends to unite male and female for the purpose of procreation.When man was purely animal, no sin was involved. When to this urge was addedemotional desire, then sin crept in, and the purpose for which the urgemanifested was perverted into the satisfaction of desire. Now that the race ismore mental, and the force of mind is making itself felt in [242] the humanbody, an even more serious situation is apparent, which can only be safelyworked out when the soul assumes control of its triple instrument.Humanity is now at the midway point as this rule shows. Man is swept by selfishdesire and by ambition, for all of us have first ray qualities. He is racked byfear—his own, family fears, national fears and racial, for all of us swing tothe rhythm of the second ray. He is dominated by sex and by money which isanother manifestation of the energy of matter and hence has a triple problemwith which he is well equipped to deal through the medium of his triple vehicleand the triple potencies of his divine soul. Let us close the instruction onthat note—well equipped to deal. We can overcome mental inertia and begin tofunction as souls in command of our environment. The soul is omniscient andomnipotent.CYCLIC EBB AND FLOWLet us consider now the words “the ebb and flow of the waters.”In the understanding of the law of cycles, we gain knowledge of the underlyinglaws of evolution and come to a realization of the rhythmic work of creation.Incidentally also we gain poise as we study our own life impulses, for they alsohave their ebb and flow, and alternate between periods of light and periods ofdarkness.We have with us always that symbolic daily occurrence wherein the part of theworld in which we live swings out into the clear light of the sun, and laterreturns into the healing dark of the night. Our very familiarity with thephenomenon causes us to lose sight of its symbolic significance and to forgetthat under the great law, periods of light and dark, of good and evil, ofsubmergence and emergence, of progress into illumination [243] and apparentbetrayal into darkness, characterize the growth of all forms, distinguish thedevelopment of races and nations, and constitute the problem of the aspirant whohas built for himself a picture of walking in a constant illumined condition andof leaving all dark places behind.In these Instructions, it is not possible for me to deal with the ebb and flowof the divine life as it manifests in the various kingdoms in nature and throughthe evolutionary growth of humanity, through experience in races, nations andfamilies. I seek, however, to elaborate somewhat the cyclic experience of a soulin incarnation, indicating the apparent ebb and flow of its unfoldment.The outstanding cycle for every soul is that of its forthgoing into incarnationand its return or flowing back into the centre from whence it came. According tothe point of view will be the understanding of this ebb and flow. Souls mightesoterically be regarded as those “seeking the light of experience” andtherefore turned towards physical expression, and those “seeking the light ofunderstanding”, and therefore retreating from the realm of human undertaking toforge their way inward into the soul consciousness, and so become “dwellers inthe light eternal”. Without appreciating the significance of the terms, thepsychologists have sensed these cycles and call certain types, extraverts, andothers, introverts. These mark an ebb and flow in individual experience and arethe tiny life correspondences to the great soul cycles. This passing into, andpassing out of, the web of incarnated existence are the major cycles of anyindividual soul, and a study of the types of pralaya dealt with in The SecretDoctrine and A Treatise on Cosmic Fire would be found of real value by thestudent.There is also an ebb and flow in soul experience on any one plane and this, inthe early stages of development, will cover many lives. They are usually quiteextreme in [244] their expression. A study of the racial ebb and flow will makethis clearer. In Lemurian days the “flow”, or the outward going cycle, spentitself on the physical plane and the ebb carried the life aspect right back tothe soul itself, and there was no secondary ebb and flow on the astral or mentalplanes.Later, the tide broke on the shores of the astral plane, though including thephysical in less degree. The flow directed its attention to the emotional life,and the drift back to the centre took no account of the mental life at all. Thiswas at its height for humanity in Atlantean days and is true also of many today.Now the ebb and flow is increasingly inclusive, and the mental experience hasits place so that all three aspects are swept by the life of the soul; all areincluded in the outgoing energy of the incarnating soul, and for many lives andseries of lives this cyclic force spends itself. Within the aspirant therearises an understanding of what is going on and he awakens to the desire tocontrol consciously this ebb and flow or (to put it in simple words) to turn theforces of the outgoing energy in any direction he chooses, or to withdraw to hiscentre at will. He seeks to arrest this process of being swept out intoincarnation without having any conscious purpose, and refuses to see the tide ofhis life beat out on emotional or mental spheres of existence, and then againsee that life withdrawn without his conscious volition. He stands at the midwaypoint and wants to control his own cycles, the “ebb and flow” as he himself maydetermine it. With conscious purpose he longs to walk in the dark places ofincarnated existence and with equally conscious purpose he seeks to withdrawinto his own centre. Hence he becomes an aspirant.The life of the aspirant begins to repeat earlier cycles. He is assailed by asudden stimulation of the physical nature and violently swept by ancient desiresand lusts. [245] This may be succeeded by a cycle wherein the physical body isconscious of the flowing away from it of vital energy and is devitalised,because not the subject of attention. This accounts for much of the sickness andlack of vitality of many of our most cherished servers. The same process canaffect the emotional body, and periods of exaltation and of highest aspirationalternate with periods of the deepest depression and lack of interest. The flowmay pass on to the mental body and produce a cycle of intense mental activity.Constant study, much thought, keen investigation and a steady intellectual urgewill characterize the mind of the aspirant. To this may succeed a cycle whereinall study is distasteful, and the mind seems to lie entirely fallow and inert.It is an effort to think, and the futility of phases of thought assail the mind.The aspirant decides that to be is better far than to do. “Can these dry boneslive?” he asks, and has no desire to see them revitalised.All true seekers after truth are conscious of this unstable experience andfrequently regard it as a sin or as a condition to be strenuously fought. Thenis the time to appreciate that “the midway spot which is neither dry nor wetmust provide the standing place whereon his feet are set.”This is a symbolic way of saying that he needs to realize two things:1. That states of feeling are quite immaterial and are no indication of thestate of the soul. The aspirant must centre himself in the soul consciousness,refuse to be influenced by the alternating conditions to which he seemssubjected, and simply “stand in spiritual being” and then “having done all,stand.”2. That the achievement of equilibrium is only possible where alternation hasbeen the rule, and that the cyclic ebb and flow will continue just as long asthe soul’s [246] attention fluctuates between one or other aspect of the formand the true spiritual man.The ideal is to achieve such a condition of conscious control that at will a manmay be focussed in his soul consciousness or focussed in his form aspect,—eachact of focussed attention being brought about through a realised and specificobjective, necessitating such a focussing.Later when the words of the great Christian teacher have significance, he willbe able to say “whether in the body or out of the body” is a matter of nomoment. The act of service to be rendered will determine the point where theself is concentrated, but it will be the same self, whether freed temporarilyfrom the form consciousness or immersed in the form in order to function indifferent aspects of the divine whole. The spiritual man seeks for thefurthering of the plan and to identify himself with the divine mind in nature.Withdrawing to the midway spot, he endeavours to realize his divinity and then,having done so, he focusses himself in his mental form which puts him en rapportwith the Universal Mind. He endures limitation so that thereby he may know andserve. He seeks to reach the hearts of men and to carry to them “inspiration”from the depths of the heart of spiritual being. Again he asserts the fact ofhis divinity and then, through a temporary identification with his body ofsensory perception, of feeling, and of emotion, he finds himself at-one with thesensitive apparatus of divine manifestation which carries the love of God to allforms on the physical plane.Again he seeks to aid in the materialising of the divine plan on the physicalplane. He knows that all forms are the product of energy rightly used anddirected. With full knowledge of his divine Sonship and a potent mindrealisation of all that that term conveys, he focusses his forces in the vitalbody and becomes a focal point for the transmission of divine energy and hence abuilder in [247] union with the building energies of the Cosmos. He carries theenergy of illumined thought and sanctified desire down into the body of ether,and so works with intelligent devotion.You ask for a clearer definition of the “midway” spot.For the probationer it is the emotional plane, the Kurukshetra, or the plane ofillusion, where land (physical nature) and water (emotional nature) meet.For the disciple it is the mental plane where form and soul make contact and thegreat transition becomes possible. For the advanced disciple and the initiate,the midway spot is the causal body, the karana sarira, the spiritual body of thesoul, standing as the intermediary between Spirit and matter, Life and form, themonad and the personality.This can also be discussed and understood in terms of the centres.As every student knows, there are two centres in the head. One centre is betweenthe eyebrows and has the pituitary body as its objective manifestation. Theother is in the region at the top of the head and has the pineal gland as itsconcrete aspect. The pure mystic has his consciousness centred in the top of thehead, almost entirely in the etheric body. The advanced worldly man is centredin the pituitary region. When, through occult unfoldment and esoteric knowledge,the relation between the personality and the soul is established there is amidway spot in the centre of the head in the magnetic field which is called the“light in the head”, and it is here that the aspirant takes his stand. This isthe spot of vital import. It is neither land or physical, nor water oremotional. It might be regarded as the vital or etheric body which has becomethe field of conscious service, of directed control, and of force utilisationtowards specific ends.Here the magician takes his stand and through the [248] medium of his force orenergy body performs the magical creative work.One point is rather abstrusely dealt with in this rule, but it clarifies, if thewords are studied with care. At the close of the rule we are told that when“water, land and air meet” there is the place for the working of magic.Curiously in these phrases the idea of location is omitted and only the timeequation considered.Air is the symbol of the buddhic vehicle, of the plane of spiritual love, andwhen the three above enumerated (in their energy aspects) meet, it is indicativeof a focussing in the soul consciousness and a centralisation of the man in thespiritual body. From that point of power, outside of form, from the centralsphere of unification and from the focussed point within that circle ofconsciousness, the spiritual man projects his consciousness into the midway spotwithin the brain cavity where the magical work must, in relation to the physicalplane, be carried out. This ability to project the consciousness from the planeof soul realisation into that of creative magical work on the etheric subplanesis gradually made possible as the student in his meditation work developsfacility in focussing his attention in one or other of the centres in the body.This is accomplished through the medium of the force centres in the ethericbody. He gradually gains that plasticity and that fluidity of the self-directedconsciousness which will enable him to play on the centres, as a musicianutilises the seven notes of music. When this has been achieved he can begin totrain himself in wider and more extended focussings and must learn to withdrawhis consciousness, not only to the brain, but to the soul on its own plane andthence re-direct his energies in the performance of the magical work of thesoul.The fundamental secret of the cycles lies in this withdrawal and the subsequentre-focussing of attention and [249] it must be remembered in this connectionthat the basic law underlying all magical work is that “energy follows thought”.If aspirants would remember this they would live through their periods ofaridity with greater ease and would be conscious of the underlying purpose.It might here be asked what are the dangers of this midway spot?The dangers of too violent fluctuation between land and water, or between theemotional response to life and truth or life on the physical plane. Someaspirants are too emotional in their reactions; others too materialistic. Theeffect of this is felt in the midway spot and produces a violent instability.This instability has a direct effect on the solar plexus centre which was the“midway spot” in early Atlantean times, and is still the midway point in thetransmutation processes of the aspiring personality. It transmutes and transmitsthe energies of the sacral centre and of the centre at the base of the spine,and is the clearing house for all energies focussed in the centres below thediaphragm.The dangers incident to a premature and uncontrolled pouring in of purespiritual energy to the mechanism of the personality. That vital spiritual forceenters through the cranial aperture, and pours into the head centres. From themwill follow the line of least resistance which is determined by the daily trendof the aspirant’s thought life.Another and rather potent danger is the result, literally, of the bringingtogether of the land and water. It demonstrates as the pouring into the brainconsciousness (the land aspect) of the knowledges of the astral plane. One ofthe first things an aspirant becomes aware of is a tendency to the lowerpsychism. It is a reaction from the solar plexus centre. But this midway pointcan be utilised as a “jumping off place” into the world of astral phenomena.This will produce “death by drowning”, [250] for the aspirant’s spiritual lifecan be swamped and entirely submerged in the interests of the lower psychicalexperiences. It is here that many worthy aspirants go astray—temporarily it maybe, but the times are so critical that it is a matter to be deplored if any timeis lost in futile experimentation and the retracing of any path chosen.A clue to the significance of these words is to be found in the recognition ofthe following occult fact. The place where water and land meet is the solarplexus centre. The place where water, land and air meet is in the head. Land isthe symbol of the physical plane life, and of the exoteric form. Water is thesymbol of the emotional nature. It is from the great centre of the personalitylife, the solar plexus, that the life is usually ruled and governmentadministered. When the centre of direction lies below the diaphragm there is nomagic possible. The animal soul controls and the spiritual soul is perforcequiescent. Air is the symbol of the higher life in which the Christ principledominates, in which freedom is experienced and the soul comes to fullexpression. It is the symbol of the buddhic plane, as water is of the emotional.When the life of the personality is carried up into Heaven, and the life of thesoul comes down on to earth, there is the place of meeting, and there the workof transcendental magic becomes possible.This meeting place is the place of fire, the plane of mind. Fire is the symbolof the intellect and all magical work is an intelligent process, carried out inthe strength of the soul, and by the use of the mind. To make itself felt on thephysical plane, a brain is required which is receptive to higher impulses andwhich can be impressed by the soul utilizing the “chitta” or mental substance inorder to create the needed thought forms, and so express the ideas and purposesof the intelligent loving soul. These are recognized by the brain and are [251]photographed upon the “vital airs” found in the brain cavity. When these vitalairs can be sensed by the magician in meditation, and the thought-formsimprinted on this miniature reflection of the astral light, then the realpotency in magic can begin to make itself felt. The brain has “heard” occultlythe injunctions and instructions of the mind as it relays the behests of thesoul. The vital airs are swept into form-making activity just as their highercorrespondence, the “modifications of the thinking principle, the mind stuff”(as Patanjali calls it), are thrown into an analogous form-making activity.These can then be seen interiorly by the man who is seeking to perform themagical work and much of his success is dependent upon his ability to registerimpressions exactly, and to see with clarity the forms of the process in magicwhich he is seeking to demonstrate as magical work in the outer world.It might therefore be said that there are three stages in the form-makingprocess. First, the soul or spiritual man, centered in the soul consciousnessand functioning in “the secret place of the Most High”, visualizes the work tobe done. This is not a sequential act, but the finished completed work of magicis visioned by a process that does not involve the time element or spatialconcepts at all. Secondly, the mind responds to the soul (calling attention tothe work to be performed), and is swept into thought-form making activity bythis impression. According to the lucidity and illumination of the mind-stuff sowill be the response to the impression. If the mind is a true reflector andreceiver of soul impress, the corresponding thought-form will be true to itsprototype. If it is not true (as is usually the case in the early stages of thework) then the thought-form created will be distorted and incorrect, unbalancedand “out of drawing”.It is in meditation that this work of accurate reception [252] and correctbuilding is learnt and hence the emphasis laid in all true schools of esoterictraining upon a focussed mind, a capacity to visualize, an ability to buildthought-forms, and an accurate grasp of egoic intent. Hence also the need of themagician beginning the practical work of magic with himself as the subject ofthe magical experiment. He begins to grasp the vision of the spiritual man, ashe is in essence. He realizes the virtues and reactions which that spiritual manwould evidence in physical plane life. He builds a thought-form of himself asthe ideal man, the true server, the perfect master. He gradually coordinates hisforces so that power to be these things in external reality begins to take shapeso that all men can see. He creates a pattern in his mind which hews as true ashe can make it to the prototype, and which serves to model the lower man andforce conformity to the ideal. As he perfects his technique he finds atransmuting, transforming power at work upon the energies which constitute hislower nature, until all is subordinated and he becomes in practicalmanifestation what he is esoterically and essentially. As this takes place, hebegins to be interested in the magical work in which it is the function of alltrue souls to participate.Then the third aspect of the form-making process can manifest. The brain issynchronized with the mind, and the mind with the soul, and the plan is sensed.The vital airs in the head can be modified and respond to the force of thebuilding magical work. A thought-form exists then as the result of the previoustwo activities, but it exists in the place of the brain activity and becomes afocussing centre for the soul, and a point through which energy can flow for theperformance of the magical work.This magical work, carried out under the direction of the soul (inspiring themind which in its turn impresses the brain), leads then (as the result of thistriple coordinated activity) to the creation of a focussing centre, [253] orform, within the head of the magician. The energy which flows through this focalpoint acts through three distributing agents, and hence all three are involvedin all magical work.1. The right eye, through which the vital energy of the spirit can expressitself.2. The throat centre, through which the Word, the second aspect or the soulexpresses itself.3. The hands, through which the creative energy of the third aspect works.“The White Magician” works “with the eyes open, the voice proclaiming and thehands conferring.”These points are or technical interest to the experienced worker in magic, butof symbolic interest only to the aspirants for whom these letters are intended.That the inner vision may be ours, the eye see clearly the glory of the Lord,and the voice speak only in benediction, and the hands be used only inhelpfulness, may well be the prayer of each of us."},{"pageContent":"RULE NINECondensation next ensues. The fire and waters meet, the form swells and grows.Let the magician get his form upon the proper path.THE NECESSITY FOR PURITY[257] Rule number nine is found on page 1017 in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , andthe comment given in the Treatise is noticeably brief:“This rule is very briefly summed up in the injunction: Let desire and mind beso pure and so equally apportioned and the created form so justly balanced thatit cannot be attracted towards the destructive or ‘left-hand’ path.”The reasons for this brevity may be stated to be due to the extreme simplicityof this rule in the consciousness of the man who knows, and its extremecomplexity from the standpoint of the casual reader. Only the simplest and mostpractical of its significances is there given but perhaps a few of the deepermeanings can be imparted.It is interesting to note that as progress is made upon the path, the forms inwhich truth can be given become more and more simple, whilst the meaning graspedbecomes more and more wide and inclusive, and hence involves (on analysis) moreand more complexity. Finally, resort is had to symbols and the cosmic plan isgrasped through the presentation of geometrical forms to the inner eye of theaspirant.The cardinal point emphasized in this rule is purity and, in the last analysis,purity is largely a question of motive. If the incentive to action of any kindin the three worlds is based on personality desire and brought about by theapplied use of the mind, then impurity characterizes that action. If the impulseemanates from the [258] Dweller in the form, it is then subordinated andcontrolled by the Dweller to the desired end. Then the characteristic is puritywithin the group limitations, for absolute purity only exists when entirefreedom from control has been brought about. The soul is group conscious andgroup controlled, and (until the causal body has been overcome and liberationfrom its control achieved) the real significance of purity will not becomprehended. Suffice it to say that there is a close connotation betweenimpurity and limitation of any kind, physical, emotional and mental.But absolute purity need not here be considered by the aspirant. No one in theesoteric groups of the world has yet achieved the fifth initiation, wherein themeaning will enter the consciousness in a blaze of intensest realisation. Forthe majority, physical and emotional purity are the objectives, and primarilytherefore liberation from emotional control and desire. Hence the constant, e’enthough badly worded injunction in many of the esoteric books “Kill out desire”.Perhaps a more just rendering for the immediate present would be “re-orientdesire” or “re-direct desire”, for a constant process of re-orientation of theentire desire nature so that it eventually becomes a habitual state of mind isthe clue to all the transmutation processes, and to effective magical work.As progress on the Path is made the thought processes of the aspirant becomemore potent, and the thought-forms—created with definite purpose and in themeditation work—become more effective in the bringing about of results. It willbe apparent therefore that in magical work (which has ever to be wrought out onthe physical plane) there will always exist the tendency towards the “left-handpath” until soul consciousness is permanently established, and purity of motivehas become a habit of the mind.[259] May I remind all who read that the establishing and stabilizing of righthabits is, for the aspirant to discipleship, a prime requisite. Those who areworking in the field of planetary evolution are looking for dependableinstruments, and this cannot be too emphatically impressed upon all of you.People whose emotional moods and feelings run riot or who lack physical controlcannot be counted upon in an emergency by Those who are seeking helpers. Peoplewhose minds are clouded or whose inability to hold the mind “steady in thelight” is inherent, are unsuitable workers in the high places of worldendeavour. This remark need deter no one in these groups from pushing forward,for the recognition of a defect is a preliminary step towards its overcoming.These groups are in training and this must be borne in mind or elsediscouragement is apt to ensue when the ideal is enunciated. World need andopportunity go hand in hand at this time. The Great Ones, Who stand as a wallbetween humanity and planetary Karma are, we are told, hard pressed at thistime, and I assure you that this is but an inadequate statement of the case.The thoughts of men since the middle of the Atlantean period have steadily beenattracted toward the destructive or left-hand path, because selfishness has beenthe motive, and self-interest the dominant factor. Part of the work of theChrist when He came 2000 years ago was to offset this tendency by theinculcation, through example and precept, of sacrifice and unselfishness, andthe martyr spirit (tinctured as it oft was by hysteria and a heavenlyself-interest) was one of the results of this endeavour. Seen from thestandpoint of the Hierarchy, the effort has been successful, for the Christianspirit stands for re-orientation to heavenly things. Hence purity of motive andthe instinct for service, which latter keynote is new from the standpoint of thepast eternities.[260] In spite of this, however, the tendency to selfish interest is the mostpotent factor in the world at this time, and hence the critical situationexisting between the Hierarchy of Light and the hierarchy controlling theleft-hand path, or the path of control by form and desire.Let there be no discouragement, however, for the spiritual thought, resulting inmagical work, of one brother of pure intent is of far greater potency than thatof many brothers who follow the tendencies of the personality. Though every trueaspirant as he grasps the magnitude of the Plan and surveys the forces arrayedagainst him may be overcome by the apparent futility of his effort and theseeming smallness of the part he plays, let him remember that there is asteadily growing group of those similar to him and that this is a group effort.Under the Law the Great Ones work through Their disciples in all countries andnever before have there been so many endeavouring to fit themselves for thisfunction of being “Transmitters of the Purpose,” and never before has thereexisted such a strong inner integrity and subjective relation between workers inall fields in all parts of the world. For the first time in history is there acoherent group for the Masters to use. Heretofore, there have been lonelyisolated workers or tiny detached groups, and this has greatly hampered thework. Now this is changed.I want to charge you all to realize this and to work to substantiate this groupintegrity and to develop the power to recognize all such workers everywhereunder any name or organization and to cooperate with them when so recognized.This is no easy thing to do. It presupposes the following:1. An inner sensitiveness to the Plan.2. An ability to recognize principles, governing conduct and administration.[261]3. A capacity to overlook the non-essentials and to emphasize the essentials.4. A submergence of personal ambition and interest in the furthering of thegroup ideals and5. A steady preservation of the inner contact through meditation and theoverlooking and non-emphasis of personality reactions.These are basic pre-requisites and should receive the attention of workers andstudents in all groups.It would be of value if each student would link up every day at five o’clock byan act of the will with this rapidly integrating group of servers, mystics andbrothers. To this end it might be wise to commit to memory the following briefdedication to be said silently at that hour with the attention focussed in thehead:“May the Power of the one Life pour through the group of all true servers.“May the Love of the One Soul characterize the lives of all who seek to aid theGreat Ones.“May I fulfil my part in the One work through self-forgetfulness, harmlessnessand right speech.”Then carry the thought forward from the rapidly forming group of world-serversto the Great Ones who stand back of our world evolution.This can be done in a few seconds of time wherever one may be and in whatevercompany, and will not only aid in the magical work of the forces of light, butwill serve to stabilize the individual, to increase his group consciousness, andto teach him the process of carrying forward interior subjective activities inthe face of and in spite of outer exoteric functioning.FUNDAMENTAL FORMSThe simplicity of this Rule nine is such that in a few words the entire processof creative evolution is summarized. On the mental plane an idea takes form. On[262] the desire plane sentient energy pervades that form. Under theevolutionary process the form “swells and grows”. Through the right direction ofthe form and its orientation in the needed direction, the purpose of the thinkeris fulfilled.All life is vibration and the result of vibration is form, dense or subtle, andever subtler as ascension takes place. As the pulsating life progresses its rateof vibration changes, and in this changing of vibration lies hid the secret ofform-shattering and form-building. Forms are of four kinds in this era of thefourth round:1. The Form of the Personality, that vehicle of physical, astral and mentalmatter that provides the means of contact in the three worlds. It is built ineach life, the key of the vibration being set up in the life preceding thepresent. That form proves adequate for the average man and serves him tilldeath. The man who is entering on the occult path starts with the vehicleprovided, but during incarnation builds for himself ever a newer and bettervehicle, and the more progressed he is the more consciously he works. Henceeventuates that constant turmoil and frequent ill-health of the beginner in theoccult life. He senses the law, he realises the need of raising his key, andfrequently he begins with mistakes. He starts to build anew his physical body bydiet and discipline, instead of working from the inner outward. In the carefuldiscipline of the mind and the manipulation of thought-matter and intransmutation of emotion comes the working out on the physical plane. Add to thetwo above, physical plane purity as to food and manner of life, and in sevenyears time the man has built for himself three new bodies around the permanentatoms.2. The Form of the Environment. This is really the evolutionary working out ofthe involutionary group soul. It relates to our contacts, not just exterior, buton the inner planes as well. In similarity of vibration [263] comes coherency.When therefore a man raises his vibration and builds anew from the beginning,and alters consequently his key, it results in dissonance in his surroundingsand subsequent discord. Therefore—under the law—there comes always to thestriver after the Mysteries and the manipulator of the law, a period ofaloneness and of sorrow when no man stands by and isolation is his lot. Inlesser degree this comes to all, and to the arhat (or initiate of the fourthdegree) this complete isolation is a characteristic feature. He stands midwaybetween life in the three worlds and that in the world of adepts. His vibrationdoes not synchronise, prior to initiation with the vibrations of either group.Under the law he is alone. But this is only temporary. When the environmentsatisfies then is the moment of anxiety; it indicates stagnation. Theapplication of the law causes primary disruption.3. The Form of the Devotee. Yes, I mean just that word, for it expresses anabstract idea. Each person of every degree has his devotion, that for which helives, that for which—in ignorance, in knowledge or in wisdom—he wields as muchof the law as he can grasp. Purely physical may that devotion be, centred inflesh, in lust for gold, in possessions concrete. He bends all his energies tothe search for the satisfaction of that concrete form and therein learns. Purelyastral may be the aim of the devotee—love of wife or child, or family, pride ofrace, love of popularity, or lust of some kind—to them he devotes the whole ofhis energy, using the physical body to fulfil the desire of the astral.Higher still may be the form of his devotion,—love of art, or science orphilosophy, the life religious, scientific, or artistic—to them he consecrateshis energies, physical, astral and mental, and always the form is that ofdevotion. Always the vibration measures up to the goal, finds that goal, passesit and disintegrates. Pain enters [264] into all shattering of the form, andchanging of the key. Many lives, for millennia of years, are spent under thelower vibrations. As evolution progresses, more rapid is the development, andthe key changes from life to life, whereas in the earlier stages one key or tonemight be sounded for several lives in their entirety. As a man nears the Path,the Probationary Path becomes strewn with many shattered forms, and from lessercycle to lesser cycle he changes the key, often in one life heightening hisvibration several times. See therefore how the life of all aspirants, ifprogressing with the desired rapidity, is one of constant movement, constantchanges and differentiations, and continuous building and breaking, planning andseeing those plans disrupted. It is a life of ceaseless suffering, of frequentclashing with the environing circumstances, of numerous friendships made andtransferred, of mutation ceaseless and consequent agony. Ideals are transcendedonly to be found to be stations on the road to higher; visions are seen, only tobe replaced by others; dreams are dreamt only to be realized and discarded;friends are made, to be loved and left behind, and to follow later and moreslowly the footsteps of the striving aspirant; and all the time the fourth formis being built.4. The Form of the Causal Body. This is the vehicle of the higher consciousness,the temple of the indwelling God, which seems of a beauty so rare and of astability of so sure a nature that, when the final shattering comes of even thatmasterpiece of many lives, bitter indeed is the cup to drink, and unutterablybereft seems the unit of consciousness. Conscious then only of the innate DivineSpirit, conscious only of the Truth of the Godhead, realizing profoundly and tothe depths of his being the ephemeral nature of the form and of all forms,standing alone in the vortex of initiatory rites, bereft of all on which he mayhave leant (be it friend, Master, doctrine [265] or environment), well may theInitiate cry out: “I am that I am, and there is naught else.” Well may he thenfiguratively place his hand in that of his Father in Heaven, and hold the otherout in blessing on the world of men, for only the hands that have let slip allwithin the three worlds are free to carry the ultimate blessing to strugglinghumanity. Then he builds for himself a form such as he desires,—a new form thatis no longer subject to shattering, but suffices for his need, to be discardedor used as occasion warrants.In these days you will need to ponder on this matter of the form, for with theentering in of a new ray, and the commencement of a new era comes ever a periodof much disruption until the forms that be have adapted themselves to the newervibration. In that adaptation those who have cultivated pliability andadaptability, or who have that for their personality ray, progress with lessdisruption than those more crystallized and fixed.Particularly now should pliability and responsiveness of form be aimed at, forwhen He Whom we all adore comes, think you His vibration will not causedisruption if crystallization is present? It was so before; it will be so again.Cultivate responsiveness to the Great Ones, aim at mental expansion and keeplearning. Think whenever possible in terms abstract or numerical, and by lovingall, work at the plasticity of the astral body. In love of all that breathescomes capacity to vibrate universally, and in that astral pliability will comeresponsiveness to the vibration of the Great Lord.This summation of process and of the forms is equally true of God and His cosmiccreative work; of the soul, as it builds its instrument for expression, eitherunconsciously in the early stages or consciously in the later; of the disciple,as he seeks to express his realization of the work through group work and theorganization of his [266] life; and of perfected man, as he learns, throughexperience, to centre his forces on the mental plane and from there accomplishhis purpose in generating and producing those thought-forms which mould theminds of men, and embody in themselves that aspect of the Universal Mind whichis needed for the right production of that immediate fraction of the Plan whichhis age and generation require.All these various applications of the rule could be elucidated and enlargedupon. Our problem, however, must be kept clearly in mind. We are conscioussouls, or in process of becoming conscious. We are beginning, through ourmeditation work and our application to study, to work on mental levels. We arecreating forms continuously, pervading them with energy and sending them out tofulfill their function in line with our realized subjective purpose.The emphasis should be laid upon the word realized in the above paragraph.According to the clarity of vision and the depth of the inner realization sowill be the adequacy of the created form, and so will be the strength of thelife which will enable it to perform its intended function.Up to the present time the majority of aspirants in the world express theresults of little and weak thought, but rapid action. The goal for studentsshould at this time be rapid concentrated thought and slow action. That slowaction however will be potent in result; there will be no lost motion, nodelayed reactions, and no tendency towards hesitation. The attention of thethinker being focussed on the mental plane, the progress of his manifestedthought will be sure and inevitable. When the idea is clearly grasped, theattention closely focussed, and the energy or life aspect steadily applied, theresult will be irresistible appearance and potent action on the physical plane.[267] This thought must be borne in mind if the dangers of the left hand pathare to be avoided. Let me here make some statements in brief tabulated form,which will produce a truer understanding of the words “left hand path”. We aredealing here primarily with those thought-forms which man creates:1. The left hand path concerns the matter aspect and the life poured into theform serves only to vitalize the atoms in substance. The potency of the loveaspect—as wielded by the soul—is lacking.2. The form created is constituted of mental matter, of astral matter and ofphysical substance. It lacks the soul contribution. Its purpose is in line withthe development of form, but not in line with soul expression.3. The left hand path, therefore, is the path of progress for substance ormatter. It is not the path of progress for the soul aspect. It is the “way ofthe Holy Ghost” but not the way of the Son of God. I express this truth in thesewords as it serves peculiarly to make the distinction clear and yet preservesthe integrity of substance-matter and their Unity within the One Life.4. All forms created at every stage are either confined to the left hand path orembrace it and yet go beyond it, and follow the right hand way. This sentenceprovides food for thought and its meaning is difficult to gather. It should beborne in mind that all forms, whether they follow the right or left hand way arealike up to a certain point; they travel the same progressive stages and at onetime in their career they appear uniform and alike. Only when their purposeappears does the distinction become apparent, and hence the training of theaspirant in right motive as a preparatory step to true occult work.[268] The question might be asked: What is meant by occult work?True occult work involves:1. The contacting of the Plan.2. Right desire to co-operate with the Plan.3. The work of thought-form building and the confining of the attention of thecreator of these thought-forms to the mental plane. This is of so potent anature that the thought-forms created have a life cycle of their own and neverfail to manifest and perform their work.4. The direction of the thought-form from the mental plane and the confining ofthe attention to that specific enterprise, knowing that right thought and rightorientation lead to correct functioning and the sure avoidance of the left handpath.This is a lesson little appreciated by aspirants. They engage in emotionaldesire for the appearance of their thought-form and the manifestation of theidea. They spend much time following the orthodox methods of work and inphysical plane activities. They wear themselves out by identifying themselveswith the form they have created instead of remaining detached from it, andacting solely as the directing agents. Learn to work on the plane of mind. Buildthere your form, remembering that if you submerge yourself in the form for whichyou are responsible it may obsess and dominate you and then the form will be thedominant factor and not the purpose of its existence. When the form controlsthen comes the danger that it may be turned in the wrong direction and find itsway on to the left hand path and so increase the power of matter and its holdover sentient souls.It might be briefly added that anything that tends to increase the power ofmatter and add to the potent energy of form-substance produces a tendency to theleft [269] hand path and a gradual attraction away from the Plan and the Purposewhich it veils and hides.All work and all created thought-forms (whether they materialize as anorganization, a religion, a school of thought, a book or a life work of anykind) which express spiritual ideals and lay the emphasis upon the life-aspectcome under the category of white magic. They then form part of the stream oflife which we call the right hand Path, because it leads humanity out of forminto life, and away from matter into consciousness.In an ashram of one of the Great Ones not long ago, a disciple asked his masterto express this truth to him in such a way that though the words might be fewyet the import would be worthy of continuous consideration. His master made thisreply:“Only the Sons of Men know the distinction between the magic of the right andleft hand ways and when they have achieved, these two ways will disappear. Whenthe Sons of Men know the distinction which exists between matter and substance,the lesson of this epoch will be grasped. Other lessons will be left but thisone passes. Matter and substance together work out the way of darkness.Substance and purpose blended indicate the way of light.”"},{"pageContent":"RULE TEN[273] As the waters bathe the form created, they are absorbed and used. Theform increases in its strength; let the magician thus continue until the worksuffices. Let the outer builders cease their labours then, and let the innerworkers enter on their cycle.THOUGHT-FORM BUILDINGIn Rule Ten two facts about the form are stated, which are true of all forms,and three strong injunctions are given in the following terms:The facts are:1. The form absorbs and uses the waters in which it is immersed.2. As a result it grows in strength.The three injunctions are:1. Let the magician go on building his form until its adequate potency isassured.2. Then let the “outer builders” cease from labour.3. Let the “inner builders” enter on their cycle.We have seen how, in the process of thought-form building, the time came whenthe form had to be oriented in the right direction and set upon the proper pathin order to carry out its creator’s will and purpose. This takes place fairlyearly in the work and after the process of orientation the work of buildingproceeds, for the thought-form is not yet ready for an independent life. Thereis a true analogy between the gestation period of an infant and that of athought-form. The importance of the right placement of the child within the wombis never overlooked by a good physician, and where there is analogously a wrongposition upon the path to be followed into manifested existence, death andtrouble oft ensue. The analogy is close—as you well know. Birth is preceded bythe “breaking of the waters” (in medical [274] parlance), and before thethought-form brings about the desired results on the physical plane there comestoo a similar reaction; the waters of desire become so potent as to causeprecipitation, and the consequent appearance of the desired form of expression.Let us take the facts and analogies as they stand and study them from thestandpoint both of the macrocosm and the microcosm.We note that the form absorbs and uses the substance wherein it is immersed. Oursolar system is one of many, and not the greatest. It constitutes a fragment ofa greater whole. This greater whole, formed of seven parts (or seven solarsystems), is itself immersed in the waters of space, is born of desire and,therefore, a child of necessity. It draws its life from its surroundings.Streaming into our solar system from all sides are force currents, emanatingfrom what A Treatise on Cosmic Fire calls the “One about Whom naught may besaid”. These currents embody His will and desire, express His love or attractivecapacity, and manifest as that great thought-form we call our system.In parentheses, it is well to note that this Existence is termed “the One aboutWhom naught may be said”, not because of secrecy or mystery, but because allformulation of ideas about His life and purpose are impossible until one hascompleted the term of evolution in our solar system. Note, I say, our solarsystem, not just our planetary existence. Speculation about the Existence who,through His life, informs seven solar systems is wasted energy. On our planet,only such great lives as the Buddha, the Kumaras and the planetary Logos, arebeginning to sense the dynamic impulse of the greater Whole, and even they areonly sensitive to it but are, as yet, utterly unable to conceive of its trend,for it lies beyond mind and love and will. It brings into play factors [275] forwhich we have no terms and tendencies which are as yet not even remotelyvisioned on our planet.We have generated a term we call the ether. Occultly speaking, this is themodern way of expressing “the waters of space”, which are the waters of desire,in which we are immersed. It is in constant ebb and flux, and is the stream oflife, constituted of forty-nine types of energy, which pours through the cosmicegoic lotus, and (radiating forth from it) feeds with its measure of sustenancethe form—solar, planetary, or human—for which it is responsible. This is dealtwith in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire.Man is immersed in forces which are to him as the waters of space are to oursolar system. He finds himself, as does our sun and its attendant planets,forming part of a whole, and just as our system is but one of seven systems,drawn together to form the body, or manifested expression of a life, so is thehuman kingdom of which he is an infinitesimal part, one of seven kingdoms. Theseare the correspondences in the life of the planetary Logos to the seven solarsystems. When he begins to sense the life of the solar Logos as it expressesitself through the seven planetary schemes we will have touched theconsciousness of the planetary Logos of our special scheme, who is sensingsomewhat the united vibrations of the lives of the seven solar Logoi.Bringing the analogy down closer still, the human kingdom itself is an analogousstate of consciousness to the human unit through its subjective force existence,and from the standpoint of consciousness provides “the waters of space” in whicha human being thrives and grows. Again, we are met in the fourth kingdom withexpressions of the same seven forces, and as man awakens to a recognition of theseven rays or types, and begins to work consciously with them, he is taking thefirst step towards transcending them and controlling them [276] within his fieldof operation. This is now taking place. Knowledge of the seven ray types isbeginning to permeate among the thinkers of the race and this knowledge was inpast aeons the prerogative of the initiates of the time. Held latent in theastrological presentation is that information which will lead disciples torealization, and which will put them en rapport with the seven planetaryschemes. Real developments in astrology may not be looked for, however, untilthe New Age is really with us and the new orientation achieved.The form of humanity is completed. Its right placement within the womb of matteris the objective of the Hierarchy, with all the consequent implications. Notethese words. The need at this time is terrific, and the soul is at the birthingin humanity as a whole. Cosmically speaking, if right direction of the forces ofthe human kingdom is now achieved, there will be manifested on the earth ahumanity which will manifest a purpose, a beauty and a form which will be fullexpressions of an inner spiritual reality and in line with egoic purpose. Othereventualities can be sensed as sadly possible but these we will not consider forit is the hope and the belief of the watching Brothers that men will transcendall undesirable eventualities and make the goal. One word here, and one hint.The Hierarchy of the planet constitutes symbolically the head centre of humanityand their forces constitute the brain forces. On the physical plane are a largeband of aspirants, probationary disciples and accepted disciples who are seekingto be responsive to the “head centre”, some consciously, others unconsciously.They are gathered from all fields of expression but are all creative in some wayor other. They in their turn constitute what might be symbolically called the“pineal gland” of humanity. As in individual man this is usually dormant andasleep, so, in humanity, this group of cells within the brain of the bodycorporate is dormant, [277] but thrilling to the vibrations of the headcentre—the occult Hierarchy. Some of the cells are awake. Let them intensifytheir endeavour and so awaken others. The pioneers of the human family, thescientists, thinkers and artists constitute the pituitary body. They express theconcrete mind but lack that intuitive perception and idealism which would placethem (symbolically speaking) in the pineal gland; they are neverthelessbrilliant, expressive and investigating. The objective of the Hierarchy (againsymbolically speaking) is to make the pineal gland so potent and, therefore, soattractive that the pituitary body of cell lives may be stimulated and thus aclose interplay be brought about. This will lead to such potent action thatthere will be a streaming forth of new cells to the pineal gland and at the sametime such a strong reaction set up that the entire body will be affected,resulting in the streaming upward of many stimulated lives to take the places ofthose who are finding their way into the centre of hierarchical endeavour.The “waters of space”, in which this re-orientation and reversal of tendenciesis progressing, are in a state of violent turmoil. The vortex of conflictingdesire in which men find themselves is now chaotic and so potent that thesewaters are stirred to the very depths. Students of modern history and of socialorder are faced with an unprecedented condition, corresponding in the corporatebody of humanity to that upheaval in the life of an individual aspirant whichalways precedes the passing onto the Path of Discipleship. Hence there is nocause for depression or undue anxiety, but only ardent desire that thetransition may be made in due time and order and be neither too rapid—hencedestructive to all right ties and affiliations—nor too prolonged and so strainbeyond endurance the sorely tried fabric of humanity. All new manifestations inall kingdoms in all ages must come slowly, and therefore safely, to thebirthing. [278] All new forms, if they are ultimately to carry weight and gatheradequate momentum to carry them through their life cycle, must be built insilent subjectivity, in order that the building may be strong and sure and theinner contact with the creator (human or divine) and true conformity to thepattern may be substantial and unbreakable. This is true of a universe, akingdom in nature, or a thought-form created by a human thinker.In all form-building the technique of construction remains basically the same,and the rules and realizations may be summed up in the following aphoristicphrases.Let the creator know himself to be the builder, and not the building.Let him desist from dealing with the raw material on the physical plane, and lethim study the pattern and the blue prints, acting as the agent of the DivineMind.Let him use two energies and work with three laws. These are the dynamic energyof purpose, conforming to the Plan, and the magnetic energy of desire, drawingthe builders to the centre of endeavour.Let these three laws hold sway, the law of synthetic limitation, of vibratoryinterplay, and of active precipitation. The one concerns the life, the secondconcerns the building, and the third produces manifested existence.Let him deal first with the outer builders, sending his call to the periphery ofhis circle of influence.Let him set the waters of living substance in motion by his idea and impulse,bending the builders to his purpose and plan.Let him build with judgment and with skill, preserving always the “stool of thedirector” and coming not down into close contact with his thought-form.Let him project, in time and space, his form through [279] visualization,meditation and skill in action, and so produce that which his will commands, hislove desires, and his need creates.Let him withdraw the builders of the outer form, and let the inner builders ofdynamic force push it forth into manifestation. Through the eye of the creatorare these inner builders brought to functioning, directed action. Through theword of the creator were the outer builders guided. Through the ear of thecreator the volume of the greater Word vibrates through the waters of space.Let him remember the order of creative work. The waters of space respond to theword. The builders build. The cycle of creation ends and the form is adequate inmanifestation. The cycle of performance succeeds and depends for its duration onthe potency of the inner builders, who constitute the subjective form andtransmit the vitalising life.Let him remember that the cessation of the form ensues when purpose is achieved,or when impotency of will produces failure of functioning in the cycle ofperformance.Students would do well to study these cycles of creative building, ofperformance and of subsequent disintegration. They are true of a solar system,of a human being, and of the thought-forms of a creative thinker. The secret ofall beauty lies in the right functioning of these cycles. The secret of allsuccess on the physical plane lies in right understanding of law and of order.For the aspirant the goal of his endeavour is the correct building of forms inmental matter remembering that “as a man thinketh so is he”; that for him thecontrol of mental substance and its use in clear thinking is an essential toprogress.This will demonstrate in organization of the outer life, [280] in creative workof some kind—a book written, a picture painted, a home functioning rhythmically,a business run along sound and true lines, a life salvaged, and the outer dharmacarried out with precision, whilst the inner adjustments proceed in the silenceof the heart.For the disciple, the work extends. For him there has to be realization of thegroup plan and purpose and not simply of his own individual spiritual problem.There has to be conformity to the purpose for his immediate cycle and lifeperiod; the subordinating of his personal dharma and ideas to the need andservice of that cycle. For him there has to be that attainment of knowledge, ofstrength, and of coordination between the personal self and the soul which willresult in ability to build organized forms and groups on the physical plane andto hold them coherently together. This he does, not through the force of his owncharacter and equipment but because that character and equipment enable him toact as a transmitter of the greater life energies and to serve as an efficientcooperator with a plan of which he can only vision a fragment. He works,however, faithfully at the building of his aspect of the great plan and findsone day when the building is completed and he sees the whole, that he has builttrue to design and in conformity with the blue prints as they have been carriedin the minds of the architects (the Elder Brothers) who—in Their turn—are intouch with the Mind of the one Existence.The practical application of these truths is of utmost importance. There is nolife so circumscribed and no person so situated who cannot begin to workintelligently and to build thought-forms under law and with understanding. Thereis no day in any man’s life, particularly if he is an aspirant or a disciple,when a man cannot work in mental matter, control his use of thought, watch theeffect of his mental processes on those he contacts, and [281] so handle his“chitta” or mind-stuff (as Patanjali calls it) that he becomes more and moreuseful.THE CENTRES, ENERGIES AND RAYSThere are two connections in which this Rule Ten can be studied and therebyresults of practical value can be achieved. We can study it from the standpointof the work which the soul does in relation to its instrument, the human being,and we can also study it from the standpoint of organisation work and of thatform-building which the disciple does in relation to his service for theHierarchy.Back of the outer form of a human being, responsible for its creation, itsmaintenance and its use, lies, we know, the soul. Back of all activity for thefurthering of human evolution as well as of other evolutionary processes standsthe Hierarchy. Both represent centres of energy; both work under Law creatively;both proceed from subjective activity to objective manifestation and both areresponsive (in the great sequence of graded lives) to vitalisation andstimulation from higher centres of energy. Some of the factors that the disciplehas to learn to recognize as his particular series of lives unfolds falls intotwo main groups, each of them bringing his form aspect under seven types ofenergy, or influences.There is first the group of forces which concerns purely the form side, that arethe work of the outer Builders, and which are the predominant factors right upto the stage of the Probationary Path. These are the forces inherent in matteritself; they deal with the body nature and might be listed as follows:1. Physical forces. These are due to the life of the cells which constitute thebody. This cell life is responsive to the cell life of the environment. Neverlet it be forgotten that the occultist always sees the correlation [282] betweenthe factors in himself and the corresponding factors in his surroundings. Welive in a world of forms. These forms are made up of lives and these lives havetheir own emanatory and contributory influence. They fall in their turn intothree main groups:a. Those emanations, which issuing from the cells themselves and dependent upontheir quality, produce a good or a bad effect, are coarsening or refining intheir influence, and raise or lower the physical vibration of the united cellbody. Thus, as we well know, the physical effect of a coarse brutal animalnatured man will be different to that of the refined beautifying results ofcontact with an older soul, functioning in a body, cultured, clean, disciplinedand purified.b. Those emanations, of a purely physical kind which are responsible for thatchemical affinity between one animal body and another which produces the comingtogether of the sexes. It is an aspect of animal magnetism and is the responseof the cells to the call of other cells, acting under the Law of Attraction andRepulsion. It is shared by man with the animals, and is instinctive and freefrom all mental reactions.c. Those forces or emanations, which are the response of the cells to harmoniousrhythms and therefore dependent upon the cell having in itself something of thatto which it responds. These emanations are little understood as yet, but willincreasingly come to the fore as the race progresses. This type of force is thatmysterious something which enables the physical body to recognise as harmoniousor congenial a physical surrounding or environment, for instance. It is thatundefinable reaction which results in two human beings (apart [283] from all sexattraction, for people of the same sex experience it with each other) having aharmonious effect physically upon each other. This is, on the outer plane, theesoteric basis for all group relation, and it is the understanding of theseemanations that enables the isolation and segregation of races to be carriedforward under the great evolutionary plan.These three might be described as the quality of the cell forces operatingentirely on the physical plane which produce a peculiar type of physical body,the magnetic attraction between two physical bodies, and the racial types .These three factors guide the Manu of the race as He builds a new race andimpresses the outer Builders with His ideas. They also guide a Master of theWisdom as He builds His physical body at will for the carrying forward of Hiswork in any time or place. These emanations should, in measure, be understoodsomewhat by all those engaged in forming organisations and groups for activeservice in the world. What, should the disciple ask himself, should be thevibratory quality of the cells of that body, of the individuals who compose it?What should be the quality of its attractive force, and of the magnetic effectit is to have in the world? What does the group possess through the medium ofits corporate units which will put it en rapport with other groups and so makeit harmonious in its relations with them? These questions warrant carefulattention and should be considered by all group builders.2. Vital forces. These are often regarded by the materialists as intangible andtherefore not material at all. But the occultist regards the etheric medium as aform or aspect of matter and as relatively tangible as the outer objective form.To him the ether of space, which term necessarily includes the etheric form ofall bodies, the [284] astral or emotional sentient body and the mental body,constituted of mind-stuff, are all of them material and are the substance of theform side of life. As the basis of correct understanding, it should be notedthat the cell life to which we have above referred is coordinated, influencedand vitalised by the blood stream, that intricate system which interpenetratesevery part of the body, is responsible for its welfare and demonstrates in amanner not yet truly comprehended the fact that the “blood is the life”. Theblood is an aspect of energy, as is the sap in the vegetable kingdom.The sympathetic nervous system, that marvellous apparatus of sensation, isclosely related to the emotional or astral body. The contact is made via thesolar plexus, just as the vitality, governing the quality of the blood stream,makes its contact via the heart. In the heart is the centre of physical planeexistence. The cerebrospinal system works in close relation to the chitta ormind stuff. Therefore we have the following to consider:1. Cell life Blood stream Heart centre Thymus gland. 2. Sensory life Sympatheticnervous system Solar plexus centre Pancreas. 3. Mental life Cerebro-spinalsystem Ajna centre Pituitary body 4. Vital life Seven centres Spleen.This, as you see, governs the manifestations of the quaternary, but there areother aspects of humanity which manifest through the objective form and whichcomplete the entire man and make the seven of his manifold objective existence.5. Self-conscious upper brain Head centre Pineal gland. 6. Self-expression lowerbrain Throat centre Thyroid. 7. Self-perpetuation sex organs Sacral centreReproductive organs. 8. Self-assertion entire man Centre at base of spineAdrenals.[285] You will notice that eight factors are here enumerated, and it is herethat many of the schools go astray. The heading ‘vital life’ is a comprehensiveone, but it must be remembered that it relates entirely to the physicalvitalisation of man through the lowest aspect of the centres. This vital life ofthe universe of matter enters into the human organism through the spleen.The centres have three main functions:—First, to vitalise the physical body.Second, to bring about the development of self-consciousness in man.Third, to transmit spiritual energy and sweep the entire man into a state ofspiritual being.The vitality aspect is shared by man with the animals and with all createdforms, and his capacity to move freely in a three dimensional world is theoutstanding achievement of that aspect. The self-consciousness aspect is theprerogative of the human family. When man has evolved, when all parts of hisnervous system, his endocrine system, and his centres are coordinated andworking in harmonious rhythm then the highest aspect (the spiritual) makes itspresence felt. The spiritual energy and not just the consciousness or sentientenergy pours through Man, the instrument of divine Life, and the custodian offorces, to be held and used for the other and lower kingdoms in nature.The above enumeration might therefore be arranged in the following order. Thetable gives man as he is intended to be and not as he now is in the course ofhis evolutionary progress.[286]1. Self-assertion (full development) the coordinated quaternary Centre at baseof spine Adrenals. 2. Self-expression (creative work) Lower brain Throat centreThyroid. 3. Self-conscious life (personality). Upper Brain Head centre Pinealgland. 4. Self-perpetuation Sex organs Sacral centre Sex glands. 5. Mental lifeCerebro-spinal system Ajna centre Pituitary. 6. Sensory life Sympathetic nervoussystem Solar plexus Pancreas. 7. Cell life Blood stream Heart centre Heart.The eighth point, the vital life, functioning through the seven centres and awhole system of lesser chakras and the nadis (which underlie the nerves and arethe cause of their existence as the centres are of the glands) is the medium ofmany forces and energies—some purely physical, others related to the AnimaMundi, the World Soul, and others unknown as yet, because they will only maketheir presence felt later in the evolutionary programme. They will then expressdivinity, the energy of the Father or the highest aspect.It should be noted that the above tabulation pictures the second ray unfoldment,and also that the self referred to is the self-realisation of the spiritual man.The lowest aspect of the vital life of God is the perpetuation of the species,and this is the result of the livingness of the incarnated Life; and the next issimply expressive of the stage when the “I” consciousness is dominant and hasreached its consummation in the completed personality. Then comes the expressionof the indwelling self, hidden by the personality, through its creative activityof a non-physical character. Finally, we have the assertion or fullmanifestation of the divine nature. This, curiously enough, can only occur whenthe lower spinal centre is aroused, when the energy of the material nature iscarried by an act of the will up into Heaven, and when therefore the entirenature—material, sensitive or psychic, and the existence aspect—are unified andrealised. Meditate upon these words, for they connote the consummation as far ashumanity is concerned.[287] The occult aphorism: “To will, to know, to dare, and to be silent” , has aspecial significance not hitherto revealed and at which it is only possible forme to hint. Those of you who have the inner knowledge will comprehend at once.To Will . These words relate to the ultimate achievement, when, by an act of thecombined will of the soul and of the lower man, unification and realisation arebrought about. It concerns the centre at the base of the spine.To Know. These words concern the Ajna centre, the centre between the eyebrows. Ahint lies in the words ‘Let the Mother know the Father’. It has relation to themarriage in the Heavens.To Dare. These words give the clue to the subordination of the personality, andhave a close connection with the solar plexus, the great clearing house ofdesire and of the astral forces, and also the main centre of the transmutativework.To Be Silent . This phrase relates to the transmutation of the lower creativeenergy into the higher creative life. The sacral centre has to relapse intosilence.It will be seen then that for the disciple the following centres are ofparamount importance:1. The ajna centre, through which the purified personality expresses itself.2. The centre at the base of the spine, which is the centre through whichcomplete and utter control and coordination is achieved, through the arousing ofthe purifying agency of fire.3. The sacral centre, wherein the basic force of our particular solar system,the force of attraction of form to form is transmuted, and the attractive forceof the soul takes the place of the reproductive creative material activity.[288]4. The solar plexus centre which, situated in the centre of the body and beingthe organ of the astral body and of the lower psychism, gathers together alllower forces and redirects them under the impulse of the soul to their higherrepositories.I realise that the teaching given here is both deep and abstruse, but it isneeded for the few, and their numbers will increase as time elapses.The complexity of the subject is also increased by the fact that each ray holdswithin its teaching a different approach and a different method for those soulswho are found responsive to its peculiar impulse.I give here the seven keys for each of the ray methods. These can be studied inrelation to the above tabulations and in connection with the four words we havebeen considering. We must remember that ‘To Will’ is the prerogative of Spirit,‘To Know’ is the function of the Soul, ‘To Dare’ is the duty of the personality,and ‘To Be Silent’ is the ultimate dharma or destiny of the matter aspect, ofthe animal nature in its interplay with the soul.First Ray :—”Let the Forces come together. Let them mount to the High Place, andfrom that lofty eminence, let the soul look out upon a world destroyed. Then letthe word go forth: ‘I still persist!’”Second Ray: —”Let all the life be drawn to the Centre, and enter thus into theHeart of Love Divine. Then from that point of sentient Life, let the soulrealise the consciousness of God. Let the word go forth, reverberating throughthe silence: ‘Naught is but Me!’”Third Ray: —”Let the Army of the Lord, responsive to the word, cease theiractivities. Let knowledge end in wisdom. Let the point vibrating become thepoint quiescent, and all lines gather into One. Let the soul realise the One inMany and let the word go forth in [289] perfect understanding: ‘I am the Workerand the Work, the One that Is.’”Fourth Ray: —”Let the outer glory pass away and the beauty of the inner Lightreveal the One. Let dissonance give place to harmony, and from the centre of thehidden Light, let the soul speak: Let the word roll forth: ‘Beauty and gloryveil me not. I stand revealed. I am.’”Fifth Ray: —”Let the three forms of energy electric pass upward to the Place ofPower. Let the forces of the head and heart and all the nether aspects blend.Then let the soul look out upon an inner world of light divine. Let the Wordtriumphant go forth: ‘I mastered energy for I am energy Itself. The Master andthe mastered are but One.’”Sixth Ray :—”Let all desire cease. Let aspiration end. The search is over. Letthe soul realise that it has reached the goal, and from that gateway to eternalLife and cosmic Peace, let the word sound: ‘I am the seeker and the sought. Irest!’”Seventh Ray: —”Let the builders cease their work. The Temple is completed. Letthe soul enter into its heritage and from the Holy Place command all work toend. Then in the silence subsequent, let him chant forth the Word: ‘The creativework is over. I, the Creator, Am. Naught else remains but Me.’”The vital forces, which are simply the passing through the outer sheath of theconstantly moving ether of space, are of many kinds. One of the concepts, lyingback of the astrological theories, is that the etheric body of any formconstitutes part of the etheric body of the solar system, and is therefore themedium for the transmission of solar energies, of planetary forces, and ofextra-solar or cosmic impulses, esoterically called ‘breaths’. These forces andenergies of the cosmic rays are constantly circulating and following definitepaths through the ether [290] of space in all parts, and are thereforeconstantly passing through the etheric bodies of every exoteric form. This is abasic truth and must be carefully borne in mind, for its implications are manyand varied; but all lead back to the idea of unity, and of the Oneness of allmanifestation, only to be known and realised on the subjective side.The second basic idea is that the response of the etheric vehicle of all formsand its capacity to appropriate, to utilise, and to transmit are dependent uponthe condition of the centres, of the chakras, as they are called in the East.These include not only the well known seven major centres but numbers of lesservortices of force, as yet unnamed and unknown in the occident. It is dependentalso upon the quality of the etheric vehicle, upon its aliveness, and also uponthe interlacing network in which the centres have their place, and which in itsentirety is called ‘the web’ or the ‘golden bowl’. If this is clear ofimpediments and of sediment, and if its channels are not clogged then thecirculating rays, energies and forces can find an easy medium and can circulateunimpeded throughout the entire body. They can then utilise those centres whichare responsive to their vibrations, and can be passed on and through to forms inother or the same kingdoms in nature. Here lies the secret of all scientific andoccult healing. Healers are experimenting with the etheric body and yet littlereal knowledge is theirs. They know little or nothing of the centres in theirown body through which the magnetic or other currents must flow; they areunaware of the condition of the etheric centres of those they seek to heal andof the nature of the forces they wish to employ. All they can do is todiscipline their lives, and so control their appetites that they build a cleanbody and provide clear channels for the passage of forces from and throughthemselves to others.The third concept to be noted is that forms are, as yet [291] primarilyresponsive to the forces which reach them from other forms on the planet, to theseven basic types of energies emanating from the seven planets, and also to thelife-giving solar ray. All forms in all the four kingdoms respond to these manyforces, to these seven energies and to the one ray. The human family areresponsive also to other energies and to solar rays,—all however coloured by theforce generated within the solar ring-pass-not.The work of the occultist and of the aspirant is to arrive at an understandingof these forces and so learn their nature and their use, their potency andvibratory rate. He has also to learn to recognise their source and be able todifferentiate between forces, energies and rays. For the beginner a cleardistinction can be made between forces and energies by appreciating the factthat personalities affect us through the forces emanating from their formaspect, but that these same personalities, purified and aligned, can betransmitters of the energies of the soul.Broadly speaking, the work of the human kingdom is to transmit energy to thelower kingdoms in Nature, whilst the work of the Hierarchy, in its relation tothe human kingdom, is to transmit energies from the spiritual realm, from otherplanetary centres, and from the solar system. These energies when stepped downfor transmission differentiate into forces.Students must not get confused by the complexity of the subject. They must learncertain large generalisations, and remember that as the omniscience of the soulis tapped, the more detailed knowledge will gradually fall into place.The other types of energy which concern the first two main groups with which theaspirant has to deal are related entirely to the form side. The third andsucceeding groups are: [292]3. Astral energy.4. The energy of the lower concrete mind, of the chitta, the mind-stuff.5. The energy of the Personality.6. Planetary energy.7. Solar energy, or the Life Breath.These can be subdivided as follows:3. Astral Energy. Emanating from:a. A man’s own astral or sentient body.b. The human family as a whole.c. The astral plane in the large sense.d. The ‘heart of the Sun’.4. Mental Energy. Emanating from:a. The individual chitta or mind-stuff.b. The mentality of:1. The human family as a whole.2. The particular race to which a man belongs.c. The mental plane as a whole.d. The Universal Mind.5. Personality Energy . Emanating from:a. The coordinated form of man.b. Advanced human beings who are dominant personalities.c. Groups, i.e.1. The Hierarchy of the Planet. Subjective.2. The integrating group of Mystics. Objective.6. Planetary Energy . Emanating from:a. The seven planets. This is the basis of astrological practice.b. The Earth.c. The Moon.7. Solar Energy. Emanating from:a. The physical Sun.b. The Sun, acting as a transmitter of cosmic Rays. [293]ASTRAL ENERGY AND FEARThe subject now to be considered is of most practical application for itconcerns the astral body—the body in which a man is pre-eminently polarised andof which he is more potently conscious than of any other body. The etheric bodyis really below the threshold of consciousness. Human beings remain unaware ofthe passage of forces through this vehicle and the nearest they get to therecognition of it is when they speak in terms of vitality or lack of vitality.The physical body makes its presence felt when something goes wrong or throughthe gratification of one or other of the appetites. The situation is howeverdifferent in connection with the astral body for there is the vehicle ofexperience for the majority, and few there are who do not pass the greater partof their conscious life, recording the reactions of that body and vibratingbetween the two poles of happiness and misery, of satisfaction ornon-satisfaction, of assurance or doubt, of courage or of fear. This reallymeans that the inherent force and life of the emotional sentient vehicle governthe life-expression and mould the experience of the incarnated soul. Therefore,it is of value to us to understand something of what those forces are, wherethey come from, and how they act and react on the man. There lies hisbattleground and there also lies his field of victory.To begin with, it is advisable to bear in mind that all astral energy is part ofthe astral energy of the solar system and that therefore:1. The sentient body of a human being is an atom of substance in the sentientbody of the planetary Logos.2. The sentient body (a term I much prefer to the term astral, and which I shallcontinue to use) of [294] the planetary Logos is an aspect—not an atom—of thesentient body of the solar Logos.3. This in its turn is influenced by, and is a channel for sentient forces,emanating from vast centres of energy outside our solar system altogether.If this is borne in mind it becomes apparent that man, being but a tiny fragmentof a vaster whole which in its turn is incorporated into a still vaster vehicle,is the meeting ground of forces greater and more diversified than his brain iscapable of recognizing. Hence the complexity of his problem and hence all thepossibilities growing out of those expansions of consciousness which we callinitiation. Every stream of energy pouring through his body of desire and ofsentient reaction, is but a pathway leading him to wider and every wideningcontacts and realisations. Here also lies the safeguard for the majority ofhuman beings, in the fact that they possess as yet an apparatus inadequate forthe registering and recording of those infinite possibilities which theseavenues of realisation offer. Until the mental apparatus is sufficientlyawakened and controlled it would not be possible for man to interpret rightlyand utilise correctly the information which his body of sensitive responsecould, but fortunately does not yet, convey to him.Apart from the constant circulation through his astral body of planetary andsolar and cosmic energies, every human being has appropriated, out of thegreater Whole, enough of the astral energy wherewith to construct his ownindividual and separate astral body, responsive to his peculiar note, colouredby his peculiar quality, and limiting him or not according to his point on theladder of evolution.This constitutes his astral ring-pass-not, defining the limits of his emotionalresponse to life experience, embodying [295] in its quality the range of hisdesire life, but being at the same time capable of tremendous expansion,development, adjustment and control under the impulse of the mental body and ofthe soul. It is subject also to vibratory activity as the result of theinterplay between it and the physical plane life experience, and thus the greatwheel of experience is set in motion and will persist until the four NobleTruths of the Buddha are understood and realised.This astral body has in it the counterparts of the etheric or laya centres, andthrough them stream the forces and energies, earlier dealt with, into theetheric body. These centres carry energies from the seven planets and from thesun to every part of the astral organism, thus putting man en rapport with allparts of the solar system. This results in the fixation of a man’s life destiny,until such a time as the man awakens to his immortal heritage and so becomessensitive to forces that are as yet—for the many—unrecognised. These emanatefrom the form. This is the reason why a horoscope is frequently quite accuratein its delineation for the unevolved and for the unawakened, but is quite inerror and at fault in the case of the highly evolved man. Man is, en masse, whathis desire body makes him. Later, “as a man thinketh so is he”. The astral body,with its longings, appetites, moods, feelings, and cravings moulds the physicalbody through the attractive forces which flow through it, and so guides the manon unerringly to the fulfilment of his desires. If the cravings of the sentientnature are dominantly animal in their objective we shall have the man withstrong appetites, living a life given over to the effort to satisfy them. If thecraving is for comfort and for happiness, we shall have the man with a sensuous,beauty-loving and pleasure-loving disposition, governed practically entirely byselfish effort. So it is through all the many grades of desire, good, bad, [296]and ordinary, until that re-orientation takes place which so refocusses theastral energies that they are turned in a different direction. Desire becomesaspiration. Thus liberation from the wheel of birth is brought about and a manis freed from the necessity to reincarnate. Then the horoscope as now understoodproves futile, untrue and useless and the term sometimes used, but wrongly, ‘thehoroscope of the ego or the soul’ means nothing. The soul has no individualdestiny, but is submerged into the One. Its destiny is the destiny of the group,and of the Whole; its desire is the working out of the great Plan, and its willis the glorification of the incarnated Logos.I would like to suggest to students that they procure if possible The Science ofthe Emotions by Bhagavan Das. It is an able treatise on the astral and sentientbody, and deals with the factors that most nearly concern the aspirant as hefaces the problem of understanding and of controlling his emotional nature, ofmastering the technique of development, and of reorienting it to widerexperience and of preparing it for the tests and expansions of the second majorinitiation—the baptism and the final entering of the stream. Metaphoricallyspeaking, the experience that lies ahead upon the Path is covered in thefollowing esoteric phrases:“When the stream enters the River of Life, its passage can be traced for a shortmoment and then is lost. When the currents of the sentient life meet where theriver passes round the mountain’s massive foot, then one vast stream is seenwhich floweth north.”The symbology of this is apparent, and can be also used to depict the flow ofthe two currents—Ida and Pingala—and their blending in the river of energy thatmounts to the head. There is the meeting place, and there the sacrifice, enactedupon the mount of Golgotha (the place of the skull). [297]In considering the sentient body of a human being I will probably help the mostif I deal with it in terms of its moods and ordinary expressions, for it is onlyin dealing with its effects and in seeking to master them that man arrives atknowledge of himself and so becomes a Master. The most ordinary manifestationsof astral activity are:I. Fear.II. Depression or its opposite pole, hilarity.III. Desire for the satisfaction of the animal appetites.IV. Desire for happiness.V. Desire for liberation. Aspiration.In these five are summed up practically most of the sentient experiences of manand we will consider each one from the following angles:1. The cause.2. The effect.3. The method of direction.You will note that I say ‘method of direction’ not method of control. Aspirantsmust learn that they are working with, and in, forces, and that right and wrongactivity on the physical plane is due simply to a right or wrong direction ofthe force currents and not to anything inherently wrong or right in the energiesthemselves.I. Fear. This is one of the most usual of the manifestations of astral energy,and is put first because it constitutes, for the vast majority, the Dweller onthe Threshold and also in the last analysis is the basic astral evil. Everyhuman being knows fear and the range of the fear vibrations extends from theinstinctual fears of the savage man based on his ignorance of the laws andforces of nature, and on his terror of the dark and the unknown, to the fears soprevalent today of loss of friends and loved ones, of health, of money, ofpopularity [298] and on to the final fears of the aspirant—the fear of failure,the fear which has its roots in doubt, the fear of ultimate negation or ofannihilation, the fear of death (which he shares equally with all humanity) thefear of the great illusion of the astral plane, of the phantasmagoria of lifeitself, and also fear of loneliness on the Path, even to the very fear of Fearitself. This list could be largely extended but suffices to indicate theprevalence of fears of all kinds. They dominate most situations and darken manyhappy moments. They reduce man to a timid and frightened atom of sentient life,standing afraid before the stupendousness of the problems of existence, aware ofhis insufficiency as a man to cope with all situations and unable to leave hisfears and questionings behind and step into his heritage of freedom and of life.Often he is so ridden by fear that he becomes afraid of his very reason. Thepicture cannot be too blackly coloured, for fear is the dominant astral energyat this time and sensitive humanity succumbs all too easily to it.You ask: What are the basic causes of fear? To that question, if carried farenough back into the esoteric history of the solar system there is nointelligible answer to be given. Only the advanced initiate can comprehend. Fearhas its roots in the warp and woof of matter itself, and is par excellence, aformulation or effect of the mind principle, and a result of mental activity.The fact that birds and animals know fear puts the whole subject upon a widerfooting than if it were simply a human failing and the result of the activity ofthe functioning of the human mind. It is not incident upon a man’s possessing areasoning mind; if he used his reason in the correct way he could eliminatefear. It lies in what is called cosmic Evil—a high sounding phrase, conveyinglittle. It is inherent in the fact of matter itself and in the play of the pairsof opposites—soul and matter. The sentient souls [299] of animals and of men aresubconsciously aware of factors such as:1. The vastness and therefore the sensed oppression of the Whole.2. The pressure of all other lives and existences.3. The working of inexorable Law.4. The sense of imprisonment, of limitation, and of consequent inadequacy.In these factors, growing out of the manifested process itself and persistingand growing in potency during the ages, are found the causes of all modern fearand the basis of all terror, above all that which is purely psychological andnot just the instinctual fear of the animal.To concretise the matter more clearly would not help. Of what use is it to betold that fear is a quality of evil (or of matter) which colours fundamentallyor characterises the astral or sentient body of our planetary Logos? What haveyou gained if I outlined to you the problem of the great Life in Whom we liveand move and have our being as He, on His Own cosmic plane, seeks liberation andfaces His Own peculiar trials and tests? How can words adequate be found toconvey a cosmic struggle between Lives so impersonal and exalted inconsciousness that the words his, or he or tests prove simply laughable andconvey no possible aspect of truth or reality whatsoever? Cosmic evil, cosmicprogression, or cosmic problems can well be left to that distant time whenaspirants have taken the third initiation, have lost all sense of separateness,and—being identified with the Life Aspect and not with the form side—cantherefore enter somewhat into the state of consciousness of our planetary Logos,sense His destiny, and vision fleetingly the wonder of the consummation.Let us confine our attention therefore to man and more [300] particularly toaverage man, and see whence come the waves of fear which sweep him so constantlyoff his feet.1. The Fear of Death is based upon:a. A terror of the final rending processes in the act of death itself.b. Horror of the unknown and the indefinable.c. Doubt as to final immortality.d. Unhappiness at leaving loved ones behind or of being left behind.e. Ancient reactions to past violent deaths, lying deep in the subconsciousness.f. Clinging to form life, because primarily identified with it in consciousness.g. Old erroneous teaching as to Heaven and Hell, both equally unpleasant inprospect to certain types.I speak about Death as one who knows the matter from both the outer worldexperience and the inner life expression:—There is no death. There is, as youknow, entrance into fuller life. There is freedom from the handicaps of thefleshly vehicle. The rending process so such dreaded does not exist, except inthe cases of violent and of sudden death and then the only true disagreeablesare an instant and overwhelming sense of imminent peril and destruction, andsomething closely approaching an electric shock. No more. For the unevolved,death is literally a sleep and a forgetting, for the mind is not sufficientlyawakened to react, and the storehouse of memory is as yet practically empty. Forthe average good citizen, death is a continuance of the living process in hisconsciousness and a carrying forward of the interests and tendencies of thelife. His consciousness and his sense of awareness are the same and unaltered.He does not sense much difference, is well taken care of, and oft is unawarethat he has passed [301] through the episode of death. For the wicked andcruelly selfish, for the criminal and for those few who live for the materialside only, there eventuates that condition which we call ‘earth-bound’. Thelinks they have forged with earth and the earthward bias of all their desiresforce them to remain close to the earth and their last setting in the earthenvironment. They seek desperately and by every possible means to re-contact itand to re-enter. In a few cases, great personal love for those left behind orthe non-fulfilment of a recognised and urgent duty holds the good and beautifulin a somewhat similar condition. For the aspirant, death is an immediateentrance into a sphere of service and of expression to which he is wellaccustomed and which he at once recognises as not new. In his sleeping hours hehas developed a field of active service and of learning. He now simply functionsin it for the entire twenty-four hours (talking in terms of physical plane time)instead of for his usual few hours of earthly sleep.As time progresses and before the close of the next century death will befinally seen to be non-existent in the sense in which it is now understood.Continuity of consciousness will be so widely developed and so many of thehighest types of men will function simultaneously in the two worlds that the oldfear will go and the intercourse between the astral plane and the physical planewill be so firmly established and so scientifically controlled that the work ofthe trance mediums will rightly and mercifully come to an end. The ordinarycommon trance mediumship and materialisations under controls and Indian guidesare just as much perversions of the intercourse between the two planes as aresex perversions and the distortions of the true relationship and intercoursebetween the sexes. I refer not here to the work of clairvoyants, no matter howpoor, nor to the taking possession of the body by entities of high calibre, butof [302] the unpleasant phenomena of the materialisation seance, of ectoplasm,and the blind unintelligent work done by old Atlantean degenerates andearthbound souls, the average Indian chief and guide. There is nothing to belearned from them and much to be avoided. The reign of the fear of death iswell-nigh ended and we shall soon enter upon a period of knowledge and ofcertainty which will cut away the ground from under all our fears. In dealingwith the fear of death, there is little to be done except to raise the wholesubject onto a more scientific level, and—in this scientific sense—teach peopleto die. There is a technique of dying just as there is of living, but thistechnique has been lost very largely in the West and is almost lost except in afew centres of Knowers in the East. More of this can perhaps be dealt with laterbut the thought of the needed approach to this subject can rest in the minds ofthe students who read this and perhaps as they study and read and think,material of interest will come their way which could be gradually assembled andpublished.2. Fear of the Future. This is a fear that will as yet show a growing tendencyto develop and will cause much distress in the world before it is obliterated.It grows out of three human capacities:a. Instinctive psychological thought habits, which have their roots deep in theanimal nature and hark back to the primal instinct of self-preservation. Savageraces however, have little of this. That forward looking anticipatory state ofmind is predominantly a human characteristic and is that germ of the imaginativefaculty, linked to the mental processes, which will eventually merge into thatintuitive meditation, plus visualisation, which is the true basis of allcreative work. But at present it is a menace and a hindrance. Ancient suffering,dire memories, haunting miseries, deep-seated in the subconscious rise to thesurface frequently and cause a condition [303] of fear and of distress which noamount of reasoning seems able to quiet. Facilities of communication put eventhe most unimportant en rapport with the tragedies, pains and sufferings of hisbrother thousands of miles away. The economic catastrophe of the present timehas brought about a condition of mass terror, and the more sensitive theindividual the more he will react to this state of mind. Fear of the future istherefore a distressing blend of instinctual memory and anticipatoryimagination, and few there are who escape this menace. Worry and anxiety are thelot of every man and cannot and will not be offset and overcome by any lesserfactor than the soul itself.b. The flashes of prevision emanating from the soul who is dwelling in theconsciousness of the Eternal Now. When contact with the soul is firmlyestablished and the consciousness of the Knower is stabilised in the brain thenprevision will carry with it no terror. The picture will then be seen as awhole, and not as a passing and fragmentary glimpse as is now the case. Soagain, the remedy remains the same: the establishing of such close relationsbetween the soul and the brain, via the trained and controlled mind, that causeand effect will be seen as one, and right steps can be taken to handlesituations correctly and to the best advantage. Prevision seldom takes the formof forecasting happiness, and the reason is not far to seek. The race is at apoint where the prodigal son is conscious of the husks and of the futility ofearthly life. He is ready for a careful consideration of the Buddha’s message,and he is ready because he has been devoured for centuries by war and famine, bydesire and by the economic struggle. The vista he sees before him appears blackand forbidding and full of cataclysmic disaster.Yet if men carried the concept of brotherhood with all its implications into thelife and work of every day, into [304] all intercourse whether between thecapitalist and the labourer, the politician and the people, between nation andnation, or between race and race, there would emerge that peace on earth whichnothing could upset or overturn. So simple a rule, and yet utterly beyond themental grasp of the majority!c. A mass of individual distress and fear can be taken on by an individual andyet have nothing to do with him whatsoever. It is quite possible for a man totune in on the fears of other people whilst he himself has literally nothing tofear of any kind. He can so identify himself with their forebodings of futuredisaster that he interprets them in terms of his own coming experience. He isunable to dissociate himself from their reactions and absorbs so much of thepoison in their emotional and mental auras that he is swept into a very vortexof terror and of fear. Yet, if he did but know it, the future holds for him nohidden catastrophes. He is simply deluded, but the effect on his astral body andupon his solar plexus is identically the same. This is painfully the case nowthat there are so many thousands of sensitive aspiring souls, inexperienced inthe handling of the world karma, wide open to the suffering of others and unableto distinguish between their own destiny in the immediate future and the destinyof others in their environment.It is possible also for the more advanced aspirant and those upon the Path ofDiscipleship to contact ancient vibrations of evil and misery on the astralplane—evil long past and gone; it is possible for them to read a tiny fragmentof the akashic records which concerns coming distress to an individual or agroup, which they themselves may never see and yet nevertheless appropriate theconveyed information to themselves and suffer consequently.3. Fear of Physical Pain . Some people have this fear as the underlying cause ofall their anxieties, little though [305] they may recognise it. It is really aresult of the other three classes of fears; of the strain which they put upontheir astral body, and the tension caused by the use of the imaginative facultyand the reasoning tension in the physical nervous system. This system becomesvery much over-sensitised and capable of the most acute physical suffering. Illsand ails which would seem of no vital importance to the ordinary and morephlegmatic types are aggravated into a condition of real agony. This should berecognised by those who care for the sick and steps should be taken to minimisethe physical condition through the use of sedatives and of anesthetics so thatundue strain should not be put on an already overworked nervous system.You ask me whether I am endorsing the use of ether and chloroform in operations,and of sedative drugs. Not basically, but most certainly temporarily. When man’scontact with his soul is firmly established, and when he has developed thefaculty of passing in and out of his physical body at will, these helps will nolonger be needed. They may be regarded in the meantime as emergency measures,necessitated by world karma and the point of evolution of the race. I am not ofcourse referring to the use of narcotics and of drugs by hysterical andunbalanced people, but to the judicious use of ameliorants of pain under thewise guidance of the physician.4. Fear of Failure . This affects many people along many lines. The fear thatone may fail to make good, the fear that we may not gain the love and admirationof those we love, the fear that others despise us or look down upon us, the fearthat one may fail to see and grasp opportunity, these are all aspects of thefear complex which colours the lives of so many worthy people. This can be basedupon an environment which is uncongenial and unappreciative, on an equipmentwhich seems inadequate [306] to its task, and in many cases has its roots in thefact that a man is a disciple, or a really big soul ready to tread theProbationary Path.He has had a touch of soul contact; he has seen the vision and the possibility;he looks at his personality and ranges it up alongside the work to be done, andthe quality of the people with whom that has brought him into contact. Theresult is an inferiority complex of a most powerful kind, because fed by realstreams of force from above. Energy, we know, follows thought and is tincturedby the quality of that thought. The man turns a critical and disgusted eye uponhis personality and by so doing feeds the very things which he deplores and thusrenders himself still more inadequate to the task. It is a vicious circle ofeffort and must be offset by a complete realisation of the truth contained inthe words: “As a man thinketh, so is he.” As he dwells upon the nature of hisomniscient soul, he becomes like that soul. His thought is focussed in the soulconsciousness and he becomes that soul in manifestation through the medium ofthe personality.This is but a brief summation of the major fears which afflict humanity andserves only to open up the subject and give opportunity for a few practicalsuggestions.II. Depression or its polar opposite, hilarity . When we touch on the subject ofdepression we are dealing with something so widespread that few escape itsattacks. It is like a miasma, a fog which environs the man and makes itimpossible for him to see clearly, walk surely, and cognise Reality. It is partof the great astral illusion and, if this is grasped, it will become apparentwhy depression exists, for the cause of it is either astral or physical andincident to a world situation or a personal situation. We might therefore studydepression in individuals and look at its causes. It is caused by: [307]1. The world glamour. This sweeps an isolated unit, otherwise free fromindividual conditions producing depression, into the depths of a world reaction.This world glamour with its devitalising and depressing results has its roots invarious factors which we have only the time to briefly indicate:a. Astrological factors, either affecting the planetary chart and henceindividuals, or primarily racial. These two factors are oft overlooked.b. The path of the sun in the heavens. The southern path tends to a loweredvibratory influence and aspirants should bear this in mind in autumn and theearly winter months.c. The dark half of the moon, the period towards the end of the waning moon, andthe early new moon. This, as you well know, affects the meditation work.d. Psychological factors and mass inhibitions due undoubtedly to forces externalto the planet and to plans, obscure in their intent to ordinary humanity. Theseforces, playing upon the human race, affect the most sensitive; they in theirturn affect their environment and gradually a momentum is established whichsweeps through a race or a nation, through a period or a cycle of years, andproduces conditions of profound depression and of mutual distrust. It causes asad self-absorption and this we term a panic or a wave of unrest. The fact thatthe working out may be military, economic, social or political, that it may takethe form of a war, of a religious inquisition, of financial stringency orinternational distrust is incidental. The causes lie back in the blue prints ofthe evolutionary processand are governed—even if unrealised—by the good Law. [308]2. Astral polarisation. Just as long as a man identifies himself with hisemotional body, just as long as he interprets life in terms of his moods andfeelings, just as long as he reacts to desire, just so long will he have hismoments of despair, of darkness, of doubt, of dire distress, and of depression.They are due to delusion, to the glamour of the astral plane, which distorts,reverses and deceives. There is no need to dwell on this. If there is one factoraspirants recognise it is the need of freeing themselves from the GreatIllusion. Arjuna knew this, yet succumbed to despair. Yet in his hour of need,Krishna failed him not, but laid down in the Gita the simple rules wherebydepression and doubt can be overcome. They may be briefly summarised as follows:a. Know thyself to be the undying One.b. Control thy mind, for through that mind the undying One can be known.c. Learn that the form is but the veil which hides the splendour of Divinity.d. Realise that the One Life pervades all forms so that there is no death, nodistress, no separation.e. Detach thyself therefore from the form side and come to Me, so dwelling inthe place where Light and Life are found. Thus illusion ends.It is his astral polarisation which lays a man open to his many emotionalreactions and to waves of mass feeling of any kind. This is the cause of hisbeing swept into that vortex of uncontrolled energy and misdirected emotionalforce which eventuates in a world war, a financial panic, a religious revival,or a lynching. It is this also that raises him to the heights of hilarity and ofspurious happiness in which the “light deceptive” of the astral plane uncoversto him false sources of amusement, or the mass hilarity—owing to hissensitivity—sweeps him into that hysterical condition which finds its vent [309]in unrestrained merriment and which is the opposite pole of unrestrainedweeping. I refer not here to true merriment nor the proper sense of humour, butto those hysterical outbreaks of hilarity which are so common among the rank andfile of humanity and lead to reactions of fatigue.3. A devitalised condition of the physical body. This is due to various causes,such as:a. A depleted etheric or vital body.b. Physical disease, either inherent or brought over from another life,accidental, or due to wrong emotional reactions, or produced as the result ofgroup karma, such as an epidemic.c. Atmospheric. This is sometimes overlooked, but the condition of theatmosphere, the nature of the climate, the density, humidity or dryness, theheat or cold have a definite effect upon the psychological outlook.You will find, if you study, that all subsidiary and temporary causes ofdepression and its opposite can be grouped under one of these three heads, andwhen one has ascertained the cause, the cures will become apparent.I have dealt somewhat at length with the two first manifestations of astralforce—Fear—fear of death, of the future, of suffering, of failure, and the manylesser fears to which humanity is subject—and Depression—because these two fearsconstitute for man the Dweller on the Threshold in this age and cycle. Both ofthem indicate sentient reaction to psychological factors and cannot be dealtwith by the use of another factor such as courage. They must be met by theomniscience of the soul working through the mind,—not by its omnipotence. Inthis is to be found an occult hint. I shall not deal with the other factorslisted, such as desire for happiness, for the satisfaction of the animalappetites, and [310] for liberation, for these do not constitute for themajority such a problem as the first two. One could write at length on themanifestation and the cause of all these, but when fear and depression areovercome, the race will enter into its heritage of happiness, of truesatisfaction (of which the cravings above indicated are but the symbols) and ofliberation. Let us deal with the basic evils first. Once they have beendominated all that remains is right orientation and polarisation in the soul.We will next consider the overcoming of wrong vibration in the astral body andthe use of astral energy in the right direction.We have been dealing at length with the subject of the astral or sentient body,and have considered the various wrong ways in which it makes its presence felt.Humanity vibrates primarily in one or other of these ways, and the sentient bodyof the average human being is scarcely ever free from some mood, some fear, someexcitement. This has provided a condition whereby the solar plexus centre isabnormally developed. In the bulk of humanity the sacral centre and the solarplexus govern the life, and that is why desire for material living and for thesex life are so closely blended. The solar plexus in the animal is the brain andgoverns all the instinctual reactions, but is not so closely allied with thepurely sex expression as it is in the human being. When the brain is becomingsensitive to the awakening mind and is not so entirely occupied with themechanism which registers sensory impression, we shall have the orientationwhich will eventually raise the consciousness into those centres which lie abovethe diaphragm. The solar plexus will then again be relegated to its old functionas a directing agent of the purely instinctual animal life. For the advancedpupil in the world, the solar plexus is largely the organ of psychic sensitivityand will remain so until the higher psychic powers supersede the lower [311] andman functions as a soul. Then the sensory life will drop below the threshold ofconsciousness.THE RIGHT USE OF ENERGYIn considering the overcoming of wrong vibration and the right direction ofastral energy it might be of value here if we were very briefly to list themajor energies which impress the human organism and circulate through thesentient body of man.1. Energies passing and repassing through the sentient body of the planetitself. This is, in other words, the astral body of the spirit of the earth.This entity is not the planetary Logos, but a being of great power on theinvolutionary arc, who holds the same relation to the planetary Logos as theastral elemental does to the human being. Facts about this life will be found inthe Treatise on Cosmic Fire . Its life is the aggregate of a vast number oflives, and those lunar pitris or lesser builders who constitute the sentientlife of the personality aspect of the planetary Logos—a more potent force forgood and also for evil, as we use the word “evil”. Evil, per se, isnon-existent, as is good in the sense of the pairs of opposites. Only in timeand in space are there varying states of consciousness, producing differingouter effects. The energy of this involutionary life has a potent effect on thatother tiny involutionary life which constitutes our astral elemental. The factthat protects from complete sensitive identification with this greater life isman’s individuality and the potency of his rapidly coordinating personality.Man is an individual. He is the result of other factors and the combination ofthese factors constitutes his protection from complete absorption in theplanetary sentient life, as is the case with the animals. At death, man’s astralbody disintegrates and then its particles [312] again constituteundifferentiated fragments of the great whole.2. Certain astral energies, emanating from some planetary forms which as yetexist not in the form of physical planets, nor yet in the etheric realm, butwhich are enclosed within the ring-pass-not of our solar system. They represent,in the planetary sense, two groups of lives:—First, those astral shells ofdecaying and disintegrating planets which are to be seen by the initiate, stillrevolving around our sun, but which are nevertheless fast disappearing. Our moonwill join their number when the complete disintegration of the outer form hastaken place. Second, the astral forms of those lesser solar lives on theevolutionary arc who are taking form slowly but have not yet taken an ethericbody, and will never in this world period take a physical body. These two groupsare the planetary correspondences to the re-incarnating types of men, and tothose who have passed over and are slowly shedding their bodies, prior toeventual rebirth, or who have completely vacated their shells.There are two of these astral forms in close proximity to our Earth, which arerapidly “decomposing”, if I may so term it, and yet have a very potentinfluence. On account of this close relation, they produce two types of desireor of astral tendency among men. One produces much of that instinctual tendencyto cruelty which one sees in children and in certain types of men, and the otherhas an effect upon the sex life and produces some of those tendencies toperversions which cause so much difficulty now. Sadistic tendencies and sexperversions find much strengthening influence from these dying astralemanations. In ancient days they were still more potent, being closer to ourearth than now; hence the ritualistic cruelties and the horrors, for instance,of Sodom and Gomorrah. Their power is rapidly declining and it should beremembered that they would have no [313] power at all were there not in humanityitself certain instincts upon which these energies can work. It should also beremembered that in Lemurian times their influence was constructive, for in thosedays, the lesson of sex and the intelligent registering of pain had a place inthe schemes of those who were endeavouring to lead animal man into humanconsciousness—not into soul consciousness or even into self-consciousness inthose very early times.Close to our earth, on the road to rebirth, is a great Life in process of takingetheric form. This Life, being on the evolutionary arc and not constituting thelife of a decaying shell, is having a real effect in the inauguration of the NewAge. This effect is twofold:—through the emanations from the astral body of thisgreat Life the work of breaking down the separative wall of individualism whichdemonstrates in man as selfishness and in nations as nationalism is carriedforward. Through this rapidly integrating etheric body this Life is bringing theetheric body of our planet into a state of increased rapid vibration. Referencewill be found in the Treatise on Cosmic Fire to an avatar from Sirius who comesto bring about certain planetary effects. This Life is not that avatar but is inthe nature of a forerunner—of a St. John the Baptist, who “baptiseth with water(astral emanations) and the Holy Ghost”. More information along these lines isnot possible, but mention is made of it, as the energies coming from these twofactors must be borne in mind.3. Astral energies emanating from the new sign of the zodiac into which we arenow entering, the sign Aquarius. This sign, that of the water-carrier, is aliving sign and an emotional sign. It will (through the effect of its potentforce) stimulate the astral bodies of men into a new coherency, into abrotherhood of humanity which will ignore all racial and national differencesand will [314] carry the life of men forward into synthesis and unity. Thismeans a tide of unifying life of such power that one cannot now vision it, butwhich—in a thousand years—will have welded all mankind into a perfectbrotherhood. Its emotional effect will be to “purify” the astral bodies of menso that the material world ceases to hold such potent allure, and may in itslater stages bring about a state of exaggeration as potent in the line ofsentiency as that which we have undergone in the line of materiality! The finalstages of all signs produce over-development of the factor on which they mostpotently work. At present the effect of this sign is constructive among thepioneers of the race, and destructive among the rank and file of humanity. Factsabout the coming Aquarian age can be searched for in the current books on thesubject and it profits not for me to enlarge upon them here.4. Faint emanations from the sacred “heart of the sun”, unrecognized by themasses but instantly calling forth response from the mystics of the race who areasserting increasingly a group integrity of a very real moment and interest.These emanations are too high to be sensed by humanity at large, but the mysticsreact and are drawn together by the sensing of the new vibration. Their work isthen to step down the vibration so that its effects can be sensed in time by theforemost of the race. The work of this group of mystics must thereforeinevitably grow, for the “heart of the solar Logos” beats now in closer rhythmwith this planet than has heretofore been the case (this not being a sacredplanet.) The love and thought of that divine Life is turned towards this “littledaughter of a long lost son”, as our planet is sometimes called in the occultbooks of the Great Ones.5. Another mass emanation which sweeps the astral body of man into strenuousactivity is the impulsive desire of the astral body of the fourth or humankingdom, [315] viewing it as a whole, or as the expression of a life. Thissentient body of humanity responds in an unrealised manner to all the four abovetypes of astral energy and according to the calibre of the individual astralbody, and according to the stage of development so will come response. It is inthis fact that the roots of mass psychology and of mob rule lie. Also the rootsof public opinion, so-called, are to be found here, but it will be long beforethe psychologists of the academic schools will recognize these four factors. Itis with this type of sentient response that the leaders of men seek to work,moulding the thoughts of men in order to awaken desire for this, that and theother. They work with this type of sentient matter without the leastunderstanding of the situation, and without any comprehension of the factorswith which they are dealing; they work magnetically if on the second ray, andwith the inspiring of fear through destruction if on the first ray. If on thethird ray, they use the Law of Expediency. Thus all three work with the astralbodies of men, and their capacity to succeed is dependent largely upon their owntype of astral body, and its power to attract others who are sufficientlydeveloped to respond with adequate sentiency and then to carry forward the goodwork. The man in the street is therefore the victim of the astral potency ofthose who drive him either for their own ends or for the good of his soul—for itworks in both directions.6. The astral life, or sensitive emanations of a man’s surrounding family orfriends. They affect him far more than he may credit, or he may affect them,according to which side is positive and which is negative. Everyone we meet, orcontact, every person with whom we live or daily consort has an effect upon us,either for good or evil. They either stir up our emotional nature in a good andhigh sense, and so aid its work of re-orientation, or they lower its standard sothat progress is hindered and [316] the work of drawing downwards towardsmateriality is carried forward. This we know well, and it is unnecessary for meto enlarge upon it here.7. The emotional (astral sentient) equipment with which a man enters into life,which he utilises, and which he builds as life progresses. Many a man is thevictim of an emotional body which he has himself constructed as he responded tothe energies of the groups enumerated above. The astral body reacts to allemanations of a sensitive character in three ways:a. Emotional. The astral body is swept into response of some kind to theemanations of the astral bodies—group bodies or individual—of those surroundinghim. This phrase warrants careful study.b. Sensitive . There is always a registering of all impressions by the sensitiveastral body, even if emotional response lacks, and disciples have to learn todistinguish carefully between the two. Sometimes when emotional reaction lacks,as generally understood, there is nevertheless a registering of the originatingcause which sought to bring about an effect on the emotional body.c. Simple reaction. The registering or the refusal to register or respond to animpact, to an emotional impression. This can be either good or bad.In all three cases, one or other of the pairs of opposites is chosen and thechoice depends upon the quality of the astral mechanism of the man concerned. Afourth method involves complete detachment from the emotional body altogether,and a complete capacity to isolate oneself from any sensory impression atwill—in order to serve with greater efficiency and to love with greaterintelligence. Forget not that in the last analysis, love and emotion are not thesame. [317]The practical question now arises: How is one to overcome the wrong vibration?First:—It is necessary that one recognises what wrong vibration is, and that oneis able to register reaction. A vibration, an impulse, an emotion, a desireoriginate in a lower aspect of the form side. They differ from an emanationcoming from the soul. The two impacts upon the sentient body must be recognisedas different. The question has to be asked: Is this reaction a response topersonality life or is it a response to the soul consciousness? Does thisimpulse which seeks to sweep my sentient body into activity come from the divineLife within me or is it coming from the form aspect in any of itsmanifestations? Does it cause my astral body to become active in such a way thatthose who are en rapport with me are hurt thereby or helped? Are they hinderedor aided?A close study of one’s emotional reactions brings one to the consideration ofthat basic characteristic which cannot be over-emphasized in view of the world’spresent condition. Harmlessness . I tell you that the achieving of harmlessnessin the positive sense (not in the negative) means the attainment of that stepwhich leads definitely to the Portal of Initiation. When first mentioned, itsounds of small moment, and to bring the whole subject of initiation into suchsmall account that it becomes unimportant. But let him who so thinks practicethat positive harmlessness which works out in right thought (because based onintelligent love), right speech (because governed by self-control), and rightaction (because founded on an understanding of the Law), and he will find thatthe attempt will call forth all the resources of his being and take much time toachieve. It is not the harmlessness that comes from weakness and sentimentalloving disposition, which dislikes trouble because it upsets the settled harmonyof life and leads to consequent [318] discomfort. It is not the harmlessness ofthe little evolved negative impotent man or woman, who has not the power to hurtbecause possessing so little equipment wherewith damage can be done.It is the harmlessness that springs from true understanding and control of thepersonality by the soul, that leads inevitably to spiritual expression inevery-day life. It emanates from a capacity to enter into the consciousness andto penetrate into the realisation of one’s brother, and when this has beenaccomplished—all is forgiven and all is lost sight of in the desire to aid andto help.Response to wrong vibration will not be basically prevented by the methods ofeither “building a shell”, or by “insulation” through the power of mantrams andvisualisation. These two methods are temporary expedients by which those who asyet have somewhat to learn seek to protect themselves. The building of a shellleads to separativeness, as you well know, and necessitates the eventualovercoming of the habit of shell-building, and a shattering and consuming of theshells already built. This latter can be more easily done than the overcoming ofthe habit. Automatically the building process goes on until finally the aspiranthas built so many ramparts around himself that he can neither get out nor canany contacts be made with him. The process of insulation, which is a moreadvanced practice and calls for more magical knowledge, consists of theemanating of certain energies of the vital body in a particular direction, whichserve to keep other energies at a distance through what is called impact.Through this impact upon approaching energies, they are reversed and sent inanother direction. But those energies must go somewhere, and should they damageanother person, is not the one who reversed their direction through a desire toprotect himself responsible?The practice of harmlessness is the best and easiest [319] way for the aspirantto work. There is then nothing in him which is inimical to any life in any form,and he therefore attracts to himself only that which is beneficent. He uses thebeneficent forces thus attracted for the helping of other beings. This has to bethe first step, and the discipline it entails and the constant supervision ofall the activities on the three planes of human evolution and of all reactionsbring the emotional body under the dominance of the illumined mind. They alsobring about the understanding of one’s fellow men.There is secondly, a later stage wherein the disciple learns to absorb andtransmute the wrong vibrations and the energies which are destructive. He has noshells nor barriers. He does not insulate himself nor isolate himself from hisbrothers. Through harmlessness he has learnt to neutralise all evil emanations.Now he acts with a positiveness of a new kind. Definitely and with fullawareness of what he is doing, he gathers into himself all the evil emanations(destructive energies, and wrong forces) and he breaks them up into theircomponent parts and returns them whence they came, neutralised, impotent andharmless, yet intact in nature. You say that this is a hard teaching and conveysbut little to the average aspirant? Such is ever the way in esoteric teaching,but those who know will understand and for them I speak.Another method is still more advanced and is utilised by the initiate. Through aknowledge of the law and of certain Words of Power he can command the energiesto reverse themselves and to return to their originating centre. But with thismethod we have nothing to do. There must as yet be much practice in harmlessnessand a close watch kept upon its application in the daily life.The right direction of astral energy can be summed up in its three aspects fromthe ancient Book of Rules, given to chelas of the entering degrees. All trueesoteric [320] schools begin with the control of the astral body and, the chelahad to memorise and practice these three rules after he had made some realgrowth in the manifestation of harmlessness.Rule I. Enter thy brother’s heart and see his woe. Then speak. Let the wordsspoken convey to him the potent force he needs to loose his chains. Yet loosethem not thyself. Thine is the work to speak with understanding. The forcereceived by him will aid him in his work.Rule II. Enter thy brother’s mind and read his thoughts, but only when thythoughts are pure. Then think. Let the thoughts thus created enter thy brother’smind and blend with his. Yet keep detached thyself, for none have the right tosway a brother’s mind. The only right there is, will make him say: “He loves. Hestandeth by. He knows. He thinks with me and I am strong to do the right.” Learnthus to speak. Learn thus to think.Rule III. Blend with thy brother’s soul and know him as he is. Only upon theplane of soul can this be done. Elsewhere the blending feeds the fuel of hislower life. Then focus on the plan. Thus will he see the part that he and youand all men play. Thus will he enter into life and know the work accomplished.A note, appended to these three rules says:“These three energies—of speech, of thought, and of purpose—when wielded withunderstanding by the chela and blended with the awakening forces of his brotherwhom he seeks to aid, are the three energies with which all adepts work.”It is almost impossible to translate these ancient formulas into adequate terms,but the above rough paraphrase will convey the idea to the illumined; theserules [321] sum up the few thoughts which the average aspirant needs to graspabout the right direction of energy, and for which he is ready.THE PRESENT AGE AND THE FUTUREThus we have seen the place that the tiny sentient unit, employed by anindividual human being, plays in relation to the Great Whole. We have noted thevarious forms which astral evolution assumes. We have also recorded some of thesources from which astral energy comes. We have found that each of us isimmersed in a sea of sentient forces which have their effect upon usbecause—under the Law—we have appropriated for our own use a portion of thatuniversal energy, through the medium of which we are en rapport with the whole.One of the types of astral energy upon which we did not touch emanates, we aretold, from the “Heart of the Sun”. I cannot, however, touch upon it at lengthowing to the inability of the human brain to understand it or the human heart toappropriate it until such time as the heart centre is opened and functioning.This stream of living energy can nevertheless be sensed in a large way, thoughnot as yet appropriated in its pure essence. We call it the “love of God”. It isindeed that free flowing, outgoing, magnetically attractive force which leadseach pilgrim home to the Father’s House. It is that force which stirs in theheart of humanity and finds expression through the medium of world avatars,through the mystical yearning found in every human being, through all movementsthat have for their objective the welfare of humanity, through philanthropic andeducational tendencies of every kind, and (in the natural world so-called)through the instinct of protective motherhood. But it is essentially a groupsentiency, and only in the coming Aquarian Age will its true nature find correctunderstanding and right appropriation. I touch on it here as it is one of [322]the factors to be considered. Only those, however, whose “hearts are opened andlifted up unto the Lord” will know whereof I speak.It is needless for us to concern ourselves with that which lies far ahead of therace. Immediate problems call for attention—problems which are personal orracial and which all concern the control of the astral vehicle. Opportunity isoffered to demonstrate in chaos the potentialities of the ego or soul, and itscapacity to control and dominate in its little sphere of influence. Therein liesfor all aspirants at this time the peculiar effort of the coming days, and Iwould—for your guidance—make certain suggestions to be followed by you or not asdeemed wise.We must remember that every aspirant is a focal point of energy and should be,in his place, a conscious focal point. In the midst of the whirl and storm heshould make his presence felt. The Law of action and re-action works here, andoften the Great Ones (foreseeing the need of just such points of inner contactin periods of world unrest, such as the present) gather into certain localitiesthose who are aspirants to service. They act as a balance and aid the generalplan, and at the same time they themselves learn much needed lessons.The effort on the part of all aspirants should not be to resist and repel thepressure or to fight and ward off. Such a method centres the attention upon thenot-self and leads to added chaos. The effort should be along the lines of anendeavour to make contact with the higher self, and keep it stable and steady,and to be in such direct alignment that the force and power of the soul may bepoured upon and through the lower threefold nature. This pouring through willbring about a steady radiation which will affect the surroundings exactly inproportion to the extent of the inner contact, and in direct relation to theclarity of the channel linking the [323] physical brain to the causal body. Theaspirant should also strive after that self-forgetfulness which merges itself inthe good of those contacted. This self-forgetfulness refers to the lower self.Self-recollectedness and self-forgetfulness should be companions.The man who aims at providing a point of contact, between conditions of chaosand Those Who work for constructive ends and order, should likewise use thatmost necessary factor of common-sense in all that he does. This involves alwaysobedience to the law of economy of force, due to discrimination, and a truesense of values. Where these are present, time will be economised, strength willbe husbanded, energy will be wisely distributed, excessive zeal will beeliminated, and the Great Ones will be able to depend upon an aspirant’ssagacity and thus find a helper.All occult training has in view the development of the aspirant so that he mayindeed be a focal point of spiritual energy. It should be remembered, however,that under the law, this training will be cyclic, and will have its ebb andflow, as all else in nature. Times of activity succeed times of pralaya, andperiods of registered contact alternate with periods of apparent silence. Notehere the choice of words. This alternation is due to the imposition of the Lawof Periodicity and if the student develops as desired, each pralayic period issucceeded by one of greater activity, and of more potent achievement. Rhythm,ebb and flow, and the measured beat of the pulsating life are ever the law ofthe universe, and in learning to respond to time vibration of the high Placesthis rhythmic periodicity must be borne in mind. The same law governs a humanbeing, a planet, a solar system—all centres or focal points of energy in somegreater Life. If such work as you are doing is to succeed (and it is largely thework of developing the ability to touch certain currents on mentallevels—currents which [324] emanate from the higher self, from your egoic group,or from the Master) definite planned conditions must be provided. Certainfactors must be present. If they do not exist, then the currents are (if I mayso express it) deflected, and contact fails of accomplishment. If occupationwith mundane affairs is necessitated—and such periods come in every lifecycle—then the attention should be concentrated on these details, and the highercontact may be then temporarily unrealised. Such attention to affairs on thephysical plane is not necessarily loss of time, for it may be as much a part ofthe plan at that particular time as any other kind of service. Full expressionand consciousness on each and every plane is the objective, remembering thateach plane with its varying states of consciousness is equally a part of thedivine Life. What is lacking as yet with the majority of aspirants is asynthetic consciousness and the capacity to hold and register continuity.If emotional or mental chaos exists, then again the currents are deflected andthe brain makes no record of that which may be inwardly seen and heard. Iffatigue is present and the physical body is in need of rest, then likewise theinner fails to be recorded. It is the centres in the etheric vehicle which arevitalised and become active in this work of contact and consequent transmissionof energy; if therefore the vitality is low and the pranic fluids are notassimilated, then the whole vibratory contact is lowered and the centre fails toregister vibration and response. When again the stimulation is adequate and theother conditions are resolved into the necessary quietude, then again thecurrents may be encountered, response follows and a fresh cycle of receptivityeventuates. I have entered thus into explanation as I have seen manyquestioning, and am anxious that the process followed may be somewhat clarified.It is wise that all who work should have a clear understanding [325] of thatwork and should—along lines so closely affecting their power to serve—be fullyaware of each step taken.As regards the problems occupying the attention of all of you who are living inthis time of world unrest and upheaval, I have a word of cheer to give you.Though, to you, the whole situation may have seemed clouded and the horizondarkened by storms, bear in mind that when the disturbance is general, as now,and the whole area involved, then the end is near. In nature, a general electricstorm serves to clear the atmosphere, and ushers in a period of sunshine andmore grateful living conditions. We have had the electrical storm of the worldwar, and the period of gradual dispersion of the clouds has been with us, withthe thunder rumbling round, and sudden sharp storms of wind and rain upsettingthe hopefulness of those desiring sunshine. Those who with patience carry on thework, who keep the inner calm and surety who lose sight of the foreground ofpersonalities, and bear only in mind the formless forces that are at workthrough all forms and seasons, will see order brought out of chaos, constructionout of past destruction and present adjustments; they will see the setting looseof fresh life forces, hitherto shut out by the crystallising shells built byman. So hold the inner vision steadily and have that long patience which enduresthrough the lesser cycle, because the key to the greater cycle has been heldwith firmness.It might be of value to touch briefly upon certain main lines of thought whichare emerging at the present time and which are the outgrowth of the past and thepromise of the future.The thoughts of men have ever been religious. There has never been a time whenreligion or the thoughts of men about God, about the infinite, and about theLife which has brought all into being has not been present. [326] Even the mostignorant of savage races have recognized a Power and have attempted to definetheir relationship to that Power in terms of fear, of sacrifice or ofpropitiation. From the rudiments of nature worship, from the fetichism anddegraded idol worship of primitive man we have built up a structure of truthwhich though as yet imperfect and inadequate, does verily lay the foundation ofthe future Temple of Truth where the light of the Lord will be seen and whichwill prove adequate as an expression of Reality.Out of the darkness of time there have emerged the great religions. Thesereligions though diverse in their theologies and forms of worship, thoughcharacterized by distinctions of organization and ceremonial, and thoughdiffering in their methods of application of truth, are united in three basicaspects:1. In their teaching as to the nature of God and of man.2. In their symbolism.3. In certain fundamental doctrines.When men recognize this and succeed in isolating that inner significantstructure of truth which is the same in all climes and in all races, then therewill emerge the universal religion, the One Church, and that unified though notuniform approach to God, which will demonstrate the truth of St. Paul’s words“One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above alland through all and in you all.” Theologies will disappear into the knowledge ofGod; doctrines and dogmas will no longer be regarded as necessary, for faithwill be based on experience, and authority will give place to personalappreciation of Reality. The power of the Church over the group will besupplanted by the power of the awakened soul in men; the age of miracles and thedisputations as to the why and how of those miracles [327] with the consequentscepticism or agnosticism will give way to the understanding of the laws ofnature which control the superhuman realm and the supernatural stage of theevolutionary process. Man will enter into his divine heritage and know himselfas the Son of the Father, with all the divine characteristics, powers andcapacities which are his because of his divine endowment. But in the meantimewhat have we? A breaking away from old established tradition, a revolt fromauthority, whether of the Church, of dogma, doctrine or theology; a tendencytowards self-determination and an overthrowing of the old standards, and of oldbarriers of thought and the divisions existing between races and faiths.Hence we are passing through an intermediate stage of chaos and of questioning,of rebellion and consequent apparent license. The methods ofscience,—investigation and analysis, comparison and deduction,—are being appliedto religious belief. The history of religions, the foundations of doctrine, theorigin of ideas and the growth of the God idea are being subjected to researchand study. This leads to much disputation; to the rejection of old establishedideas as to God, the soul, man and his destiny. Schools of thought have everexisted differing in their ideas and methods and the six Schools of IndianPhilosophy have embodied in themselves practically all the basic speculations ofman as to the why and wherefore of manifestation. Little which is new has beenadded by the occident to these six speculative schools, though the western mind,with its genius for scientific techniques and method, has elaborated the ideasand differentiated the six theories into a multiplicity of lesser propositions.Out of the medley of ideas, theories, speculations, religions, churches, cults,sects and organizations, two main lines of thought are emerging—one doomedeventually to die out, the other to strengthen and grow until it, in its turn,gives birth to that (for us) [328] ultimate formulation of truth which willsuffice for the next age and carry man to a high pinnacle of the Temple to theMount of Initiation. These two lines are:1. Those who look back to the past, who hang on to the old ways, the ancienttheologies, and the reactionary rejection methods of finding truth. These arethe people who recognize authority, whether that of a prophet, a bible or atheology. These are those who prefer obedience to imposed authority to theself-imposed guidance of an enlightened soul. These are the followers of aChurch and a government, who are distinguished by a pure devotion and love, butrefuse recognition to the divine intelligence with which they are gifted. Theirdevotion, their love of God, their strict but misguided conscience, theirintolerance mark them out as devotees, but they are blinded by their owndevotion and their growth is limited by their fanaticism. They belong mostly tothe older generation and the hope for them lies in their devotion and the factthat evolution itself will carry them forward into the second group.To this first group is committed the work of crystallization which will resultin the complete destruction of the old form; to them is given the task ofdefining the old truths so that the mind of the race will be clarified, thatnon-essentials and essentials will be recognized for what they are, andfundamental ideas so contrasted with the formulation of dogmas that that whichis basic will be seen and the secondary and unimportant beliefs thereforerejected, for only the basic and causative will be of value in the coming age.2. The second group is as yet a very small minority, but a steadily growing one.It is that inner group of lovers of God, the intellectual mystics, the knowersof reality who belong to no one religion or organization, but who regardthemselves as members of the Church universal and as “members one of another”.They are [329] gathered out of every nation, race and people; they are of everycolor and school of thought, yet they speak the same language, learn by the samesymbols, tread the same path, have rejected the same non-essentials, and haveisolated the same body of essential beliefs. They recognize each other; theyaccord equal devotion to the spiritual leaders of all races, and use eachother’s Bibles with equal freedom. They form the subjective background of thenew world; they constitute the spiritual nucleus of the coming world religion;they are the unifying principle which will eventually save the world.In the past we have had world Saviours—Sons of God who have enunciated a worldmessage and brought an increase of light to the peoples. Now, in the fullness oftime, and through the work of evolution there is emerging a group who perhapswill bring salvation to the world, and who—embodying the group ideas anddemonstrating the group nature, manifesting in a small way the true significanceof the body of Christ, and giving to the world a picture of the true nature of aspiritual organism—will so stimulate and energize the thoughts and souls of menthat the new age will be ushered in by an outpouring of the love, knowledge andharmony of God Himself.Religions in the past have been founded by a great soul, by an Avatar, by anoutstanding spiritual personality, and the stamp of their lives and words andteaching has been set upon the race and has persisted for many centuries. Whatwill be the effect of the message of a group Avatar? What will be the potency ofthe work of a group of knowers of God, enunciating truth and banded togethersubjectively in the great work of saving the world? What will be the effect ofthe mission of a group of world Saviours, not as Christs, but all knowers of Godin some degree, who supplement each other‘s efforts, reinforce each other’smessage, and constitute an organism [330] through which the spiritual energy andprinciple of spiritual life can make their presence felt in the world?Such a body now exists with its members in every land. Relatively they are fewand far between, but steadily their numbers are increasing and increasinglytheir message will be felt. In them is rested a spirit of construction; they arethe builders of the new age; to them is given the work of preserving the spiritof truth, and the reorganizing of the thoughts of men so that the racial mind iscontrolled and brought into that meditative and reflective condition which willpermit it to recognize the next unfoldment of divinity.Connected with these two groups, the reactionary doctrinaires and the subjectiveband of mystics, is the majority of the new generation of young people who arepart of neither band and whose ideas are largely disorganized by the recognitionof both. This majority do not belong to the past and refuse to accept theauthority of that past. They do not belong to the inner group of Knowers who areworking at the task of swinging the thoughts of men into right channels, forthey have not reached as yet the point of knowledge. They only recognize twothings: their need for freedom, and an intense eagerness for knowledge. Theydespise the tradition of the past; they reject the old formulations of truth;and because as yet they stand on no sure ground but are only in the position ofseekers and enquirers, we have our present state of world upheaval, of apparentlicense and disruption. It should not be forgotten that this world state istherefore the result of the clashing of the three types of force prevalent inthe world of today.1. That emanating from the holders with the old tradition, who, emphasizing theforms and the past produce the destruction of those forms.2. That emanating from the inner group of mystics, [331] who, under the guidanceof the planetary Hierarchy are building the new form.3. That emanating from the masses who belong to neither group and who arewielding force as yet blindly and often unwisely until such time comes when theyrecognize those constructive channels into which it can wisely be poured.Hence the problem of this transition period and hence the necessity for thegiving out of teaching which will enable the seeking aspirant and enquirer tofind himself. Hence the need for the laws of the soul and for the truth as toindividual unfoldment to be made clear to those who, rejecting the oldtradition, and refusing recognition to the mystic, yet seek to know themselvesas liberated souls. With that knowledge will come the steady growth of theBuilding Mystics, for when a man has found his soul and recognizes itsrelationship to its mechanism of expression, the threefold lower man, heautomatically passes into the consciousness of the subjective life, begins towork with cause and is no longer lost in the world of effects. Then he findshimself standing shoulder to shoulder with the mystics and knowers of all time.This is the trend of the religious impulse at this time and this is the glory ofthe coming age.If it is true that there is being gathered together in the background of ourpresent world-state a group of mystics who are distinguished by knowledge,vision, and a power to work on mental levels, unseen and unrecognized by men, itcould also be noted that this band is not confined to the strictly religioustypes. Men and women in every branch of human thought are found among this groupincluding scientists and philosophers.Like all else at this time, science itself is in process of transformation, andlittle as it is realized by many, their work with what they call matter, andtheir investigations of the atom are entering into a new field. In this [332]field the older techniques and mechanisms will gradually be discarded and a newapproach and a different fundamental concept as to the nature of matter willmark the new age. Within the next twenty-five years, emerging out of the twoseemingly different ideas as to the nature of the atom, a recognition of certainenergy impulses will be seen and this will be based on the discovery of thoseenergies which (playing on the atom and on atomic forms) produce the tangibleconcrete shapes to which we give names in the various kingdoms of nature. Thetruth of certain basic premises of the Ageless Wisdom will be demonstrated, suchas:1. The soul is the form-building principle, producing attraction and cohesion.2. This soul is an aspect or type of energy, distinguished from that of matteritself.3. The atom has been recognized as an energy unit, but as yet the energy whichsweeps atoms into aggregates which we call organisms and forms has not beenisolated. This the mystics in the scientific world will sense and work todemonstrate during the next generation. It is this type of energy, the energy ofthe form building aspect of manifestation which is the source of all magicalwork; and it is this energy in the various kingdoms of nature that producesform, shape, species, kind, type and the differentiations which mark anddistinguish the myriad forms through which life itself manifests. It is thequality of the energy which produces the quantity of forms; it is the lightwhich causes the emergence into consciousness of the race of heterogeneousshapes which aggregates of atoms can assume.4. This type of energy which produces the shapes and forms and coherentorganisms in all the kingdoms of nature is not the life principle. The lifeprinciple will remain undiscovered and unrecognized until such time as [333] thesoul or qualifying principle, the builder of the forms is studied, recognizedand in its turn investigated.5. This is only possible as man steps forth into a fuller conscious possessionof his divine heritage, and working as a soul and in control of his mechanism(physical, emotional, and mental) can work consciously en rapport with the soulin all forms.This will be possible only as the race grasps the above hypothesis, andrecognizes it as a possibility and seeks to demonstrate the fact of thesoul-factor lying back of its structure or body of manifestation, or equally,seeks to disprove it. All great scientists and workers in the realm of objectivenature have worked as souls, and all the most amazing of the developments in therealm of physics and chemistry, as in other departments of human knowledge, havebeen made when the worker in any particular field has launched forth with faithin some hypothesis he has formed, and has investigated and progressed his workforward stage by stage until he has contacted an aspect of the truth hithertounformulated by man. Then, having through the use of his intuition entered intoa new realm of thought, he takes the knowledge there discovered and formulatesit in such way by theory, principle, experiment and mechanical contrivance thatit becomes the possession of the group, and in due time is understood andutilized by the world. But in its genesis it has been mystical work and based ona mystical intuition.It might be noted here that three great discoveries are imminent and during thenext two generations will revolutionize modern thought and life.One is already sensed and is the subject of experiment and investigation, thereleasing of the energy of the atom. This will completely change the economicand political situation in the world, for the latter is largely dependent uponthe former. Our mechanical civilization will be simplified, and an era usheredin which will be [334] free from the incubus of money (its possession and itsnon-possession), and the human family will recognize universally its status as abridging kingdom between the three lower kingdoms of nature and the fifth orspiritual kingdom. There will be time and freedom for a soul culture which willsupersede our modern methods of education, and the significance of soul powersand the development of the superhuman consciousness will engross the attentionof educators and students everywhere.A second discovery will grow out of the present investigations as to light andcolor. The effect of color on people, animals and units in the vegetable kingdomwill be studied and the result of those studies will be the development ofetheric vision or the power to see the next grade of matter with the strictlyphysical eye. Increasingly will people think and talk in terms of light, and theeffect of the coming developments in this department of human thought will betriple.a. People will possess etheric vision.b. The vital or etheric body, lying as the inner structure of the outer forms,will be seen and noted and studied in all kingdoms of nature.c. This will break down all barriers of race and all distinctions of color; theessential brotherhood of man will be established. We shall see each other andall forms of divine manifestation as light units of varying degrees ofbrightness and shall talk and think increasingly in terms of electricity, ofvoltage, of intensity and of power. The age and status of men, in regard to theladder of evolution, will be noted and become objectively apparent, the relativecapacities of old souls, and young souls will be recognized, therebyre-establishing on earth the rule of the enlightened.Note here, that these developments will be the work of the scientists of thenext two generations and the result [335] of their efforts. Their work with theatom of substance, and their investigations in the realm of electricity, oflight and of power, must inevitably demonstrate the relation between forms,which is another term for brotherhood, and the fact of the soul, the inner lightand radiance of all forms.The third development, which will be the last probably to take place, will bemore strictly in the realm of what the occultists call magic. It will grow outof the study of sound and the effect of sound and will put into man’s hands atremendous instrument in the world of creation. Through the use of sound thescientist of the future will bring about his results; through sound, a new fieldof discovery will open up; the sound which every form in all kingdoms of naturegives forth will be studied and known and changes will be brought about and newforms developed through its medium. One hint only may I give here and that is,that the release of energy in the atom is linked to this new coming science ofsound.The significance of what has happened in the world during the last century inthe realm of sound is not appreciated yet nor understood. Terrific effects arehowever being produced by the unbelievably increased noise and sound emanatingfrom the planet at this time. The roar of machinery, the rumble of thetransportation mechanisms in all parts of the world—trains, vessels andairplanes—the focussing of the sounds of men in such congested areas as thegreat cities, and, at this time, the universal use of the radio bringing musicalsounds into every home and into street life are producing effects upon thebodies of men and upon all forms of life everywhere which will become apparentonly as time elapses. Some forms of life in the animal kingdom, but primarily inthe vegetable kingdom, will disappear and the response of the human mechanism tothis world of sound, uproar and [336] music in which it will increasingly finditself will be most interesting.These three developments will usher in the new age, will produce in thistransition period the needed changes, and will inaugurate a new era whereinbrotherhood will be the keynote, for it will be a demonstrated fact in nature.It will be an age wherein men will walk in the light, for it will be a world ofrecognized inner radiance, wherein the work of the world will be carried forwardthrough the medium of sound, and eventually through the use of words of powerand the work of the trained magician. These trained workers in substance,understanding the nature of matter, seeing always in terms of light andcomprehending the purpose of sound will bring about those structural changes andthose material transformations which will establish a civilization adequate forthe work of the coming race. This work will be that of the conscious unificationof the soul and its vehicle of manifestation. Those cultural methods also whichwill take the undeveloped of the race and carry them forward to a bettermanifestation, and a truer expression of themselves will be established and thisit is the privilege of the coming generation of scientific investigators tobring about.The outstanding characteristic, however, of the coming cycle will be anoutgrowth of psychology. It will be the emergence of a new factor from thestandpoint of the modern psychologist of the materialistic school and willinvolve the recognition of the soul.The mechanistic school of psychologists has served and is serving an invaluablepurpose, and the findings of the behaviorists are sound in fact, thougherroneous in conclusion. They serve as a needed brake upon the more speculativeand mystical school, which is dignified by the name of introspectionist. Likemuch else in the world at this time, from two great lines of thought, such [337]as the mechanistic and the introspective or subjective mentioned above, a thirdwill manifest which will embody the truth in both positions and duly adjust themto each other. On a larger scale this is working out in the fusing of occidentand orient, of mysticism and occultism. We have no quarrel with either, but inthe evolution of thought the main trends of ideas at this time are rapidlyapproaching each other and from them a synthesis will emerge which will prove anadequate platform upon which the coming cycle may make its stand.It might be of value here if we noted the tendency of three lines of thought,roughly speaking in the field of psychology.1. The mechanistic, laying the emphasis upon structure, ascribing the reactionsof the human organism, mental, emotional, and physical—entirely to the materialaspect, and regarding the structure as responsible for and giving rise to allthe lines of conduct and characteristics which man displays, both abnormal andnormal.2. The introspective school, positing a self or a conscious something which isresponsible for conditions and which, as has sometimes been said, is “aware ofawareness”. This school of psychologists recognizes the structure but goesfurther and regards certain aspects of conduct, and certain reactions andproblems as insoluble under the pure mechanistic process. They approach morenearly the occult position, but do not go so far.3. Then there are what I might call the vitalists, or that group ofpsychologists who, admitting the fact of the structure, yet regard it assubjected to the influences of energies and forces emanating from an outerenvironment. These are the energies of a wider nature than those arisingentirely within a man’s own self, and number among them the great basic urgesfor which nature itself is responsible and which can be seen and felt in unitsof organic life, other than the human.[338] The truth which is safeguarded in all these schools is one truth and eachaspect of it is correlated.There is a mechanism through which the real man functions, and there is astructure which he has built up in conformity to the laws of nature and which hecan learn to use and control. But, in accordance with the more subjective andspeculative school he must learn to differentiate between himself, as theconscious centre of awareness, the “I” upon the throne of intelligence, and theapparatus through which he can contact the outer world. When the “I”, the userof the mechanism, can do this he becomes aware of another fact and that is thatnot only is he a generator and user of energy, and the director of a quota ofvitality which is his own, but that there are energies and forces in nature andthe planet, and also extra-planetary or cosmic, to which he can also respond andwhich he can learn to use and adapt. The three present schools are therefore, inembryo, custodians of these three factors. Under the present system of quarreland separation, these three schools are occupied largely with disproving eachother’s theories. But they are all three of them correct in their facts thoughwrong in their deductions. They all three need each other and from a blending ofthe three presentations there will emerge the fourth, which will be nearer thetruth than any of the separated three.When we come to the consideration of other basic trends in the world of currentthought it becomes apparent that one of the most dominant is the increasingemphasis laid upon group consciousness, or environal awareness. This has beenrecognized by the man in the street as a sense of responsibility and indicatesin the individual an egoic vibration. It is one of the first signs that the soulis beginning to use its mechanism. No longer does the man live in the interestsof the separated self but he begins to realize the need for adjustment to [339]and in the condition of his neighbor. He assumes the duty of being in a veryreal sense his brother’s keeper, and realizes that in reality progress,contentment, peace of mind and prosperity do not exist for him apart from thatof his brother. This realization is steadily expanding from the individual tothe state and nation, from the family unit to the world, and hence the bigorganizations, fraternities, clubs, leagues and movements which have for theirobjective the uplift and welfare of men everywhere. The necessity of givinginstead of getting is growing in the racial consciousness and the recognition ofcertain of the basic concepts connected with brotherhood is steadily growing.Brotherhood as a fact in nature is as yet largely a theory, but brotherhood asan ideal is now fashioned in the racial consciousness.One of the great schools of thought or trend of ideas which is destined to passaway is that of the current philosophies as we now know them. Philosophy in itstechnical sense as the love of wisdom will increase as men understandincreasingly the meaning of wisdom and become epochally wiser, but the presentschools of philosophy have nearly served their purpose. This has been theformulation of ideas concerning God and His relation to man, concerningdivinity, eschatology and spiritual relationships.The last great gestures of the philosophical schools remain yet to be made.Their place will be taken in later centuries by those who will in deed and intruth be cosmologists, for once the Word of Mankind is understood and graspedand the significance of the individual appreciated, the Word of the Cosmos willreceive due and more correct attention, and the laws and nature of that greatBeing in Whom we live and move and have our being will be studied. The cosmicChrist can never be known by any except the individual Christ.Man, as we shall see as we proceed, is on the verge of [340] establishing hisdivinity. Evolution has carried forward the perfecting of the mechanism to suchan extent that it is now a coordinated integrated organism, a usable structureand ready for the divine user. In the course of the next few decades the fact ofthe soul will be established, and the work of the introspective thinkers, themystics and occult students will be carried forward to the point where soulforce will be established as a racial concept, and the laws of the soul will berecognized as superseding, though not abrogating (for the lesser is everincluded in the greater) the laws of man. This in the sense that the law is everkept by a manifesting soul, for, since there is no inclination to break it,there is no tendency on his part to infringe it.This growing conviction as to the soul as the self is evidenced by theopposition to the theory called forth by the schools of thought which emphasizethe dominance of matter and trace all phenomena, objective and subjective, tothe activity of matter. Through the wrestling of those holding differing pointsof view truth emerges into the light, just as in a larger case, spirit “mountson the shoulders of matter” back to its original position, plus the gain inquality which is the result of the experience. This being so, knowledge willtake the place of theory, and direct evidence that of speculation. Thetheorising of men as to their divine nature must shortly give place toconviction and their philosophising to direct investigation of the soul. Thatwhich is recognized and admitted, even if not understood, is the object ofattention and investigation and the day will dawn before so very long when anexperimental science of the soul will have its place in the universities andpublic endowments and not the proving of the soul, but an analysis of itsnature, purposes, and life will receive an attention equal to that now gives bymodern scientists in their varying branches to the mechanism the soul seeks andeventually will use, [341] for naught can arrest that great evolutionarydevelopment.Certain words of warning I would like to give and also a summarisation of muchearlier said:First, hold not on to the form no matter what it be. All forms are butexperiments, and reach the point where they are in balance—to be eitherdiscarded or vivified.Secondly, remember that all personalities (your own included) have their periodsof ebb and flow, under the law. The periods of ebb in the case of those holdingprominent position cause at times consternation to all those who follow theirpersonalities, and not the inner God within their own heart.Thirdly, bear in mind, also, that just as in the individual life there come theperiods wherein the vision is obscured, the valley is traversed, and the starsshut out by the fog, so in connection with groups will the same be seen. Butbear equally in mind that after the valley is crossed (for all aspirants and forall truly spiritual groups) the Mount of Initiation is seen and ascended; afterobscuration succeeds the vision, and after night comes the day. In the greatcycles affecting cosmic groups this also can be seen; in the lesser cycles,controlling the races, the same eventuates and the same law persists in all thelesser groups down to the groups of tiny lives that hold sway in the vehicles ofman. This needs emphasis.Fourthly, do not permit yourselves to be discouraged. Discouragement is due tothree causes. Paramountly it is due to the lowering of the vitality of thebodily organism. When such is the case, the astral body makes too strong ademand upon the physical, and in the endeavour to respond and in the sensedincapacity to do so adequately, lies one cause of the sense of discouragement.This often attacks those of you who are finely organised in the physicalvehicle. The cure for this type of discouragement [342] is obvious, is it not?Rest and relaxation build anew, and give time for nature to adjust the trouble.The sun too revitalises with prana and this should be considered. After all,sound common sense is the special requirement, and also the realisation thatone’s work is adjusted to one’s capacity, and not to the overwhelming need.Meditate on this.Another basis for discouragement is the over-development of the concrete mind,which in its turn makes too great a demand upon the emotional nature, andconsequently again upon the physical. Too great a capacity to see all around asubject, too disproportionate a comprehension of the world’s need, and too quickan apprehension of the many issues involved in connection with some particularmatter produce a violent vibration in the astral body. This leads to ashattering of the physical vehicle, and the result sensed we termdiscouragement. It is here that a sense of proportion must be cultivated, thatthe faculty of wise balancing enters, and that mental equilibrium must beachieved. The cure lies in the realisation that time, eternity, evolution (callit what you will) brings all things to pass, and that everything does not dependupon individual effort. It is possible for wise souls to hasten the good work,but the end, nevertheless, is sure. If the wise souls are not forthcoming yetthe force of evolution brings all things to pass, even if more slowly. Do notforget this, but when discouragement from mental sources settles down upon you,in quietness adjust yourself, and in contemplation sense the ultimateachievement of that great factor, Time.A third cause lies in more occult realms, and is due to the balancing of thepairs of opposites. When the pendulum swings—as it must and does—towards thatwhich we call dark, evil, and undesirable, it produces in those of you who areoriented towards the light a tension which results in discomfort in all thebodies, and is specially [343] sensed as depression by the physical body. Themore sensitive your body, the greater your responsiveness to this form oftemptation. It is one of the things which specially hinders the aspirant. Itrenders him negative and receptive from the form side, and slows down hisvibration. It prevents achievement and his service to the world suffers inconsequence. The cure for discouragement does not lie in cultivating a violentcounter vibration. It lies in the wise use of the mental body, and in a capacityto reason logically and to see the cause of the conditions, which lies either inyour own personality or in your environment. Thus poise will he attained. Itlies also in the appreciation of Time as a solvent as aforesaid. It lies also inthe stilling of the concrete mind and a subsequent linking up with the soul and,via the soul, with the egoic group and consequently with the Master. It mustnever be forgotten that contact with the Master is made in this order, and thathe who comes more and more under the guidance of the soul is he who more andmore enters into the consciousness of his Master.Then having with unselfish intent linked up with the Master, there comes nextthe deliberate and concentrated effort to work with pure dispassion, and with nodesire to see the fruit of action. This process, long continued and pursued withpatience, will result eventually in the attaining of an equilibrium whichnothing can disturb.I would like to state that there are five things which those who choose the pathof occultism need to cultivate, and that the group should specially seek toattain. They are as follows:1. Consecration of motive.2. Utter fearlessness.3. The cultivation of the imagination, balanced wisely by the reasoning faculty.[344]4. A capacity to weigh the evidence wisely, and to accept only that which iscompatible with the highest instinct and intuition.5. A willingness to experiment.These five tendencies, coupled with purity of life and regulation of thoughtwill lead to the sphere of achievement. Remember too that it is not purposedthat you should find out all the knowable, but only just as much of it as may beemployed wisely for the illumination of the race and of those whom you can each,in your own place, influence.A real problem, as you all realise, lies in the achieving of utter fearlessness.All fear, doubt, and worry have to be eliminated. If this can be done thedevelopment of the inner point of contact and the knowledge of how to tap thesources of inspiration will increase in a wonderful manner. So many close thesources of information through an uncontrolled emotional nature. The astral bodycan be controlled. How?1. By direct inhibition. This method can be used to advantage by beginners, butit is not the best method to follow. It reacts on the physical body, leads tocongestion in the astral body, and to a similar condition in the ethericvehicle. It often produces headache, congestion of the liver and otherdisorders.2. By a direct realisation of the issues at stake and the consciousness that,for a pupil of the Master, nothing comes to pass but what can lead to increasedknowledge and development, and greater usefulness in service. Fear with many isnot based on timidity (a paradoxical statement!) but is often based on a mentalcondition, such as pride. Those who are becoming polarised in the mental body,find their fears allied to the intellect. They are therefore harder to overcomethan the fears of a person polarised in the astral body. The latter can bringthe [345] intellect to bear on the elimination of fear in the astral body. Themental types have to call directly on the Ego, for always the higher must becalled in to deal with the lower. Hence the necessity for always keeping thechannel clear. Do not crush out fear. Force it out by the dynamic power ofsubstitution. This leads to my third suggestion that students in the groupshould cure the fear habit by—3. A direct method of relaxation, concentration, stillness and flushing theentire personality with pure white light. Proceed in the following manner:You are, we will say, in a state of panic; suggestions of great unpleasantnessare crowding in; your imagination is running riot, and your mind enforces theriot. Forget not that the fears of an emotional person are not so potent asyours. Having a strong mental body, you clothe your fear reactions with mentalmatter, highly vitalised, which causes a powerful thoughtform to be created.This circulates between you and the feared event. Realising this you willproceed to seek quietness. You will relax your physical body, endeavour to quietyour astral body as far as may be, and to steady the mind. Then visualizingyourself (the personality), the soul and the Master—He, as the apex of thetriangle,—you will with deliberation call down a stream of pure white light,and, pouring it through your lower vehicles, you will cleanse away all thathinders. Continue this process until you realise that the needed work isaccomplished. At first you may have to do it many times. Later just once willsuffice, and later still the whole process may be needless, for you will haveachieved conquest.This applies to the fears connected with the personality. You use the loveaspect, flooding yourself with love and light. The legitimate fears which arise[346] from things connected with the circumstances of the work to be done, andfrom the knowledge of materialised obstructions to the work must be treatedsomewhat differently. Here again a definite method must be followed:Still the physical body.Quiet by temporary inhibition the astral body.Link up with the Ego, and definitely reason out the proper method of procedurein meeting the difficulty. Having exhausted all the higher rational methods andhaving clearly seen your course of action, you then—Raise your vibration as high as may be and call down, from intuitional levels,added light on the difficulty. If your intuition and reasoning faculty produceharmony and thus show the way out, then proceed. As an occult fact past allcontroversy, you know that naught can now happen but what is for the best. Youare sure of guidance, and he who sees thus the end from the beginning makes noerror.A third class of fears—which aspirants contact more and more as they grow instrength and usefulness in service—is based on the realisation of the forcesthat are working against the Plan and hindering the work to be done. Occultattacks and occult powers, warring militantly against the aspirant will occur;they may make their power felt in one or other of the vehicles and—in rarecases—where the aspirant is important enough, on all at once. Sometimes theywill be attacks directed against the individual worker, sometimes against groupsof workers. To counter them you employ the first method with the followingadditions and changes. You link yourself up either as an individual or formingone of a group with your own soul and with the Lodge of Masters, [347] notsimply with your own Master, but with the Brotherhood for which you are working.Then when stillness has been achieved, you visualise those Masters of whom youknow, and raising your vibration higher still, you connect up, if possible, withthe Chohans, with the Christ and the Manu, according to the line, religious orpolitical, with which you may be working, and along which the attack will come.You then pour through the linking chain, and through all the vehicles, a streamof violet light. This method is only for use when the need is dire and thenecessity great. The reason for caution lies in the etheric vehicle, whichresponds most violently to the colour violet.With these precautions in mind the fear vibration can be faced and eventuallyeliminated. Fears fall into two categories for the worker:—Fear of what thefuture holds, and, secondly, doubt as to the outcome of any effort. With mostpeople it is a combination of the two. Most aspirants have no basic doubt as tothe ultimate issue, but they do doubt at times the working out of those issuesin the present time, and they shrink back also from the path of endeavour,knowing—and rightly knowing—that it leads through trial and loneliness to theFeet of the Hierophant. They are likewise distressed by troubles and highvibrations which seem to emanate from high spiritual sources. Strong vibrationswill come with ever increasing frequency, and as the race progresses inevolution the vibrations will wax stronger and their reactions must be dealtwith in wisdom.Two things manifest when the spiritual vibration is exceedingly potent. All goodaspirations and synchronous high vibrations are stimulated and, secondly, allthat we term “evil” is likewise stimulated. Aspirants should bear this carefullyin mind. There may demonstrate such a factor as a crime wave, but there willalso demonstrate an increasing number of groups that stand for [348] spiritualendeavor and high aspiration. The effect of the heightening of the vibration onyou, the aspirant, may manifest in various ways also. It may result in bodilyfatigue and this must be dealt with—not so much by sleep and by rest, though ajust proportion of them is necessary—but above all by a change of vibration, ofrecreation and of amusement. Secondly, it results frequently in a profounddepression, in an utter sinking of the heart as the future is faced. Face thatfuture, however, and remember that what the future holds is not revealed, butthat “joy cometh in the morning”. It results also in a sensitiveness of theastral body that is, perhaps, even more hard to bear. This must be dealt with bythe individual as best he may, bearing in mind the suggestions that I have givenhim. It results also in a permanent stimulation of the atoms in the variousvehicles and their coherent, stabilized vibration. It lifts a little nearer tothe goal, though perhaps the aspirant may not realize it.Everything depends upon the pupil’s ability to grasp the inner meaning of allevents. His entire progress upon the Path rests upon his attitude in making theteaching his own. It is only as we transmute the lessons on the inner planesinto practical knowledge that they become part of our own experience and are nolonger theoretical. Expansion of consciousness should be an ever increasingpractical experience. Theories are of no value until we have changed them intofact. Hence the value of meditating on an ideal. In the meditation our thoughtsvibrate temporarily to the measure of the conception, and in time that vibrationbecomes permanent.Those who, with open eyes, enter on occult training need indeed to count thecost. The reward at the end is great, but the path is rough and the trueoccultist walks it alone. The capacity to stand alone, to assume responsibility,[349] and then to carry all through single-handed, and to brave evil for thesake of the good achieved is the mark of a White Brother. Be prepared then forloneliness, for dangers of a dim and obscure character, and expect to see yourlife spent for no reward that touches the personality. It is only as theconsciousness expands, and one finds one’s true position in the cosmic wholethat the reward becomes apparent; but cease from fear, and know that thepersonality is only temporary, and what matter if it suffer? Some good gainedfor the universal Brotherhood, some law explained and demonstrated in the lifeof every day, may make the Master say eventually (yes, eventually, after all isover) well done! Let your eyes therefore look straight on. Turn not to the righthand nor to the left. The path leads upward and on to greater rapidity ofvibration and to greater sensitiveness. Seek the point of balance in your workand keep that balance, for the years hold much work, much pressure and muchsuffering.Are you strong enough to see the world’s woe, to see disaster and yet keepjoyful? Can you be a partner in the work of furthering the evolution of the raceand see the necessity for trouble and for discipline and yet not move to stemthe tide of sorrow? Picked and tried souls are being trained all over the worldat the present time. The Masters are overwhelmed with the work and Their time isover-occupied. They give what They can but on the individual aspirant dependsthe use made of that which is given.Those of us who watch and guide on the inner side of life realize more thanperhaps you who bear the burden and heat of physical plane existence know. Weknow your physical disabilities and some day may be able to help definitely inthe building up of strong bodies for world service. Now—such is the astralmiasma—it is well nigh impossible for you, our struggling brethren, [350] tohave good health; the karma of the world prohibits it. The astral corruption andthe foul cesspools of the lower levels of the mental plane infect all, and luckyis he who escapes. We watch with tenderness all of you, who, with weak andsensitive bodies, struggle, work, fight, fail, continue and serve. Not one hourof service, given in pain and tension, not one day’s labor followed with rackednerves, with head tired and with heart sick, is allowed to pass unnoticed. Weknow and we care, yet, we may do naught that you, struggling in the field of theworld, can do of that which is needed. The world’s karma engulfs each of you atthis epoch. If you could but realize it, the time is short, and rest, joy andpeace are on their way.The half-gained victory, the days lived through with a certain measure ofsuccess, yet with an unachieved ideal, the minutes of exhaustion of soul andbody when the emptiness of everything, even of service itself, seems the onlynoticeable thing, the weeks and months of endeavor and of struggle againstapparently insuperable odds, against the stupendous power of the forces ofevolution, against the roaring tide of the world’s ignorance,—all are known.Take comfort in the assurance that love rules all; take courage from therealization that the Hierarchy stands.Those who are to teach the world more about the Masters and who are beingtrained to be focal points of contact are put through a very drasticdisciplining. They are tested in every possible way and taught much throughbitter experience. They are taught to attach no importance to recognition. Theyare trained not to judge from the appearance but from the inner vision. Capacityto recognize the Master’s purpose and the ability to love are counted ofparamount importance. Aspirants who seek to be chosen for work as disciples mustlose all desire for the things of self and must be willing at any [351] cost topay the price of knowledge. If proof is to be given to the world of thesubjective realm of reality it will be bought with the heart’s blood, for only“in the blood of the heart” can power be safely gained and wisely wielded. Asyou go on and, as aspirants, study the hidden laws of nature, you will realizethe need for the price paid. The spiritual unfoldment of the disciple’scharacter must keep pace with his inner knowledge. This knowledge grows in threeways:1. By definite expansions of consciousness, which open up to the disciple arealization of the points to be attained. This produces in his mind aformulation of what lies ahead to be grasped and is the first step towardsacquirement. An aspirant is definitely taken on the inner planes and shown by amore advanced chela what is the work to be done, much in the same way as a pupilis shown by his master the lesson to be learned.2. The next step is the mastering of the lesson and the working out inmeditation and experiment of the truths sensed. This is a lengthy process, forall has to be assimilated and made part and parcel of the disciple’s very selfbefore he can go on. It resembles the working out of a sum—figure by figure,line by line, the working out being carried forward until the answer isachieved. This work is done both on the inner planes and on the physical. In theHall of Learning the pupil is taught nightly for a short time before proceedingwith any work of service. This teaching he brings over into his physical brainconsciousness in the form of a deep interest in certain subjects, and in anincreasing aptitude to think concretely and abstractly on the various occultmatters that are occupying his attention. He attempts to experiment and triesvarious methods of studying the laws and in process of time arrives at resultsthat are of value to him. Time passes and as he appropriates and knows more, hisknowledge takes a synthetic form and he becomes [352] ready to teach and toimpart to others the residue of knowledge of which he is sure.3. In teaching others comes further knowledge. The definition of truth inteaching crystallises the facts learnt, and, in the play of other minds, theaspirant’s own vibration becomes keyed up to ever higher planes, and thus freshintuition and fresh reaches of truth pour in.When one lesson has, in this way, been mastered, a further one is set, and whena pupil has learnt a particular series of lessons he graduates and passes aninitiation. The whole group he teaches is benefited by his step forward, forevery disciple carries those he instructs along with him in a curiousindefinable sense. The benefit to the unit reacts upon the whole. A Mastercarries His disciples on and up with Him in a similar manner. The matter isabstruse and largely one of the secrets of the law of vibratory expansion. Theinitiation of the Logos has a universal effect.You are right in your assumption that the probationary path corresponds to thelater stages of the period of gestation. At the first initiation what is calledin the New Testament “the babe in Christ” starts upon the pilgrimage of thepath. The first initiation simply stands for commencement. A certain structureof right living, of thinking and of conduct has been attained; the form that theChrist is to occupy has been constructed and now that form is to be vivified andindwelt. The Christ life enters and the form becomes alive. Therein lies thedifference between theory and making that theory a part of yourself. You canhave a perfect picture or image but it lacks the life. You have a person who hasmodelled his life on the divine as far as he can. He has a good copy yetsomething is lacking. What is this something? The manifestation of theindwelling Christ. The germ has been there but it has lain dormant. Now it isfostered and brought to birth, and the first initiation is [353] attained. Muchthen remains to be done. The analogy is complete. Many years were spent by thedisciple Jesus between the birth and baptism. The remaining three initiationswere taken in three years. You have the same situation on the path of theaspirant.The second initiation marks the crisis of the control of the astral body. Afterbaptism there remain the three temptations, demonstrating the complete controlof the three lower vehicles. Then comes the Transfiguration, followed byknowledge of the future and complete self-abnegation. Therefore, you have thefollowing:1. The moment of conception—i.e. individualization.2. Nine months gestation—i.e. the wheel of life.3. First initiation—i.e. the birth hour.The path is, therefore, a path on which steady expansion of consciousness isundergone with increasing sensitivity to the higher vibrations. This works outat first as sensitiveness to the inner voice and this is one of the mostnecessary faculties in a disciple. The Great Ones are looking for those who canrapidly obey the inner voice of their soul. The times are critical and allaspirants are urged also to render themselves sensitive to the voice of theirMaster as well. His time is fully occupied and disciples must train themselvesto be sensitive to His impression. A slight hint, a pointed finger, a hurriedsuggestion, may be all that He has time to give, and each disciple must be uponthe watch. The pressure upon Them is great now that They are moving closer tothe physical plane. More souls are conscious of Them than when They worked onmental levels only and They also, working on denser planes, are findingconditions more difficult. The devas and disciples, aspirants and those upon theprobationary path are being gathered around Them now and are being organizedinto groups with special work assigned. Some souls can work only in mass [354]formation, banded together and unified by a common aspiration. Such are themajority of Christians, for instance, in the churches. These, knowing not thelaws of occultism, and only sensing the inner truth, work on broad lines ofpreparation. They are aided by bands of lesser devas or angels who suggest,guide and control.Others more advanced work in smaller groups. They idealize more and in them yousee the thinkers and leaders of social reform, of humanitarian regeneration andof church leadership, either Christian or Oriental. The higher devas guide them,the blue and yellow devas, as the former group are guided by the blue and rose.Back of them stand the still more advanced—the aspirants, probationers anddisciples of the world. They work singly or in twos or threes and never ingroups exceeding nine—the occult significance of these numbers being necessaryto the success of their work. Great white and gold devas attend their labours.Back again of these three groups stand the Masters and the devas of the formlesslevels—a Great Brotherhood, pledged to serve humanity.Movements are being set on foot to transmute, if possible, the labours ofdestruction into constructive work. The time is critical, for a pause has comein the work of the destroyers. There is opportunity for the tide to turn and forthe re-building of the body social.It is for this reason that each one of you needs to make a fresh dedication ofhimself to the work of the redemption. Personalities must be submerged.Aspirants must live harmlessly in thought and word and deed. In this way eachone of you will provide a pure channel, will become an outpost for theconsciousness of the Master and provide a centre of energy through which theBrotherhood can work.The prime problem of the aspirant is to dominate the emotional nature. Then hestands victor on the field of [355] Kurukshetra; the clouds have rolled away,and henceforth he can walk in the light. Let it here be remembered that thisvery freedom to walk in the light carries with it its own problems. You ask howthis can be? Let me give one simple, yet (I think you will find) convincingargument.When a man literally walks in the light of his soul and the clear light of thesun pours through him—revealing the Path,—it reveals at the same time the Plan.Simultaneously however, he becomes aware of the fact that the Plan is very faras yet from consummation. The dark becomes more truly apparent; the chaos andmisery and failure of the world groups stand revealed; the filth and dust of thewarring forces are noted, and the whole sorrow of the world bears down upon theastounded, yet illuminated, aspirant. Can he stand this pressure? Can he becomeindeed acquainted with grief and yet rejoice forever in the divineconsciousness? Has he the ability to face what the light reveals and still gohis way with serenity, sure of the ultimate triumph of good? Will he beoverwhelmed by the surface evil and forget the heart of Love which beats behindall outer seeming? This situation should ever be remembered by the disciple, orhe will be shattered by that which he has discovered.But with the advent of the light, he becomes aware of a new (for him) form ofenergy. He learns to work in a new field of opportunity. The realm of the mindopens up before him, and he discovers that he can differentiate between theemotional nature and the mental. He discovers also that the mind can be made toassume the position of the controller, and that the sentient forces respond withobedience to mental energies. “The light of reason” brings this about—light thatis always present in man but which only becomes significant and potent when seenand known, either phenomenally or intuitionally.[356] Much false teaching is going about these days in connection with the mindand the soul. It might be summed up in the teaching of one school which shall benameless, as follows:Nature is cruel and selective. She works by the Law of the survival of thefittest; in the process of selection, millions of lives are sacrificed and muchbirthing of forms comes to naught. Hence the achieving of soul life is a rareevent. Few people have souls and only a few therefore possess immortality and gohence to their own place of power to return no more. The rest are lost,submerged and swallowed up in the general process of nature, and the humankingdom as a whole is a dead loss except for a few emerging and significantfigures which the past and the present produce. They have achieved through thesacrifice of the many.But the reaction of men themselves to this teaching is an adequate answer. Thesense of immortality, the surety of an eternal future, the innate belief in God,the revelation of the light, the achieving of a wisdom which helps and aids isnot the prerogative of the Senecas, of the St. Pauls, of the Akbars of the race.It is found (and sometimes in its purest form) in the humblest peasant. Words ofwise counsel fall from the lips of the illiterate, and a knowledge of God and abelief in the soul’s immortality are discovered to be latent in the hearts ofthe most unlikely and oft of the most sinful. But when the highly evolved andthe most intelligent of the race discover in themselves the divine Flame, andawaken the power of the supreme Controller, seated at the heart of their being,they are very apt to place themselves in a higher category than other people,and to classify those who do not have their mental grasp of the differentiationsof the evolutionary development as differing so widely from them as not todeserve the name of Sons of God. They regard all not working in mental energy aslacking souls [357] and hence as lacking eternal persistence as individuals.This is only a glamour of the mind, is part of the great heresy of separateness,and indicates faintly the coming period wherein the mind will be as dominant andas misleading as is the sentient body at this time.Let us therefore study the types of mental energy with which the individual hasto work and see how this great heresy of separateness and the “fallacy ofrepudiation”, as it is sometimes called, can be offset.One of the first things we have to remember as we consider these types of energyis that their trend and work can be grasped more easily in a larger sense inrelation to humanity than can their effects in an individual use of mentalenergy. Only a few human beings are as yet consciously using this type of forceand only a few can therefore understand what it really entails. Increasingly menwill come, as units, into possession of their intellectual heritage but,numerically speaking, scarce one in ten thousand is utilising this inherentpower and knowingly functioning in his mental body.When however we look at humanity as a whole and cast our eyes back over the pastracial development, we can see how mental energy has had a most definite effectand has produced outstanding results. The use of two factors differentiates manfrom the animal, whether he uses them consciously or unconsciously. Both arelatent in the animal but man is the only entity in the three worlds who canconsciously reap benefit from them. One of these factors is pain , and the otheris the faculty of discrimination. Through the means of pain and a subsequentprocess of analysis, of relation plus memory and visualisation, man has learntwhat to avoid and what to cultivate. This works in the realm of physical planehappenings and of sensory experience. Through discrimination as to ideas and asto thought currents, man has learnt to decide upon what to base his activitiesin all departments [358] of human affairs, even though he has but an imperfectgrasp as to the true nature of ideas and his application of the truths sensed isquite imperfect. That he often chooses unwisely, that the ideas governing groupconduct are not of the highest, that public opinion is proverbially moulded bypersonal and selfish interests may be only too sadly true. Nevertheless—throughpain and learning to utilise the power of choice in the realm of ideas—man issteadily forging ahead towards full liberty and full control of the earth, whichit is his right to inherit. The Old Commentary says in relation to these twocharacteristics of man something that conveys much of beauty, couched insymbolic language. The phrases run as follows and it must be borne in mindwhilst pondering upon them that water symbolises sentiency or astral reaction,and fire is the symbol of the mentality.“The assuaging waters cool. They slowly bring relief, abstracting form from allthat can be touched. The quivering fever heat of long repressed desire yields tothe cooling draught. Water and pain negate each other. Long is the process ofthe cooling draught.“The burning fire releases all that blocks the way of life. Bliss comes andfollows after fire, as fire upon the waters. Water and fire together blend andcause the great Illusion. Fog they produce and mist and steam and noise, veilingthe Light, hiding the Truth and shutting out the Sun.“The fire burns fiercely. Pain and the waters disappear. Cold, heat, the lightof day, the radiance of the rising sun and perfect knowledge of the Truthappear.“This is the path for all who seek the light. First form, and all its longing.Then pain. Then the assuaging waters and the appearance of a little fire. Thefire grows, and heat is then active within the tiny sphere and does its fierywork. Moisture likewise is seen; dense fog, and to the pain is added sadbewilderment, for they who use the fire of mind during the early stage are lostwithin a light illusory.“Fierce grows the heat; next comes the loss of power to suffer. When this stagehas been outgrown, there comes [359] the shining of the unobstructed sun and theclear bright light of truth. This is the path back to the hidden Centre.“Use pain. Call for the fire, oh, pilgrim in a strange and foreign land. Thewaters wash away the mud and slime of nature’s growth. The fires burn thehindering forms which seek to hold the pilgrim back and so they bring release.The living waters, as a river, sweep the pilgrim to the Father’s Heart. Thefires destroy the veil hiding the Father’s Face.”Perhaps one of the first things that every student has to learn, as he seeks tograsp the nature and use of mind, is that public opinion has to give place toindividual consciousness of right, and that then that individual consciousnesshas to be so employed and concentrated that it is seen in its right proportionas that living germ which can expand into the divine flower of the Son of Mind,the Manasaputra, and as the thread which leads back into the realm of theUniversal Mind. This thread and this consciousness, when followed, will lead theindividual into the Council Chamber wherein the plan and the purpose of thegreat Life will stand revealed, and wherein all human selfishness andself-seeking fade out in the clear light of the Will of God. Through rightunderstanding and right use and control of the astral nature and a comprehensionof the nature of the sentient consciousness, man can penetrate into the veryheart of God Himself and know past all controversy that all is well, for all isLove. Through right use of the mind, and through correct understanding of thenature of the intellect, man can enter into the mind of God and know that all iswell, for all is planned, and divine purpose is steadily working out itsobjectives.The work of the Atlantean Adepts was to impress upon the world consciousness thefact that God is Love. This is a symbolic expression of the truth as is the useof the word God. The work of the Aryan Adepts is to impress upon the worldconsciousness that God is Will. To do [360] this for the human family, They workwith the intellect so as to bring it into control, to subordinate other forms tothe mind and through the mind to reveal to man the vision of what is and whatwill be. Man is therefore brought into line with the esoteric head centre of theone Life. In the animal kingdom, through the development of sentiency and itsallied unfoldment through pain, They are bringing those types of forms into linewith the heart centre in Nature. This is a phrase conveying a truth which cannotbe more clearly expressed until man has become more inclusive in hisconsciousness. Through colour in the vegetable Kingdom those forms of divinemanifestation are also brought into vibratory contact with that centre of forcein Nature which is analogous to the throat centre in man.In using these words I refer primarily to the Life which is expressing itselfthrough our planet, to our planetary Logos, but the idea can (needless to say)be progressed to include the great Life of which our planetary Logos is but areflection and an expression. Man, the brain of nature; the animals, theexpression of the heart; the vegetable world, the expression of the creativeforce or of the throat centre; these three kingdoms in nature forming, in apeculiar manner, correspondences to the three higher centres in man, as thethree kingdoms on the involutionary arc correspond to the three lower centres,and the mineral kingdom—abstruse as the idea may seem to those of you who havenot the consciousness of the life-aspect—corresponding to the solar plexus, thegreat clearing house between that which is above and that which is below.These analogies change as time progresses. In Lemurian days, viewing it as akingdom in nature, humanity expressed the solar plexus aspect, whilst the animalkingdom stood for the sacral centre, and the centre at the base of the spine wassymbolised by the vegetable [361] kingdom. In the middle of the Atlanteanperiod, when certain great changes and experiments were wrought, a shift in theentire process took place; certain egos came in, as you know, as related in theSecret Doctrine and in a Treatise on Cosmic Fire , and a tremendous steppingforward became possible through their efforts. The chitta or mind-stuff becamemore vibrant and now we have the period of its intensest activity in theconcrete sense.We are told in the esoteric teaching that all three aspects of Divinity arethemselves triple, and hence we can divide the energy of mind as far as humanityis concerned into three aspects also. We have therefore:1. The lower concrete mind, called the chitta or mind-stuff in the Yoga Sutrasof Patanjali.2. The abstract mind, or that aspect of the mind which is related to the worldof ideas.3. The intuition or pure reason which is for man the highest aspect of thementality.These three find their overshadowing or enveloping field of expression in thethird aspect of the Logos, which we call the Universal Mind, the activeintelligent Deity. The lines of force from these three lower aspects lead back(if one may use so inadequate an expression) on to the third plane, as theastral lines of force lead back to the second or monadic plane, though as far asman’s consciousness is concerned they only lead back to the buddhic orintuitional plane.It is interesting to note that just as the Monad, impelled by desire, producesthat form of life which we call the personality, so the mind aspect, as part ofthe purpose working out through the Universal Mind, in its form produces thatmanifestation which we call a Manasaputra, the great Son of Mind on the mentalplane. Hence it is the mind principle in humanity which brings into [362]manifestation the egoic body, the causal vehicle, the karana sarira, thetwelve-petalled lotus. We are of course talking entirely in terms of the formaspect here. The reason for this lies back on the cosmic planes, whereon theplanetary Logos has His life. From the cosmic astral plane comes the impulsewhich produces form existence and concrete expression—for all form-taking is theresult of desire. From the cosmic mental plane comes the will-to-be in time andspace, which produces the seven groups of egoic lives and the third outpouring.It will be seen then inferentially, how the right use of energy by the initiateputs him en rapport not only with the higher planes of the solar system but alsowith those cosmic planes whereon our Logos has His Personality aspect, usingthese words in symbolic fashion. The right use of physical energy by theinitiate gives him the 'freedom' of the cosmic physical plane. The right use ofastral energy gives him power on the cosmic astral, and the correct use ofmental energy gives him entrance on to the cosmic mental. Inferentially then,the three higher centres in man when functioning perfectly play their part inthis work of carrying energies from these exalted spheres into the field ofactivity of the initiate and of being doorways into realms hitherto closed tohim.Each centre or chakra is composed of three concentric interblending whorls orwheels which in the spiritual man upon the probationary path move slowly in onedirection, but gradually quicken their activity as he nears the portal of thePath of Initiation. On initiation, the centre of the chakra (a point of latentfire) is touched, and the rotation becomes intensified, and the activity, fourthdimensional. It is difficult to express these ideas in words that can becomprehended by the uninitiated, but the effect could be described as a changingfrom a measured turn to one of a scintillating radiation, a ‘wheel [363] turningupon itself’, as the ancient Scriptures express it. Hence, when by purification,conformity to rule, and an aspiration that brooks no hindrance and that ceasesnot for pain, the aspirant has caused his centres to pulsate and to rotate,then—and only then—can the Master lead him into the Presence of the Hierophant.The Initiator then, with full knowledge of the disciple’s ray and of hissub-ray, both egoic and personal, and recognising any karma that still maycling, touches the centre or centres which are in line for vivification, and thehidden fire will then rush up and become focalised. Remember always that in thevivification of a centre there is always a corresponding vitalisation of theanalogous head centre, till eventually the seven centres in the body and theseven centres in the head rotate in unison. Remember also that just as the fourminor rays pass into the three major rays, so the four minor centres carry onthe correspondence and pass into pralaya, finding their focal point in thethroat centre. Thus you will have the three centres—head, heart andthroat—carrying the inner fire, with the three major head centres vibrating inunison also.I realise that this is all intricate and technical. It has its place and valuehowever, and much that here is communicated will find its usefulness when youare all passed over to the other side and a fresh band of aspirants will followin your footsteps. The training of the mental body has a value, and many evadesuch technicalities, hiding behind an emphasis upon the life side of truth, alldue to an inherent mental laziness. This that you now receive is but the A. B.C. of esotericism. Waste not time however in too detailed deduction. All that isnow possible is a broad general outline, patient reserve, a willingness torecognise physical brain limitations and the accepting of an hypothesis. Believethese hypotheses possible unless your intuition revolts or they are contradicted[364] by past teaching given by other of the Lodge’s Messengers. I do notdogmatise to you. I only in these instructions give you certain information,—thecorrectness of which I leave the future to demonstrate. I simply ask that youmake record and in the coming years much that may now seem peculiar or mayhapeven contradictory will be elucidated, slowly unravelled, and more easilycomprehended. A little knowledge leads to much confusion unless laid aside forfuture use when the years of instruction have increased the store.To return to our theme:—The heart centre in man opens the door into what iscalled “the heart of the Sun.” The throat centre opens the way into fullunderstanding of the path of the physical Sun and all true astrologers musteventually have that centre functioning. The head centre opens the way to thecentral spiritual Sun, each passing, via the planetary correspondence, to one ofthe cosmic planes.Thus we have a summation of technicalities, and of facts, which are (under theLaw of Analogy) of purely academic interest and no more. Even those of us whoare initiate know practically nothing of the cosmic planes beyond the cosmicphysical. Our consciousness is only beginning to be solar, and we are labouringin our small measure to overcome those planetary limitations which hold us backfrom solar knowledge and life. For aspirants who have not even a knowledge ofwhat planetary consciousness signifies, the above information has only one valueand that is, that it emphasises the synthetic nature of the great plan and thefact that the smallest unit is an integral part of the whole. It enforces theidea that energy is a life fluid circulating throughout the entire body of theLogos, and vivifying therefore even the tiniest atom in that whole. It isvaluable to endeavour to grasp the picture and to vision the wonder of what istranspiring. It is waste of time, nevertheless, to [365] ponder upon the cosmicastral plane, for instance, when even the plane of the ego (the fifth subplaneof the cosmic physical plane, counting from above downwards) is as yetinaccessible to the average man and is the goal for all his aspiration andmeditation.For man, therefore, the Universal Mind can best be grasped as it expressesitself through what we call the concrete mind, the abstract mind, and theintuition or pure reason.The concrete mind is the form building faculty. Thoughts are things. Theabstract mind is the pattern building faculty, or the mind which works with theblue prints upon which the forms are modelled. The intuition or pure reason isthe faculty which enables man to enter into contact with the Universal Mind andgrasp the plan synthetically, to seize upon divine Ideas or isolate somefundamental and pure truth.The goal of all the work of an aspirant is to understand those aspects of themind with which he has to learn to work. His work therefore might be summed upas follows:1. He has to learn to think; to discover that he has an apparatus which iscalled the mind and to uncover its faculties and powers. These have been wellanalysed for us in the first two books of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.2. He has to learn next to get back of his thought processes and form buildingpropensities and discover the ideas which underlie the divine thought-form, theworld process, and so learn to work in collaboration with the plan andsubordinate his own thought-form building to these ideas. He has to learn topenetrate into the world of these divine ideas and to study the “pattern ofthings in the Heavens” as it is called in the Bible. He [366] must begin to workwith the blue prints upon which all that is, is modelled and moulded. He becomesthen a student-symbolist, and from being an idolater he becomes a divineidealist. I use these words in their true sense and connotation.3. From that developed idealism, he must progress even deeper still, until heenters the realm of pure intuition. He can then tap truth at its source. Heenters into the mind of God Himself. He intuits as well as idealises and issensitive to divine thoughts. They fertilise his mind. He calls these intuitionslater, as he works them out, ideas or ideals, and bases all his work and conductof affairs upon them.4. Then follows the work of conscious thought-form building, based upon thesedivine ideas, emanating as intuitions from the Universal Mind. This goes forwardthrough meditation.Every true student knows that this involves concentration in order to focus ororient the lower mind to the higher. Temporarily the normal thought-formbuilding tendencies are inhibited. Through meditation which is the mind’s powerto hold itself in the light, and in that light become aware of the plan, helearns to “bring through” the needed ideas. Through contemplation he findshimself able to enter into that silence which will enable him to tap the divinemind, wrest God’s thought out of the divine consciousness and to know . This isthe work before each aspirant and hence the necessity of his understanding thenature of his mental problem, the tools with which he must perforce work, andthe use he must make of what he learns and gains through right use of the mentalapparatus.How is this to be done? How bring through and how build afterwards?[367] No matter how small or unimportant an individual thinker may be, yet incooperation with his brethren, he wields a mighty force. Only through the steadystrong right thinking of the people and the understanding of the correct use ofmental energy can progressive evolution go forward along the desired lines.Right thinking depends upon many things, and it might be useful to state some ofthem very simply:1. An ability to sense the vision. That involves a capacity in a faint measureto realise the archetype on which the Lodge is endeavouring to fashion the race.It involves cooperation in the work of the Manu, and the development of abstractas well as synthetic thought, the flashing forth of the intuition. The intuitionwrests from the high places a touch of the ideal plan as it lies latent in themind of the Logos. As men develop this capacity, they will touch sources ofpower that are not on mental levels at all but which constitute those from whichthe mental plane itself draws sustenance.2. Then, having sensed the vision and glimpsed a fraction of the beauty (howlittle men see is astounding!) in your hands lies the opportunity to bring downto the mental plane as much of the plan as you possibly can. Nebulous and faintat first is your grasp after it, yet it will begin to materialise. Seldom atfirst will you find that you can contact it, for the vision comes through themedium of the causal body and few can hold that high consciousness for a longtime. But the struggle to apprehend will lead to results, and little by littlethe idea will seep through to the concrete levels of the mental plane. Then itbecomes a concrete thought, something that can be definitely visualised andappropriated as a basis for thought.3. This accomplished, what comes next? A period of gestation, a period whereinyou build your thought-form of as much of the vision as you can bring throughinto [368] your consciousness. Slowly must this be done, for a stable vibrationand a well built form is desired. Hurried work leads nowhere. As you build therewill gradually be sensed a longing, a desire to see this vision brought toearth, and see it becoming known to others among the sons of men. Then youvitalise the thoughtform with the power of your will, you seek to make it be ;the rhythm becomes heavier and slower, the material built into your form isnecessarily coarser, and you find that your thought-form of the vision isclothed in matter of the mental and astral planes.4. Happy the disciple who can bring the vision nearer still to humanity, andwork it into existence on the physical plane. Remember this, that thematerialisation of any aspect of the vision on the physical plane is never thework of one man. Only when it has been sensed by the many, only when they haveworked at its material form can their united efforts draw it into outermanifestation. Thus you see the value of educating public opinion; it brings themany helpers to the aid of the few visionaries. Always the Law holds good;—indescent, differentiation. The two or three sense the plan intuitively; then therhythm they set up with their thought sweeps the mental plane matter intoactivity; thinkers seize hold of the idea. This is a hard thing to learn anddifficult to do but the reward is great.To those who wrestle, strive, and hold on, the joy is doubled when thematerialisation comes. The joy of contrast will be yours, for knowing the pastof darkness you will revel in the light of fruition; the joy of tried and testedcompanionship will be yours, for years will have proved to you who are yourchosen associates, and in community of suffering will come the strengthenedlink; the joy of peace after victory will be yours, for to the tired warrior thefruits of achievement and rest are doubly sweet; the joy of participation in theMasters’ [369] plan will be yours, and all is well that associates you closelywith Them; the joy of having helped to solace a needy world, of having broughtlight to darkened souls, of having healed in some measure the open sore of theworld’s distress, will be yours, and in the consciousness of days well spent,and in the gratitude of salvaged souls, comes the deepest joy of all,—the joy aMaster knows when He is instrumental in lifting a brother up a little higher onthe ladder. This is the joy that is set before you all—and not so very far aheadit lies. So work, not for joy but towards it; not for reward, but from the innerneed to help; not for gratitude, but from the urge that comes from having seenthe vision and realisation of the part you have to play in bringing that visiondown to earth.It is helpful to differentiate between happiness, joy and bliss:First, happiness , which has its seat in the emotions, and is a personalityreaction.Second, joy , which is a quality of the soul and is realised in the mind, whenalignment takes place.Third, bliss , which is the nature of the Spirit and about which speculation isfruitless until the soul realises its oneness with the Father. This realisationfollows upon an earlier stage wherein the personal self is at-oned with thesoul. Therefore speculation and analysis as to the nature of bliss is profitlessto the average man whose metaphors and terminologies must perforce be personaland related to the world of the senses. Does the aspirant refer to his happinessor joy? If he refers to the latter it must come as the effect of groupconsciousness, of group solidarity, of oneness with all beings, and may not beinterpreted in terms of happiness after all. Happiness comes when thepersonality is meeting with those conditions which satisfy it in one part orother of its lower nature; it comes when there is a sense of physical [370] wellbeing, of contentment with one’s environment or surrounding personalities, or ofsatisfaction with one’s mental opportunities and contacts. Happiness is the goalof the separated self.When however we seek to live as souls, the contentment of the lower man isdiscounted and we find joy in our group relationships and in bringing aboutthose conditions which lead to the better expression of the souls of those wecontact. This bringing of joy to others in order to produce conditions in whichthey may better express themselves may have a physical effect as we seek tobetter their material conditions, or an emotional effect as our presence bringsto them peace and uplift, or an intellectual result as we stimulate them toclarity of thought and understanding. But the effect upon ourselves is joy, forour action has been selfless and non-acquisitive, and not dependent upon theaspirant’s circumstance or worldly state. Much happiness is necessarily foregonewhen ill-health makes its pressure felt, as the environment is difficult and the“accumulated karma of many births” presses down, or as the troubles of thefamily, nation or race weigh upon the sensitive personality. The happiness ofyouth or the self-centred contentment of the selfish insulated person (hidinghimself behind the shield of his protective desires) must not be confounded withjoy.It is a platitude as well as an occult paradox to say that in the midst ofprofound personality distress and unhappiness, the joy of the soul may be knownand felt. Such however is the case, and it is for this the student must aim.Some people are happy because they shut their eyes to truth, or areself-hypnotised, hiding themselves within a shell of illusion. But the aspiranthas frequently reached the stage wherein his eyes are wide open; he has learntto speak truth to himself, and has built up no separating wall between himselfand [371] others. He is awake and alive; he is sensitive and frequentlysuffering. He wonders why apparently what the world calls happiness and peacehave left him, and asks what is to be the outcome.We who watch and guide on the inner side, watch with loving care all of you whostruggle in the thick of the fray. We are like the General Headquarters Staffwho follow the course of the battle from a secure eminence. In our security liesyour ultimate success, for we hold in our hands the solution of many problems,and apply that solution when the battle goes contrary. One thing always would Ihave you remember. It is of vital importance. It is this statement, that in thedestruction of the form lies hid the secret of all evolution. Think not this istruism. You will see it in constant application and need to be prepared for itsdemonstration. The Masters utilize the form to the uttermost; They seek to workthrough it, imprisoning the life in confining walls for just as long as thepurpose is served and the race instructed through that form. Then the time comesthat the form no longer serves the purpose intended, when the structureatrophies, crystallises and becomes easily destructible. Its destruction thenbecomes the matter of greatest concern and usefulness, and it goes, whilst a newform takes its place. Watch and see if this be not so. Always the building ofthe form, always its utilisation for as long as possible, always the destructionof the form when it hinders and cramps the expanding light, always then therapid reconstruction of a new form. Such has been the method since thecommencement of the aeon.In the infancy of the race the forms endured for a long time. Evolution movedmore slowly, but now on the upward trend of all things, the form has but shortduration. It lives vitally for a brief period; it moves with rapidity and thenis succeeded by another form. This [372] rapidity will increase not decrease asthe consciousness or inner expansion of the life of the race vibrates ever to afaster and lighter rate of rhythm.It is necessary likewise that you arrive at the realization that one of theprincipal objects of endeavor at the present time on the part of those whom youcall the Elder Brothers of the race, is to stimulate, purify and coordinate theetheric body. This etheric body is not only the transmitter of prana but is themedium for all the energies which we are considering. Its importance also liesin other directions:a. Being of physical plane matter, literally, etheric consciousness is the nextstep ahead for the race. This will demonstrate at first as the ability to seeetherically and to cognize etheric matter.b. It is the field of exploration immediately ahead of the modern scientist. Inten years time, many medical practitioners will be recognizing it as a fact ofnature.c. Most of the diseases that the physical body suffers from at present havetheir roots in the etheric body. There are few, if any, purely physicaldiseases. Disease has its source in astral and etheric conditions.d. The secret of safe and sane clairvoyance and clairaudience depends upon thepurification of the etheric vehicle.e. The etheric emanations of people can be great contaminators. In thepurification, therefore, of this body lies the secret of a sweeter and sanerhumanity.Hence, the importance of the etheric. There are many other reasons which willlater be emphasized. In beginning to form your ideas on the subject, however, itis the part of wisdom to adhere to wide generalities until the whole matter hastaken clear shape in your mind.Work on the etheric body, however, from the standpoint of the Hierarchy is notconfined only to the bodies of men. It is a planetary process. The etheric bodyof [373] the earth itself is being subjected to a definite stimulation. Thespirit of the earth, that mysterious entity—not the planetary Logos—is beingvivified in a new sense and in his vivification many interesting developmentseventuate. In three ways this is being attempted:1. By an increased rate of vibration of the etheric atoms, caused by the comingin of the ceremonial ray. This must not be pictured as a sudden and violentchange. From the standpoint of the human student the rate of increase isapparently so slow and gradual as to be inappreciable. Nevertheless, thestimulation exists, and in the course of centuries will be recognized.2. By the play of certain astral forces on the etheric body that leads to slowbut definite changes in the internal structure of the atom, the coming intoconsciousness of another of the spirillae and a general tightening up of thewhole cosmos of the atom.3. By the use on the inner planes by the Mahachohan of one of the powerfultalismans of the seventh ray.The spirit of the earth, it might be noted, is of slow and gradual arousing. Heis on the involutionary arc and passes on to the evolutionary in some dim anddistant future. Therefore, he will not carry us with him. He but serves ourpurpose now, offering us a home within his body, yet remaining dissociated fromus. The devas of the ethers from this very stimulation are consequentlyhastening forward in evolution and approximating also nearer to their ideal.In all I have said anent the etheric body of men, anent the planet, anent thespirit of the earth, the crux of the whole situation lies in the fact that thefive rays at this time have the seventh ray as their predominating ray. Theseventh ray is the ray that controls the etheric and the devas of the ethers. Itcontrols the seventh sub-plane of all planes but it dominates at this time theseventh sub-plane of the physical plane. Being in the fourth [374] round also,when a ray comes into definite incarnation, it not only controls on planes ofthe same number but has a special influence on the fourth sub-plane. Note howthis works at this time in the three worlds:1. The fourth ether, the lowest of the ethers, is to be the next physical planeof consciousness. Etheric matter is even now becoming visible to some, and willbe entirely visible at the end of this century to many.2. The fourth sub-plane of the astral holds the majority of men when they passover and consequently much work on the greatest number can therefore beaccomplished.3. The fourth mental sub-plane is the plane of devachan.THE FOUNDING OF THE HIERARCHYThe various energies which play upon the human being and produce his unfoldmentconstitute his field of experience. Those two words—unfoldment andexperience—should ever be linked, for each produces the other. As one issubjected to experience in the form world, a paralleling unfoldment ofconsciousness is carried forward. As that unfoldment produces constant changesin realisation and a consequent constant reorientation to a new state ofawareness, it necessarily leads to new experience—experience of fresh phenomena,of new states of being, and of dimensional conditions hitherto unknown. Hencethe frequent reaction of the disciple to the fact that for him, as yet, there isno point of peace. Peace was the objective of the Atlantean aspirant.Realisation is that of the Aryan disciple. He can never be static; he can neverrest; he is constantly adjusting himself to new conditions; constantly learningto function therein, and then subsequently finding them pass away to give place,in their turn, to new. This goes on until the consciousness is stabilised in theSelf, in the One. Then the initiate [375] knows himself to be the onlookingUnity watching the phenomenal phantasmagoria of life in form.He passes from one sense of unity to a sense of duality, and from thence againinto a higher unity. First, the Self identifies itself with the form aspect tosuch an extent that all duality disappears in the illusion that the Self is theform. We have then the form constituting apparently all that there is. This isfollowed by the stage wherein the indwelling Self begins to be aware of Itselfas well as of the form, and we talk then in terms of the higher and the lowerself; we speak of the self and its sheaths, and of the self and the not-self.This dualistic stage is that of the aspirant and of the disciple, up to the timeof his training for the third initiation. He begins with a knowledge that he isa spiritual entity confined in a form. His consciousness for a long period oftime remains predominantly that of the form. Gradually this changes,—sogradually that the aspirant learns the lesson of endurance (even to the point ofenduring the not-self!) until there comes a life of balance, wherein neitherpreponderates. This produces in the man a state of apparent negativity andinertia which may last for one life or two, and he seems to accomplish little ineither direction. This is, for workers, a valuable hint in their dealings withpeople. Then the point of balance changes, and the soul appears to dominate fromthe standpoint of influence, and the entire consciousness aspect begins to shiftinto the higher of the two aspects. Duality however, still persists, for the manis sometimes identified with his soul and sometimes with his form nature; thisis the stage wherein so many most earnest disciples are at this time to befound. Little by little however he becomes “absorbed” in the soul, and thuscomes en rapport with all aspects of the soul in all forms until the day dawnswhen he realises that there is nothing but soul and then the higher state ofunity supervenes.[376] These points need consideration and are valuable, for there are schools ofthought (such as the Vedanta and other mystical groups of thinkers) whichemphasise the life aspect and appear to negate duality. Other schools (such asthe Theosophical, in spite of denial) teach the fact of the self and thenot-self, and hence can be interpreted in terms of duality. Both are right andboth need each other. It should be remembered that in the process ofmanifestation we work from a relative unity, through duality, to another unity,in the following way:1. The unity of form, wherein the self is identified apparently with the form,and is absorbed in form life.2. Duality, with a fluctuating shift backward and forward between the self andthe form, the focus of consciousness being sometimes in one and sometimes in theother.3. The unity of the soul, wherein naught but soul is seen to exist, and onlybeing is registered in consciousness.Thus it will be found that both schools are right, and that the dualisticconcept is a step upon the way to essential union with the One Life.It should be remembered that just as the battle ground (the kurukshetra) for theaspirant or probationer is the astral plane, so the battle ground for thedisciple is the mental plane. There is his kurukshetra. The aspirant has tolearn to control his emotional psychic nature through right control of the mind,and this Krishna seeks to emphasise as he trains Arjuna to take the next steptowards right vision. The disciple has to carry forward this mental attention,and, through right use of the mind, achieve a higher realisation, and bring intoactive use a still higher factor,—that of the intuition.In himself, the aspirant repeats the racial unfoldment, [377] and re-enacts theracial drama; and to comprehend this certain facts about that drama and the workof the Hierarchy should be grasped and I here enumerate them:1. The movement for the spreading of the Secret Doctrine is eighteen millionyears old.2. Only four of the original Instigators still remain with us. The work(impulsive and controlling) lies now in the hands of three groups of lives, ifit may be so expressed:a. In the hands of those of our Earth Humanity who have equipped themselves soas to serve.b. In the hands of certain Existences who have come into our earth scheme ofevolution from other planetary schemes.c. In the hands of a large number of devas of superhuman evolution.These in their aggregate, form the occult Hierarchy of the planet, working inthree main divisions, and in seven groups as outlined in many Theosophical booksand summarized in Initiation, Human and Solar.3. In the very early stages, this Hierarchy was called by various names; amongothers it was called the Temple of Ibez.4. Let us consider the founding of the Temple of Ibez. To do this it will benecessary to consider the period of the coming of the White Brotherhood to earthand the immediate problem before Them; this will involve the recognition ofcertain facts that have never been adequately considered. It is an acknowledgedfact in occultism that for our earth humanity the advent of the occult Hierarchywas epochal; it brought about two things:The definite crystallization of that group soul which is now called thefourth orhuman kingdom. [378]The arousing of manas or mind in animal man in a triple way.a. By the direct incarnation of certain members of the White Brotherhood, inwhich way They brought in the new and necessary factors by transmission to theirchildren.b. By the definite implantation of what is called in the occult Scriptures “thespark of mind” in animal man. This is simply a pictorial way of picturing thecreation, by a direct act, of the necessary mental unit or mental apparatus ofthought, within the causal or spiritual body.c. By the gradual stimulation of the mental faculty in animal man, and thesteady vitalisation of the latent germ of mind until it flowered forth asmanifested mind.This covered a vast period of time, and though the Brotherhood made itsheadquarters at Shamballa and directed its activities from there, it was foundnecessary during the first sub-race of the Atlantean Root Race to make certainefforts, if the evolution of the race was to proceed according to plan. Studentsof these mysteries need to remember that though Shamballa is spoken of asexisting in physical matter and as occupying a definite location in space, thephysical matter referred to is etheric, the Lord of the World and His assistantsof the higher degrees occupying bodies formed of etheric matter.5. It was decided about seventeen million years ago (the coming of the Hierarchyand the founding of Shamballa being about eighteen and a half million years ago)to have on the dense physical plane an organization and a headquarters for themysteries, and to have a band of Adepts, and Chohans who would function in densephysical bodies and thus meet the need of the rapidly awakening humanity. [379]6. The first outpost for the Shamballa Fraternity was the original temple ofIbez and it was located in the centre of South America, and one of its branchesat a much later period was to be found in the ancient Maya institutions, and thebasic worship of the Sun as the source of life in the hearts of all men. Asecond branch was later established in Asia, and of this branch the Himalayanand southern Indian adepts are the representatives, though the work ismaterially changed. At a later date than the present, discoveries will be made,revealing the reality of the old form of hierarchical work; ancient records andmonuments will be revealed, some above ground and many in subterraneanfastnesses. As the mysteries of Central Asia in the land stretching from Chaldeaand Babylon through Turkestan to Manchuria, including the Gobi desert, areopened up, it is planned that much of the early history of the Ibezhan workerswill be revealed.We might here note the fact that the word Ibez is literally in the nature of anacrostic veiling the true name of the planetary Logos of the earth, one of Whoseprinciples is working in Sanat Kumara, making Him thus a direct incarnation ofthe planetary Logos and an expression of His divine consciousness. These fourletters are the first letters of the real names of the four Avatars on the fourglobes of our earth chain who have embodied four of the divine principles. Theletters I B E Z are not the true Sensar letters, if such an inaccurateexpression can be used of an ideographic language, but are simply a Europeanizeddistortion. The true meaning is only conveyed at the fourth initiation when thenature of the planetary Logos is revealed and His four Avatars are definitelycontacted through the direct mediatory work of Sanat Kumara.7. A word now as regards the work of the Ibezhan adepts and Their mysteries; itis necessary here to point [380] out that the whole trend of Their work was in away different and necessarily so, to that of the adepts at this time. Theirobjective was to stimulate mysticism and the stimulating of the kingdom of Godwithin the human atom. The nature of Their work is most difficult for theaverage man of this time to comprehend, owing to the different state of hisconsciousness. The Ibezhan adepts had to deal with a humanity which was in itsinfancy, whose polarization was most unstable, and whose coordination was veryimperfect. There was very little mentality to be found and men were practicallyaltogether astral; they functioned even more consciously on the astral planethan on the physical, and it was part of the work of these early adepts, workingunder instruction from Shamballa to develop the energy centres of the humanunit, stimulate the brain and make him fully self-conscious on the physicalplane. Their objective was to bring about a realization of the kingdom of Godwithin, and little attention was paid (in Their training of Their disciples) tothe bringing about of the realization of God in nature or in other units. It wasnecessary in those days to employ methods more definitely physical than arepermissible now, and these methods of physical stimulation were employed and thelaws of energy as they work through the various centres were taught until thetime came when another big change was made in the hierarchical methods, and thedoor from the animal kingdom into the human was closed and the door ofinitiation was opened. It was felt at that time that man was then self-centeredenough and individualized enough to permit of a drastic change in method andpractice. All this took a vast period of time and it is the remnants of theearlier Temple practices which have come down to us in degraded phallicteaching, in Tantrik magic and the practices of Hatha Yogis. The infant humanityof Lemurian and early Atlantean days had to be taught what they [381] were bymeans of symbols and methods which to us would be crude, impossible and of anature which the race should have transcended for many millions of years.8. At the time the door of initiation was opened, many millions of years ago theLodge came to two decisions:That individualisation must cease until man had not only coordinated thephysical and astral bodies and could think self-consciously but until he hadalso transcended the physical and the astral. When he is becominggroup-conscious, then the door into the kingdom of self-consciousness will againbe opened.That the path of mysticism must lead eventually to the occult path, and thatplans must be made to impart teaching, and mysteries must be organized whichwould reveal the nature of God in all that is seen, and not only in man. Manmust be taught that though an individual, he is but part of a greater whole andthat his interests must be made subservient to those of the group. Gradually theteaching was re-organized, and the curriculum increased; little by little themysteries were developed as the people became ready for them until we have themarvelous Schools of the Mysteries of Chaldea, Egypt, Greece and many others.9. Three things might be mentioned:a. The relatively low point of evolution of many men and their naturallyphysical polarization.b. The work of the black adepts and the followers of the left hand path. Whenthe Ibezhan adepts (again under instructions from the Masters at Shamballa)began to withdraw into the Temples, to make the mysteries more difficult ofattainment and to work against abuses and distortions, a number of Theirerstwhile followers, many of great power and knowledge, fought Them and thus wehave one of the causes of the appearing of [382] black and white magic, and oneof the reasons of the purifying waters of the flood being deemed necessary.c. The powerful thought-forms built up in the early Ibezhan mysteries and which(particularly in America) are as yet undestroyed. This gigantic “Dweller on theThreshold” of all the true Mysteries has to be slaughtered before the aspirantcan pass on.10. The work of the Ibezhan adepts and the mysteries of the Temple of Ibez arestill persisting and are being carried on by the masters and adepts in physicalincarnation throughout the world. They teach the meaning of the psyche, the egoor the soul and of the human unit, so that the man may indeed be what he is, aGod walking on earth, his lower nature (physical, astral and mental) completelycontrolled by the soul or the love aspect, and this not in theory but in deedand truth. When this is the case, the physical body will have no lure for the real man, theemotional nature and desire body will no longer lead astray nor will the mindshut out that which is true and spiritual, but the God will use the three bodiesas vehicles of service to the race. Then will the human kingdom be transcendedand man pass into the spiritual kingdom, there to have further lessons just asinfant humanity when passing out of the animal kingdom was trained and taughtits functions and work by the Ibezhan teachers.In Atlantean days, the goal that the Hierarchy of Teachers set before Themselveswas the awakening in man of the love nature, as a step towards the awakening ofthe heart centre. To do this, the Teachers at that time were Themselves focussed(deliberately and of intent) in the heart centre, and chose to work entirelythrough that centre, subordinating Their mental equipment and [383] the mentalenergy They could use to the need of the time, They kept Their mental force inabeyance when training the initiates until the time the third initiation wasreached. In our race, the condition is reversed. The Hierarchy is working nowentirely on mental levels, though basing all endeavour upon past achievements inconnection with the heart centre. Up to the third initiation therefore,disciples have to endeavour to work entirely with mental energy in an effort tocontrol, master and use it. Their attempt is concentrated then upon transmitting(from egoic levels) the will aspect of the soul. That will has to be imposedupon the personality until it has become the automaton of the soul. Then theintuition takes control, and energies from the intuitional or buddhic planebegin to make their impact upon the form nature, the personality. Prior to thisperiod of intuitional control, there are many lives wherein the intuition maybegin to play its part, and the student learns the meaning of illumination.Until after the third initiation, however, it is the iilumined mind which is thedominant factor, and not the pure intuitive perception, or pure reason. Afterthis great initiation, which marks a definite transition out of the formconsciousness, the initiate can function at will on the plane of the intuition,and the mind is steadily relegated into the background till it becomes a part ofthe instinctual apparatus—as much a part of the subconscious instinctual natureas is the instinctual nature which the materialistic psychologist so muchstresses. Intuitive perception, pure vision, direct knowledge, and an ability toutilise the undifferentiated energies of the Universal Mind are the maincharacteristics of the Aryan adepts. I use the word ‘undifferentiated’ in thesense of freedom from multiplicity; certain main distinctions will still befound to exist. The will of the soul, regarding that soul as having [384] itsplace on one of the seven Rays, is superseded by the will of the Whole.These are words meaning but little, or having at best only a theoreticalsignificance to students in this group. When I say to you that the will which istransmitted through the medium of the controlled mind is embodied in seven typesof energy, and to these seven types, there are corresponding types of humanity,you say doubtless that that is clear and not so difficult to grasp. Yet do youindeed understand? Seven types of energy, and seven types of responsivementalities, dependent upon the seven ray types! In this statement, we note thedifferentiations of the soul aspect as grasped by the mind. These are the sevendifferentiations which take the place of the multiplicity of differences intowhich the form aspect falls. They are, nevertheless, distinctions anddifferentiations, and persist in their hold over man until the third initiation.By them he is swept into certain major activities and life tendencies, accordingto his particular ray. These are mental distinctions. All souls on the mentalplane take the forms of the solar Angels, of the divine Sons of mind. Hence wehave these groupings, and hence the focussing of the energies through which thePlan of the Ages works out through seven main departments.At a later stage, when certain great transitions in consciousness have takenplace and the form has lost its hold, even these divisions disappear, and theplan is seen as a whole, the Life is known in its essential oneness, and theterm, monad, begins to have some real significance.Students must always remember that all distinctions and categories are mentalproductions, and are due to the modifications of the thinking principle, and tothe control of form by mental energy. As the central Thinker of the Universeworks through the power of [385] thought, the problem of surmounting thesedistinctions and differences is well nigh insuperable until such time as theaspirant comes under complete control of the second aspect of divinity, andpasses out of the domination of the third or matter aspect. But up to the thirdinitiation even the second aspect (the aspect of love) implies duality, for itis inherent in love itself. Ever there is the Lover and the loved, the Desirerand the desired, the Seeker and the sought. It is only as the first aspect, thatof energising unifying Life (which sweeps all forms and all dualities into onegreat synthesis) is sensed at the third initiation, that the words I have heredictated convey any practical meaning or realisation.Let us simplify matters, if we can, by three clear statements; in them we willsum up the work the disciple accomplishes, as he struggles with and masters theenergies of the mental world.1. Work on the mental plane produces realisation of duality. The disciple seeksto blend and merge the soul with its vehicle and to do this consciously. Heseeks to fuse them into a unity. He aims at the realisation that, here and now,they are ONE. The unification of the self and of the not-self is his objective.The first step in this direction is taken when he begins to cease identifyinghimself with the form, and recognises (during this transitional period) that heis a duality.2. The mind, rightly used, becomes therefore a recorder of two types of energyor of two aspects of the manifestation of the One Life. It records andinterprets the world of phenomena. It records and interprets the world of souls.It is sensitive to the three worlds of human evolution. It becomes equallysensitive to the kingdom of the soul. It is the great mediating principle, inthis interim of dual recognition.3. Later, the soul and its instrument become so unified and at-one that dualitydisappears, and the soul knows [386] itself to be all that is, all that has beenand all that will be.There is a curious and ancient Atlantean chant which is no longer used but inthose far off times was chanted by the initiate who took the thirdinitiation—the consummating initiation of that period. It goes as follows. Thetranslation of the symbols in which it was written necessitates the loss ofrhythm and potency.“I stand between the Heavens and Earth! I vision God; I see the forms God took.I hate them both. Naught do they mean to me, for one I cannot reach, and for thelower of the two I have no longer any love.“Torn I am. Space and its Life I cannot know, and so I want it not. Time and itsmyriad forms I know too well. Pendant I hang betwixt the two, desiring neither.“God from high Heaven speaks. There is a change. I hear with ear attentive, and,listening, turn my head. That which is visioned, yet visioning could not reach,is nearer to my heart. Old longings come again, yet die. Old chains with clamoursnap. Forward I rush.“Myriads of voices speak and halt me in my tracks. The thunder of the sounds ofearth shuts out the voice of God. I turn me on my forward path, and vision onceagain the long held joys of earth, and flesh and kin. I lose the vision ofeternal things. The voice of God dies out.“Torn again am I, but only for a little time. Backward and forward shifts mylittle self, e’en as a bird soars into heaven and settles back again upon thetree. Yet God, in His high place, outlasts the little bird. Thus do I know thatGod will victor be and later hold my mind and me in thrall.***“Hark to the joyous paean that I chant; the work is done. My ear is deaf to allthe calls of earth, except to that small voice of all the hidden souls withinthe outer forms, for they are as myself; with them I am at-one.“God’s voice rings clear and in its tones and overtones the little voices of thelittle forms dim and fade out. I dwell within a world of unity. I know all soulsare one.“Swept am I by the universal Life and as I sweep upon [387] my onward way—theway of God—I see all lesser energies die out. I am the One; I, God. I am theform in which all forms are merged. I am the soul in which all souls are fused.I am the Life, and in that Life, all little lives remain.”These words, chanted in the ancient formulas on peculiar and selected notes,were most potent and brought definite results in certain ancient ceremonies thathave long since died out.To the three concise statements above made we might add a fourth as follows:4. When the chitta, or mind stuff, is swept into activity by abstract ideas (theembodied thoughts of the divine mind, carrying the energy of their creator andconsequently the cause of phenomenal effects in the three worlds) and when tothis is added divine understanding and synthetic apprehension of the will andpurpose of God, then the three aspects of mind are unified. These we touchedupon earlier, and called them:1. Mind stuff, or chitta.2. Abstract mind.3. Intuition or pure reason.These have to be unified in the consciousness of the aspirant. When this hashappened, the disciple has built the bridge (the antaskarana) which links:1. The spiritual triad.2. The causal body.3. The personality.When this is done the egoic body has served its purpose, the solar Angel hasdone its work, and the form side of existence is no longer needed, as weunderstand and utilise it, as a medium of experience. The man enters into theconsciousness of the Monad, the ONE. The causal body [388] disintegrates; thepersonality fades out, and illusion is ended. This is the consummation of theGreat Work, and another Son of God has entered into the Father’s home. That hemay go out from there into the world of phenomena in order to work with the Planis probable, but he will not need to undergo the processes of manifestation ashumanity does. He can then construct, for the work, his body of expression. Hecan work through and with energy as the Plan dictates. Note these last words,for they hold the key to manifestation.Our study of the energies which have been brought to our attention as we studiedRule X has brought us to a consideration of:Personality Energy : emanating from:a. Coordinated man.b. Dominant human beings.c. Groups: such as1. The Hierarchy of Adepts.2. The integrating Group of Mystics of the New Age.This will be an important consideration, for this group of mystics is gainingeach year in potency.Planetary Energies : emanating from:a. The seven planets.b. The Earth.c. The Moon.Only a few things can be noted about this section of energies and about thenext, for this is a series of Instructions for the aspirant and not a treatiseon energy.Solar Energies : emanating from:a. The physical sun.b. Cosmic sources.In all thoughts concerning these energies it should be remembered that they arepassed to us through, or rather [389] constitute the bodies of, certain liveswhom we call the devas, in their greater and lesser groups, and that thereforewe are all the time working in the bodies of lives and hence influencing them.Some of you therefore who have made a study of A Treatise on Cosmic Fire mayfind it of value to note the following items of information:1. The lowest types of devas or builders on the evolutionary Path are violetdevas; next come the green, and, last of all, the white devas. These are alldominated by a fourth and special group. These control the exoteric processes ofphysical plane existence.2. It must not be forgotten, however, that, on a lower scale of the evolutionaryladder, are other groups of lives, wrongly entitled devas, which work inobedience to the law, and are controlled by the higher entities. There are, forinstance, the denser forms of gaseous life, termed often salamanders, theelementals of the fire. These are directly under the control of the Lord Agni,Lord of the mental plane, and, in this mental age, we have the element of fireentering into the mechanics of living as never before. Eliminate the productswhich are controlled by heat and you will bring our civilisation to a stop; youwill bring all means of transportation to an end and all modes of lighting; youwould throw all manufactories into the discard. Basically again, these fierylives, are found in all that burns, and in the warmth that holds all lifeformation on earth and causes the flourishing of all living things.3. Under the Law of Correspondences the mental plane has an analogy in the thirdsubplane of the physical plane, the plane into which science is now entering.Mind has, for its main expression in the material world what we call ourscientific civilisation.4. Agni rules on the mental plane, and has domination likewise on the thirdsubplane of the etheric planes. He [390] is the Lord of the fifth or mentalplane, counting from above downwards, if one must employ these terms for thesake of symbolism. For this world cycle, Agni is the dominating influence,though Indra, Lord of the buddhic or intuitional level has a subtle controlwhich is steadily waxing stronger. All humanity is striving towards the fourthplane of union between the three higher and the three lower, but, at thispresent moment, the plane of mind or of fire is the most important.5. We need to remember that just as in particular incarnations, men are focussedor polarised in various bodies—sometimes the astral and sometimes the mental—soat this time one might infer that our planetary Logos Himself is focussed in Hismental body. He, it has been said, is striving towards the fourth cosmicinitiation, which makes possible our attainment of the fourth Initiation, for Hecarries us forward with Him, and, on our particular level, we achieve as cellsin His Body.6. As time progresses, Indra will swing into control and the age of air will beushered in. More and more as the buddhic principle manifests and at-one-ment isachieved shall we see this age of air coming into being. A corroboration of thiscan be seen in the gradual control by men of the air. In an esoteric sense, allin the future will become lighter, more rarefied and more etherealized. I amchoosing my words with care.7. “Our God is a consuming Fire” refers primarily to Agni, the controllingfactor in this age. The devas of the fire will play an increasingly importantpart in all earth processes. To them is given the work of inaugurating the NewAge, the new world and civilisation and the new continent. The last greattransition was governed by Varuna.8. Agni controls not only the fires of the earth and rules the mental plane buthe is definitely associated with [391] the work of arousing the sacred fire, thekundalini. Note how the correspondence works out. A great part of the fifthroot-race, three-fifths perhaps, stand close to the Probationary Path, and withthe coming in of the new age and the advent of the Christ in due time and in Hisown place (note the care with which I express this; dogmatic assertions in termsof men’s concrete minds are inadvisable) many will find it possible to make theadequate extra effort, entailed in the taking of the first major Initiation.They will begin to pass from the fifth to the fourth plane. The Lord of Firewill achieve his peculiar work for this cycle by arousing the fire of kundaliniin the large numbers of those who are ready. This will be begun in this century,and carried forward actively for the next one thousand years.In your work you may later be shown—all depends upon your aptitude—methods ofapproach to these dominating forces, but this will come subjectively and notthrough magical work and formulas. The attainment of a right vibration will workautomatically in the production of right conditions and right rapports.I would again point out that we shall not waste time in planetary intricaciesand the interplay of solar energies, but will concern ourselves with the laws ofpractical spiritual living. I seek but to give a few thoughts which haverelation to the coming age, and which will enable man to go forward to thatglorious heritage which is his and into which he must inevitably enter under thegood Law and through the experience of rebirth. Through rebirth he learns todominate and utilise form correctly.All forms, in themselves, are not expressions of a personality. To warrant theterm, three types of energy must be present, three types, fused, blended andcoordinated into one functioning organism. A personality is therefore a blend ofmental energy, of emotional energy and of vital force, and these three aremasked, hidden [392] or revealed (note this terminology) by an outer shell orform of dense physical matter. This outer crust is in itself a form of negativeenergy. The result of this union of three energies in an objective form isself-consciousness. Their fusion produces that sense of individuality, whichjustifies the use of the word ‘I’, and which relates all occurrences to a self.Where this central conscious entity exists, utilising the mind, reactingsensuously through the emotional body and energising the dense physical (via thevital body) then one has a personality. It is self-conscious existence in form.It is awareness of identity in relation to other identities, and this is equallytrue of God or man. It is a sense of identity, however, which persists onlyduring the creative process, and for as long as the matter aspect and theconsciousness aspect present the eternal duality of nature. In our evolutionarydevelopment it is not realised in the sub-human forms; it is realised in thehuman kingdom, and is realised but merged into and negated by the greater formsand consciousness which we call the superhuman.Personality is that state of awareness which has its conditioning factor in themind stuff, but this can be transcended when that mind stuff no longer controls.As the individual mind stuff is an integral part of the Universal Mind, and asthe principle of mind is inherent in all forms, the sense of individuality andof self-awareness is always eternally possible. In the higher states ofconsciousness, it is however, eventually relegated to a subordinate position.God, for instance, can always and eternally be aware of that reality whichconstitutes the self, and which governs the integrity of the solar system, andof the solar interplay with other systems, but the consciousness of divinity andthe awareness of the solar Deity is not primarily occupied with selfhood.That—as a result of past world periods and experience—lies below the thresholdof the divine consciousness, and has [393] become as much a part of the cosmicinstinctual nature as are any of the human instinctual attributes. The focus ofthe Eternal Attention (if I may use so unusual a phrase where words arenecessarily almost worthless!) lies in realms of awareness beyond ourcomprehension. They lie as far beyond our ken as the awareness of a Master ofthe Wisdom lies beyond the ken of an ant or a mouse. It is therefore fruitlessfor us to dwell upon it. For us, there is the achieving of personality, or of afull registration or awareness of the indwelling self; there lies then theutilisation of that personality, and its sacrifice eventually to group good,with a consequent merging of the self in the one Self and the fusion of theindividual soul (consciously and willingly) in the Oversoul.‘I am’—the cry of every human being; ‘I am That’,—the cry of every personality,who realises his selfhood and uses his personality in order to express the willof the indwelling entity, the true person. ‘I am that I am’—the cry of theindividual soul as it is lost in the whole and realises its oneness with thesoul or self of all.The characteristics of the individual who is beginning to function as apersonality might be briefly enumerated as follows. They are simple and clearand preeminently selfish. Let it not be forgotten that the primitive step on theway to selfhood of necessity is selfishness. Let it be equally well rememberedthat the prime hindrance to the advanced and highly evolved personality isselfhood, or the prolongation of the selfish attitude. The characteristicstherefore are in their sequential development as follows:1. The ability to say I am, I wish, I desire, I will.2. The consciousness of being in the centre of one’s tiny universe. “Around methe Heavens move and the stars in their courses revolve” is the motto of thisstage. [394]3. The sense of drama and the capacity to visualise oneself as the centre ofone’s environment.4. The sense of responsibility and the aptitude to regard the surroundingmembers of the human family as dependent upon one.5. The sense of importance—the outgrowth of the above. This demonstrates inpower and influence where there is a real and steadily awakening entity behindthe 'persona', and in braggadocio and bombast where a small selfish creaturefunctions.6. The power to use the entire equipment so that the mind and brain functionsynchronously and the emotional nature is thereby subordinated, inhibited orcontrolled. This involves the steady growth of the power to use thought.7. Capacity to live a coordinated life so that the entire man functions and isguided by purpose (expressing the energy of will), by desire (expressing theenergy of the emotional or psychic nature), and by vitality which swings thephysical vehicle into line with purpose and desire.8. Power to influence, sway, guide and hold others within the range ofindividual purpose and desire.When this stage has been reached the three energies which constitute apersonality have been successfully fused and merged and the mechanism orinstrument of the indwelling self is a usable and valuable asset. The man is apotent personality and becomes the centre of a group; he finds himself to be afocal point for other lives, and is an influential magnetic individual, swayingothers, coordinating human units into groups, and organisms. He becomes the headof organizations and of parties, of religious and political bodies and ofnations in some cases. Thus do the dominant personalities come into being andfind themselves; they discover thus the distinction [395] between the centre ofpower, the self, and the equipment; they finally become conscious of vocation inthe true sense of the term.It should be noted that this sequential development is paralleled by an innergrowth of soul awareness, though the mode of expression of that inner growth islargely dependent upon the ray upon which the spiritual Entity is found.One point should be here noted and upon this point aspirants should exercisecare. The usual connotation of the words 'spiritual growth' is largely that ofreligious growth in understanding. A man is deemed spiritual if he is interestedin the world Scriptures, if he is a Church member and if he lives a saintlylife. But this is no true definition for it is not sufficiently comprehensive.It has grown out of the impress set upon human thought and terminologies by thePiscean Age, and through the influence of the sixth ray, and the work of theChristian Church—all most necessary and all inherent in the great plan, butwhich (divorced from their eternal context) lead to the over-emphasis of certaindivine expressions, and the overlooking of other as vital manifestations of thedivine consciousness.The true significance of the words ‘spiritual growth’ is far wider and moreinclusive than their manifestation through the medium of religious and mysticalliterature and organisations for the imparting of metaphysical truth. Power,purpose and will are divine qualities and expressions, and show themselves withequal clarity through a Mussolini or through a Pope. In both cases the mechanismof expression modifies and steps down the qualities and serves as a handicap. Apotent personality may function in any field of human expression and his workwill warrant the word spiritual just in so far as it is based on high idealism,the greatest good of the largest number, and self-sacrificing endeavour. [396]these three—idealism, group service and sacrifice—are characteristics of thosepersonalities who are becoming increasingly sensitive to the soul aspect, thequalities of that soul being knowledge, love and sacrifice.This is why the emphasis in all schools of true esotericism is laid on motive.People who are strongly individual and are developing a group consciousnessinevitably, in some life, find their way into esoteric schools and have to beguided in such a manner that the soul nature enfolds, overpowers and uses thepersonality.The outstanding characteristics of those personalities who are not as yetsoul-centered or controlled, are dominance, ambition, pride and a lack of loveto the whole, though they frequently possess love for those who are necessary tothem or to their comfort.You have therefore in the sequential development of humanity the followingstages:1. That of the animal consciousness.2. The emotionally polarised individual, selfish and governed by desire.3. The two above stages, plus a growing intellectual grasp of environingconditions.4. The stage of responsibility to family or friends.5. The stage of ambition and of longing for influence and power in some field ofhuman expression. This leads to fresh endeavor.6. The coordinating of the personality equipment under the above stimulus.7. The stage of influence, selfishly used and frequently destructive, becausethe higher issues are not registered as yet.8. The stage of a steadily growing group awareness. This is viewed:a. As a field of opportunityb. As a sphere of service. [397]c. As a place wherein sacrifice for the good of all becomes gloriously possible.This latter stage puts a man upon the path of discipleship, which includes,needless to say, that of the earlier phase, probation or testing.The problem consists in ascertaining upon which step of the ladder and in whichphase one finds oneself at any particular time. Behind each human beingstretches a long series of lives and some are now headed towards the stage ofdominant selfish personality expression and are making themselves individuals infull conscious awareness. This is, for them, as much a step forward as isdiscipleship for all of you. Others are already personalities and are beginningto experiment with the energy flowing through them and to gather aroundthemselves those people who vibrate to their note and for whom they definitelyhave a message. Hence the myriads of small groups all over the world, working inevery known field of human expression. Others have passed beyond that stage andare becoming decentralised from the personality expression in the three worldsof human life and are motivated by an energy which is the higher aspect of thepersonality energy. No longer do they work and plan and struggle to expresstheir personalities and to make their individual impact upon the world or togather magnetically around themselves a group of people who look up to them andthus feed the springs of their pride and ambition and who make them bothinfluential and important. They are beginning to see things in a newer and truerperspective. In the light of the Whole, the light of the little self fades out,just as the light that is inherent in every atom of the body is gatheredtogether and obliterated in the light of the soul when that blazes forth in allits glory.When this stage of selflessness, of service, of subordination [398] to the OneSelf, and of sacrifice to the group becomes the objective, a man has reached thepoint where he can be received into that group of world mystics and knowers andgroup workers which is the physical plane reflection of the planetary Hierarchy.THE NEW GROUP OF WORLD SERVERSWe have spoken often of the integrating group of knowers who are beginning tofunction upon the earth, gathered together in loose formation and held by theinner spiritual tie and not by any outer organisation. The planetary Hierarchyhas always existed and from time immemorial and right down the ages those sonsof men who have fitted themselves for work and who have measured up to therequirements, have found their way into the ranks of those who stand behind theworld evolution and guide the destinies of the little ones.Their grades and works are theoretically known, and names of some have beengiven out to the masses,—at what cost and personal sacrifice those masses willnever know. With the Hierarchy of adepts I do not propose to deal. The booksupon the subject are easily available and should be read with the neededreservations as to symbolical interpretations and the limiting effects of words.An event is however transpiring upon earth which is, in its way, as momentousand as important as that crisis in Atlantean times when the physical, vital andastral bodies were coordinated and formed a functioning unit. Then the 'yoga ofdevotion' or bhakti yoga was initiated for the training of the aspirants at thattime. A physical plane replica (as far as such a replica was then possible) wasorganised of those who could work devotedly and who could learn, through the useof ceremonial and pictures, some mode of activity which would carry on thehierarchical work on earth and thus constitute a training [399] school for thosewho later would be admitted into the ranks of the Hierarchy. The remnants ofthis Atlantean group remain with us in the modern Masonic movements, and thework of the Hierarchy was thus perpetuated in sign and symbol. There has thusbeen preserved in the consciousness of the race a pictorial representation of amomentous planetary condition which worked out in the human family in thisthreefold coordination. But it was primarily objective. Form and symbol, tooland furniture, temple and tone, office and externalities were the prominentfactors; they veiled the truth and therefore preserved the ‘outer and visibleform of an inner and spiritual’ reality. Only those were, in those days, allowedto participate in these mysteries and work who felt within themselves thelonging and desire for the mystical vision, and who loved deeply and weredevoted to the spiritual ideal. They were not required to possess activementalities, and their intellectual powers were practically nil. They liked andneeded authority: they learnt through ceremonial; they were devoted to the GreatOnes Whose names and forms stood behind the office holders in the esotericlodges. Mind entered not in. This must be remembered. There were nopersonalities.Today, in the world, another great moment of crisis has arrived. I refer not tothe present world condition, but to the state of the human consciousness. Mindhas arrived at a functioning power, personalities are coordinated. The threeaspects of man are being blended; another formation or precipitation from theHierarchy of adepts has become possible. On the physical plane, without anyexoteric organisation, ceremonials, or outer form, there isintegrating—silently, steadily and powerfully—a group of men and women who willsupersede eventually the previous hierarchical effort. They will supersede allchurches, all groups, and all organisations and will [400] eventually constitutethat oligarchy of elect souls who will govern and guide the world.They are being gathered out of every nation, but are gathered and chosen, not bythe watching Hierarchy or by any Master, but by the power of their response tothe spiritual opportunity, tide and note. They are emerging out of every groupand church and party, and will therefore be truly representative. This they do,not from the pull of their own ambition and prideful schemes, but through thevery selflessness of their service. They are finding their way to the top inevery department of human knowledge, not because of the clamour they make abouttheir own ideas, discoveries and theories, but because they are so inclusive intheir outlook and so wide in their interpretation of truth that they see thehand of God in all happenings, His imprint upon all forms and His note soundingforth through every channel of communication between the subjective reality andthe objective outer form. They are of all races; they speak all languages; theyembrace all religions, all sciences and all philosophies. Their characteristicsare synthesis, inclusiveness, intellectuality and fine mental development. Theyown to no creed, save the creed of Brotherhood, based on the one Life. Theyrecognise no authority, save that of their own souls, and no Master save thegroup they seek to serve, and humanity whom they deeply love. They have nobarriers set up around themselves, but are governed by a wide tolerance, and asane mentality and sense of proportion. They look with open eyes upon the worldof men and recognise those whom they can lift and to whom they can stand as theGreat Ones stand,—lifting, teaching and helping. They recognize their peers andequals, and know each other when they meet and stand shoulder to shoulder withtheir fellow workers in the work of salvaging humanity. It does not matter iftheir terminologies differ, their interpretations of symbols [401] andscriptures vary, or their words are few or many. They see their group members inall fields—political, scientific, religious, and economic—and give to them thesign of recognition and the hand of a brother. They recognise likewise Those whohave passed ahead of them upon the ladder of evolution and hail Them Teacher,and seek to learn from Them that which They are so eager to impart.This group is a product of the past and upon that past I will touch; I will alsoindicate the present situation and forecast somewhat the general lines alongwhich their association and future work will run. That such a group is formingis true and holds a good augury for the coming decades. In quiet and subtle waysthey are already making their presence felt but theirs is as yet primarily asubjective influence.Let us begin with the past. About the year 1400, the Hierarchy of Masters wasfaced with a difficult situation. As far as the work of the second ray wasconcerned (which had to do with the impartation of spiritual truth) there hadcome to be what I might call a complete exteriorisation of that truth. Theactivity of the first ray had also brought about an intense differentiation andcrystallisation among the nations and governments of the world. These twoconditions of concrete orthodoxy and political differences persisted for manygenerations and are still manifesting. Today we have a similar condition both inthe world of religion and in that of politics. This is true whether one isconsidering India or America, China or Germany, or whether one is studying thehistory of Buddhism with its many sects, Protestantism with its myriads ofwarring groups, or the many schools of philosophy in the orient or the occident.The condition is widespread, and the public consciousness tremendouslydiversified, but this state of affairs marks the summation [402] of the periodof separativeness and the end, before so many centuries, of this intensedistinctiveness of thought.After noting and watching this trend of affairs for another one hundred years,the Elder Brothers of the race called a conclave of all departments about theyear 1500 A.D. Their object was to determine how the urge to integration, whichis essentially the keynote of our universal order, could be hastened, and whatsteps could be taken to produce that synthesis and unification in the world ofthought which would make possible the manifestation of the purpose of the divineLife which had brought all into being. When the world of thought is unified,then the outer world will fall into a synthetic order. It should be rememberedhere that the Masters think in large terms and work in the wider cycles ofevolutionary endeavour. The tiny and temporary cycles, the small ebb and flow ofthe cosmic processes do not engage Their attention in the first instance.At this conclave They had three things to do:1. To view the divine plan on as large a scale as possible, and refresh Theirminds with the vision.2. To note what influences or energies were available for use in the largeendeavour to which They were pledged.3. To train the men and women who were then probationers, chelas and initiatesso that in due time They could have a satisfactory band of assistants on whomThey could in future centuries rely.They had, in connection with these aspirants, two problems:1. They had to deal with the failure on the part of even the most advanceddisciples to preserve continuity of consciousness, a failure even now manifestedby even initiates. [403]2. The Masters found the minds and brains of chelas curiously insensitive to thehigher contacts, and this again is a condition which still prevails. The chelas,then as now, possessed aspiration, a desire to serve humanity, devotion andoccasionally a fair mental equipment, but that telepathic sensitivity, thatinstinctive response to hierarchical vibration, and that freedom from the lowerpsychism which are the needed prerequisites to intensive intelligent work weresingularly lacking. For that matter, they are still distressingly so. Telepathicsensitivity is decidedly on the increase as a result of world conditions and theevolutionary trend, and this is (for the workers on the inner plane) a mostencouraging sign, but love of psychic phenomena and failure to differentiatebetween the vibrations of the various grades of hierarchical workers stillgreatly hinder the work.You might here ask and rightly so: What is this plan? When I speak of the plan Ido not mean such a general one as the plan of evolution or the plan for humanitywhich we call by the somewhat unmeaning term of soul unfoldment. These twoaspects of the scheme for our planet are taken for granted, and are but modes,processes and means to a specific end. The plan as at present sensed, and forwhich the Masters are steadily working, might be defined as follows:—It is theproduction of a subjective synthesis in humanity and of a telepathic interplaywhich will eventually annihilate time. It will make available to every man allpast achievements and knowledges, it will reveal to man the true significance ofhis mind and brain and make him the master of that equipment and will make himtherefore omnipresent and eventually open the door to omniscience. This nextdevelopment of the plan will produce in man an understanding [404] —intelligentand cooperative—of the divine purpose for which the One in Whom we live and moveand have our being has deemed it wise to submit to incarnation. Think not that Ican tell of the plan as it truly is. It is not possible for any man, below thegrade of initiate of the third degree, to glimpse it and far less understand it.The development of the mechanism whereby a disciple may be en rapport with Thoseresponsible for the working out of the plans, and the capacity to know (and notjust dimly sense) that tiny aspect of the whole which is the immediate stepahead and with which cooperation is possible, that can be achieved by alldisciples and should be held as the goal before all aspirants. With theexception of probationary disciples who are not as yet sufficiently stable intheir endeavour, all can therefore strive towards achieving continuity ofconsciousness and at awakening that inner light which, when seen andintelligently used, will serve to reveal other aspects of the Plan and speciallythat one to which the illumined knower can respond and usefully serve.To bring this about has been the objective of all training given during the past400 years, and from this fact you can vision the utter patience of the Knowersof the race. They work slowly and with deliberation, free from any sense ofspeed, towards Their objective, but—and herein lies the immediate interest ofwhat I have to communicate—They do have a time limit. This is based upon the Lawof Cycles. It concerns the operation of certain periods of opportunity whichnecessarily have their term. During these times of opportunity, forces,influences, and energies are temporarily at work, and of these the Masters seekto make use.Looking ahead, during the conclave to which I have made reference, the assembledServers of the race noted the future coming in of the Aquarian age, with itsdistinctive energies and its amazing opportunities. These [405] They noted andThey sought to prepare man for that period which would approximate 2500 years,and which could if duly utilised, bring about the unification, consciously andintelligently, of mankind, and so produce the manifestation of what I prefer tocall “scientific brotherhood” in contradistinction to the sentimentalconnotation of the term now so prevalent.It appeared to Them at that time that it would be necessary to do two thingsbefore the coming potencies of the Aquarian age could profitably be employed.First of all, humanity must have its consciousness elevated to the mental plane;it must be expanded so that it included not only the world of emotion and offeeling but also that of the intellect. The minds of men must be made widely andgenerally active, and the entire level of human intelligence must be raised. Itwas necessary, secondly, that something should be done to break down thebarriers of separateness, of isolation and of prejudice which were keeping menapart from each other and which They foresaw would increasingly do so. Cycle bycycle, men were becoming more and more wrapped up in their ownselves—satisfaction and exclusiveness, and racial pride. The result of thiswould lead inevitably to wide cleavages and the erection of world barriersbetween nation and nation, and between race and race.This determination of the members of the Hierarchy to train the minds of menmore rapidly and to build towards a more synthetic unity brought them to adecision which involved the formation of group units, and brought about theemergence of those groups of workers and thinkers who, through their activities,have so largely governed and moulded our world for the past three or fourcenturies. We have therefore, dating from this conclave, the inauguration ofdefinite and specific group work along clearly defined lines, with each groupstanding [406] for some peculiar presentation of truth and for some aspect ofthe knowledge of reality.These groups fall generally into four major divisions; cultural, political,religious, and scientific. In more modern times three other groups havedefinitely emerged; they are the philosophical, the psychological, and thefinancial groups. Philosophers have, of course, always been with us, but theyhave been for the most part isolated units who have founded schoolscharacterised by partisanship and separativeness. Now there are no outstandingfigures as in the past, but groups who represent certain ideas. It is ofprofound importance that the work of these seven groups of thinkers berecognised as part of the hierarchical programme, designed to produce a certainsituation, to bring about certain preparatory conditions, and as playing adefinite part in the work of world evolution as far as humanity is concerned.Under the influence of the different rays as they cycled in and out of activity,little groups of men emerged, played their part in group formation, anddisappeared, often unaware of their inherent synthesis and of their co-workers.As can be seen in any intelligent historical retrospect, the work that they didfor the race and their contribution to the pageant of the progress of mankindstands out with clarity. I have not the time to take this procession of groups,each custodian of a special contribution, and trace for you the work they did orthe subjective impulses under which they worked. I can but indicate the trend oftheir endeavour, and leave to some illumined student of history the delineationof the golden thread of their spiritual work as they raised the mental standardof the race and put man en rapport with the world in which he lived, opening hiseyes not only to the nature of matter and of form but also to the hidden depthsof his own being. Through their activities we [407] now have a humanity in closerelation, though not at-one, and a humanity characterised by three things:1. An amazing interrelation and intercommunication, of which the radio, thepress, modern transportation, and the telephone and telegraph are the servants.2. A wide-spread philanthropic enterprise, and the growth of the sense ofresponsibility for one’s brother, which was totally unknown in the year 1500.Movements such as the Red Cross, educational foundations, hospitals, and thepresent economic relief measures to be found in every country are its exotericmanifestations.3. A division of the entire human family, consciously or unconsciously, into twobasic groups: first, those who stand for the old order of things, who arereactionary, and separative. They represent separative nationalism, boundaries,servitude, and servile obedience; they exemplify religious sectarianism anddependence upon authority. They are against all modern innovations and progress.Secondly, those who vision a unified world wherein love of God means love ofone’s neighbour, and where the motives underlying all religious, political andeducational activities are characterised by a world consciousness and thewelfare of the entire body and not of the part.The unification to which the forward looking people aspire does not involve theneglect of any part, but it does involve the care and nurture of each part inorder that it may contribute to the well being of the entire organism. Itinvolves, for instance, the right government and proper development of everynational unit so that it can adequately perform its international duties, andthus form part of a world brotherhood of nations. [408] This concept does noteven involve the formation of a world state, but it does involve the developmentof a universal public consciousness which realises the unity of the whole, andthus produces the determination that each must be for all and all for each as ithas been said. Only in this way can there be brought about an internationalsynthesis which will be characterised by political and national unselfishness.This universal state of mind will not again inevitably involve the founding of aworld or universal religion. It requires simply the recognition that allformulations of truth and of relief are only partial in time and space, and aretemporarily suited to the temperaments and conditions of the age and race. Thosewho favour some particular approach to the truth will nevertheless achieve therealisation that other approaches and other modes of expression andterminologies, and other ways of defining deity can be equally correct and inthemselves constitute aspects of a truth which is greater and vaster than man’spresent equipment can grasp and express. Even the Great Ones Themselves butdimly sense reality and though They are aware of deeper underlying purposes thanare Their chelas, yet even They see not the ultimate goal. They too are forcedto use such unmeaning terms in Their teaching as Absolute Reality, and UltimateRealisation.Hence, during the past three centuries, group after group has appeared andplayed its part, and we today reap the benefit of their accomplishment. Underthe cultural group for instance we find emerging the poets of the Elizabethanage, and the musicians of Germany and of the Victorian era. Groups of artistsare likewise to be found, giving us the famous schools which are the glory ofEurope. Two famous groups, one cultural and the other political, also playedtheir parts, the one producing the Renaissance and the other bringing about theFrench Revolution. The effects of their work are still [409] to be felt, for themodern humanistic movement with its emphasis upon the past which is completed inthe present, and its search for the roots of man’s equipment in the earliertrends, harks back to the Renaissance. Revolution and the determination to fightfor the divine rights of man find their prime inaugurating influence and impetusin the revolution in France. Revolt, the formation of political parties, theclass warfare which is so rampant today and the splitting of every country intowarring political groups, though sporadic always, have become universal duringthe past two hundred years, and are all the results of the group activitystarted by the Masters. Men have grown thereby and have learnt how to think, andeven though they may think wrongly and may initiate disastrous experiments, theultimate good is inevitable and unavoidable. Temporary discomforts, passingdepressions, war and bloodshed, penury and vice may lead the unthinking into thedepths of pessimism. But those who know and who sense the inner guiding hand ofthe Hierarchy are aware that the heart of humanity is sound and that out of thepresent chaos and perhaps largely because of it, there will emerge thosecompetent to deal with the situation and adequate to the task of unification andsynthesis. This period has been occultly called the “age of restoration of whathas been broken by the fall”. The time has come when the separate parts can bereunited and the whole stand together again in its earlier perfection.The religious groups have likewise been many,—so many that their enumeration ishopeless. We have the groups of Catholic mystics who are the glory of theoccident, there are also the protesting Lutherans, Calvinists and Methodists,the Pilgrim Fathers—those sour and earnest men—the Huguenot and Moravianmartyrs, and the thousands of modern sects in every group. These have all servedtheir purpose and have led man to the [410] point of revolt and away fromacquiescence in authority. They have driven man to the stage of thinking forhimself by the force of their unique example. They stood for freedom and thepersonal right to know.These latter groups have acted largely under the influence of the sixth andsecond rays. The cultural emerged under that of the fourth ray, whilst the firstray has impelled the political activities which have brought such changes in thenations. Under the fifth and third ray impulses, groups of scientificinvestigators have arisen, working with the forces and energies that constitutethe divine Life, dealing with the outer garment of God, searching from withouttowards the within, and demonstrating to man his essential unity with allcreation and his relationship, intrinsic and vital, with all forms of life. Thenames of the individuals in any group are legion and of relatively noimportance. It is the group and its interrelated work that counts. It isinteresting to note that in the scientific group the underlying unity isparticularly noticeable, for its members are singularly free from sectarianismand selfish competition. This cannot be said of the religious and politicalgroups.In relation to the many nations and the myriads of men on earth, these mouldinggroups under the various divisions are few in number. Their personnel, theircontribution to the growth of human expression, and their place in the plan canquite easily be traced. The point to be emphasised is that these have all beenmotivated from the inner subjective side of life; they have come forth under adivine urge and with a specific work to accomplish; they have all been composedin the primary stage of disciples and initiates of the lesser degrees; they haveall been subjectively guided step by step by their own souls, which have, intheir turn, been cooperating consciously with the Hierarchy of Knowers. This has[411] been the case even when the individual man has been totally unawarehimself or his place in the group and that group’s divine mission. Let it beremembered also that there has not been a single failure, though again and againthe individual has not been cognisant of success. The mark of these workers isthat they build for posterity. That those who have followed them have failed,and that those who have responded to this work have not been true to the idealis disastrously true, but the initial group has uniformly achieved. This surelynegates pessimism and demonstrates the exceeding potency of the subjectiveactivity.The three groups to which I earlier referred require a word of comment. Theirwork is curiously different to that of the other groups and their ranks arerecruited from all the ray groups, though the members of the third group (thatof the financiers) are found primarily upon the seventh ray, that of ceremonialorganisation. In the order of their emergence, they are the groups ofphilosophers, psychologists and business men.The group of philosophers of more modern date are already powerfully mouldingthought, whilst the ancient schools of Asiatic philosophers are just beginningto influence western ideas. Through analysis, correlation and synthesis, thethought power of man is developed and the abstract mind can be unified with theconcrete. Through their work therefore that interesting sensitivity of man, withits three outstanding characteristics of instinct, intellect and intuition isbrought to a condition of intelligent coordination. Instinct relates man to theanimal world, intellect unites him to his fellow men, whilst the intuitionreveals to him the life of divinity. All these three are the subject matter ofphilosophical investigation, for the theme of the philosophers is the nature ofreality and the means of knowledge.The two most modern groups are the psychologists [412] who work under theDelphic injunction “Man, know thyself”, and the financiers who are thecustodians of the means whereby man can live upon the physical plane. These twogroups necessarily, and in spite of apparent divergences and differences aremore synthetic in their foundational aspects, than any of the others. One groupconcerns itself with mankind, with the varying types of humanity the mechanismemployed, and man’s urges, characteristics, and with the purpose—apparent orhidden—of his being. The other group controls and orders the means whereby heexists, controlling all that can be converted into energy and constituting adictatorship over all modes of intercourse, commerce and exchange. They controlthe multiplicity of form-objects which modern man regards as essential to hismode of life. Money, as I have before said, is only crystallised energy orvitality,—what the oriental student calls pranic energy. It is a concretisationof etheric force. It is therefore vital energy externalised, and this form ofenergy is under the direction of the financial group. They are the latest groupin point of date, and their work (it should be borne in mind) is most definitelyplanned by the Hierarchy. They are bringing about effects upon the earth whichare most far reaching.Now that centuries have elapsed since the conclave in the sixteenth century,these external groups have played their part and performed most notable service.The results achieved have reached a stage where they are internationallyeffective, and their influence is not confined to one nation or race. TheHierarchy is now faced with another situation which requires careful handling.They must gather up and weld together the various threads of influencing energyand the differing trends of thought power which the work of the groups since theyear 1500 has produced. They have also now to offset some of the effects whichare tending towards a further differentiation. [413] This must inevitably be sowhen force is brought into contact with the material world. Initial impulseshave in them potency both for good and for evil. As long as the form remains ofsecondary importance and relatively negligible, we call it good. Then the ideaand not its expression controls. As time elapses and the energy of the thoughtmakes its impact upon matter and lesser minds seize upon the particular type ofenergy or are vitalised by it, then evil begins to make its presence felt. Thisfinally demonstrates as selfishness, separateness, pride and thosecharacteristics which have produced so much harm in the world.About seventeen years ago the Masters met and came to a momentous decision. Justas it had been decided at the earlier conclave to gather out of the inchoatemasses of men, groups of workers along various lines, and set them the task ofelevating humanity and expanding the human consciousness, so now it was feltwise to gather out of the many groups, a group which should contain (as does theHierarchy itself) men of all races, of all types and tendencies. This group hasa specific mission, and some of the facts about it might be stated as follows:It is first of all an attempt at an externalisation of the Hierarchy upon thephysical plane, or a small working replica of this essentially subjective body.Its members are all in physical bodies but must work entirely subjectively, thusutilising the inner subjective apparatus and the intuition. It is to be composedof men and women of all nations and ages, but each one must be spirituallyoriented, all must be conscious servers, all must be mentally polarised andalert, and all must be inclusive.One of the essential conditions imposed upon the personnel of the group is thatthey must be willing to work without recognition, on the subjective levels. Theymust work behind the scenes as do the Great Ones. Its members [414] thereforemust be free from all taint of ambition, and from all pride of race and ofaccomplishment. They must be also sensitively aware of their fellowmen and oftheir thoughts and conditioning environment.It is a group that has no exoteric organisation of any kind, no headquarters, nopublicity, no group name. It is a band of obedient workers and servers of theWORD—obedient to their own souls and to group need. All true servers everywheretherefore belong to this group, whether their line of service is cultural,political, scientific, religious, philosophical, psychological or financial.They constitute part of the inner group of workers for humanity, and of theworld mystics, whether they know it or not. They will be thus recognised bytheir fellow group members when contacted in the casual ways of worldintercourse.This group gives to the word “spiritual” a wide significance; they believe it tomean an inclusive endeavour towards human betterment, uplift and understanding;they give it the connotation of tolerance, international synthetic communion,religious inclusiveness, and all trends of thought which concern the esotericdevelopment of the human being.It is a group therefore without a terminology or Bible of any kind; it has nocreed nor any dogmatic formulations of truth. The motivating impulse of each andall is love of God as it works out in love for one’s fellow man. They know thetrue meaning of brotherhood, without distinction of race. Their lives are livesof willing service, rendered with utter selflessness and without anyreservations.The personnel of the group is known only to the Elder Brothers of the race, andno register of names is kept, and there are only three main requirements:1. A certain amount of at-one-ment between the soul and its mechanism isessential, and that inner triplicity, [415] usually dormant in the majority, ofsoul-mind-brain must be in alignment and active.2. The brain has to be telepathically sensitive in two directions and at will.It must be aware of the world of souls and also of the world of men.3. There must also exist a capacity for abstract or synthetic thought. This willenable a man to leap over racial and religious barriers. When this is presentalso there is an assured belief in the continuity of life and its correlation tothe life after death.To sum up the situation, it must be noted that the groups in the past have stoodfor certain aspects of truth and have demonstrated certain ray characteristics.The new group will express all the aspects and have in it members on all therays. The majority of the workers in the many groups have carried forwardcertain details of the plan, and added their quota of energy to the forward urgeof humanity, but they have for the most part done this without any trueunderstanding of what they were accomplishing, and without any realcomprehension of that body-soul relationship which leads to really intelligentwork, unless we except a few prominent mystics such as Meister Eckhart. Theyhave been primarily groups of personalities, with that added touch of geniuswhich indicates a certain contact with the soul. The group that is now inprocess of formation is composed of those who are aware of the fact of the soul,and have established a soul intercourse that is real and lasting; they look uponthe mind, emotions and body nature as simply an equipment whereby human contactscan be established, and their work, as they see it, is to be carried forwardthrough the medium of this equipment, acting under the direction of the soul.They are therefore living souls, working through personalities, and notpersonalities actuated by occasional soul impulses. The members of the manygroups were all somewhat one-sided [416] and their talents ran along somespecific line. They demonstrated a capacity to write as Shakespeare, to paintlike a da Vinci, to produce musical masterpieces like a Beethoven, or to bringabout world changes like a Napoleon. But the new type of group worker is arounded out individual, with a capacity to do almost anything to which he setshis hand, but with a basic impulse to work on thought levels more than on thephysical plane. He is therefore of use to the Hierarchy as he can be used in avariety of ways, for his flexibility and experience, and his stability ofcontact can be all subordinated to the group requirements.The true exponent of this new group type will of course not appear for manydecades. He will be a true Aquarian with a universal touch, an intensesensitivity, a highly organised mental apparatus, an astral equipment which isprimarily responsive to the higher spiritual vibrations, a powerful andcontrolled energy body, and a sound physical body, though not robust in theordinary use of the term.What then is the present situation in connection with the integrating group ofmystics? Let me be somewhat explicit.In every European country, in the United States of America, and in parts of Asiaand South Africa are to be found certain disciples, usually unrecognised in theworld at large, who are thinking truth . Let me call your attention to thatphrase. The most important workers in this new group and those who are closestto the Great Ones are those whose daily thought life is oriented by the newideal. That this thought life of theirs may work out in definite esotericactivities may be true, but they are first of all and always those who live inand work from the “high and secret place”. Their influence is wielded silentlyand quietly and they lay no emphasis upon their personalities, upon their ownviews and ideas, [417] or upon their methods of carrying forward the work. Thesepossess a full realisation of their own limitations, but are not handicappedthereby, but proceed to think through into objective manifestation that aspectof the vision which it is their mission to vivify into form. They arenecessarily cultured and widely read, for in these difficult transitional timesthey have to cultivate a world grasp of conditions and possess a general idea ofwhat is going on in the different countries. They possess in truth nonationality in the sense that they regard their country and their politicalaffiliations as of paramount importance. They are equipped to organise, slowlyand steadily, that public opinion which will eventually divorce man fromreligious sectarianism, national exclusiveness, and racial biases.One by one, here and there they are being gathered out and are gathering to themthose who are free from the limitations of past political, religious andcultural theories. They, the members of the one group, are organising theseforward looking souls into groups which are destined to bring in the new era ofpeace and of good will. These latter who are being influenced by the groupmembers are as yet only a few thousands among the millions of men, and out ofthe four hundred accepted disciples working in the world at this time, onlyabout 156 are equipped by their thought activity to form part of this slowlyforming group. These constitute the nucleus of what will be some day a dominantforce. During the next twenty-five years their influence will become potentenough to attract political attention, provided those of you who have seen thevision of a powerful subjective body of thinking Souls can speak the neededwords, and outline those concepts which will hasten the work of integration, andput the units in this group in touch with one another. Do your utmost to seethat this is done and [418] make this the message and keynote of the work youall do wherever you are.What should therefore be the work of the immediate present? Let me outline theprogramme as far as I can.The first thing to be done is to strengthen the ties and establish firmly thelink between yourselves and all those whom you recognise as possible workingdisciples in the new group. To do this, acquaint yourselves with the work of theleaders of groups in the various countries of the world—such as Switzerland, theUnited States, Holland, Germany and Great Britain. From their reaction to thevision of this new age type of work you can then make a temporary decision.Watch them at their work. Note the emphasis laid by them upon personalities. Ifpersonal ambition seems to govern their activities, if their position is one ofa determination to work in the group of mystics because of its novelty orbecause it gives them a certain standing or because it intrigues theirimagination or gives them scope for gathering people around them, then proceedno further, but—preserving silence—leave time and the law to correct theirattitude.Secondly, be receptive towards those who seek you out and seem to vibrate to thesame note. When I say you, I mean the group to which you all subjectivelybelong. They will come if you work with decision and sound out the note of unityso clearly that they are in no doubt as to your motives and your disinterestedactivity. Some of the 156 who form the present nucleus will be known to you andwill work in unison with you, though maybe not in your peculiar field of action.The picture to be held before your eyes is that of a vast network of groups,working along the many possible lines, but having at their heart or behindthem—working silently and persistently influencing through soul contact—one ormore members of the new slowly emerging [419] group. These focal points throughwhich the Hierarchy is now seeking to work stand together telepathically andexoterically they must work in the completest understanding, preserving alwaysan attitude of non-interference, and leaving each worker free to teach his owngroup as he sees fit. The terms used, the methods employed, the types reached,the truths taught, the discipline of life demonstrated concern no one but theworking disciple.The members of this group of new age workers will, however, possess certaingeneral characteristics. They will impose no enforced dogmas of any kind, andwill lay no emphasis upon any doctrine or authorities. They are not interestedin having any personal authority nor do they rest back upon traditionalauthority, whether religious, scientific, cultural or any other form of imposedtruth. Modes of approach to reality will be recognised and each will be free tochoose his own. No discipline will be imposed by these workers upon those whoseek to cooperate with them. The ideas of any one person or leader as to how theunits in his particular sphere of activity should live and work, should meditateand eat, will be regarded as of no special value. The members of this new groupwork esoterically with souls, and deal not with the details of the personalitylives of the aspirants they seek to inspire.This is a basic rule and will serve to eliminate many worthy aspirants from thisgroup of world servers now in process of forming. The tendency to impose one’sown point of view indicates a lack of understanding and it will rule many out.Again, the young and promising aspirants must be sought out and carefullyinculcated with the trend of the new ideals. They must be taught to look for thedivine and the good in all—both people and circumstances. Breadth of vision mustbe developed and that [420] wide horizon pointed out which will enable theaspirants to live through this transitional period which is now with us, so thatwhen they reach middle life they will stand as pillars of strength in the newworld. Do not narrow them down to the ancient disciplines and teach them not tolay emphasis upon diet, celibacy, times and seasons, and so distract theirattention away from the newer and sacred art of being and the wonder of livingas a soul.Forget not that when a man is living as a soul and his entire personality istherefore subordinated to that soul, unselfish purpose, purity of life,conformity to law and the setting of a true example of spiritual living willnormally and automatically follow. Food, for instance, is frequently a matter ofclimatic expediency and of taste, and that food is desirable which keeps thephysical body in condition to serve the race. Again, a divine son of God cansurely function as freely and as effectively when in the married state as in thecelibate; he will however brook no prostitution of the powers of the body to thegrosser satisfactions, nor will he offend against established custom, nor lowerthe standard which the world has set for its highest and best. The issues havebeen confused and the emphasis has been too often laid upon the physical actsand not upon the life of the actor. When the attention is fixed upon the soul,the physical plane life will be rightly handled. It will be realised that thereis greater hindrance to the growth of the man in spiritual being through acritical attitude or a state of self satisfaction than by the eating of meat.Two rules of life activity must be taught the young aspirant:He must be taught to focus on constructive activity and to refrain from pullingdown the old order of living. He must be set to building for the future, and tothinking along the new lines. He must be warned not to waste time in attackingthat which is undesirable, but must instead [421] bend all his energies tocreating the new temple of the Lord through which the glory may be manifested.In this way public attention will gradually be focussed upon the new andbeautiful, and the old established creations will fall into decay for lack ofattention and so disappear.He must be taught also that partisanship is in no way a sign of spiritualdevelopment. He will not therefore use the words anti this or pro that. Suchterms automatically breed hatred and attack, and effort to resist change. Theyput the user on the defensive. Every class of human beings is a group ofbrothers. Catholics, Jews, Gentiles, occidentals and orientals are all the sonsof God.As regards the future of this world group of which we have been speaking muchdepends upon two things.First, it is necessary for all those isolated disciples working in every countryin the world, to become aware of one another and then to enter into telepathicrapport. This may seem to you to be a wonderful but impractical vision. I assureyou that this is not so. The work of establishing this rapport may indeed beslow, but it is an inevitable effect of the growing sensitivity of all the soulswho are working in the field of the world. The first indication of it is thatinstinctive recognition of those who constitute part of this group when theymeet and contact each other in the ways of world intercourse. There comes tothem an immediate flashing forth of the light, an instantaneous electricalinterplay, a sudden sensing of a similarity of vision and of objective, or avital opportunity to aid in and to cooperate with each other in the work inwhich it is realized that all are interested.Working disciples everywhere when they meet each other will know at once thattheir work is identical, and will advise with each other as to where cooperationand [422] supplementary endeavour may be possible. In about thirty years theinterrelation between the units in this group (scattered as they may be all overthe world) will be so close that daily they will meet each other at a set timeand in the secret place. This only becomes possible when the triplicity ofsoul-mind-brain are all aligned in the individual and when each aspect of it canbe simultaneously in touch with members of the group. At present all the soulsof the group of mystics do work in unison; a number have succeeded in bringingthe soul and the mind also into a close and established relation, but as yet thelowest aspect of this aligned and linking triangle, the physical brain, remainstotally unresponsive to the waves of force emanating from the higher aspects ofthe disciples engaged thus in laying the foundations of the new agecivilisation.It is therefore largely a matter of perfecting the mechanism of the brain sothat it can rightly register and correctly transmit the soul impressions and thegroup purposes and recognitions. This involves:1. The awakening into conscious activity of the centre between the eyebrows,called by the oriental student, the ajna centre.2. The subordinating then of the activity of this centre to that of the headcentre, so that the two vibrate in unison. This produces the establishment ofthree things:a. Direct conscious alignment between soul-mind-brain.b. The appearance of a magnetic field which embraces both the head centres andso definitely affects the pineal gland and the pituitary body.c. The recognition of this field of dual activity in two ways: as of a light inthe head, an interior radiant sun, or as a dynamic centre of energy [423]through which the will or purpose aspect of the soul can make itself felt.3. The development of a facility which will enable a man to:a. Use the mind in any direction he chooses, turning it externally towards theworld of phenomena, or internally towards the world of spiritual being.b. Produce consciously and at will a corresponding responsiveness in thephysical brain, so that it can register accurately any information coming fromthe physical world, and the emotional or astral world.c. Discriminate intelligently between all these spheres of sentient activity.This will all be eventually covered by a new psychological approach which willemerge out of the old and be a blend of the mechanical schools, theintrospective and the more purely oriental position, plus the conclusions of twonew schools which will shortly arise but which are as yet too small to warrant aname. They are in the embryo stage. One school will deal with the energy aspectsof the individual and his responsiveness to the energy of the universe in whichhe is immersed; the other will consider man as a unit of electricity. Both willbe quite one-sided but the contributions of the various schools will some day beunified into one synthetic presentation.The second requirement which will establish relation between the workingdisciples in this group is the capacity to preserve a constant and sequentialrecollection of both the inner and the outer life. We call it continuity ofconsciousness, and by this we mean the power to be fully aware of all happeningsin all spheres and departments of man’s being during the entire twenty-fourhours of the day. As yet this is far from being the [424] case. There is no realawareness of existence during the hours of sleep. The dream life as related isas full of illusion as any of the more definitely lower psychic experiences. Theslowly growing interest in dreams from the standpoint of psychology and theinvestigation of their probable source are the first weak attempts towardsestablishing the awareness on a really scientific basis. There is as yet noconscious registering of mental activity during such times, for instance, aswhen the emotional body holds the centre of the stage. With what is the mindoccupied during a long period of emotional upset? It has, we know, its own lifeand its laws. Again, what are the activities of the soul when the personality isoccupied exclusively with its own affairs? Is it impossible for you to vision atime when the development of consciousness will have reached the stage wherethere will be a sentient reaction in all the departments of man’s nature and allof it recorded by the brain? Already men are aware both of physical planeactivity and emotional aliveness simultaneously. That is for the majority acommon and ordinary condition. Where two activities can be registered at once,why not three or even four? Such is the future ahead for the race, and thedisciples, actively employed, will be the first to express and demonstrate thisextended consciousness.Thus telepathic interplay and extended sentiency must be developed and areclosely interlinked with each other.I have therefore pointed out the immediate future development of the individualdisciple. What lies ahead in the immediate future for the group?First of all, a preliminary period of emergence into the public consciousness,and thus of making its presence felt. This will be done through the steadycommunication of the new ideals and the constant emphasis laid upon theessential oneness of all humanity. It will [425] be the result of the uniformityand inclusiveness of the note sounded by one here and another there. During thisstage there must be no hurried work and no precipitate action of any kind. Thegrowth of the group and of its ideas will be slow and sure. The group existsalready. It has not to be formed and organised, and there is therefore for noneof you the assuming of any sense of responsibility nor the organising of anyactivity desired to lure these disciples, who have chosen thus to worksubjectively, into publicity. Such are not the methods approved by the ElderBrothers of the race, nor is it the way that They Themselves work.Know each of you for yourselves whether you stand for the new position, the newattitude towards work, and for the subjective method. Decide once and for allwhether you prefer to work in the old exoteric ambitious manner, building andvitalising an organisation, and so producing all the mechanism which goes withsuch a method of work. Remember that such groups are still greatly needed andare useful. It is not yet the new age and the little ones must not be leftexposed to the new forces, nor turned out bereft of the nursery to which theynaturally belong.Should the new mode of work appeal to you, see to it that the personality issubordinated, that the life of meditation is kept paramount in importance, thatsensitivity to the subjective realm is cultivated, and any necessary outeractivities are handled from within outwards. Avoid a purely mysticalintrospection or its opposite extreme, an over-emphasised organising spirit,remembering that a life of truly occult meditation must inevitably produce outerhappenings, but that these objective results are produced by an inner growth andnot by an outer activity. An ancient Scripture teaches this truth in thefollowing terms: [426]“When the sun progresses into the mansion of the serving man, the way of lifetakes the place of the way of work. Then the tree of life grows until itsbranches shelter all the sons of men. The building of the Temple and thecarrying of the stones cease. The growing trees are seen; the buildingsdisappear. Let the sun pass into its appointed place, and in this day andgeneration attend ye to the roots of growth.”Little groups will spring up here and there whose members respond to the newnote and whose growth into the world group will be watched over by one or moreworking disciples. But these latter do not organise the groups; they grow as aman in this place and another in that place awakens to the new vision or comesinto incarnation in order to take his place in the work and bring in the newera. These groups will demonstrate no sense of separateness; they will beunaware of personal or of group ambition; they will recognise their unity withall that exists, and will stand before the world as examples of pure living,constructive building, creative activity subordinated to the general purpose,beauty and inclusiveness. Perhaps in the early stages of integration, the wordsfriendliness and cooperativeness best describe them. They are not interested indogmas or doctrines and have no shibboleths. Their outstanding characteristicwill be an individual and group freedom from a critical spirit. Thisnon-criticism will not grow out of an inability to see error, or failure tomeasure up to an idea; falsity, impurity and weakness will be recognised forwhat they are, but when noted will only serve to evoke a loving helpfulness.Little by little these groups will come to know each other and to meet with oneanother at set times and places. They will come to these mutual conferences withno desire to impress one another and with no thought of relative numericalstrength; they will demonstrate no ambition to increase their ranks. How shouldthey when [427] they know themselves all to be members of the one world Group?They have no teaching to give of a doctrinal nature and will not seek todemonstrate learning. They will meet solely to discuss modes of worldhelpfulness, the formation of a platform so universal and composed of such basictruths that it can be presented under all the varying methods and utilise themany terminologies. They will endeavour to employ each other’s terms, and tofamiliarise themselves with each other’s approach to reality and symbology.Little by little also the special contribution and note of each group will berecognised and where a need exists for just that special approach and theparticular note or method of interpretation in any part of the world, there willbe an immediate and united impulse to facilitate the work that that specialgroup could do in that place.These groups, with the one subjective group of conscious living souls behindthem, will be too busy with world service and interests to waste time ontrifling non-essentials. They will not have the time to play around with groupnames and insignia and badges and the technicalities of fraternities when theymeet together. World needs, world opportunities, and the rapid development ofthe consciousness of mankind and the initiation of humanity into the spiritualrealities will so engross their attention that they will have no interest inpurely physical plane arrangements, nor in laying the emphasis upon their ownpersonal growth. They will be well aware that response to world need in serviceand the life of focussed meditation will promote their growth. Their eyes arenot upon themselves, upon their own good characters, or upon their individualaccomplishments.Later as a result of their telepathic relationship and their united conferences,there may emerge certain esoteric groups and schools for development in ordermore rapidly to equip them for world service. In these schools [428] modes ofmeditation, the intensification of vibration and the laws of the universe willbe taught, and the right use of colour and of sound. But all will besubordinated to the idea of service and the uplift of humanity. Also the schoolsreferred to in Letters on Occult Meditation will gradually come into being.But what use is it for me to forecast the future in more explicit terms and holdout a picture of an intriguing quality when at the present time the integrationof the group of world mystics and its close welding is not an accomplished fact?World unity, brotherhood in its true sense, the growth of telepathic interplay,the elimination of the non-essentials which serve to separate the thoughts ofmen and bring about separateness on the physical plane, and the laying of a trueemphasis upon the fundamentals of the Ageless Wisdom, the manifestation of atrue understanding, the bringing about of at-one-ment with the soul, therecognition of those who belong to the group of world Saviours—this is theimmediate work to be done and this must engross your attention.This and this alone warrants the expenditure of all that any of you have togive—love and life, time and money.This and this alone justifies your existence and calls forth from all of you whorespond to the vision that utter self-sacrifice which is so rare and sofar-reaching in its effects. The casting of all that one has at the feet of theLord of Life in order that the work of world salvage may go forward, theelimination out of one’s life of all that can possibly hinder, the giving of allthat one has until it hurts to give, the ruling of one’s life on the basis ofsurrender, asking oneself all the time: What can I relinquish in order that Imay help more adequately?—that and more than that lies ahead of all of you whohear the call and respond to the need and opportunity. [429]Let me tell you this—this group now in process of forming, will in time developits own “yoga” and school of training which will gradually supersede that of theraja yoga and bhakti yoga schools. The method of training will only be given tothose who have trained the mind and learnt to control the emotions. Hence thekey to what is now going on. The mode of training will be no easy short cut tothe goal. Only the intelligent can attain it and only coordinated personalitieswill be eligible to the teaching. The keynote of the new yoga will be synthesis;its objective will be conscious development of the intuitive faculty. Thisdevelopment will fall into two categories: first, the development of theintuition and of true spiritual perception, and secondly, the trainedutilisation of the mind as an interpreting agent.In the book Agni Yoga, some of the teaching to be given has filtered through butonly from the angle of the will aspect. No book has as yet made its appearancewhich gives in any form whatsoever the “yoga of synthesis”. We have had “bhaktiyoga” or union through devotion. Raja Yoga is now receiving emphasis, which isunion through the mind. It sounds like a redundancy to speak of union throughsynthesis, but it is not so. It is union through identification with thewhole—not union through realisation or through vision. Mark well thisdistinction, for it holds the secret of the next step for the personalities ofthe race. The Bhagavad Gita gives us primarily the key to the yoga of devotion.Patanjali teaches us the yoga of the mind. In the Gospel story we have theportrayal of realisation, but the key or the secret of identification is stillwithheld. It lies in the custody of a few in this integrating group of mysticsand knowers and will be wrought out into manifestation in the furnace of theirindividual experience and thus given to the world. But the time is not yet. Thegroup must grow in strength and knowledge and in intuitive perception. [430]You ask me: What keeps a man from becoming a member of such a group? I tell youwith emphasis that four things only keep a man from affiliation.First: an uncoordinated personality. This involves necessarily an untrained mindand a feeble intellect.Second: a sense of separateness, of distinction, and of being set apart ordifferent from one’s fellow men.Third: the possession of a creed. No matter how good a formula of beliefs it maybe, it inevitably produces exclusiveness. It bars some out.Fourth: pride and ambition.You ask again: How shall one qualify? The rules are simple, and are three innumber. First, learn to practice harmlessness; then desire nothing for theseparated self, and thirdly look for the sign of divinity in all. Three simplerules, but very hard to accomplish.Behind this group of mystics, which includes thinkers in every department ofhuman thought (let me reiterate the word thinkers) and of human knowledge standsthe Hierarchy of Masters and in between these two groups stand also a band ofteachers, of whom I am one. These act as intermediaries and as transmitters ofenergy. May I repeat and beg you to attend, that this group which is slowlyforming is gathered out of every imaginable group of thinking and intelligentmen. As yet, and this may surprise a few, there are not very many occultists(so-called) among them. This is due to the fact that the occultists arenumerically few in relation to the masses of humanity, and also to theirtendency to be sectarian, exclusive and self-righteous. Selfless humanitarianworkers are there; political leaders and economists and scientific workers inthe world’s laboratories are also there; churchmen and religious adherents fromall the [431] world religions are there and the practical mystics and a fewoccultists. The true occultist is rare.The group is and will be kept entirely subjective. Its members are linkedtelepathically, or they recognise each other through the quality of the workthey are doing in the outer world and the inclusiveness of the note they sound.It is inspired from above by the souls of its members and the Great Ones, and isenergised into activity by the need of humanity itself. It is composed of livingconscious souls, working through coordinated personalities. Its symbol is agolden triangle enclosing an even-armed cross with one diamond at the apex ofthe triangle. This symbol is never reproduced in form at all. It shines abovethe heads of all who are in the group and cannot be seen by anyone (not even aclairvoyant) except a group member, and then only if—for purposes of work—hisrecognition needs stimulation. The motto of the group is The Glory Of The One.More I may not tell you now, but this will give you some idea of the reality ofthe work that is going on. It may serve as an incentive to fresh effort on thepart of all working to equip themselves for selfless service.We are to take up now a very brief consideration of two types of energy of amajor kind, which are, in themselves, composed and blended of coordinatingenergies. The subject matter is therefore of so advanced a nature that it isuseless for the aspirant to give much time to its study. Volumes would benecessitated likewise if all that could be said were written, and it will onlybe possible in this book to outline some broad generalisations, and to indicatecertain facts of interest. The main reason that it profits us not to study theseenergies too closely is because the planetary Spirit or Logos and the planetaryEntity are the two forms in active manifestation which respond most forcibly tothe impact of these energies. The human being responds, and that onlysubconsciously, [432] because (in his form nature) he constitutes a part of theplanetary expression.The planetary Spirit is a Being Who, ages ago, passed through the state ofconsciousness which we call the human state and has left it far behind. He(using the personal pronoun simple for the sake of terminological clarity) hasan origin which lies outside the solar system altogether; his life is focussedin the planet; his consciousness lies in realms beyond the concept of thehighest adept in our planetary Hierarchy. The planetary Entity is the sum totalof the forms which constitute the form through which the planetary Spirit ismanifesting, and therefore is the synthesis of the planetary physical, astraland mental elementals. For the purposes of our consideration, this Entity is thesum total of all physical, mental, astral and mental forms, which, blended andfused, constitute our planet. Each is the embodiment of energy, and these twomajor streams which produce the form and the consciousness aspects of ourplanetary existence make their impact on the human being. The life of theplanetary Spirit makes its impact via the soul; and the life of the planetaryEntity is registered through the medium of the personality mechanism.The duality of these energies is primarily astral-buddhic, and the bias of thelife forces and the general trend of the impulses influencing humanity in thisgreat cycle are the attractive energy of the intuitional nature of the planetaryLogos, and the potent force of the astral (desire) body. In other words, theastral elemental, which embodies the desire nature of the planetary Logos isexceedingly potent, particularly in this present cycle, but the strength of thespiritual and intuitional nature of the One in Whom we live and move and haveour being is steadily increasing. On the one hand, you have the devastatingexpression of the wild hunt for pleasure, of sex and of the crime incident tothe satisfying of desire. [433] This characterises our present civilisation andis now at its height; it may be said that it is even on the decline, little asyou may sense it. At the same time, there is found the open door of initiation.Both these opportunities (if I might so term them) are found simultaneouslypresent, but the strength of the one is weakening, and the trend towards theother is growing. Thus the way out can be seen.In the above paragraph, the dominant planetary urges present in evolution aresummed up and man’s reaction to them noted.Solar energies have also a dual effect. First, there is what we might call thepranic effect, which is the result of the impact of solar force, emanating fromthe physical sun. This produces definite results upon the objective forms, andthese are termed physical or vital. These enter the human body via the spleenand also via a centre found between the shoulder blades; this centre is betweenthe throat centre and the heart centre in the spinal column, but nearer theheart than the throat. Secondly, there are energies which emanate from what isesoterically called “the heart of the sun”; these sweep through one or other ofthe planets in seven great streams and pour into the soul of man and producethat sensitivity which we call awareness. These seven types of energy producethe seven types of souls or rays, and in this thought you find the secret ofsoul unity. During manifestation, owing to the seven types of energy impacts,playing upon the matter of space, one finds the seven types of soul, the sevenfields of expression, and the seven grades of consciousness and of raycharacteristics. These differentiations as you well know are like the colouringthat the prism takes when subjected to the rays of the sun, or to the tracery ofpattern found in reflection upon a limpid pool. [434]ASTROLOGY AND THE ENERGIESTo these two energies, a third group of energies must be added, and these arethe basis of much of our astrological research. They emanate from the twelveconstellations which form our solar zodiac. Their effect is infinite and thepermutations of these three groups of energies lead to the infinite complicationwhich we find in nature. The claims of the astrologers as to the reality of theenergies playing upon the human organism can be seen to be true; their claims asto their capacity to interpret are for the most part unfounded. So little isreally known by the highest intelligence on the planet; for, forget not, thatthe adepts utilise primarily the intuition. These energies leave their mark uponevery form in every kingdom in nature, acting as a retrograding or a stimulatingforce. They carry one type of energy on to a fuller expression of the quality ofany form, or hold another back from a developed manifestation.It is not opportune here to outline the nature of true astrology. That astrologyis a science, and a coming science, is true. That astrology in its highestaspect and its true interpretation will enable man eventually to focus hisunderstanding and to function rightly is equally true. That in the revelationsthat astrology will make in time to come will be found the secret of the truecoordination between soul and form is also correct. But that astrology is notyet to be found. Too much is overlooked and too little known to make astrologythe exact science that many claim it is. The claim will be fulfilled at somefuture date, but the time is not yet.Certain factors which astrologers should bear in mind, and certain conditionsthey are only too apt to forget, may however be briefly noted. For the sake ofclear understanding we will simply tabulate a number of statements which shouldbe studied with care by the [435] average investigator in this field. I cannothere write a treatise on the energies with which astrology should deal, sorelyas such a treatise is needed.Astrologers concern themselves primarily with three types of energy:a. The energy of the constellation in which the Sun is posited at the time ofbirth.b. The rising sign to which the man should respond.c. The moon which governs his form aspect, and particularly the physical form.The energy of the particular constellation or sign in which a man is born ismore deeply significant than has ever yet been suggested. It embodies orindicates his present problem, sets the pace or tempo of his life, and isrelated to the quality of his personality. It governs, if I may so express it,the rajasic or activity aspect of his life during incarnation.The ascendant or rising sign indicates the line along which his energy as awhole can flow if he is to fulfill the purpose of any incarnation. This, ofcourse, if rightly handled. It holds the secret of his future, and in itssymbolism and understanding he can find the clue to his life problem and anindication of what he can be and achieve. It presents to him the type of forcewhich will enable him to succeed. This, when duly consummated, might be regardedas producing the sattvic, or harmony aspect of his life, for when it plays itspart and is utilised, it produces harmony with the will of the soul during anyparticular incarnation.In the moon influence, we have indicated the native’s past . It summarises thelimitations and handicaps under which he must work, and therefore might beregarded as embodying the tamasic aspect of matter, or that which “holds back”and which—if permitted to influence unduly—will produce inertia. In the bodywith which man [436] is equipped lies hid the secret of past experience, andevery lunar form through which we have to arrive at due expression is in itselfthe product or synthesis of all the past. Let me see if I can put the presenttruth about astrology in such simple guise that they who know naught of thisintricate science may understand.The birth month indicates the day of opportunity. The door stands open. Theparticular month in which a soul comes into incarnation is indicated to thatsoul by the month in which it passed out of incarnation in a previous lifecycle. If it, for instance, died in the month governed by the sign Leo, it willreturn into incarnation in the same sign, picking up the thread of experiencewhere it left it, and starting with the same type of energy and the peculiarequipment with which it passed away from earth life, plus the gain of thoughtand conscious onlooking. The quality of the energy and the nature of the forcesto be manipulated during life are indicated to the soul in this way.The rising sign, embodying another type of energy, should wax in strength duringthe incarnation, for it indicates the nature of the soul force that theincarnated son of God is seeking to wield through the medium of a particularpersonality, possessing certain characteristics.The influence of the moon is primarily physical. The prison of the soul is thusindicated. The handicaps to be met are thus secured; the type of body or ofbodies through which the force of the native’s sign and the quality of theenergy which will bring him to his goal are thus defined. Through the medium ofthe lunar lords and what they have given him as the result of past experiencedown the ages must he express himself upon the physical plane.Owing to the precession of the equinoxes, a situation is brought about in whicha fourth type of force makes itself felt. The sun is, in reality, many degrees[437] away in the great round of the heavens from where it is stated to be, asfar as the greater zodiac is concerned. This is, of course, from the standpointof time. As the sweep of the sun through a constellation covers a period ofapproximately two thousand two hundred years, the shift in the course of thecenturies is very slight, so slight that little difference would be noted in thecasting of the planetary horoscope. In the casting of the horoscope of a solarsystem it would be of vital importance, but this is so far beyond the capacityof the wisest astrologer on our planet that discussion is immaterial.In casting the horoscope of a human being who is born in a particular month,however, it should be borne in mind (which it seldom is) that now the month andthe sign do not coincide at all. The sun is really not in Leo, for instance,during the month of August. The correct interpretation therefore of a chart islargely psychometrical and dependent upon the thought-form of the constellationwhich has been built up for ages by the astrologers. Energy follows thought. Forthousands of years certain types of energy and their consequent qualifyingeffects on substance and form have been considered to be thus and so. Therefore,thus they are, except in the case of the highly evolved, of the true aspirantwho has oriented himself, and is thus escaping from the wheel of existence andbeginning to govern his stars, and so is no longer under their rule anddomination.Astrology now deals primarily with the personality for whom the horoscope may becast and with the events of the personality life. When, through meditation andservice, plus the discipline of the lunar bodies, a man comes consciously anddefinitely under his soul ray, then he comes as definitely under the influenceof one or other of the seven solar systems, as they focus their energy throughone or other of the constellations and [438] subsequently one or other of theseven sacred planets. Eventually, there will be twelve sacred planets,corresponding to the twelve constellations, but the time is not yet. Our solarsystem, as you know, is one of seven. When a man has arrived at this point inevolution, birth months, mundane astrology, and the influences which play uponthe form aspect become of less and less importance. This circle of solar systemsaffects paramountly the soul and it becomes the focal point of spiritualenergies. This is the problem of the soul on its own plane,—responsiveness tothese types of energy, and, of them, the personality is totally unaware.The signs which fall therefore into the four categories of earth, water, fireand air, concern primarily the man who lives below the diaphragm, and whoutilises the lower four centres:—the centre at the base of the spine, the sacralcentre, the solar plexus and the spleen. The inner group of seven major orsystemic energies produce their effect upon the man who is living above thediaphragm, and work through the seven representative centres in the head. Fourof them focus through the throat centre, the heart centre, the ajna and headcentres. Three are held latent in the region of the head centres (the thousandpetalled lotus) and only enter into functioning activity after the thirdinitiation. It will be evident therefore how complicated from the standpoint ofthe horoscope (as well as of the individual problem) is this meeting of theenergies of two types of constellations in the case of the man who is neitherpurely human nor purely spiritual. The ordinary horoscope is negated. Thehoroscope is not possible as yet of delineation. The only horoscope, which isbasically and almost infallibly correct is that of the entirely low grade humanbeing who lives entirely below the diaphragm and is governed by his animalnature alone.Astrologers must remember also that there are several [439] undiscovered planetswhich are producing pulls and shifts and focussing streams of energy upon ourearth which tend to complicate the problem still further. Pluto is one of them,and having now emerged into manifestation (or rather into recognition) to itwill be assigned all the unexplained conditions. Pluto will be made thescapegoat for faulty astrology for a long time to come. This chart failed towork and be true because Pluto must be influential in it and we know littleabout Pluto. So the story will run. Yet Pluto has always been revolving aroundour sun and producing its effects. It governs however the death or cessation ofold ideas and emotions, and its influence is therefore largely cerebral and inthat you have the clue to its late discovery. Mankind is only on the verge ofbecoming mental. Its effects are felt first in the mental body. The names of theplanets are not the result of arbitrary choice but the planets name themselves.Astrologers will eventually find it necessary to cast three horoscopes or threecharts:—one purely physical dealing with the body of nature; one primarilyemotional, and dealing with the quality of the personality and with itssensitivity, or state of awareness; the third will be the chart of the mentalimpulses and conditions. It will be found that these three charts will takecertain geometrical lines, the lines of energies will form patterns. These threecharts, superimposed one upon the other, will give the personality diagram, theindividual life pattern. Amazing symbolic charts and lineal forms will be foundto emerge when this is done, and the “geometry of the individual” will grow outof this, for it will be found that each line will function in relation toanother line, and the trends of the life energies will become apparent.Eventually, even in this department of knowledge, “the star will shine forth”This will constitute a new branch of psychology and its true exponent for [440]our age will duly be found. I but indicate the lines of the future astrology inorder to safeguard the present.One thing astrologers need at this time to do and that is to make due allowancefor this transition period out of Pisces into Aquarius. This is seldom done, butit is evident that the tremendous turmoil incident to these transitions affectsthe individual chart, and frequently offsets individual destiny or karma. Peopleare submerged in planetary and racial destinies, and their own tiny affairs areoffset almost entirely and sometimes completely negated. It is not possible tocast the horoscope of the planet, and those who propose to do so are deceivingthemselves and others. The horoscope of the fourth kingdom in nature, ofhumanity, will eventually be cast, but it will be done by initiates, and thereare no initiate astrologers working on the physical plane at this time. One hinthere I give.The Sun was in Sagittarius when the first human tendencies struggled to thefore. The stage of animal man was completed and when Sagittarius was dominant(from our planetary standpoint—I am using words with care) the great event ofindividualisation took place. But the brain of the then human being failed toregister what had happened. In the words of the Old Commentary:“The sons of God shot forth like arrows from the bow. The forms received theimpulse and lo! a God was born. The tiny babe knew not the great event.”This took place twenty-one million years ago. Cycles passed and when at a laterdate the sun was in Leo (approximately eighteen million years ago) the firstinstances of coordination between brain and mind took place and the human beingwas definitely self-conscious. He registered his individuality. The figures forthe first [441] date (though exactness is not possible in a system of mutationsuch as ours) are 21,688,345 years ago. These figures are useless at this timefor they can neither be proved correct nor incorrect. Later investigation willprove their usefulness, when the nature of time is better understood.Sagittarius governs human evolution, for it symbolises progress towards aconscious goal. Leo governs the human consciousness in the human kingdom for theenergy pouring through it enables man to say “I am”.It might be of value if I here attempted a translation necessarily inadequate,of the key word of each sign. These fall into two categories as far as humanityis concerned. There is the key word for the form aspect and the keyword for thesoul aspect. In the first case, the word is expressed; in the second it isconsciously spoken by the soul. Translated into modern terms much is lost, butthe underlying thought which directs the work of the emanating energies is ofvalue. For our world period they are as follows:For the aspirant who progresses from Aries to Pisces and has thereforere-oriented himself we have:Aries......I come forth, and from the plane of mind I rule.Taurus......I see, and when the eye is opened, all is illumined.Gemini......I recognise my other self and in the waning of that self I grow andglow.Cancer......I build a lighted house and therein dwell.Leo......I am That and That am I.Virgo.......I am the Mother and the Child, I God, I matter am.Libra......I choose the Way that leads between the two great lines of force.[442]Scorpio.......Warrior I am, and from the battle I emerge triumphant.Sagittarius......I see the goal. I reach the goal and see another.Capricorn......Lost am I in light supernal and on that light I turn my back.Aquarius......Water of life am I, poured forth for thirsty men.Pisces......I leave the Father’s home and turning back, I save.From the standpoint of the form, the life proceeds in a reverse direction, andthe work of nature is seen under the following words:Pisces.......And the Word said: Go forth into matter.Aquarius......And the Word said: Let desire in form be ruler.Capricorn......And the Word said: Let ambition rule and the door stand wide.Sagittarius......And the Word said: Let food be sought.Scorpio......And the Word said: Let Maya flourish and deception rule.Libra......And the Word said: Let choice be made.Virgo......And the Word said: Let matter reign.Leo......And the Word said: Let other forms exist, I rule.Cancer......And the Word said: Let isolation be the rule and yet the crowdexists.Gemini......And the Word said: Let instability do its work.Taurus......And the Word said: Let struggle be undismayed. [443]Aries......And the Word said: Let form again be sought.It will be noted that all these ideas concern the work of energy in some form oranother and in the last grouping with the work of the so-called unregenerateselfish individual, full of desire for satisfaction. The group of mantric wordsused by the aspirant in the power of his own soul, are positive.It seems needless to deal further with the various types of force and we shallnow turn our attention to Rule XI."},{"pageContent":"RULE ELEVENThree things the worker with the law must now accomplish. First, ascertain theformula which will confine the lives within the ensphering wall; next, pronouncethe words which will tell them what to do and where to carry that which has beenmade; and finally, utter forth the mystic phrase which will save him from theirwork.ANALYSIS OF THE THREE SENTENCES[447] This rule is, as you know, the last of those governing work on the astralplane and the magical task of motivating those thought-forms which are to be theexpression of some type of energy. We have considered the various energies withwhich men work and the power a man can wield through building thought-forms. Wehave seen also how a man can manipulate the various grades of matter until theembodied idea has clothed itself with mental matter and with astral matter. Itis therefore a vital entity, on the verge of materialising upon the physicalplane. Nothing, it should be noted, can now stop its emergence into objectivityexcept the expressed act of the will of its creator, for the form, beingvitalised by that creator, is subject always to his will, until he has severedhis connection with it by the utterance of the “mystic phrase”. We will assumethat emergence into effective existence is the decision and that the creativework is carried forward.It will here be noted that this work is either conscious or unconscious. In theunconscious building of thought-forms such as is the case with the average humanbeing, many never produce the desired physical plane effects, and fail in theirintended purpose. As long however, as man is animated by selfishness and byhatred, this is a beneficent thing. Fortunately for the human race, few peopleas yet work in mental matter. Most of them work with astral or desire matter andthese forms are fluidic and changeable, and are powerful only through thefaculty of persistence. There is an occult basis for [448] the statement that ifone desires a thing for a sufficiently long period of time one will possess it.Such is the law governing the return to incarnation of the average human being.Lacking the one-pointedness of the mental plane matter as it is influenced by aconcentrated mind, these desire forms fail to do the damage they otherwisemight. Their effect is felt largely by the creator of these kama-manasic formsand not by his environing associates. The moment that the mind factor enters inand becomes dominant, that moment a man becomes dangerous or useful as the casemay be—dangerous not only to himself but to those around him, or useful in theworking out of the plan of evolution. He can then create thought-forms, capableof producing outward manifesting results and tangible effects. Given aspiration,however, and spiritual impulse, a man can become a true occultist, and produceorganised results, and functioning organisms upon the physical plane. I use theword “organism” deliberately, for it will serve to convey the idea that anythought-form is regarded by us as a subjective and existing entity, clothed insubtle matter, and capable of manifestation. This is called popularly sometimes“the working out of an idea”, or the “carrying through of a project”; it istermed at other times a “discovery”, or an “ invention”, or something of thatnature. All the time, quite unrealising it, man is talking in occult terms andevidencing an inner appreciation of the methods whereby all that has beenthought (by God or man) comes into existence.The embodied idea or thought (the former being potentially far more potent thanthe latter) has worked its way through to the verge of physical manifestation.Its creator who, in the case of a “white magician” is not an emotionally centredperson, is consciously bringing it to the stage when its inner purpose and plancan be demonstrated. He holds the thought-form in his consciousness [449] andgives it shape and energy through the power of his own one-pointed mental focus.We are told in the rule under consideration that the aspirant has three thingsto do:1. Ascertain the formula which will crystallise the form he has built, much inthe same way that we find architects and bridge builders reducing the desiredform to a mathematical formula.2. Pronounce certain words which will give the form vitality and so carry itforth on to the physical plane.3. Utter the phrase which will detach the thought-form from his aura and so savethe drain upon his energies.It will be noted that the formula has relation to the thought-form, the words ofpower to the objective for which the form has been constructed, and the mysticphrase concerns the severing of the magnetic link which binds together thecreator and his creation. One therefore concerns the form, another the soulembodied in the form (whose lowest characteristic is desire, the reflection oflove) and the last the life aspect with which the creator has endowed thecreation. We are consequently face to face again with the eternal triplicitiesof spirit, soul and body. It should be remembered that the Rules for Magic, asunderstood by the true esotericist, are as true of a created universe, solarsystem or planet as they are true of the tiny thought creations of a chela oraspirant.The first reaction of the average student on reading the above is to thinkimmediately of the body nature as it expresses some type of energy. Thus dualityis the thing noted and that which employs the thing is present in his mind. Yetone of the main necessities before occult aspirants at this time is to endeavourto think in [450] terms of the one Reality which is Energy itself and nothingelse. Therefore it is of value to emphasize in our discussions of this abstrusesubject the fact that spirit and energy are synonymous terms and areinterchangeable. Only in the realisation of this can we arrive at thereconciliation of science and religion and at a true understanding of the worldof active phenomena by which we are surrounded and in which we move.The terms organic and inorganic are largely responsible for much of theconfusion, and the sharp differentiation existing in the minds of many peoplebetween body and spirit, between life and form, have led to a refusal to admitthe essential identity in nature of these two. The world in which we live isregarded by the majority as really solid and tangible, yet possessing somemysterious power lying concealed within it which produces movement, activity andchange. This is of course putting it crudely but it suffices to sum up theunintelligent attitude.The orthodox scientist is largely occupied with structures, relationships, withthe composition of form and with the activity produced by the component formparts and their interrelations and dependencies. The chemicals and elements andthe functions and parts they play, and their mutual interactions as they composeall forms in all the kingdoms of nature are the subject of their investigation.The nature of the atom, of the molecule and the cell, their functions, thequalities of their force manifestations and the varying types of activity, thesolving of the problem as to the character and nature of the energies—focalisedor localised in the differing forms of the natural or material world—demand theconsideration of the ablest minds in the world of thought. Yet thequestions—What is Life? What is Energy? or What is the process of Becoming andthe nature of Being? remain unanswered. The problem as to the why and the [451]wherefore is regarded as fruitless and speculative, almost insoluble.Nevertheless, to the pure reason and through the correct functioning of theintuition, these problems can be solved and these questions answered. Theirsolution is one of the ordinary revelations and attainments of initiation. Theonly true biologists are the initiates of the mysteries, for they have anunderstanding of life and its purpose and are so identified with the lifeprinciple that they think and speak in terms of energy and its effects, and alltheir activities, in connection with the work of the planetary Hierarchy, arebased on a few fundamental formulas which concern life as it makes itself feltthrough its three differentiations or aspects:—energy, force, matter.It should be noted here that only as a man understands himself can he arrive atan understanding of that which is the sum total that we call God. This is atruism and an occult platitude, but when acted upon leads to a revelation whichmakes the present “Unknown God” a recognised Reality. Let me illustrate:Man knows himself to be a living being and calls death that mysterious processwherein that something, which he commonly designates as the breath of life, iswithdrawn. On its withdrawal, the form disintegrates. The cohesive vitalisingforce is gone, and this produces that falling apart into its essential elementsof that which has hitherto been regarded as the body.This life principle, this basic essential of being and this mysterious elusivefactor is the correspondence in man of that which we call spirit or life in themacrocosm. Just as the life in man holds together, animates, vitalises anddrives into activity the form and so makes of him a living being, so the life ofGod—as the Christian calls it—performs the same purpose in the universe andproduces [452] that coherent, living, vital ensemble which we call a solarsystem.This life principle in man manifests in a triple manner:1. As the directional will, purpose, basic incentive. This is the dynamic energywhich sets the being functioning, brings him into existence, sets the term ofhis life, carries him through the years, long or short, and abstracts itself atthe close of his life cycle. This is the spirit in man, manifesting as the willto live, to be, to act, to pursue, to evolve. In its lowest aspect this worksthrough the mental body or nature, and in connection with the dense physicalmakes itself felt through the brain.2. As the coherent force. It is that significant essential quality which makeseach man different, which produces that complex manifestation of moods, desires,qualities, complexes, inhibitions, feelings and characteristics which produce aman’s peculiar psychology. This is the result of the interplay between thespirit or energy aspect, and the matter or body nature. This is the distinctivesubjective man, his colouring, or individual note; this it is which sets therate of vibratory activity of his body, produces his particular type of form, isresponsible for the condition and nature of his organs, his glands, and hisouter aspect. This is the soul and—in its lowest aspect—it works through theemotional or astral nature and in connection with the dense physical, throughthe heart.3. As the activity of the atoms and cells of which the physical body iscomposed. It is the sum total of those little lives of which the human organs,comprising the entire man are composed. These have a life of their own and aconsciousness which is strictly individual and identified. This aspect of thelife principle works through [453] the etheric or vital body and in connectionwith the solid mechanism of the tangible form through the spleen.It is not, of course, possible to give the mantric words and phrases which arementioned in Rule XI. They would be profoundly incomprehensible to all but theinitiate, and therefore need not engross our attention. It should be noted thatmuch in these Instructions is in advance of modern thought and both theseInstructions and the Treatise on Cosmic Fire will only be fully understoodtowards the end of this century.Let us consider this rule sentence by sentence, and arrive at that one of theinterpretations which is the easiest for the average aspirant. All these rulescan be read from the standpoint of intelligent man, and will mean but little;they can be read from the standpoint of the aspirant, and will then conveycertain practical ideas which are susceptible of daily application and can bewrought out in the crucible of life experience. They will achieve meaning as theaspirant learns to handle energies, to work in mental matter and to cooperatecreatively with the Purpose underlying the evolutionary plan. From the angle ofvision of the disciple, these Rules carry certain potent instructions and willlead him to an understanding of the process of the creative work in nature,which is necessarily sealed to the mind of the aspirant. As to the comprehensionof the initiate, these words convey definite commands which only his illuminedintuition can rightly interpret. With the higher grades of intelligences we neednot concern ourselves. We will consider this Rule therefore solely from theangle of vision of the average aspirant, leaving other interpretations to thoseindividuals who have the internal equipment which will enable them tounderstand.I. Ascertain the formula which will confine the lives within the enspheringwall.All forms in nature, as we well know, are made up of [454] myriads of tinylives, holding a certain measure of awareness, of rhythm, and of coherencyaccording to the force of the Law of Attraction, utilized by the builder of theform. This is true both of the Macrocosm and of the infinite world ofmicrocosmic lives, which are contained within the greater whole. Embryo solarsystems, coming into being under the impulse of divine thought, are at firstfluidic and nebulous, are shifting in outline and are held together loosely bythe central nucleus of energy—another way of expressing the embodied idea. Astime progresses, they pass on to other conditions, they take more definite form,they enter into peculiar relations with allied and neighbouring forms, andadjust themselves to varying relations of an internal nature with those forms,which in the earlier stage was not possible. Eventually we find a solar systemsuch as ours and myriads of others—a solar system functioning as a sun with itsrevolving and rotating planets, preserving their differing orbits, holding theirstated and relative positions, active as independent and inter-dependentorganisms, and yet presenting, to the eye of the astronomer, a coherence, aunity and a structure that is unique in each case and yet which functions undercosmic law. It measures up to some vast purpose, conceived and held steadily inthe Universal Mind, which is in its turn an aspect of that group-conscious andself-conscious entity who is the author of its being and the creator of itsform.This one intelligent Life may be posited as creating in his meditation (or its,if you prefer, for what do words matter when all is futile to express reality asit is!) and consequently in his reflective mind, that which we call athought-form. This thought-form has four main characteristics:1. It is brought into being through the conscious use of the Law of Attraction.[455]2. It is formed of an infinite number of living entities who are attracted bythe mind of the divine Creator and thus enter into relation with each other.3. The form is the externalization of something that its Creator has:a. Visualized.b. Built intelligently and “coloured” or “qualified”, so as to meet the purposefor which it was intended.c. Vitalized by the potency of his desire and the strength of his livingthought.d. Held in shape as long as it is needed in order to perform its specific work.e. Connected to himself by a magnetic thread—the thread of his living purposeand the strength of his dominant will.4. This interior purpose, which has clothed itself in mental, astral and vitalsubstance, is potent on the physical plane just as long as:a. It remains consciously in its Creator’s thought.b. It “keeps its distance” occultly from its Creator. Many thought-forms remainfutile as they are “too close” to their Creator.c. It can be directed in any desired direction, and under the law of leastresistance, can find its own place, thus performing its desired function andcarrying out the purpose for which it was created.The “formula” therefore might be regarded as the idea emanating from the divineThinker; it might be defined as the dynamic purpose, the \"thing\" as the Thinkersees it and externalizes it in his mind, and visualizes it as the carrier of hisintent. The mathematics which underlie the construction of a bridge, such as anyof the great spans which signalize human achievement, convey [456] naught to theuninitiated, but to those who know and understand, they are the bridge itself,reduced to its essential terms. They are the bridge in latency, and in thesemathematical formulas lie hid the purpose, the quality and the form of thecompleted structure and its eventual usefulness. So it is with the concepts andthe ideas which give birth to a thought-form. These occult formulas exist on thearchetypal plane which (for the aspirant) is the plane of the intuition, thoughin reality it is a state of consciousness far higher still. These formulasunderlie a world of forms and must be contacted by those who are duly equippedto work under the Great Architect of the Universe. There are, symbolicallyspeaking, three great books of formulas. Note the words “symbolically speaking”,and forget them not. There is first the Book of Life, read and eventuallymastered by initiates of all degrees. There is the Book of Divine Wisdom, readby aspirants of all degrees, sometimes called the Book of Knowing Experience,and there is the Book of Forms which is compulsory reading for all in whom theintelligence is awakening to functioning activity. It is with the Book of Formsthat we are now concerned.Patanjali speaks in one place of the “rain-cloud of knowable things” of whichthe soul is consciously aware. The aspirant, weary of the eternal round of hisown futile and unimportant thoughts, seeks to tap the resources of this “raincloud” and so precipitate upon the earth some of the thoughts of God. He seeksto work so that he can further the manifestation of the ideas of the Creator. Todo this he has to fulfill certain initial requirements, which might be brieflystated as follows:1. Know the true meaning of meditation.2. Align with facility the soul, the mind and the brain.3. Contemplate, or function as the soul on its own plane. It then becomespossible for the soul to act [457] as the intermediary between the plane ofdivine ideas and the mental plane. You see how this matter of participation inthe divine creative process works out as the objective of all true meditationwork?4. Register the idea, received by the soul intuitively, and recognize the formwhich it should take. These last seven words are of vital importance.5. Reduce the vague and misty idea to its essentials, discarding all vainimaginings and the formulations of the lower mind, so equipping oneself to leapreadily into activity, and, through steadfastness in contemplation, receiveaccurately the vision of the inner structure, or of the subjective skeleton, ifI may so term it, of the form which is to be.6. This, as recorded consciously by the soul upon the mind, is as consciouslyregistered by the mind, held steady in the light, and might be regarded as thereduction of the formula to the blue print. It is not the formula itself, butthe secondary process. According to the strength, the simplicity and the clarityof the embodiment of the formula in a simple outlined structure, so will be thefinally furnished building and the consequent form, which will confine withinthe periphery of the outer form itself the lives used in its construction.This, in reality, resembles the stage of conception. Latent within the germ (theresult of male-female interrelation) lie all the potencies and capacities of thefinished product. Latent within the idea which has been materially conceived,but which has been inspired by the Spirit aspect, lie hid the potencies of thefinished thoughtforms. The matter aspect, represented by the mind, has beenfecundated by the Spirit aspect, and the triplicity [458] will eventually becompleted by the created form. But in the early stages there is as yet only the“formula”—the conceived idea, the latent yet dynamic concept. It is potentenough to draw to itself the essentials for growth and form, yet who shall saywhether it will prove an abortion, a mediocre and feeble product, or a creationof real beauty and value?Every externalized idea is, therefore, possessed of form, animated by desire,and created by the power of the mind. The desire plane is the one upon which themind imposes its conceptions in order to produce the “idea incarnate”, to clothethe idea in form. It is therefore the gestation ground. The mind previously hasbeen the recipient of the archetypal idea, as grasped and visualized by thesoul. In its turn the soul is the recipient of the formula as presented to it inthe world of ideas. You have thus the “presented-idea”, the “perceived-idea” andthe “formulated-idea”, and the idea working out into manifestation.It is well to bear in mind that the following factors govern the emergence ofthe idea out of the Universal Mind into the world of tangible forms. These are:1. The energies emanating from the archetypal plane. This plane is the focus ofthe attention of the highest group of Intelligences on our planet. Theirconsciousness can respond and be inclusive to this sphere of activity whereonthe Mind of God expresses itself, free from the limitations of what weunderstand as form. They are the custodians of the formula; they are themathematicians who prepare the blue prints of the great Plan; they calculate theeffects of the forces with which the work is carried forward, and the energieswhich must be manipulated; they allow for the strains and stresses to which theforms must be subjected under the impact of the life force, they deal with thecyclic impulses to which the evolutionary process must respond; they concern[459] themselves with the relation between the form aspect and the life urge.2. The intuitional state of awareness. On this level of consciousness, we findthe Masters of the Wisdom carrying on Their work, and it is in this sphere ofinfluence that They work with the greatest ease and facility, as much so as doesnormally intelligent man work on the physical plane. Their minds are constantlyin touch with the archetypal minds, who are the custodians of the formulas, andThey—taking the blue prints (I speak again in symbolic fashion), deal with thespecifications, look for those suitable for the control of the work, andassemble the needed personnel. Among Their disciples They search until They findthe one most suited to be the focal point of information on the physical plane,or the group most eligible to carry into manifestation the desired part of thePlan. They work with those so chosen, impressing upon their minds that eternaltriplicity of idea-quality-form until the details begin to emerge, and the workof what is literally a “precipitation” can go forward.3. The activity of the mental state of consciousness. It is on the mental planethat much of this work is necessarily done, and here is reason sufficient forthe development, on the part of the aspirant, of a trained intellect. The “raincloud of knowable things” precipitates first of all on the mental plane, and afurther precipitation goes forward when disciples and aspirants are therecipients. These latter, in their turn, seek to impress and guide the lesserworkers and aspirants, who, karmically or by choice, lie within their radius ofinfluence. Thus the “idea” presented is seized upon by many minds and theformula aspect of the great work has played its part.It will be seen how this work is consequently and essentially group work, and istherefore only truly possible for those who have somewhat mastered themeditation [460] process, and can “hold the mind steady in the light”. Thislight in reality streams forth from the Universal Mind and is of varying kindsand was (esoterically speaking) generated in a previous solar system and must beused and developed in this one.In the words “the light of the intuition” we have conveyed to our minds thattype of energy which embodies the purpose, the will of God, the Plan, as weregard it. In the words “the light of the soul”, we have an expression whichsums up the purpose, the plan, the will of those entities, who, incarnated inhuman form, and at times functioning out of the body, have the responsibility ofmaterializing the divine concepts in the four kingdoms in nature. The humankingdom is, par excellence, the medium of expression for the Universal Mind, andwhen the sons of God in human form are perfected, the problems of the naturalworld will be solved in a large measure. The fully conscious sons of God, awareof themselves whilst in the human form (and they are few as yet), constituteliterally the brain of the planetary life.There is a truly occult significance to the words “to throw the light” upon aproblem, a condition, or a situation. In its essential meaning it connotes therevelation of the presented idea, of the principle which underlies the outermanifestation. It is the recognition of the inner and spiritual reality whichproduces the outer and visible form. This is the keynote of all work insymbolism. The work of ascertaining the formulas, of drawing up the subjectivecharts or plans of intuitive impression and of intense activity on the mentalplane is the sole work of the organized planetary hierarchy. The second phase ofthe work is carried on by those workers, who, co-operating consciously with thehierarchy, demonstrate the reality of that work in the three worlds of humanevolution. They bring the germ of the idea, and the embryonic concept into outerand completed existence, [461] through the process of right thought, theawakening of desire, and the nurturing of right public opinion. They thus bringabout the needed physical activity.Aspirants, group leaders and thinkers in all parts of the globe can be availablefor this work, provided their minds are open and focussed. According to thesimplicity of their approach to truth, according to the clarity of theirthought, according to their group influence and state of inclusive awareness,and according also to their power for long sustained effort will be theapproximation of the outer form to the inner idea and the spiritual subjectivereality.The point I seek to make is that the average reader of these Instructions hasnothing to do with the formulas. They are grasped and understood by the greatKnowers Who stand back of the evolutionary process and are responsible for itsfunctional activity. The hierarchy of Masters, of the senior initiates, anddisciples is proceeding steadily with that work but is dependent, under the Law,upon those on the physical plane who are to produce the outer forms. If theyfail to respond, there will be delay or incorrect building; if they makemistakes, there will be lost time and energy, and again delay; if they loseinterest and cease to work, or are primarily interested in their own affairs andpersonalities, the Plan will have to wait, and energy which would otherwise bemade available for the solving of human problems and the guidance of humanitywill have to find its outlet in other directions. There is never anything staticin the creative process; energy which is flowing forth in the pulsation of theone Life, and its rhythmic and cyclic activity—never ending and neverresting—must be somewhere utilized, and must find its way in some direction,often (when man fails in his duty) with catastrophic results. The problem ofcataclysms, the cause, for instance, of the steadily increasing insect peril,will be [462] found to be related to the inflow of unused and unrecognizedenergy which is capable of right direction and right purpose and for thefurthering of the Plan, if the aspirants and disciples of the world willshoulder their group responsibilities, submerge their personalities, and achievetrue realization. Humanity must be more diligent and more intelligent in theworking out of its true destiny and karmic obligations. When men are universallyen rapport with the custodians of the plan and their minds and brains areillumined by the light of the intuition, of the soul and of the universal mind,when they can train themselves to respond intelligently to the timely impulseswhich cyclically emanate from the inner side of life, then there will be asteady adjustment between life and form and a rapid amelioration of worldconditions. It is an interesting point to bear in mind that the first effect ofthe response of the more advanced of the sons of men to the formulas astranslated and transmitted by the Knowers will be the establishing of rightrelations between the four kingdoms in nature, and right relations between unitsand groups in the human family. A step in this direction is being made.Relations between the four spheres of activity which we call human, animal,vegetable and mineral are now badly adjusted because the energy of matter isprimarily the governing factor. In the human kingdom, the working of this energydemonstrates in what we call selfishness. In the animal kingdom, it demonstratesin what we call cruelty, though, where the sense of responsibility isnonexistent and only instinctual and temporary parental responsibility is found,there is no criticism to be given. In the vegetable kingdom this maladjustmentexpresses itself during this planetary period of misuse as disease.This surprises you? Disease has its roots primarily in maladjustments andmisdirected force in the vegetable kingdom; this affects the animal and mineralkingdoms [463] and subsequently the human. It is too far ahead for this to bedemonstrated, but when this condition is understood, it will be in that kingdomin nature that the attention of the investigators must be focussed, and theeradication of disease will eventually find its solution.II. Pronounce the words which will tell them what to do and where to carry thatwhich has been made.Let us remember in connection with this Rule that it is only potent in so far asthe “worker with the Law” is en rapport with the inner reality within himself,with the soul. It is essential that through him, in full waking consciousness,the soul should be functioning. It is the soul who pronounces the words. It isthe soul who utters forth the mystic phrase, but it is the soul as controller orruler of the mechanism, of the form-apparatus. This control is only possiblewhere there is alignment of the brain and mind and soul. Again, it is necessaryto remember that this Rule, being an expression of the creative work, applies toall creative process, whether macrocosmic or microcosmic, whether we are dealingwith God as the creator of the solar system, with the soul as the creator of thehuman mechanism, or with the man as he attempts to master the technique of themagical work and so become a creator of forms in his own little sphere. All haveto work out the true significance of the Rule, for God works under the law ofHis Being, and this Law demonstrates to us as the laws of nature.The ideas of ordered activity and of a conscious and purposeful goal are boundup in the phrase we are considering. The builder of any form is first of all acontroller of lives and the arbiter of the destinies of certain entities. Inthis thought we have light thrown upon the subject of free will and upon the Lawof Cause and Effect. It must not be forgotten however that the mystery of causeslies hid in past universes—all, in their day, the “forms indwelt by God”. For usthere can be no such [464] thing as pure cause, but only the working out ofmajor effects. Just as for us such a reality as pure reason is totallyincomprehensible and unattainable, so with pure cause. These factors antedateour solar system and therefore speculation about them remains unrewarded, exceptin so far as it tends to develop the mental apparatus. This solar system is asystem of effects, which in their turn generate causes. Only in the human familyand only among those human beings who are consciously using mind power are anycauses of any kind being generated. All causes, being initiated by a mind ofsome kind, functioning consciously and thinking clearly, posit a Thinker, andthis is profoundly the position of the occult sciences. Our solar system is athought-form but one having real existence just as long as thought persists. Allthat is forms part of the current of ideas emanating from the divine Thinker.All thoughts are part of a divine stream. The mass of people think not, and sodo not generate causes that must in due time produce their effect.You ask, where then the truth of the statement made in many occult modern booksthat the trend of life or cycle of lives indicates necessarily the future, andthat the causes initiated in one life work out as effects in another? Wherelives are predominantly emotional and are physically oriented, it is not aparticular life that sets the pace but the group of lives, simultaneouslyinteracting with each other, predisposes the future along certain lines. This iseternally true of all human beings at a certain level of conscious developmentwhere they are swayed by mass ideas, moulded unthinkingly by tradition andpublic opinion, are frankly immersed in selfish interests, and are not “takinghold” of conditions themselves but are being carried forward on the tide ofevolution. It is a form of group activity (groups governed by the vibration ofphysical and astral forms) which produces the [465] characteristics andtendencies which cause the situation and environing circumstances. In thisrealization lies hid the secret of racial and national karma and conditions. Inthese groups, the ordinary feeling, active man is immersed, and out of thisimmersion he must find his way by discovering and using his mind. Instinct mustgive place to intellect. For cycles of lives, groups of souls incarnate throughthe pull of the material forms towards which they are attracted. Theseattractive energies have earlier been utilized by the soul—finally beingdiscarded and disintegrated. It is the potency of form which in the first casedraws the soul into incarnation, for in the first half of the evolutionaryprocess matter—highly organized in a previous solar system—is the dominantfactor. Later, we know, spirit mounts on the shoulder of matter. The massinterplay of spirit and matter is now so potent that one of the majorexperiences that a soul undergoes is the achieving of the stage wherein the pullof matter begins to wane and the soul learns to detach itself. This is theexperience through which humanity is now passing—again a group activity on ahigher turn of the spiral.Large generalizations are indeed safer than the detailed and oft erroneousinformation anent the rules governing the taking and relinquishing of form,found in much of our puerile literature, but e’en these generalizations shouldbe regarded with much distrust. All that can be posited is that, under the Lawof Cause and Effect, spirit and matter coalesced and the worlds were made.Governed by the same law, forms were created and became material expressions ofthe life urge. They were swept in and out of manifestation according to arhythmic cyclic beat, initiated in still earlier solar systems, than the oneimmediately preceding ours. Groups of forms appeared and disappeared, and weregoverned [466] almost entirely by their group coherence and vibration. So thelife progressed through the elemental or involutionary kingdoms, through thethree lower kingdoms in nature and on into the human kingdom.In the lower human stages and in the stage of animal man, the same groupactivity reigns, only (as in the involutionary kingdoms) becoming smaller andsmaller groups as the individual units achieve—one by one—the status of trulyself-conscious individuals, and begin to work as souls. Then they not onlybecome creators, with the power of standing alone, with the faculty of clearthinking and accurate visualization, but demonstrate also that they are thepossessors of the creative art or faculty of creative imagination. They passthrough life after life of self-sufficiency in which the personality isdeveloped and used; then they begin to find their subjective group which willeventually take the place of the outer material groups in their consciousness.Thus they regain again group existence, only this time in full awareness andcontrol.In the group with which they find themselves subjectively affiliated, will befound those who have worked with them in the earlier mass state, so that theywork in close association with those who have been nearest to them and who havebeen linked with them in the great life cycle.There are certain names given to these stages in the occult archives which aresuggestive and illuminating; they are of course symbolic. It might be ofinterest if I gave some of these ancient cryptic utterances which convey threeitems of information, namely, the name of the stage, its esoteric colour, andits symbol. I would like to point out, however, that these intriguing pieces ofinformation which I at times convey and which some of the students seem toregard as of vital importance are of [467] far less importance than theinjunction to live kindly, speak words of gentleness and of wisdom, and practiceself-forgetfulness. The occult data is read and noted, the familiar instructionsare skipped and overlooked. We, who work with aspirants, smile oft at thefoolishness and lack of judgment evinced by those we teach. Say to a student:Practice with steadfastness the law of loving-kindness, and he will say thatindeed he will attempt to do, but within himself the very familiarity of theinjunction palls and is deemed, at best, a needed platitude. Say to the student:I will give you some occult phrases or some items of information anent the GreatOnes, and with keenness, with excitement, and with smug self-satisfaction andwith a pleased curiosity, he prepares for the important revelation. Yet theearlier injunction is the conveyer of occult information and indicates a lawwhich—if rightly followed—leads to release and liberation. The latter concernsphenomena and the knowledge of it leads not the weary pilgrim to the gates ofheaven. Some of you need this reminder.Those stages which precede the human are omitted as none who will read thesewords possess the equipment to comprehend their inner sense. We will begintherefore with the stages in the human kingdom.Stage IThe life has climbed the stairway long through daily use of form. Through thelesser three, with progress slow, the long path has been travelled. Another doorstands open now. The words sound forth: “Enter upon the way of real desire.”The life, that only knows itself as form, enshrouds itself in vivid red, the redof known desire, and through the red all longed-for forms approach, are graspedand held, used and discarded, until the red changes to rose [468] and rose topalest pink, and pink to white. Forth flowers then the pure white rose of life.The tiny rose of living life is seen in bud; not yet the full blown flower.Stage IIThe picture changes form. Another voice, coming from close at hand uttersanother phrase. The life continues on its way. “Enter the field where childrenplay and join their game.” Awakened to the game of life, the soul passes thegate.The field is green and on its broad expanse the many forms of the one movingLife disport themselves; they weave the dance of life, the many patterned formsGod takes. The soul enters “the playground of the Lord” and plays thereon untilhe sees the star with five bright points, and says: “My Star.”The star is but a point of light, not yet a radiant sun.Stage IIIThe way of red desire fails. It loses its allure. The playground of the sons ofGod no longer holds appeal. The voice which has twice sounded from out the worldof form sounds now within the heart. The challenge comes: “Prove thine ownworth. Take to thyself the orange ball of thy one-pointed purpose.” Responsiveto the sounded word, the living soul, immersed in form, emerges from the manyforms and hews its onward way. The way of the destroyer comes, the builder andagain the tearer down of forms. The broken forms hold not the power to satisfy.The soul’s own form is now the great desire, and thus there comes the enteringof the playground of the mind.But in these dreams and fantasies, at times a vision comes—a vision of a foldedlotus flower, close petalled, [469] tightly sealed, lacking aroma yet, butbathed in cold blue light.Orange and blue in some more distant time will blended be, but far off yet thedate. Their blending bathes the bud in light and causes future opening. Let thelight shine.Stage IVInto the dark the life proceeds. A different voice seems to sound forth. “Enterthe cave and find your own; walk in the dark and on your head carry a lightedlamp.” The cave is dark and lonely; cold is it and a place of many sounds andvoices. The voice of the many sons of God, left playing on the playground of theLord, make their appeal for light. The cave is long and narrow. The air is fullof fog. The sound of running water meets the rushing sound of wind, and frequentroll of thunder.Far off, dim and most vaguely seen, appears an oval opening, its color blue.Stretched athwart this space of blue, a rosy cross is seen, and at the centre ofthe cross, where four arms meet, a rose. Upon the upper limb, a vibrant diamondshines, within a star five-pointed.The living soul drives forward towards the cross which bars his way to life,revealed and known.Not yet the cross is mounted and therefore left behind. But onward goes theliving soul, eyes fixed upon the cross, ears open to the wailing cries of allhis brother souls.Stage VOut into radiant life and light! The cave is left behind; the cross isoverturned; the way stands clear. The word sounds clear within the head and notwithin the heart. “Enter again the playground of the Lord and this time lead thegames.” The way upon the second [470] tier of stairs stands barred, this by thesoul’s own act. No longer red desire governs all the life, but now the clearblue flame burns strong. Upon the bottom step of the barred Way he turns backand passes down the stairs on to the playground, meeting dead shells built in anearlier stage, stepping upon forms discarded and destroyed, and holding forththe hands of helpfulness. Upon his shoulder sits the bird of peace; upon hisfeet the sandals of the messenger.Not yet the utter glory of the radiant life! Not yet the entering intoeverlasting peace! But still the work, and still the lifting of the little ones.Here in symbolic form we have pictures of human life and progress, of life inform and growing through the building process which marks the creative work. Itis only a bald translation of some mantric phrases, and of some basic symbols,and must in no way be considered to be anything except indicative of a process,veiled and couched so that only those who know can understand. Esotericists willunderstand that these five stages cover the life period of every form, no matterwhether the creator is cosmic, planetary or human.Every form is built by an impulsive spark of life, emanated by a creator, andgrowing stage by stage under the law of accretion—an aspect of the law ofattraction, which is the law of life. This law cooperates with the Law of Causeand Effect, which, as we know, is the law governing matter. Cause, attraction ordesire, accretion and effect—these four words govern the construction of anythought-form. When the latter is a completed entity, it is an effect built byaccretion under the power of an organized cause.The race has evolved now to a point where we think of effects primarily in termsof quality rather than in terms of matter. A thought-form exists for us in order[471] to produce an effect. The raison d’être of all forms we have come to feelis to express some subjective quality which will give us the key to itscreator’s purpose. Ponder on these words. Hence, we find in this Rule XI thatthe purpose of the word pronounced is to tell the lives which constitute theform “what to do and where to carry that which has been made.” Thus we find theidea of purpose, activity and goal.There is no need for me to add to the vast amount of literature which has beenput forth or to emphasize the significance of purpose in connection with such athoughtform as a solar system, a planet, a kingdom in nature or a human being.In some respects this subjective triplicity of purpose, activity and goal iswell known and in others it is of too high and too inscrutable a nature for usto deal with in these Instructions and wander into the realms of speculation.With the goal, religion has long sought to deal; with the activity aspect, thescientist is now attempting to deal; and with the Will of God the most advancedthinkers and philosophers are constantly speculating. Only when man submitshimself to the discipline of his own spiritual will and controls the activity ofthe lives within his form nature and so orients himself to the goal as itprogressively makes its appeal to his vision, will he arrive at a trueunderstanding of the plan, which constitutes the will of God as far as humanbeings can grasp it.But with the thought-forms which he is beginning to create as he daily learns tothink, we can concern ourselves for it is the first lesson soon to be learnt inthe magical work. The creator in mental matter has:a. To learn to build intelligently.b. To give the impulse, through right speech which will animate that which hehas built, and so enable the thought-form to convey the intended idea. [472]c. To send out his thought-form correctly oriented to his goal, and so trulydirected that it will reach the objective and accomplish its sender’s purpose.The necessity for clear thinking and the elimination of idle, destructive andnegative thoughts becomes increasingly apparent as the aspirant progresses uponhis way. As the power of the mind increases and as the human beingdifferentiates his thought increasingly from mass thought, he inevitably buildsthought substance into form. It is at first automatic and unconscious. He cannothelp so doing, and fortunately, for the race, the forms constructed are sofeeble that they are largely innocuous, or so in line with mass thought thatthey are negligible in their effect. But as man evolves his power and hiscapacity to harm or to help increases, and unless he learns to build rightly andcorrectly to motivate that which he has built he will become a destructiveagency and a centre of harmful force—destroying and harming not only himself, aswe shall see shortly, but equally hurting and harming those who vibrate to hisnote.Granted all this you might appositely inquire: Are there some simple rules whichthe earnest and sincere beginner could apply to this science of building andwhich are so clear and concise that they will produce the needed effect? Thereare, and I will state them simply so that the beginner will, if he follows them,escape the dangers of black magic, and learn to build in line with the plan. Hewill, if he follows the rules I give, avoid the intricate problem which he hashimself blindly constructed and which will indeed shut out the light of day,darken his world, and imprison him in a wall of forms which will embody for himhis own peculiar great illusion.These rules may sound too simple for the learned aspirant but for those who arewilling to become as little children they will be found to be a safe guide intotruth [473] and will eventually make them able to pass the tests for adeptship.Some are couched in terms symbolic, others are necessarily blinds, still othersexpress the truth just as it is.1. View the world of thought, and separate the false out of the true.2. Learn the meaning of illusion, and in its midst locate the golden thread oftruth.3. Control the body of emotion for the waves that rise upon the stormy seas oflife engulf the swimmer, shut out the sun and render all plans futile.4. Discover that thou hast a mind and learn its dual use.5. Concentrate the thinking principle, and be the master of thy mental world.6. Learn that the thinker and his thought and that which is the means of thoughtare diverse in their nature, yet one in ultimate reality.7. Act as the thinker, and learn it is not right to prostitute thy thought tothe base use of separative desire.8. The energy of thought is for the good of all and for the furtherance of thePlan of God. Use it not therefore for thy selfish ends.9. Before a thought-form is by thee constructed, vision its purpose, ascertainits goal, and verify the motive.10. For thee, the aspirant on the way of life, the way of conscious building isnot yet the goal. The work of cleaning out the atmosphere of thought, of barringfast the doors of thought to hate and pain, to fear, and jealousy and lowdesire, must first precede the conscious work of building. See to thy aura, ohtraveler on the way.11. Watch close the gates of thought. Sentinel desire. [474] Cast out all fear,all hate, all greed. Look out and up.12. Because the life is mostly centered on the plane of concrete life, thy wordsand speech will indicate thy thought. To these pay close attention.13. Speech is of triple kind. The idle words will each produce effect. If goodand kind, naught need be done. If otherwise, the paying of the price cannot belong delayed.The selfish words , sent forth with strong intent, build up a wall ofseparation. Long time it takes to break that wall and so release the stored-up,selfish purpose. See to thy motive, and seek to use those words which blend thelittle life with the large purpose of the will of God.The word of hate , the cruel speech which ruins those who feel its spell, thepoisonous gossip, passed along because it gives a thrill—these words kill theflickering impulses of the soul, cut at the roots of life, and so bring death.If spoken in the light of day, just retribution will they bring; when spoken andthen registered as lies, they strengthen that illusory world in which thespeaker lives and holds him back from liberation.If uttered with intent to hurt, to bruise and kill, they wander back to him whosent them forth and him they bruise and kill.14. The idle thought, time selfish thought, the cruel hateful thought ifrendered into word produce a prison, poison all the springs of life, lead todisease, and cause disaster and delay. Therefore, be sweet and kind and good asfar as in thee lies. Keep silence and the light will enter in.15. Speak not of self. Pity not thy fate. The thoughts of self and of thy lowerdestiny prevent the inner [475] voice of thine own soul from striking upon thineear. Speak of the soul; enlarge upon the plan; forget thyself in building forthe world. Thus is the law of form offset. Thus can the rule of love enter uponthat world.These simple rules will lay right foundations for the carrying forward of themagical work, and will render the mental body so clear and so powerful thatright motive will control and true work in building will be possible.Much of the significance of this rule must remain theoretical, and be consideredas holding a challenge until such time as the real magical work of thought-formbuilding becomes universally possible. The formula , as we have seen, willremain unknown to all save the members of the Hierarchy of Adepts for long agesto come. The directional words are capable of ascertainment, but only to thosewho are working consciously under the guidance of their own souls, and who,through mind control merging into deep meditation, can manipulate the matter ofthought and become “knowing creators.” These can, and do, speak the impulsivewords which bring into being those new forms and organisms, those expressions ofideas and those organisations which live their life cycle and serve theirpurpose, and so come, duly, to their timely and appointed end. These creatorsare the leaders and organisers, the teachers and the guides in all phases ofhuman living. Their sound does go forth into all lands and their note isinternationally recognised. Hundreds of such names are easily remembered andspring unhidden to the mind. They live in the memory of the multitude and thatwhich lives is the sound of their accomplishment, be that good or bad.But in the sentence which we must consider we find portrayed a universalfunction, even though it is as yet [476] carried forward for the most partunconsciously. The words to be dealt with are as follows:III. Finally, to utter forth the mystic phrase which will save him from theirwork.Therefore it appears that at the close of the magical work of creation, a phrasemust be enunciated which effects a salvation and produces a liberation of a dualkind,—a liberation of the creating agent from the form which he has created, andthe emancipation of that form from the control of the one who has brought itinto being.It is obvious that already the nature of speech in relation to embodied ideas isbeing somewhat understood. Study the method of talk which is now the main factoremployed to “launch an idea.” Note how all inventions (which are neither morenor less than embodied concepts) come into exoteric being on the physical planethrough the power of the spoken word, and consider also with care the occultsignificance underlying all conferences, all meetings, all consultations, andall discussions which concern themselves with the launching of some idea or setof ideas upon the sea of public necessity. May it not be possible that under themodes of activity employed by the advertising agencies and the constant traininggiven to salesmen in the use of the spoken word as a means of approach to thepublic in order to sell an idea, we shall find the first distorted indicationsof the emanations of those mystic phrases which will bring into being thecreation of the soul in all fields of creative enterprise?The training of public opinion, the utilisation of catch words and slogans, thetendency to embody the concepts of campaigners in trite and apposite phrases arepart of the growing realisation as to the magical work. All these means areemployed blindly and without true realisation; they constitute a part of theemerging activities of a humanity which is on the verge of real creative work,[477] the principles of which are not yet understood nor scientifically applied.But they do point the way, and under the simplification which marks the returnto synthesis, we shall have the cessation of speech and the utilisation ofsimpler forms. Under the evolutionary urge, we have had the creative Sound, theWord, Speech. The latter, in its turn, has been differentiated into words,phrases, sentences, paragraphs, books, until we now have the era wherein thisdifferentiation is at its height, and we have speeches at all hours of the dayand night; we have the utilisation of the public platform to reach the publicear, and of the radio to reach all classes and races of humanity in an effort tomould public opinion and bring certain ideas and concepts into the publicconsciousness. We have the publication of books literally in their millions, andall playing their part in the same great work, and we have as yet both methodsof communication being prostituted to the selfish ends and ambitious purposes ofthose who speak and write. Yet there are a few true creators who areendeavouring to make their sound heard, to speak those mystical words which willenable humanity to see the vision. Thus will be dispersed eventually the cloudsof thought-forms which at this time shut out the clear light of God.The subject is too large for me to elaborate in this Treatise . I but seek tomake suggestions which will carry to the intelligent reader some idea of theenormous progress which has been made in the magical work. In this way he willbe enabled to go forward with optimism knowing that hitherto all has been goodinasmuch as man has progressed in knowledge. Out of the present welter of speechand of words, of lectures and of books, a few clear concepts will surely emergewhich will find an echo in the hearts of men. Thus also will men be led on intothe new age, wherein “talk will die out and books come to naught” for the linesof subjective communication [478] will lie open. Men will recognise that noiseacts as a deterrent to telepathic intercourse. The written word will not beneeded either, for men will use symbols of light and colour to supplementthrough the eye what the subjective hearing has recorded. But that day is notyet, even though the radio and television are the first steps in the rightdirection.Putting the truth as simply as possible we might state that through thecomplexity of much speech-making and book-writing, ideas are now enabled to takeform and so run through their cycle of activity. But this method is asunsatisfactory in the field of knowledge as is the ancient tallow dip in thefield of illumination. Electric light has superseded it, and some day the truetelepathic communication and vision will take the place of speech and ofwritings.Carrying the same concepts into the field of real esoteric work we have theworker in thought-matter building his thought-form and “confining the lives”which express and respond to his idea within a “ring-pass-not”. This latterpersists for as long as his mind attention and hence his ensouling energy isdirected upon it. We have him pronouncing the words which will enable histhought-form to do its work, fulfill the mission for which it has beenconstructed, and carry out the purpose for which it was created. All that hasbeen given out hitherto in connection with the words used in the creative workis the sevenfold sacred Word, AUM. This, when rightly used by the soul on themental plane vitalises and expedites all thought-forms, and so producessuccessful enterprise. It is interesting to note that in Atlantean days, theword used was TAU, enunciated explosively and so forcefully, that thethought-forms thus energised and expedited acted inevitably like a boomerang,and returned to the one who sent them forth. This word TAU is likewise, in itssymbolic form, the [479] symbol of reincarnation. It is desire for form whichproduces the use of form and causes cyclic and constant rebirth in form. It wasthe constant use of the TAU likewise, which brought about the final overwhelmingwith water, which swept away the ancient Atlantean civilisation; the few whoused the AUM in those days were not potent enough to offset the force of desire.The mind bodies of the race could not respond to that newer creative sound.Humanity was still swept entirely by longing and desire to such an extent thatthe united desire for possessions and for the enjoyment of form drove menesoterically “into the waters”. Desire for form still forces upon humanity theconstant process of rebirth until such time as the TAU influence is exhaustedand the AUM sound can dominate. The former influence is however weakening, andthe AUM is increasing in potency until it will be the dominating factor. To thislatter sound, the word of the Soul must eventually succeed, until AUM in itsturn is entirely superseded.The sound of many waters (which is the symbolic way of expressing the TAUinfluence) will cease, and the time will come, as we are assured in theChristian Bible, when there “will be no more sea”. Then the sound of the AUMwhich is symbolically spoken of as the “roaring of a blazing fire”, and which isthe sound of the mental plane will take its place. The word of the soul cannotbe given except in the secret place of initiation. It has its own peculiarvibration and note, but this cannot be conveyed until such time as the AUM isused with correctness. Just as the TAU, carrying the note of desire and of theurge to have and to be, was misused and carried its civilisations to disaster,so AUM can also be misused and can carry its civilisations into the fire. Thisis the truth which really underlies the misunderstood Christian teaching anenthell-fire and the lake of fire. They portray symbolically the end of the age[480] when the mental plane civilisations will come to a cataclysmic end, as faras the form aspect is concerned just as the earlier civilisations came to awatery consummation.One hint here I will give, and one that is oft overlooked. On the mental plane,time is not; therefore the time equation enters not into the idea of a finalending by fire. There is no setting of a time for a disaster or a catastrophe.The full effect will take place in the realm of the mind, and may it not be saidthat even now the fire of anxiety, of foreboding, of worry, and of fear isburning up our thoughts and engrossing our mental attention? Its work is topurify and cleanse, so, let the AUM do its work and let all of you who can,employ it with frequency and with right thought so that the world purificationmay proceed apace. Much must be burned and consumed which bars the way for theemergence of the new ideas, the new archetypal forms. These will eventuallydominate the new age and make it possible for the word of the soul to soundforth and be heard exoterically.I realize that that which I have imparted here is difficult of comprehension,but the paragraphs above dictated hold warning for the careless and muchinstruction for the earnest seeker after light.There are two aspects of this phrase which we are considering with which I seekbriefly to deal. There are many which I might take up, but two will suffice tocarry practical suggestion, and to indicate ideas which aspirants everywherewould do well to grasp. The thought of salvation from the effect ofform-embodied ideas must be considered, and I would like also to cover the ideaof “a saving-from” under two headings. The aspirant has to be saved from thethought-forms built daily during his mental life, and a soul in incarnation hasalso to be saved from the form attachments which during the ages have [481]grown and strengthened, and from which he has to be released through the processwe call death. We will therefore divide our subject as follows:I. Salvation from the power exerted by the thought-forms we have ourselvescreated.II. Salvation from the power of the threefold body which the soul has built,through the magical release called death.It is with the latter that I wish primarily to deal, but certain things must besaid concerning the power of thought-forms, and concerning their danger, and themode whereby they can be rendered innocuous.SALVATION FROM OUR THOUGHT-FORMSI speak now for aspirants, who, through concentration and meditation, aregaining power in thought. I speak for the thinkers of the world, who, throughtheir one-pointed application and devotion to business, to science, to religionor to the varying modes of human activity have oriented the mind (not theemotions but the mentality) to some line of constant action which is necessarilya part of the divine activity in the large sense.It is right here, in the use of thought, that the difference between black andwhite magic can be seen. Selfishness, ruthlessness, hatred, and crueltycharacterise the worker in mental substance whose motives are, for many lives,centred around his own aggrandisement, focussed on his personal acquisition ofpossessions, and directed entirely to the attainment of his own pleasure andsatisfaction, no matter what the cost to others. Such men are happily few, butthe way to such a point of view is easy to achieve, and many need to guardthemselves lest they tread unthinkingly the way towards materiality.A gradual and steady growth in group consciousness and responsibility, asubmergence of the wishes of the [482] personal self and the manifestation of aloving spirit characterise those who are oriented towards the life side of thedivine whole. It might be said that human beings fall into three main groups:1. The vast majority, who are neither good nor bad, but simply unthinking andentirely submerged in the evolutionary tide, and in the work of developing atrue self consciousness, and the needed equipment.2. A small, a very small number, who are definitely and consciously working onthe side of materiality or (if you prefer so to express it) on the side of evil.Potent are they on the physical plane, but their power is temporal and noteternal. The law of the universe, which is the law of love, is eternally againstthem, and out of the seeming evil good will come.3. A goodly number who are the pioneers into the kingdom of the soul, who arethe exponents of the new age ideas, and the custodians of that aspect of theAgeless Wisdom which is next to be revealed to mankind. This group isconstituted of the unselfish and intelligent men and women in every field ofhuman endeavour, of the aspirants and disciples, of the initiates who sound thenote for the various groups and types, and of the Occult Hierarchy itself. Theinfluence of this band of mystics and knowers is exceedingly great and theopportunity to work in cooperation with it at this time is easier of attainmentthan at any other time in racial history.The first group is unthinking; the two other groups are beginning to think andto employ the laws of thought. It is with the use of thought by the aspirantthat I seek to deal. Much about thought will be found in A Treatise on CosmicFire [483] , but I intend to give some practical ideas and suggestions whichwill help the average aspirant to work as he should.Let us remember first of all that no aspirant, no matter how sincere anddevoted, is free from faults. Were he free, he would be an adept. All aspirantsare still selfish, still prone to temper and to irritability, still subject todepression and even at times to hatred. Oft that temper and hatred may bearoused by what we call just causes. Injustice on the part of others, cruelty tohuman beings and to animals, and the hatreds and viciousness of their fellow mendo arouse in them corresponding reactions, and cause them much suffering anddelay. One thing must ever be remembered. If an aspirant evokes hatred in anassociate, if he arouses him to temper, and if he meets with dislike andantagonism, it is because he himself is not entirely harmless; there are stillin him the seeds of trouble, for it is a law in nature that we get what we give,and produce reactions in line with our activity be it physical, emotional ormental.There are certain types of men who do not come under this category. When a manhas reached a stage of high initiation, the case is different. The seed ideas heseeks to convey, the work he is empowered to do, the pioneering enterprise he isendeavouring to carry forward, may—and often do—call forth from those who sensenot the beauty of his cause and the rightness of the truth he enunciates, ahatred and a fury which causes him much trouble and for which he is notpersonally responsible. This antagonism comes from the reactionaries and thedevotees of the race and it should be remembered that it is largely impersonaleven though focussed on him as the representative of an idea. But with thesehigh souls I deal not, but with students of the Ageless Wisdom who are learningnot only that they seldom think, but that when they do they are oft thinking[484] wrongly, for they are forced into a thought activity by reactions whichhave their seat in their lower nature, and are based on selfishness and lack oflove.There are three lessons which every aspirant needs to learn:First , that every thought-form which he builds is built under the impulse ofsome emotion or of some desire; in rarer cases it may be built in the light ofillumination and embody, therefore, some intuition. But with the majority, themotivating impulse which sweeps the mind-stuff into activity is an emotionalone, or a potent desire, either good or bad, either selfish or unselfish.Secondly , it should be borne in mind that the thoughtform so constructed willeither remain in his own aura, or will find its way to a sensed objective. Inthe first case, it will form part of a dense wall of such thoughtforms whichentirely surround him or constitute his mental aura, and will grow in strengthas he pays it attention until it is so large that it will shut out reality fromhim, or it will be so dynamic and potent that he will become the victim of thatwhich he built. The thought-form will be more powerful than its creator, so thathe becomes obsessed by his own ideas, and driven by his own creation. In thesecond case, his thought-form will find its way into the mental aura of anotherhuman being, or into some group. You have here the seeds of evil magical workand the imposition of a powerful mind upon a weaker. If it finds its way intosome group, analogous impulsive forms (found within the group aura) willcoalesce with it, having the same vibratory rate or measure. Then the same thingwill take place in the group aura as has taken place within the individualring-pass-not,—the group will have around it an inhibiting wall ofthought-forms, or it will be obsessed by some idea. Here we have the clue to allsectarianism, to all fanaticism, and to some forms of insanity, both group andindividual. [485]Thirdly, the creator of the thought-form (in this case an aspirant) remainsresponsible. The form remains linked to him by his living purpose and thereforethe karma of the results, and the ultimate work of destroying that which he hasbuilt must be his. This is true of every embodied idea, the good as well as thebad. The creator of all of them is responsible for the work of his creation. TheMaster Jesus, for instance, has still to deal with the thought-forms which wecall the Christian Church, and has much to do. The Christ and the Buddha havestill some consummating work to carry through, though not so much with the formswhich embody Their enunciated principles, as with the souls who have evolvedthrough the application of those principles.With the aspirant, however, who is still learning to think, the problem isdifferent. He is still prone to use thought matter to embody his mistakenapprehension of the real ideas; he is still apt to express his likes anddislikes through the power of thought; he is still inclined to use the mindstuff to make possible his personality desires. To this every sincere aspirantwill bear witness.Much concern is being felt among many of you as to the guarding of thoughts andthe protection of formulated ideas. Some thoughts are ideas, clothed in mentalmatter and keep their habitat on the plane of thought matter. Such are theabstract conceptions and the scarcely sensed facts of the inner occult or mysticlife that pass through the mind of the thinker. They are not so difficult toguard, for their vibrations are so high and light that few people have the powerto clothe them adequately in mental matter, and those few are so very scarcethat the risk of such statements being unwisely promulgated is not very great.Then there are the communications involved in occult teaching. The circle ofthose who apprehend them is widening somewhat and these thought-forms frequently[486] take to themselves astral matter from the desire in the heart of thestudent to verify, corroborate, and share with the group whose knowledge is asvital as his. Sometimes this is possible, and sometimes not. If prohibited whatis the method of protection then? Largely a refusing to allow the matter of theastral plane to adhere to the mental thought-form. Fight the matter out on thedesire level, and inhibit that type of matter from formulating. Where no desireto speak exists, and where the striving is to prevent the gathering of thematerial around the nucleus, another thought-form is built up, one thatintervenes and protects.Still another type of thought-form comes forth,—the most prevalent and the onethat causes the most trouble. These are the facts of information, the detailedmaterial, the news (if so you like to call it), the basis of what may degenerateinto gossip, that concerns either your work, administrative or otherwise, andthat which concerns other people. How shall you prevent your mind fromtransmitting to another facts such as these? These are facts that have theirorigination in physical plane occurrence, and therein lies the difficulty. Theinner facts of the occult life, and those that originate on the mental plane arenot so difficult to hide. They do not come your way till your vibrations arekeyed high enough for them, and as a rule, when that is so, character ofsufficient stability and wisdom goes alongside. But it is not thus with aphysical plane fact. What must be done? The other thoughts descend from above;these latter work upwards from the physical plane and are increased in vitalityby the knowledge of the many, often of the many unwise. One kind startsnebulously on the mental plane, and only the higher type of mind can formulateit, and clothe it with matter in geometrical precision, and such a mind usuallyhas the wisdom that refuses to clothe it in astral plane matter. Not so with thephysical plane fact. It [487] is a vital entity, robed in material of the astralplane and the mental plane when first you meet and contact it. Will you vitaliseit, or will you arrest it? Arrest it by a rush and wave of love for the partyimplicated, that envelops the thought-form and sends it back to the originator,borne on the wings of a surge of astral plane matter, strong enough to sweepthrough and around, mayhap disintegrating, but most certainly returning itharmlessly to the sender. Perhaps it is an evil piece of information, a lie oritem of gossip. Devitalise it by love, break it in pieces by the power of acounter thought-form of peace and harmony.Or again, it may be true, some sad or evil occurrence or deed of some mistakenbrother. What then is there to do? Truth cannot be devitalised or disintegrated.The Law of Absorption will aid you here. Into your heart you absorb thethought-form you encounter and there transmute it by the alchemy of love. Let mebe practical and illustrate, for the matter is of importance.Some brother comes to you and tells to you a fact about another brother—a factinvolving what the world would call wrongdoing on that brother’s part. You whoknow so much more than the average man of the street, will realise that that socalled wrongdoing may be but the working out of karma, or have its basis in agood motive wrongly construed. You add not to the talk, you do not hand on theinformation, as far as you are concerned the thought-form, built around thefact, has wandered into what you call a cul-de-sac.What do you then? You build a counter stream of thoughts which (on a wave oflove) you send your apparently erring brother: thoughts of kindly assistance, ofcourage and aspiration, and of a wise application of the lessons to be learntfrom the deed he has accomplished. Use not force, for strong thinkers must notunduly influence other minds, but a gentle stream of [488] wise transmutinglove. We have here three methods, none strictly occult, for those later shall beimparted, but methods available for the many.1. The thought form kept to the mental levels, i.e. the inhibiting of astralplane matter.2. The thought-form broken up and disintegrated by a stream of love-forcewell-directed.3. The absorbing of the thought-form, and the formulation of a counter-thoughtof loving wisdom.Inhibition—Disintegration—AbsorptionThere are three main penalties which attach to the wrong use of thoughtsubstance, and from these the aspirant must learn to save himself, and to avoidthose activities; eventually this will make the process of salvationunnecessary.1. A potent thought-form can act like a boomerang. It can return, charged withincreased velocity, to the one who sent it on its mission. A strong hatred,clothed in mental matter, can return to its creator charged with the energy ofthe hated person, and can hence work havoc in the life of the aspirant. Hatenot, for hatred returns ever from whence it came. There is a depth of truth inthe ancient aphorism: “Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.”A potent desire for material acquisition will eventually return bringinginevitably that which has been desired, only to find in the majority of casesthat the aspirant no longer aches for possession, but regards it as an incubus,or, in the meantime, already possesses more than he needs and is satiated andknows not what to do with all that he has gained.A potent thought-form embodying an aspiration for spiritual illumination or forrecognition by the Master may bring such a flood of light as to blind theaspirant, and make him consequently the possessor of a wealth of spiritualenergy for which he is unready, and which he [489] cannot use. Again, it mayattract to the aspirant a thought-form of one of the Great Ones, and thus swinghim deeper into the world of illusion and of astralism. Hence the need forhumility, for a longing to serve and a resulting self-forgetfulness if one is tobuild truly and correctly. Such is the law.2. A thought-form can also act as a poisoning agent, and poison all the springsof life. It may not be potent enough to swing out of its creator’s aura (veryfew thought-forms are), and find its goal in another aura there to gatherstrength and so return from whence it came, but it may have a vitality of itsown which can devastate the life of the aspirant. A violent dislike, a gnawingworry, a jealousy, a constant anxiety and a longing for something or someone mayact so potently as an irritant or poison that the entire life is spoilt, andservice is rendered futile. The entire life is embittered and devitalised by theembodied worry, hatred or desire. All relationships with other people arerendered equally futile or even definitely harmful, for the worried orsuspicious aspirant spoils the home circle or his group of friends by his innerpoisonous attitude, governed by an idea. His relation to his own soul and thestrength of the contact with the world of spiritual ideas is at a standstill,for he cannot progress onward and is held back by the poison in his mentalsystem. His vision becomes distorted, his nature corroded, and all hisrelationships impeded by the wearing, nagging thoughts which he has himselfembodied in form and which have a life so powerful that they can poison him. Hecannot rid himself of them no matter how hard he tries or how clearly he sees(theoretically) the cause of his trouble. This is one of the commonest forms ofdifficulty, for it has its seat in the selfish personal life, and is ofttimes sofluidic that it seems to defy direct action.3. The third danger against which the aspirant must [490] guard himself isbecoming obsessed by his own embodied ideas, be they temporarily right orbasically wrong. Forget not that all right ideas are temporary in nature andmust eventually take their place as partial rights and give place to the greatertruth. The fact of the day is seen later as part of a greater fact. A man canhave grasped some of the lesser principles of the Ageless Wisdom so clearly andbe so convinced of their correctness that the bigger whole is forgotten and hebuilds a thought-form about the partial truth which he has seen which can provea limitation and keep him a prisoner and hold him back from progress. He is sosure of his possession of truth that he can see the truth of no one else. He canbe so convinced of the reality of His own embodied concept of what the truth maybe that he forgets his own brain limitations and that the truth has come to himvia his own soul and is consequently coloured by his ray, being subsequentlybuilt into form by his personal separative mind. He lives but for that littletruth; he can see no other; he forces his thought-form on other people; hebecomes the obsessed fanatic and so mentally unbalanced, even if the worldregards him as sane.How shall a man guard himself from these dangers? How shall he rightly build?How shall he preserve that balance which will enable him to see truth, judgerightly, and so preserve his mental contact with his soul and with the souls ofhis fellow men?First and foremost, by the constant practice of Harmlessness. This involvesharmlessness in speech and also in thought and consequently in action. It is apositive harmlessness, involving constant activity and watchfulness; it is not anegative and fluidic tolerance.Secondly, by a daily guarding of the doors of thought, and a supervision of thethought life. Certain lines of thought will not be permitted; certain oldthought habits will be offset by the institution of constructive creative [491]thinking; certain preconceived ideas (note the esoteric value of that phrase),will be relegated to the background so that the new horizons will be visionedand the new ideas can enter. This will entail a daily, hourly watchfulness, butonly until ancient habits have been overcome and the new rhythm established.Then the aspirant will discover that the mind is so focussed on the newspiritual ideas that the old thought-forms will fail to arrest the attention;they will die of inanition. There is encouragement in this thought. The firstthree years’ work will be the hardest. After that the mind will be engrossed bythe ideas and not by the thought-form.Thirdly, by refusing to live in one’s own thought world and by entering theworld of ideas and the stream of human thought currents. The world of ideas isthe world of the soul, and of the higher mind. The stream of human thoughts andof opinions is that of the public consciousness and of the lower mind. Theaspirant must function free in both worlds. Note this with care. The thought isnot that he must function freely, which involves more the idea of facility butthat he must function as a free agent in both worlds. Through constant dailymeditation he does the first. Through wide reading and sympathetic interest andunderstanding he accomplishes the second.Fourthly, he must learn to detach himself from his own thought creations, andleave them free to accomplish the purpose for which he intelligently sent themforth. This fourth process falls into two parts:1. By the use of a mystic phrase he severs the link which holds an embodied ideain his thought-aura.2. By detaching his mind from the idea, once he has sent it on its mission, helearns the lesson of the Bhagavad Gita and “works without attachment”.These two points will vary according to the growth and status of the aspirant.Each has, for himself, to formulate [492] his own “severing phrase”, and eachhas for himself, alone and unaided, to learn to look away from the three worldswherein he works in his effort to push his idea of the work to be done. He hasto teach himself to withdraw his attention from the thought-form he has built,wherein that idea is embodied, knowing that as he lives as a soul, and asspiritual energy pours through him so his thought-form will express thespiritual idea and accomplish its work. It is held together by the life of thesoul, and not by personality desire. The tangible results are ever dependentupon the strength of the spiritual impulse animating his idea, which is embodiedin his thought-form. His work lies in the world of ideas and not in physicaleffects. Automatically the physical aspects will respond to the spiritualimpulse.SALVATION FROM DEATHWe come now to the second phase of our study of the final words of Rule XI. Wehave dealt with salvation from the dangers incident to the creation ofthoughtforms by a human being who has learnt, or is learning, to create on themental plane. Much could have been said from the standpoint of the inability ofthe majority of students to think with clarity. Clear thinking involves capacityto dissociate oneself, temporarily at least, from all reactions and activitiesof an emotional nature. As long as the astral body is in a state of restlessmovement, and its moods and feelings, its desires and emotions are powerfulenough to attract attention, positive pure thought processes are not possible.Until the time comes when there is a more general appreciation of the value ofconcentration and of meditation, and until the nature of the mind and itsmodifications are more universally understood, any further teaching on thesubject would be futile.In these Instructions I have sought to give an indication [493] of the firststeps in esoteric psychology, and have dealt primarily with the nature and modeof training of the astral body. Later on in this century, the psychology of themind, its nature and modifications may be handled in more detail. But the timeis not yet.Our subject now is salvation from the body nature through the process of death.Two things must be borne in mind as we seek to study the means of thissalvation:First, by the body nature I mean the integrated personality, or the humanequipment of physical body, vital or etheric vehicle, the matter (or mode ofbeing) of the desire nature, and the mind stuff. These constitute the sheaths orouter forms of the incarnated soul. The consciousness aspect is sometimesfocussed in one and sometimes in another, or is identified with the form or withthe soul. The average man works with facility and self-consciousness in thephysical and astral bodies. The intelligent and highly evolved man has added tothese two the conscious control of his mental apparatus, though only in certainof its aspects, such as the memorising or analysing faculties. He has also, insome cases, succeeded in unifying these three into a consciously functioningpersonality. The aspirant is beginning to understand something of the principleof life which is animating the personality, whilst the disciple is utilising allthree, because he has coordinated or aligned the soul, the mind, and the brainand is therefore beginning to work with his subjective apparatus or energyaspects.Secondly, this salvation is brought about through a right understanding of themystical experience we call death. This is to be our theme, and the subject isso immense that I can only indicate certain lines along which the aspirant maythink, and posit certain premises which he can later elaborate. We shall confineourselves also primarily to the death of the physical body. [494]Let us first of all define this mysterious process to which all forms aresubject and which is frequently only the dreaded end—dreaded because it is notunderstood. The mind of man is so little developed that fear of the unknown,terror of the unfamiliar, and attachment to form have brought about a situationwhere one of the most beneficent occurrences in the life cycle of an incarnatingSon of God is looked upon as something to be avoided and postponed for as long atime as possible.Death, if we could but realise it, is one of our most practised activities. Wehave died many times and shall die again and again. Death is essentially amatter of consciousness. We are conscious one moment on the physical plane, anda moment later we have withdrawn onto another plane and are actively consciousthere. Just as long as our consciousness is identified with the form aspect,death will hold for us its ancient terror. Just as soon as we know ourselves tobe souls, and find that we are capable of focussing our consciousness or senseof awareness in any form or on any plane at will, or in any direction within theform of God, we shall no longer know death.Death for the average man is the cataclysmic end, involving the termination ofall human relations, the cessation of all physical activity, the severing of allsigns of love and of affection, and the passage (unwilling and protesting) intothe unknown and the dreaded. It is analogous to leaving a lighted and a warmedroom, friendly and familiar, where our loved ones are assembled, and going outinto the cold and dark night, alone and terror stricken, hoping for the best andsure of nothing.But people are apt to forget that every night, in the hours of sleep, we die tothe physical plane and are alive and functioning elsewhere. They forget thatthey have already achieved facility in leaving the physical body; [495] becausethey cannot as yet bring back into the physical brain consciousness therecollection of that passing out, and of the subsequent interval of activeliving, they fail to relate death and sleep. Death, after all, is only a longerinterval in the life of physical plane functioning; one has only “gone abroad”for a longer period. But the process of daily sleep and the process ofoccasional dying are identical, with the one difference that in sleep themagnetic thread or current of energy along which the life force streams ispreserved intact, and constitutes the path of return to the body. In death, thislife thread is broken or snapped. When this has happened, the conscious entitycannot return to the dense physical body and that body lacking the principle ofcoherence, then disintegrates.It should be remembered that the purpose and will of the soul, the spiritualdetermination to be and to do, utilises the thread soul, the sutratma, the lifecurrent, as its means of expression in form. This life current differentiatesinto two currents or two threads when it reaches the body, and is “anchored”, ifI might so express it, in two locations in that body. This is symbolic of thedifferentiations of Atma, or Spirit, into its two reflections, soul and body.The soul, or consciousness aspect, that which makes a human being a rational,thinking entity, is “anchored” by one aspect of this thread soul to a “seat” inthe brain, found in the region of the pineal gland. The other aspect of the lifewhich animates every atom of the body and which constitutes the principle ofcoherence or of integration, finds its way to the heart and is focussed or“anchored” there. From these two points, the spiritual man seeks to control themechanism. Thus functioning on the physical plane becomes possible, andobjective existence becomes a temporary mode of expression. The soul, seated inthe brain, makes man an intelligent rational entity, self-conscious andself-directing; [496] he is aware in varying degree of the world in which helives, according to the point in evolution and the consequent development of themechanism. That mechanism is triple in expression. There are first of all thenadis and the seven centres of force; then the nervous system in its threedivisions: cerebro-spinal, sympathetic, and peripheral; and then there is theendocrine system, which might be regarded as the densest aspect orexternalisation of the other two.The soul, seated in the heart, is the life principle, the principle ofself-determination, the central nucleus of positive energy by means of which allthe atoms of the body are held in their right place and subordinated to the“will-to-be” of the soul. This principle of life utilises the blood stream asits mode of expression and as its controlling agency, and through the closerelation of the endocrine system to the blood stream, we have the two aspects ofsoul activity brought together in order to make man a living, conscious,functioning entity, governed by the soul, and expressing the purpose of the soulin all the activities of daily living.Death, therefore, is literally the withdrawal from the heart and from the headof these two streams of energy, producing consequently, complete loss ofconsciousness and disintegration of the body. Death differs from sleep in thatboth streams of energy are withdrawn. In sleep only the thread of energy, whichis anchored in the brain is withdrawn, and when this happens the man becomesunconscious. By this we mean that his consciousness or sense of awareness isfocussed elsewhere. His attention is no longer directed towards things tangibleand physical but is turned upon another world of being and becomes centred inanother apparatus or mechanism. In death, both the threads are withdrawn orunified in the life thread. Vitality ceases to penetrate through the medium ofthe blood stream and the heart fails to function [497] just as the brain failsto record, and thus silence settles down. The house is empty. Activity ceasesexcept that amazing and immediate activity which is the prerogative of matteritself and which expresses itself in the process of decomposition. From certainaspects, therefore, that process indicates man’s unity with everything that ismaterial; it demonstrates that he is part of nature itself and by nature we meanthe body of the one life in whom “we live and move and have our being”. In thosethree words—living, moving and being—we have the entire story. Being isawareness, self consciousness and self-expression and of this man’s head andbrain are the exoteric symbols. Living is energy, desire in form, coherence andadhesion to an idea and of this the heart and the blood are the exotericsymbols. Moving indicates the integration and response of the existing, aware,living entity into the universal activity, and of this the stomach, pancreas andliver are the symbols.It is interesting, though incidental to our subject, to bear in mind that incases of imbecility and idiocy and in that stage of old age which we call seniledecay, the thread which is anchored in the brain is withdrawn, whilst that whichconveys the life impulse or urge remains still anchored in the heart. There islife but no intelligent awareness; there is movement but no intelligentdirection; in the case of senile decay, when there has been a high gradeapparatus utilized in life, there may be the appearance of intelligentfunctioning but that is an illusion due to old habit and to old establishedrhythm but not to coordinated coherent purpose.It must be noted also that death is, therefore, undertaken at the direction ofthe ego, no matter how unaware a human being may be of that direction. Theprocess works automatically with the majority, for when the soul withdraws itsattention the inevitable reaction on the physical plane is death, either by theabstraction of the [498] dual threads of life and reason energy, or by theabstraction of the thread of energy which is qualified by mentality, leaving thelife stream still functioning through the heart but no intelligent awareness.The soul is engaged elsewhere and occupied on its own plane with its ownaffairs.In the case of highly developed human beings we often find a sense of pre-visionas to the death period; this is incident upon egoic contact and awareness of thewishes of the ego. It involves sometimes a knowledge of the very day of death,coupled to a preservation of self-determination up to the final moment ofwithdrawal. In the case of initiates there is much more than this. There is anintelligent understanding of the laws of abstraction and this enables the onewho is making the transition to withdraw consciously and in full wakingawareness out of the physical body and so to function on the astral plane. Thisinvolves the preservation of continuity of consciousness so that no hiatusoccurs between the sense of awareness on the physical plane and that of theafter death state. The man knows himself to be as he was before, though withoutan apparatus whereby he can contact the physical plane. He remains aware of thestates of feeling and of the thoughts of those he loves, though he cannotperceive or contact the dense physical vehicle. He can communicate with them onthe astral plane or telepathically through the mind if they and he are enrapport, but communication that involves the use of the five physical senses ofperception lies necessarily out of his reach. It is useful to remember, however,that astrally and mentally the interplay can be closer and more sensitive thanever before for he is freed of the handicap of the physical body. Two things,however, militate against this interplay: one is the grief and violent emotionalupset of those left behind and, in the case of the average human being, theother is the man’s own ignorance [499] and bewilderment as he stands faced bywhat are to him new conditions, though they are really old conditions, if hecould but realize it. Once men have lost the fear of death and have establishedan understanding of the after-death world which is not based on hallucinationand hysteria or on the conclusions (oft unintelligent) of the average medium,who speaks under the control of his own thought-form (built by himself and thecircle of sitters), we shall have the process of death properly controlled. Thecondition of those left behind will be carefully handled so that there is noloss of relationship and no false expenditure of energy.There is a big difference now between the scientific method of bringing peopleinto incarnation and the perfectly blind and oft frightened and surely ignorantway in which we usher them out of incarnation. I seek today to open the door inthe occident to a newer and more scientific method of handling the process ofdying, and let me make myself perfectly clear. What I have to say in no wayabrogates modern medical science with its palliatives and skill. All I plead foris a sane approach to death; all I seek to make is a suggestion that when painhas worn itself out and weakness has supervened, the dying person be permittedto prepare himself, even if apparently unconscious, for the great transition.Forget not that it takes strength and a strong hold on the nervous apparatus toproduce pain. Is it impossible to conceive of a time when the act of dying willbe a triumphant finale of life? Is it impossible to vision the time when thehours spent on the death bed may be but a glorious prelude to a conscious exit?When the fact that the man is to discard the handicap of the physical sheath maybe for him and those around him the long waited for and joyous consummation? Canyou not visualize the time when instead of tears and fear and the refusal torecognize the inevitable, the dying person and [500] his friends would mutuallyagree on the hour and that nothing but happiness would characterize the passing?That in the minds of those left behind the thought of sorrow will not enter anddeath beds will be regarded as happier occasions than births and marriages? Itell you, that before so very long this will be deeply so for the intelligent ofthe race, and little by little for all.You say there are as yet only beliefs as to immortality and no sure evidences.In the accumulation of testimony, in the inner assurances of the human heart, inthe fact of belief in eternal persistence as an idea in the minds of men liessure indication. But indication will give place to conviction and knowledgebefore another hundred years has elapsed, for an event will take place and arevelation be given to the race which will turn hope into certainty and beliefinto knowledge. In the meantime, let a new attitude to death be cultivated and anew science of death be inaugurated. Let it cease to be the one thing we cannotcontrol and which inevitably defeats us and let us begin to control our passingover to the other side, and to understand somewhat the technique of transition.Before I take up this subject in greater detail I would like to make referenceto the “web in the brain”, which is intact for the majority but is non-existentfor the illumined seer.In the human body, as you know, we have an underlying, interpenetrating vitalbody which is the counterpart of the physical, which is larger than the physicaland which we call the etheric body or double. It is an energy body and iscomposed of force centres and nadis or force threads. These underlie or are thecounterparts of the nervous apparatus—the nerves and the nerve ganglia. In twoplaces in the human vital body there are orifices of exit for the life force.One opening is in the solar plexus and the other is in the brain at the top ofthe head. Protecting [501] both is a closely woven web of etheric matter,composed of interlacing strands of life energy.During the process of death, the pressure of the life energy beating against theweb produces eventually a puncturing or opening. Out of this the life forcepours as the potency of the abstracting influence of the soul increases. In thecase of animals, of infants and of men and women who are polarized entirely inthe physical and astral bodies, the door of exit is the solar plexus and it isthat web which is punctured, thus permitting the passing out. In the case ofmental types, of the more highly evolved human units, it is the web at the topof the head in the region of the fontanelle which is ruptured, thus againpermitting the exit of the thinking rational being.In psychics and in the case of mediums and lower seers (clairvoyant andclairaudient people) the solar plexus web is permanently ruptured early in lifeand easily therefore they pass in or out of the body, going into trance, as itis called, and functioning on the astral plane. But for these types there is nocontinuity of consciousness and there seems no relation between their physicalplane existence and the happenings which they relate whilst in trance and ofwhich they usually remain totally unaware in the waking consciousness. The wholeperformance is below the diaphragm and is related primarily to animal sentientlife. In the case of conscious clairvoyance and in the work of the higherpsychics and seers there is no trance, obsession or mediumship. It is the web inthe brain which is punctured and the opening in that region permits the inflowof light, information and inspiration; it confers also the power to pass intothe state of Samadhi which is the spiritual correspondence to the trancecondition of the animal nature.In the process of death these are, therefore, the two main exits: the solarplexus for the astrally polarized, [502] physically biased human being andtherefore of the vast majority, and the head centre for the mentally polarizedand spiritually oriented human being. This is the first and most important factto remember and it will easily be seen how the trend of a life tendency and thefocus of the life attention determine the mode of exit at death. It can be seenalso that an effort to control the astral life and the emotional nature and toorient one’s self to the mental world and to spiritual things has a momentouseffect upon the phenomenal aspects of the death process.If the student is thinking clearly, it will be apparent to him that one exitconcerns the spiritual and highly evolved man, whilst the other concerns the lowgrade human being who has scarcely advanced beyond the animal stage. What thenof the average man? A third exit is now in temporary use; just below the apex ofthe heart another etheric web is found covering an orifice of exit. We have,therefore, the following situation:1. The exit in the head, used by the intellectual type, by the disciples andinitiates of the world.2. The exit in the heart, used by the kindly, well-meaning man or woman who is agood citizen, an intelligent friend and a philanthropic worker.3. The exit in the region of the solar plexus, used by the emotional,unintelligent, unthinking man and by those whose animal nature is strong.This is the first point in the new information which will slowly become commonknowledge in the West during the next century. Much of it is already known bythinkers in the East and is in the nature of a first step towards a rationalunderstanding of the death process.The second point to be grasped is that there can be a technique of dying and atraining given during life which will lead up to the utilization of thattechnique.As regards the training to which a man can submit himself I will give a fewhints which will be found to [503] convey a new meaning to much work now beingdone by all aspirants. The Elder Brothers of the race who have guided humanitythrough long centuries, are now busy preparing people for the next great step tobe taken. This step will bring in a continuity of consciousness which will doaway with all fear of death and link the physical and astral planes in such aclose relation that they will in reality constitute one plane. Just as anat-one-ment has to be brought about between the various aspects of man, so asimilar unification has to take place in connection with the various aspects ofthe planetary life. The planes have to be at-one-ed as well as soul and body.This has already been largely accomplished between the etheric plane and thedense physical plane. Now it is being rapidly carried forward between thephysical and the astral.In the work being done by seekers in all departments of human thought and life,this unification is proceeding and in the training now suggested to earnest andsincere aspirants, there are other objectives than just the one of producingsoul and body at-one-ment. No emphasis, however, is laid upon them, owing to theability of man unduly to emphasize the wrong objectives. It might well be askedif it is possible to give a simple set of rules that would be followed now byall who seek to establish such a rhythm that life itself is not only organizedand constructive, but when the moment for vacating the outer sheath arrives,there will be no problem nor difficulty. I will, therefore, give you four simplerules that link up with much that all students are now doing:1. Learn to keep focussed in the head through visualization and meditation andthrough the steady practice of concentration; develop the capacity to liveincreasingly as the king seated on the throne between the eyebrows. This is arule that can be applied to the every day affairs of life. [504]2. Learn to render heart service and not an emotional insistence on activitydirected towards handling the affairs of others. This involves, prior to allsuch activity, the answering of two questions:—Am I rendering this service to anindividual as an individual, or am I rendering it as a member of a group to agroup? Is my motive an egoic impulse, or am I prompted by emotion, ambition toshine and love of being loved or admired? These two activities will result inthe focussing of the life energies above the diaphragm and so negate theattractive power of the solar plexus. Hence, that centre will becomeincreasingly inactive and there will not be so much danger of puncturing the webin that locality.3. Learn, as you go to sleep, to withdraw the consciousness to the head. Thisshould be practiced as a definite exercise as one falls to sleep. One should notpermit oneself to drift off to sleep, but should endeavor to preserve theconsciousness intact until there is a conscious passing out onto the astralplane. Relaxation, close attention, and a steady drawing upwards to the centerin the head should be attempted, for until the aspirant has learned to besteadily aware of all processes in going to sleep and to preserve at the sametime his positivity, there is danger in this work. The first steps must be takenwith intelligence and followed for many years until facility in the work ofabstraction is achieved.4. Record and watch all phenomena connected with the withdrawing process,whether followed in the meditation work or in going to sleep. It will be found,for instance, that many people wake with an almost painful start just as theyhave dropped asleep. This is due to the slipping out of the consciousnessthrough a web which is not adequately clear and through an orifice which ispartially closed. Others may hear an intensely loud snap in the region of thehead. This is caused by the vital airs in the head of which we are not usuallyaware and is produced [505] by an inner aural sensitivity which causes awarenessof sounds always present but not usually registered. Others will see light asthey fall asleep, or clouds of colour, or banners and streamers of violet, allof which are etheric phenomena. These phenomena which are of no real moment, areall related to the vital body, to pranic emanations, and to the web of light.The carrying on of this practice and the following of these four rules over aperiod of years will do much to facilitate the technique of the death bed, forthe man who has learned to handle his body as he falls asleep, has an advantageover the man who never pays any attention to the process.In relation to the technique of dying it is only possible for me at this time tomake one or two suggestions. I deal not here with the attitude of the attendantwatchers, I deal only with those points which will make for an easier passingover of the transient soul.First, let there be silence in the chamber. This is, of course, frequently thecase. It must be remembered that the dying person may usually be unconscious.This unconsciousness is apparent but not real. In nine hundred cases out of athousand the brain awareness is there, with a full consciousness of happenings,but there is a complete paralysis of the will to express and complete inabilityto generate the energy which will indicate aliveness. When silence andunderstanding rule the sick room, the departing soul can hold possession of itsinstrument with clarity until the last minute and can make due preparation.Later, when more anent colour is known, only orange lights will be permitted inthe sick room of a dying person, and these will only be installed with dueceremony when there is assuredly no possibility of recovery. Orange aids thefocussing in the head, just as red stimulates [506] the solar plexus and greenhas a definite effect upon the heart and life streams.Certain types of music will be used when more in connection with sound isunderstood, but there is no music as yet which will facilitate the work of thesoul in abstracting itself from the body, though certain notes on the organ willbe found effective. At the exact moment of death, if a person’s own note issounded, it will coordinate the two streams of energy and eventually rupture thelife thread, but the knowledge of this is too dangerous to transmit yet and canonly later be given. I would indicate the future and the lines along whichfuture occult study will run.It will be found also that pressure on certain nerve centers and on certainarteries will facilitate the work. (This science of dying is held in custody, asmany students know, in Tibet.) Pressure on the jugular vein and on certain bignerves in the region of the head and on a particular spot in the medullaoblongata will be found helpful and effective. A definite science of death willinevitably later be elaborated, but only when the fact of the soul is recognizedand its relation to the body has been scientifically demonstrated.Mantric phrases will also be employed and definitely built into theconsciousness of the dying person by those around him, or employed deliberatelyand mentally by himself. The Christ demonstrated their use when he cried aloud,“Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.” And we have another instance inthe words, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.” The steady useof the Sacred Word chanted in an undertone or on a particular key (to which thedying man will be found to respond) may later constitute also a part of theritual of transition accompanied by the anointing with oil, as preserved in theCatholic Church. Extreme unction has an occult, scientific basis. The top of the[507] head of the dying man should also symbolically point towards the East andthe feet and the hands should be crossed. Sandalwood only should be burned inthe room and no incense of any other kind permitted, for sandalwood is theincense of the first or destroyer ray and the soul is in process of destroyingits habitation.This is all I can at this time communicate on the subject of death for theconsideration of the general public. But I conjure all of you to push the studyof death and its technique as far as possible and to carry forward occultinvestigation of this matter."},{"pageContent":"RULE TWELVEThe web pulsates. It contracts and expands. Let the magician seize the midwaypoint and thus release those “prisoners of the planet” whose note is right andjustly tuned to that which must be made.INTERLUDES AND CYCLES[511] We now come to the four rules which concern the physical plane. In manyways their understanding is far more difficult than was the case in the otherrules, in just the same way that practical application is far harder thantheorising. We can frequently think with clarity and desire rightly but theworking out into physical plane manifestation of the subjective ideas, under lawand constructively, is never an easy thing to do. It is however just at thispoint that a white magician begins to do his real work, and it is just here thathe encounters failure and finds that his inner grasp of reality does notnecessarily result in correct creative activity. In A Treatise on Cosmic Fire ,there will be found certain points of interest for us to consider, and I wouldlike to quote a few words from them:“It might be useful here to remember that in the work of creation the whitemagician avails himself of the current ray influences. When the fifth, third andseventh rays are in power, either coming in, at full meridian, or passing out,the work is much easier than when the second, sixth or fourth are dominant. Atthe present time, the seventh ray, as we know is rapidly dominating, and it isone of the easiest of the forces with which man has to work. Under this ray itwill be possible to build a new structure for the rapidly decaying civilisation,and to erect the new temple desired for the religious impulse. Under itsinfluence the work of the numerous unconscious magicians will be muchfacilitated.” Pages 1021-1022.It is apparent therefore that the day of opportunity is with us, and that thecoming generation can, if it so wishes, perform the magical work with many ofthe factors [512] present which will tend to produce satisfactory results. Thefifth ray is passing out, but its influence can still be felt; the third ray isat full meridian, and the seventh ray is rapidly coming into right activity.Much will consequently occur to make man successful, provided he can preserveconstantly a right orientation, purity of motive and of life, a stabilised andreceptive emotional body and that inner alignment which will make hispersonality a true vehicle for his soul or self.A very interesting analogy works out as we study the words: “The web pulsates.It contracts and expands”. The underlying thought is that of pulsation, ofdiastole and systole, of ebb and flow, of cyclic activity, of the day ofopportunity and the night of inactivity, of inflow and output, and of those manyappearances and disappearances which mark the sweep of all lives in all kingdomsand dimensions. This day and night cycle which is the inevitable mark ofmanifested existence has to be recognised. One of the things which everydisciple has to learn (putting the truth in the simplest terms) is to achievethat wisdom which is based on a knowledge of when to work and when to refrain,and on an understanding of those periods or interludes which are characterisedby speech and by silence. It is here that mistakes are made and here that manyworkers fail to make good.This entire rule might be given in the following paraphrase which will meritcareful thought and which I will elucidate somewhat.God breathes and His pulsating life emanates from the divine heart and manifestsas the vital energy of all forms. It flows, pulsating in its cycles, throughoutall nature. This constitutes the divine inhalation and exhalation. Between thisbreathing out and the breathing in comes a period of silence and the moment foreffective work. If disciples can learn to utilise these interludes, they canthen release the “prisoners of the planet,” which [513] is the objective of allmagical work, performed during this world period.With the manner in which this One Life of the solar system works in these vastinterludes of meditative silence, called technically a pralaya, we need notconcern ourselves. The activity of the Universal Mind and its comprehensivepurpose can only be perceived when each son of God enters consciously into hisdivine heritage. The mode of working by means of which our planetary Lifeutilises the cycles of silence concerns Him alone, and it must be rememberedthat each planetary Logos has a different pulsation, a varying periodicinterlude, and His Own unique method of procedure.What does concern the student of these Instructions however is how he canhimself attain a definite constructive activity in his interludes. Theseinterludes, for the purpose of our discussion, fall into three categories:1. Life interludes, or those periods wherein the spiritual man is out ofincarnation and has withdrawn into the egoic consciousness. These, for thelittle evolved, are practically nonexistent; they cycle in and out ofincarnation with amazing rapidity. The physical plane analogy of this rapidityof activity is to be found in the intense rushing to and fro of the ordinary manas he meets the exigencies of existence and also in the difficulty he evidencesin patience and in waiting and in achieving the meditative poise. As growthtakes place, the periods of withdrawal from incarnation steadily lengthen, untilthe point is reached when the periods out of physical manifestation greatlyexceed those spent in outer expression. Then the interlude dominates. Theperiods of outgoing (exhalation) and of inbreathing (inhalation) are relativelybrief and—the point to be emphasised—these two periods are coloured andcontrolled by the purposes of the soul, formulated and recorded on the mindduring the interlude between the two more active stages of experience. [514] Theinner life, slowly developed during the cyclic interludes, becomes thedominating factor. The man gradually becomes subjective in his attitude and thephysical plane expression is primarily then the result of the inner thought lifeand not so much the result of reaction to physical plane occurrences and therestlessness of the desire nature.2. The ebb and flow of daily life during a particular incarnation will alsodemonstrate its interludes, and these the aspirant has to learn to recognise andto utilise. He has to register the distinction between intense outgoingactivity, periods of withdrawal, and interludes wherein the outer life seemsstatic and free from active interest. This he must do if he is to avail himselffully of the opportunity which life experience is intended to furnish. The wholeof life is not concentrated in one furious continuous stretch of rushing forthto work, nor is it comprehended in one eternal siesta. It has normally its ownrhythmic beat and vibration and its own peculiar pulsation. Some lives changetheir rhythm and mode of activity every seven years; others alter every nine oreleven years. Still others work under shorter cycles and have months ofstrenuous endeavour followed by months of apparent non-effort. Some people againare so sensitively organised that, in the midst of work, events andcircumstances are so staged that they are forced into a temporary retirementwherein they assimilate the lessons learnt during the preceding period of work.Two groups of human beings work with apparently no physical plane ebb and flow,but manifest steadily an urge to work. These are people who are so littleevolved and so low down (if one might thus express it) on the ladder ofevolution and so predominantly animal that there is no mental reaction tocircumstances but simply a response to the call of physical needs, and the useof time for the satisfaction of desire. This never lets up [515] and thereforethere is little that can be called cyclic in their expression. They include theunthinking toiler and the uncivilised man. Then there are those men and womenwho are on the opposite scale, and have climbed relatively high on the ladder ofprogress. These are so emancipated from the purely physical and are so aware ofthe nature of desire that they have learnt to preserve a continuousactivity—based on discipline and service. They work consciously with cycles andunderstand somewhat their nature. They know the divine art of abstracting theirconsciousness into that of the soul in contemplation and can control and wiselyguide their work in the world of men. This is the lesson which all disciples arelearning and this is the high achievement of the initiates and trained workersof the race.3. The third type of interlude, and the one with which we are here primarilyconcerned as we consider the magical work on the physical plane, is theinterlude achieved and utilised during the meditation process. With this thestudent must familiarise himself, for otherwise he will be unable to work withpower. This interlude or period of intense silence differentiates itself intotwo parts:There is first of all the interlude which we call contemplation. I would remindyou of the definition given in a book by Evelyn Underhill which describescontemplation as “an interlude between two activities”. This period of silencesucceeds upon the activity (found so difficult by the beginner) of making thealignment between soul-mind-brain, of quieting the emotional body, and ofachieving that concentration and meditation which will serve to focus andreorient the mind upon a new world, and place it within the sphere of influenceof the soul. It is analogous to the period of inhalation. In this cycle, theoutgoing consciousness is gathered in and lifted up. When success crowns thiseffort, the consciousness then [516] slips out of what we call the personality,the mechanism aspect, and becomes a changed consciousness. The soul on its ownplane becomes active and of this activity the mind and brain are aware. From thestandpoint of personality activity, an interlude takes place. There is a pointof inspired waiting. The mechanism is entirely quiescent. The mind is heldsteady in the light and the soul in the meantime thinks, as is its habit, inunison with all souls, taps the resources of the Universal Mind, and formulatesits purposes in line with the universal plan. This cycle of recorded soulactivity is followed by what might be called the process of exhalation. Theinterlude comes to an end; the waiting mind again becomes active and in so faras it has been rightly oriented and held in a purely receptive attitude, itbecomes the interpreter and instrument of the soul, which has now turned the“light of its countenance upon the attentive personality”. Through that mediumit can now work out the plans formulated in the interlude of contemplation. Theemotional nature is swept by desire to make objective the plans with which thereoriented mind seeks to colour its experience, and subsequently the brainreceives the transmitted impression and the physical plane life is then adjustedso that those plans can properly materialise. This of course delineates amechanism, trained and adjusted and rightly responsive—a rare thing indeed tofind. The second part of the interlude only becomes possible when the first orcontemplative interlude has been achieved.The disciple who is seeking to cooperate with the Hierarchy of Masters and tomanifest this cooperation by active participation in Their work on the physicalplane has to learn to work not only through the contemplative realisation butthrough a scientific utilisation of the interludes, developed in breathing,between points of inhalation and exhalation in the purely physical sense of[517] the term. This is the true science and objective of pranayama. The brainconsciousness is necessarily involved. The interlude between breaths is onlycapable of right use when a man has achieved the power to follow the interludeof contemplation affecting the soul and the mind and the brain. Just as the mindhas been held in the light, and has been receptive to the soul impression so thebrain has to be held receptive to impression from the mind.One interlude therefore (from the standpoint of the united soul and personality)takes place after the period of soul inhalation, when the outgoing consciousnesshas been gathered inward, and the other takes place at the close of thatinterlude when the soul again becomes outgoing consciously to the objectiveworld; exhalation takes the place of inhalation and also has its interlude. Thedisciple has to learn facility in utilising these two soul interludes—one ofwhich produces effects upon the mind, and the other upon the brain.There is, as always, a physical plane analogy of this process of divineinhalation and exhalation with its two interludes of silence and of thought. Letme again reiterate the consequences of these interludes. In the higherinterlude, abstract or divine thought impresses the soul and is transmitted tothe waiting mind; in the other, the mind, through concrete thought and anattempt to embody divine thought in form, impresses the brain and producesaction through the medium of the physical body.Students of occultism who have demonstrated their devotion and their mentalpoise, and who (to use the ancient formula of the schools of meditation) havekept the five commandments and the five rules, and have achieved right poise,can begin to use the interludes between the two aspects of physical breathingfor intense activity and the use of the power of will to produce magicaleffects. [518] The consciousness, focussed in the brain and having participatedin the work of contemplation can now proceed to the work of materialising theplan upon the physical plane by the focussed energy of will, used in the silenceby the conscious man. As can be seen, these breathing interludes are also two innumber, after inhalation and after exhalation and the more experienced thedisciple, the longer will be the interlude and the greater the opportunitytherefore for focussed magical work and for the utterance of those words ofpower which will make divine purpose to be .It would not be right nor proper for me to enlarge here upon the work ofutilising these “midway points”, as they are called in Rule XII, which themagician seizes and which he employs in constructive work. In them heconsciously uses energy, directing it as he sees fit; in them, he consciouslycomes in contact with those forces and lives which he can employ and command tobring to him what he requires for the furtherance of spiritual purposes and forthe work of constructing those forms and organisms which may be needed; in them,he goes forward with the work of releasing the “prisoners of the planet”; and inthem he becomes conscious of his fellow workers, of the group of world mystics,and of the hierarchy of souls.In Instructions such as these, which are to be read by the general public itwould be most unwise to give more explicit directions. Enough has been leftunsaid to make it impossible for any but a deeply learned student to arrive atthe necessary correlations which will enable him to carry forward the “work ofthe interludes”, in which alone magical work can be done. You might ask: Why isthis so? Why are the secrets of the breath so carefully guarded? Because theefficacy of black magic is found right here. There is a point where both blackand white magic employ necessarily one similar stage in the work. [519] Certainmen, with potent wills and clear and trained minds, but animated by purelyselfish purpose, have learnt to use the lower of the two soul interludes—thatwhich concerns the relation of mind and brain. Through an intense applicationand a knowledge of the science of the centres they have been enabled to work outtheir selfish plans and to impose their will and mental authority upon the“prisoners of the planet”. Thus they have wrought much harm. They have no desireto participate in the higher interlude wherein the soul is active, and the mindresponsive. The intellectual activity and the responsiveness of the brain tomind impression is all that concerns them. Both white and black magicians, asyou see, employ the lower interlude, and both know the significance of thephysical breathing interludes. But the white magician works from the soul levelout into the manifested world and seeks to carry out the divine plan, whilst theblack magician works from the level of the intellect as he seeks to achieve hisown separative ends. The difference is not only that of motive, but also ofalignment and the radius of the consciousness and its field of expansion. Henceyou will see why such extreme caution is evidenced by all true teachers, as theyendeavor to teach the nature of the magical work. Only the tested and the true,only the unselfish and the pure can be given the full instructions. All can begiven the information concerning the major interludes of soul-mind andmind-brain. Only a few can as yet be trusted with the significant informationconcerning the minor interludes, carried on in the physical body between breathsand in the brain consciousness.One other point might be of interest before I proceed to speak of the “prisonersof the planet” and the work to be done with them.Humanity at this time is passing through a cycle of excessive activity. For thefirst time in human history [520] this activity embraces mankind on a largescale in the entire three aspects of the personality consciousness. The physicalbodies, the emotional and mental states of consciousness are all in a conditionof potent upheaval. This unified triple activity is increased by a cycle ofequally intense planetary activity, due to the coming in of a new age, thepassing of the sun into a new sign in the Zodiac and the preparationconsequently going on to fit man to work easily with the new forces and energiesplaying upon him. At the centre of human life, the integrating group of newWorld Servers must meet therefore a very real need. Their work must primarily beto keep such a close link with the soul of humanity—made up of all souls ontheir own level of being—through their own organised soul activity that therewill always be those who can “work in the interludes” and so keep the planprogressing and the vision before the eyes of those who cannot as yet themselvesenter into the high and secret place. They have, as I oft times have said, tolearn to work subjectively, and this they must do in order to preserve—in thiscycle of activity and exoteric expression—the power, latent in all, to withdrawinto the centre. They constitute the door, speaking symbolically. Capacities andpowers can die out for lack of use; the power of divine abstraction and thefaculty to find what has been called “the golden path which leads to the clearpool and from thence to the Temple of Retreat” must not be lost. This is thefirst work of the Group of World Mystics, and they must keep the path open andthe way clear of obstructions. Otherwise white magic might temporarily die outand the selfish purposes of the form nature assume undue control. This direevent happened in Atlantean days and the then group of workers had to withdrawfrom all external activity and “abstract the divine mysteries, hiding them awayfrom the curious and the unworthy.”[521] Now a new attempt is being made to free the “prisoners of the planet”. TheHierarchy, through the Group of World Servers now in process of formation isseeking to externalise itself, and to restore the mysteries to humanity to whomthey truly belong. If the attempt is to succeed it is basically necessary thatall of you who have sensed the vision or seen a part of the intended plan shouldre-dedicate yourselves to the service of humanity, should pledge yourselves tothe work of aiding to the utmost of your ability (ponder those words and searchout their significance) all world servers, and should sacrifice your time andgive of your money to further the endeavor of the Great Ones. Rest not, aboveall, from your meditation work; keep the inner link; think truth at all times.The need and the opportunity are great and all possible helpers are being calledto the forefront of the battle. All can be used in some way, if the true natureof sacrifice is grasped, if skill in action is developed and if work withoutattachment is the effort of each and all of you.THE PRISONERS OF THE PLANETHaving dealt with the work of the magician in his own interior consciousness andwith the need for him to learn the importance of seizing the “midway point” inhis work of using the interludes, both major and minor, we come now to theconsideration of the objective of all his work, that is if he is a true whitemagician. It is stated clearly that this is to release the “prisoners of theplanet”. It would profit us therefore to study who these prisoners are and whatis the mode of their release to be employed by the working disciple.These prisoners of the planet fall into two major groups, which embodynecessarily certain subdivisions. Inclusively they constitute all forms of lifethat we usually call subhuman, but these words must be given a [522] widerconnotation than is normally the case. They must be extended to include alllives which are embodied in forms.The two divisions are as follows:First, the substance of all forms, or the multiplicity of tiny atomic liveswhich, through the power of thought, are drawn into the form aspect throughwhich all existences or all souls, mineral, vegetable, animal and the animalbody of man, express themselves. This opens up a wide horizon and coverspractically the work of creation on the physical plane so that we cannot eventouch upon it. Under the Law of Magnetic Attraction and owing to the impulsiveactivity of the Universal Mind as it works out the purposes of the solar Logosor of the planetary Logos these constituents of the matter of space, these atomsof substance, are drawn together, manipulated in a rhythmic manner and heldtogether in form. Through this mode of creation, existences come intomanifestation, participate in the experience of their particular cycle, whetherit is ephemeral, like the life of a butterfly or relatively permanent like theensouling life of the planetary deity, and vanish. The two aspects concerned,spirit and matter, are brought thus into a close rapport, and necessarily exertan effect upon each other. Matter, so-called, is energised or “lifted up” in theoccult sense of the term by its contact with spirit so-called. Spirit, in itsturn, is enabled to enhance its vibration through the medium of its experiencein matter. The bringing together of these two divine aspects results in theemergence of a third, which we call the soul, and through the medium of thesoul, spirit develops a sentiency and a conscious awareness and capacity torespond which remains its permanent possession when the divorce between the twocomes around eventually and cyclically.Much anent this will be found in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire [523] and there is noneed for me to repeat myself here. This second treatise is intended to be morepractical and generally useful. It deals primarily with the training of theaspirant so that he can, in his turn, act as a conscious creator, and as heworks serve the higher ends of the Life which enfolds him. Thus he aids in thematerialising of the plans of God. The training of the aspirant, the indicatingto him of possible trends and lines of evolution, and the definition of theunderlying purpose is all that it is wise to impart at the present stage inwhich the average aspirant finds himself. This has been attempted in theseInstructions and there has been given also some new teaching anent the emotionalvehicle. In the next century, when man’s equipment is better developed and whena truer meaning of group activity is available, it will be possible to conveymore information, but the time is not yet. All that is possible for me is togrope for those feeble words which will somewhat clothe the thought. As theyclothe it they limit it and I am guilty of creating new prisoners who mustultimately be released. All books are prison houses of ideas, and only whenspeech and writing are superseded by telepathic communication and by intuitiveinterplay will the plan and the technique of its expression be grasped in aclearer fashion. I talk now in symbols; I manipulate words in order to create acertain impression; I construct a thought-form which, when dynamic enough, canimpress the brain of a transmitting agent, such as yourself. But, as I do so, Iknow well how much must be left unrelated and how seldom it is possible to domore than point out a cosmology, macrocosmic or microcosmic, which will sufficeto convey a temporary picture of divine reality.I talk to you of laws, and I seek to formulate them intelligently but I amdealing really with those divine impulses which emanate from a cosmic Creatorand become laws as they produce effects in the matter of space, meeting [524]therein practically no resistance. Other divine impulses which also cyclicallystream forth have not as yet carried such a strong vibration, and have nottherefore been as powerful as the vibration of the combined substance affected.These latter are those impulses to which we give the name spiritual, and whichwe look forward to seeing established as the laws of the new era, and which willthen supersede or coalesce with the present laws of the universe. Together theywill bring in the new synthetic world.But how can the whole be comprehended by the part? How can the entire plan benoted by a soul which sees as yet but a tiny fraction of the structure? Bearthis steadily in mind as you study and ponder these Instructions and rememberthat, in the light of the future knowledge of humanity, all that is hereconveyed is like a fifth reader in grammar school to the text books utilised bya college professor. It will serve however to graduate the aspirant out of theHall of Learning into the Hall of Wisdom, if he uses the information given.Learn to be telepathic and intuitive. Then these forms of words and these ideas,clothed in form, will not be needed. You can then stand face to face with nakedtruth, and live and work in the terrain of ideas and not in the world of forms .So we leave the vast expanse of lives, covered by the unmeaning phrase “atomicsubstance,” and pass on secondly to a consideration of those prisoners of theplanet which can be more easily contacted, whose general plight can be morespecifically understood, and who stand in a closer relation to man. Men are notyet equipped to comprehend the nature of those units of electrical energy whichembody what we call the soul of all things and which has been termed the “animamundi”—the life and soul of the One in whom all embodied existences live andmove and have their being. [525]To do this, it will be necessary to understand somewhat the part that the fourthkingdom in nature plays in relation to the whole, and the purpose for which thataggregate of forms which we call the human family exists. We must study thisfrom the standpoint of the relation of the fourth kingdom to the whole, and notfrom the standpoint of man’s own individual progressive development and the parthe plays as a human unit within the ring-pass-not of the human family. We willuse the word humanity, and speak of its mission and function in the big schemeand the working out of the plan. We will infer a humanity which is composed ofall the sons of men. It includes on the one hand the hierarchy of adepts whohave deliberately incarnated on the physical plane in order to work within thelimits of the human kingdom, and on the other we find the undeveloped typeswhich are more animal than human. Between these two extremes we find the manyand varied types, the developed and the undeveloped, the intelligent and theunintelligent—all who are covered by the word man.Humanity constitutes a centre of energy within the cosmos, capable of threeactivities.I. First of all, humanity is responsive to the inflow of spiritual energy. Thispours into it from the cosmos, and speaking symbolically these energies arebasically three in number:1. Spiritual energy, as we inadequately term it. This emanates from God theFather and reaches humanity from the level of what is technically called themonadic plane, from the archetypal sphere, the highest source of which a man canbecome conscious. To this type of energy there are few so equipped that they canrespond. It is for the majority practically nonexistent. I use the words “Godthe Father” in the sense of the One Self-Existent Life, or Absolute Being.2. Sentient energy—the energy which makes man a [526] soul. It is the principleof awareness, the faculty of consciousness, that something, inherent in matter(when brought into relation with spirit), which awakens responsiveness to anouter and far-reaching field of contacts. It is that which eventually developsin man a recognition of the whole, of the self, and which leads him toself-determination and self-realisation. When these are developed, as they arenot in the subhuman kingdoms, a man can become aware of the first type ofenergy, mentioned above. This energy of sentient consciousness comes from thesecond aspect of deity, from the heart of the sun, just as the first,technically but symbolically speaking, emanates from the central spiritual sun.The parallel to these two types of force in a human being is the nervous energyworking through the nervous system with headquarters in the brain, and the lifeenergy which is seated in the heart.3. Pranic energy, or vitality. This is that vital force, inherent in matteritself and in which all forms are immersed, as they constitute functioning partsof the greater form. To this all forms respond. This type of energy comes fromthe physical sun and works actively upon the vital bodies of every form in thenatural world, including the physical form of humanity itself.In the terminology of the Ageless Wisdom, these three are called electric fire,solar fire, and fire by friction, and their purpose in relation to each other issummed up for us in the words of The Secret Doctrine as follows:“Matter is the Vehicle for the manifestation of Soul on this plane of existence,and Soul is the Vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation of Spirit andthese three are a Trinity, synthesized by Life which pervades them all.” S. D.I. 80.Humanity, being the meeting-place for all the three types of energy, constitutestherefore a “midway point,” [527] in the consciousness of the Creator. This“midway point” has to be seized by the active creating agent in some such manneras the aspirant has to learn to seize his midway points in the tiny bit ofmagical and creative work which he is seeking to carry forward. Humanity isintended to be the medium wherein certain activities can be instituted. It is inreality the brain of the planetary Deity, its many units being analogous to thebrain cells in the human apparatus. Just as the human brain, made up of aninfinite number of sentient responsive cells, can be suitably impressed whenquiescence has been achieved, and can become the medium of expression for theplans and purposes of the soul, transmitting its ideas via the mind, so theplanetary Deity, working under the inspiration of the Universal Mind, canimpress humanity with the purposes of God and produce consequent effects in theworld of phenomena.The members of the hierarchy represent those who have achieved peace andquiescence, and can be impressed; aspirants and disciples represent those braincells which are beginning to fall into the larger divine rhythm. They arelearning the nature of responsiveness. The mass of men are like the millions ofunused brain cells which the psychologists and scientists tell us we possess butdo not employ. This analogy you can think out in greater detail for yourself,but even superficially it will be apparent to you that when this point isgrasped, the purpose for which humanity exists, the objective before the groupof world mystics and workers, and the ideal set before the individual aspirant,are the same as in the individual meditation; the achieving of that focussedattention and mental quiet wherein reality can be contacted, the true and thebeautiful can be registered, divine purpose can be recorded, and it becomespossible to transmit to the phenomenal form, upon the physical plane, the neededenergy whereby the subjective [528] realisation can be materialised. Theaspirant does this in connection with his own soul purpose if he is successfulin his endeavour; the disciple is learning to do this in relation to grouppurpose, and the initiate cooperates with the planetary purpose. Theseconstitute the inner group of vitally alive brain cells in the planetary brain,the entire human group, and it is evident that the more powerful their unitedvibration and the clearer the light which they reflect and transmit, the morerapidly will the present inert mass of human cells be brought into activity. Theoccult hierarchy is to the planetary Life what the light in the head is to theaverage awakened disciple, only on so much vaster a scale, and with such anadequate inner alignment that students such as those who read these Instructionscannot understand the true significance of the words. The point to be grasped isthat through humanity on the physical plane, the nature of reality will berevealed; the true and the beautiful will be manifested; the divine plan willeventually work out, and that energy be transmitted to all forms in nature whichwill enable the inner spiritual reality to emerge.II. The second type of activity of which man is capable is an intenseprogressive and spiral development within the human ring-pass-not. This sentencecovers the mode of development and the entire procedure of unfoldment of all theevolving units that we call men. With this I seek not here to deal. The historyof the human structural growth, the entire field of the unfolding humanconsciousness and the history of all races and peoples that have lived or areliving upon our planet can be dealt with under this heading. It concerns the usehumanity has made of all the energies available within the natural world ofwhich it is a part, inherent in the fourth kingdom itself and coming to it alsofrom the world of spiritual realities. [529]III. The third type of activity which should occupy the attention of humanity,and one as yet little understood, is that it should act as a transmitting centreof spiritual forces—soul force and spiritual energy united and combined—to theprisoners of the planet and to the lives, held in embodied existence in theother kingdoms of nature. Human beings are apt to be primarily concerned withtheir higher group relations, with their return to the Father’s home, and withthe trend which we call “upwards” and away from the phenomenal world. They areprincipally occupied with the finding of the centre within the form aspect, thatwhich we call the soul, and, having found it, with the work then of acquaintingthemselves with that soul and thus finding peace. This is right and in line withdivine intention but it is not all of the plan for man, and when this remainsthe prime objective, a man is dangerously near falling into the snare ofspiritual selfishness and separateness.When the centre is found by any human being and he becomes at-one with, andenters into relation with his soul, then he automatically shifts his position inthe human family and—again speaking in symbols—finds himself part of the centreof light and understanding which we call, esoterically, the occult hierarchy,the cloud of witnesses, the disciples of the Christ, and other names accordingto the trend of the disciple’s convictions. This hierarchy is also attempting toexternalise itself in the form of the group of World Workers, and when a man hasfound his soul and the principle of unity is sufficiently revealed to him heshifts also into this more exoteric group. All who find the centre do not as yetlink up with both the interior and exterior groups. Then he is pledged to themagical work, to the salvaging of souls, to the releasing of the prisoners ofthe planet. This is the goal for humanity as a whole, and when all the sons ofmen have attained the objective, these prisoners will be released. [530] Thereason for this will be that the magical work will be carried forwardintelligently and perfectly and human beings in group formation will act astransmitters of pure spiritual energy, which will vivify every form in everykingdom in nature.In considering the problem of the prisoners of the planet and their eventualrelease, it must be remembered that one of the forces which lie back of theentire evolutionary scheme is that of the Principle of Limitation. This is theprimary impulse which brings about the act of creation, and is intimately linkedwith that of will and its lower reflection, desire. Will is desire, formulatedso clearly and carried so powerfully to an intelligent climax that the mode ofits materialisation is grasped with such accuracy and energised with such intentthat the result is inescapable. But pure will is only possible to a coordinatedthinker, to truly self-conscious entities. Desire is instinctual or ratherinherent in all forms, for all forms and organisms constitute part of someprimary thinker and are influenced by the powerful intent of that primary force.The Principle of Limitation therefore is the outcome of the purposeful will andformulated desire of some thinking Being, and governs consequently theform-taking process of all incarnated lives. This Principle of Limitationcontrols the scope of an incarnation, sets its measure and rhythm, determinesthe radius of its influence, and brings about that illusory appearance ofreality which we call manifestation.The “prisoners of the planet” fall into two categories:1. Those lives which act under the influence of a conscious purpose, and who“limit the life that is in them” for a time. They consciously take form, knowingthe end from the beginning. These Beings in their turn fall into three maingroups. [531]a. The Being Who is the life of our planet, the One in Whom we live and move andhave our being. This being, or sum total of organised lives is sometimes calledthe planetary Logos, sometimes the Ancient of Days, sometimes God, and sometimesthe One Life.b. Those lives who constitute the Principle of Limitation in a kingdom ofnature. The Life that is, for instance, expressing itself through the medium ofthe animal kingdom is a self-conscious intelligent entity, working in fullawareness of intent and objective, and limiting his sphere of activity in orderto provide due opportunity and expression for the myriad lives that find theirlife and being and sustenance in him. See you how the law of sacrifice runsthroughout creation.c. The sons of mind, human souls, solar Angels, the divine sons of God who infull self-consciousness work out certain well seen ends through the medium ofthe human family.2. Those lives who are limited in form because they are not self-conscious butare unconscious constituent parts of a greater form. They have not yet evolvedto the point where they are self-conscious entities.It might be said that this second category includes all existences, but the lineof demarcation between self-produced limitation and unrealised form-taking liesentirely in the realm of consciousness. Some lives are prisoners and know it.Others are prisoners and know it not. The clue to suffering lies right here inthe realm of mind. Pain and agony, rebellion and the conscious urge towardsbetterment and the changing of conditions are only found where what we callindividuality is present, where the “I” complex is controlling, and where aself-conscious entity is functioning. There is of course [532] the equivalent topain in kingdoms below the human, but it enters into another differentiation. Itis not self-related. Subhuman forms of life suffer and undergo discomfort andare subject to the throes of death but they lack memory and prevision, andpossess not that mental apprehension which will enable them to relate past andpresent and anticipate the future. They are exempt from the agony of foreboding.Their entire reaction to what are called evil conditions is so different to thatof humanity that it is difficult for us to grasp it. The Old Commentarydescribes these two groups in the following terms:“The Sons of God, who know and see and hear (and knowing, know they know) sufferthe pain of conscious limitation. Deep in the inmost depths of conscious being,their lost estate of liberty eats like a canker. Pain, sickness, poverty andloss are seen as such, and from them every son of God revolts. He knows that inhimself, as once he was before he entered prisoner into form, he knew not pain.Sickness and death, corruption and disease, they touched him not. The riches ofthe universe were his, and naught he knew of loss.“The lives that enter into form alone with lives self-conscious, the deva liveswhich build the forms indwelt by all the Sons of God, they know not pain or lossor poverty. The form decays, the other forms retire, and that which is requiredto nourish and keep strong the outer, lacks. But lacking also will and plannedintent, they feel no aggravation and know no clear revolt.”A word about pain might be in place here, though I have naught of an abstrusenature to communicate anent the evolution of the human hierarchy through themedium of pain. The devas do not suffer pain as does mankind. Their rate ofrhythm is steadier although in line with the Law. They learn through applicationto the work of building and through incorporation into the form of that which isbuilt. They grow through appreciation [533] of and joy in the forms built andthe work accomplished. The devas build and humanity breaks and through theshattering of the forms man learns through discontent. Thus is acquiescence inthe work of the greater Builders achieved. Pain is that upward struggle throughmatter which lands a man at the Feet of the Logos; pain is the following of theline of the greatest resistance and thereby reaching the summit of the mountain;pain is the smashing of the form and the reaching of the inner fire; pain is thecold of isolation which leads to the warmth of the central sun; pain is theburning in the furnace in order finally to know the coolness of the water oflife; pain is the journeying into the far country, resulting in the welcome tothe Father’s Home; pain is the illusion of the Father’s disowning, which drivesthe prodigal straight to the Father’s heart; pain is the cross of utter loss,that renders back the riches of the eternal bounty; pain is the whip that drivesthe struggling builder to carry to utter perfection the building of the Temple.The uses of pain are many, and they lead the human soul out of darkness intolight, out of bondage into liberation, out of agony into peace. That peace, thatlight and that liberation, with the ordered harmony of the cosmos are for allthe sons of men.With the problem of limitation is closely linked that of liberation. Into theprison house of form enter all that live; some enter consciously and someunconsciously, and this we call birth, appearance, incarnation, manifestation.Immediately there sweeps into activity another law or the working out of anactive principle which we call the Law of Cycles. This is the principle ofperiodic appearance—a beneficent operation of the lower wisdom of innatedivinity, for it produces that sequence of the states of consciousness which weterm Time. This produces therefore in the world field of awareness a [534]gradual and slow growth towards self-expression, self-appreciation, andself-realisation. To these principles of Limitation and of Cycles is addedanother principle, that of Expansion. This brings about the development ofconsciousness so that the latent germ of sentiency or of sensitive response toenvironment may be fostered in the living unit.We have therefore three Principles:1. The Principle of Limitation.2. The Principle of Periodic Manifestation.3. The Principle of Expansion.These three Principles together constitute the factors underlying the Law ofEvolution as men call it. They bring about the imprisonment of the Life in itsvarious appearances or aspects; they produce the environing forms, and they leadthe imprisoned lives on into ever more educational prison houses. Finally thetime arrives when the Principle of Liberation becomes active and a transition iseffected out of a prison house which cramps and distorts into one which providesadequate conditions for the next development of consciousness.It is interesting here to note that death is governed by the Principle ofLiberation, and not by that of Limitation. Death is only recognised as a factorto be dealt with by self-conscious lives and is only misunderstood by humanbeings, who are the most glamoured and deluded of all incarnated lives.The next point to be noted is that each kingdom in nature acts in two ways:1. As the liberator of the kingdom of forms which has not reached its particularstage of conscious awareness.2. As the prison house of lives that have transmitted into it from the level ofconsciousness next beneath it. [535]Let it be remembered always that each field of awareness in its boundariesconstitutes a prison, and that the objective of all work of liberation is torelease the consciousness and expand its field of contacts. Where there areboundaries of any kind, where a field of influence is circumscribed, and wherethe radius of contact is limited there you have a prison. Ponder on thisstatement for it holds much of truth. Where there is an apprehension of a visionand of a wide unconquered territory of contacts then there will inevitably be asense of imprisonment and of cramping. Where there is realisation of worlds toconquer, of truths to be learnt, of conquests to be made, of desires to beachieved, of knowledges to be mastered, there you will have a festering sense oflimitation, goading on the aspirant to renewed effort and driving the livingentity on along the path of evolution. Instinct, governing the vegetable andanimal kingdoms, develops into intellect in the human family. Later intellectmerges into intuition and intuition into illumination. When the superhumanconsciousness is evoked these two—intuition and illumination—take the place ofinstinct and of intelligence.Illumination—what does that lead to? Straight to the summit of achievement, tothe fulfilment of cyclic destiny, to the emergence of the radiant glory, towisdom, power, God consciousness. These words however mean but little or nothingin comparison with a Reality which can only be sensed by any human being whenhis intuition is awakened and his mind illumined.Grasping these facts anent imprisonment how, to be practical, can a man become areleasing agent for the “prisoners of the planet”? What can humanity as a wholeachieve along this line? What can the individual do?The task of humanity fails primarily into three divisions of labour. Threegroups of prisoners can be released [536] and will eventually find their way outof their prison house through the instrumentality of man. Already human beingsare working in all three fields.1. Prisoners within the human form. This involves working with one’s fellow men.2. Prisoners within the animal kingdom, and already much is being done in thisfield.3. Prisoners within the forms of the vegetable world. A beginning has been madehere.Much work is being accomplished by man for men, and through the agency ofscientific, religious and educational endeavour, the human consciousness issteadily expanding until one by one the Sons of God are breaking through theirlimitations into the world of souls. In the retrospect of history, the pictureof the emerging prisoner, Man, can be seen in clear delineation. Little bylittle he has mastered the planetary boundaries; little by little, he has grownfrom the stage of cave man to that of a Shakespeare, a Newton, a Leonardo daVinci, an Einstein, a St. Francis of Assisi, to a Christ and a Buddha. Thecapacity of man to achieve in any field of human expression seems practicallyunlimited, and if the past few thousand years have seen such a stupendousgrowth, what shall we see in the next five thousand years? If prehistoric man,little more than an animal, has grown into the genius, what unfoldment is notpossible as more and more of innate divinity makes its presence felt? Thesuperman is with us. What will the world manifest when all mankind is tendingtowards a concrete manifestation of superhuman powers?Man’s consciousness is being released in varying directions and dimensions. Itis expanding into the world of spiritual realities and beginning to embrace thefifth or spiritual kingdom, the kingdom of souls. It is interpenetrating,through scientific research, the world of [537] super-human endeavour, andinvestigating the many aspects of the Form of God, and of the forms thatconstitute the Form.In touching upon the work of humanity in releasing the units of which it isconstructed, and in releasing the prisoners in the vegetable and animalkingdoms, I want to point out two things, both of profound importance:First, in order to release the “prisoners of the planet” that come under thetitle of subhuman, man has to work under the influence of the intuition ; whenworking to release his fellow men he has to know the meaning of Illumination.When the true nature of Service is comprehended, it will be found that it is anaspect of that divine energy which works always under the destroyer aspect, forit destroys the forms in order to release. Service is a manifestation of thePrinciple of Liberation, and of this principle, death and service, constitutetwo aspects. Service saves, liberates and releases, on various levels, theimprisoned consciousness. The same statements can be made of death. But unlessservice can he rendered from an intuitive understanding of all the facts in thecase, interpreted intelligently, and applied in a spirit of love upon thephysical plane, it fails to fulfil its mission adequately.When the factor of spiritual illumination enters into that service, you havethose transcendent Lights which have illumined the way of humanity and haveacted like search-lights, thrown out into the great ocean of consciousness,revealing to man the Path he can and must go.I would like to point out another thing. I have given no specific rules forreleasing the prisoners of the planet. I have made no classification of theprisons and their prisoners, nor of methods of work nor of techniques ofrelease.I urge only upon each and all who read these Instructions [538] the necessityfor renewed effort to fit themselves for service by a conscious and deliberateeffort to develop the intuition and to achieve illumination. Every human beingwho reaches the goal of light and wisdom automatically has a field of influencewhich extends both up and down, and which reaches both inwards to the source oflight and outwards into the “fields of darkness”. When he has thus attained hewill become a conscious centre of life giving force, and will be so withouteffort. He will stimulate, energise and vivify to fresh efforts all lives thathe contacts, be they his fellow aspirants, or an animal, or a flower. He willact as a transmitter of light in the darkness. He will dispel the glamour aroundhim and let in the radiance of reality.When large numbers of the sons of men can so act, then the human family willenter upon its destined work of planetary service. Its mission is to act as abridge between the world of spirit and the world of material forms. All gradesof matter meet in man, and all the states of consciousness are possible to him.Mankind can work in all directions and lift the subhuman kingdoms into heavenand bring heaven down to earth."},{"pageContent":"RULE THIRTEENThe magician must recognize the four; note in his work the shade of violet theyevidence, and thus constructed the shadow. When this is so, the shadow clothesitself, and the four become the seven.THE QUARTERNARIES TO BE RECOGNISED[541] This rule is for me one of the most difficult to explain, the reason forthis being threefold:One: The number of people in physical incarnation at this time who can work in atruly creative manner and profit by the information given in this Rule isexceedingly few. Only to the white magician, and he experienced in his work, canthe real interpretation be given. There is much danger in imparting thesignificance of these rules to those who are not qualified in themselves to workcorrectly. We will, therefore, consider the qualifications required of those whoare entitled to this knowledge so that the student can begin to develop inhimself that which may be lacking.Two: The danger of minute and detailed instructions consists in the fact thatwere they now to be given to the world, we should be flooded with thought-formsand these thought-forms would be created in order to express purely selfishdesire and mental matter would be swept into activity in line with the fanciesand the whims of the undeveloped along spiritual lines. It must be rememberedthat every human thought, whether the potent mass thoughts or individual dynamicideas, must eventually emerge objectively on the physical plane. This is aninevitable and unalterable rule and due consideration of this law which governsmental substance will show the danger of wrong thought and the power of right.The potency of human thought at this time is primarily of mass description, forfew there are who can think creatively. Public opinion, mass ideas, thetendencies of human [542] desire and thought, are not at this time of thehighest order, and the physical precipitation of these vague and inchoatethoughts distinguished by a vast similarity, and coloured by selfish intent andpersonal behest, and based upon likes and dislikes, prejudices and longings, canbe seen in the most interesting precipitation. The vast assembly of insectswhich now haunt our planet and cause increasing concern to the scientist,agriculturist, and all those dealing with the welfare of the human animal, arethe direct result of thought precipitation.I have not time to enlarge upon this fact, but I can assure you that as menlearn to think with more unselfishness and with greater purity, and as maliceand hatred and competition give place to brotherhood, kindness and cooperation,the insect pest, as it is now called, will most surely die out.Three: Another difficulty which I experience in elucidating these rules lies inthe fact that it is today more easy to prove the fact that there is a realm ofmind than it is to prove that there is a realm of the ether, even thoughscientists use the word widely. This rule concerns the four grades of ethericsubstance which constitute the etheric envelope of all forms in nature, from amountain to an ant, and from a plant to an atom. Certain scientists recognizethe fact of an etheric body, vast numbers do not, and from the standpoint of themasses of humanity, it remains unrecognized. That which lies closest to us andin our immediate foreground is often overlooked, and it has interested those ofus who teach and guide to note how much emphasis is laid upon psychic and astralphenomena, and how little attention is paid to the more obvious and more easilydiscerned etheric forms and forces! Given a slight change in the present mode ofvisual focussing it will be found that the human eye is capable of including anentirely new field of perception and of awareness. Blindly men introvert their[543] consciousness and become aware of astral objects and that illusive worldof ever changing forms in which we live and move and have our being, and yet,they fail to see that which lies immediately before them.These three difficulties of:1. Lack of qualification,2. Dangers inherent in unconscious form-building.3. Etheric blindness,make it well nigh impossible for me to do full justice to this rule and toelucidate the work on etheric levels, and hence the relative brevity of theelucidation.In dealing with the subject of qualification and answering the question: Whatconstitutes the equipment needed by a white magician? I would say one thing:—allstudents realize that certain requirements must be met if a man is to beentrusted with any measure of understanding of the technique of the Great Work.I take it for granted, however, that the character qualifications are not thoseto which our question refers. All aspirants know, and down the ages have beentaught, that a clean mind and a pure heart, love of truth, and a life of serviceand unselfishness, are prime prerequisites, and where they are lacking, naughtavails and none of the great secrets can be imparted. You might well say here:We have also been taught that there exist those who work in the four ethers andwho undoubtedly perform magical deeds, yet who do not possess this essentialpurity and loving-kindness to which reference has been made. This is undoubtedlytrue; they belong to a group of workers in matter whom we call Black Magicians;they are highly developed intellectually and can motivate mental substance ormind stuff in such a manner that it can achieve objectivity on the physicalplane and bring about their deep intent. About this group there is muchmisunderstanding and profound ignorance. It is perhaps as well, [544] for theirdestiny is tied up with the future race, the sixth, and their end and thecessation of their activities will come about in that far distant aeon which istechnically called the Sixth Round. The final break or division between theso-called black and white forces, for this particular world cycle, will takeplace during the period of the sixth root race in the present round. Towards theclose of the sixth root race, before the emergence of the seventh, we shall havethe true Armageddon about which so much has been taught. A small cycle,corresponding to this final battle and cleavage, will appear during the sixthsubrace which is now in process of formation. The world war which has just takenplace and our present cycle of separativeness and upheaval, do not constitutethe real Armageddon. The war which is told to us in the Mahabharata and thepresent war had the roots of their trouble and the seeds of the disasters whichthey brought about, one in the lower and one in the higher astral world.Selfishness and desire of a low order were the impulses back of them both. Thecoming great division will have its roots in the mental world and willconsummate in the sixth subrace. In the sixth root race it will have the seedsof portentous disaster in the coordinated triplicity of mind, astralism, andphysical nature, which will bring about a climaxing moment for the planetaryduality.Beyond that we need not go, for the humanity of the sixth round will be sodifferent in nature to ours and those who will differentiate into the black andthe white forces will be so unlike what we now understand by the words, that weneed not concern ourselves with that far distant problem.Let it be remembered that the true black magician (I refer not here to a personwith a tendency to black magic) is a soulless entity. He is a being in whom theEgo is—as [545] we understand the term today—non-existent. It is oft overlookedand seldom grasped or told that they, therefore, do not exist in physicalbodies. Their world is ever the world of illusion. They work, from the lowermental plane, on desire matter and on the sentient desire bodies of those on thephysical plane who are swept by delusion and held in the bonds of extremeselfishness and self-centeredness. What the ignorant call a black magician onthe physical plane is only some man or woman sensitive to or en rapport with atrue black magician on the astral plane. This relationship is only possible whenthere have been many lives of selfishness, low desire, perverted intellectualaspiration, and love of the lower psychism, and this only when the man has beenheld willingly in thrall by them. Such men and women are few and far between,for unadulterated selfishness is rare indeed. Where it exists, it is exceedinglypotent, as are all one-pointed tendencies.The clue to the requirements of a more esoteric kind is given to us in RuleXIII. “The magician must recognize the four.” He has presumably built up a finecharacter. He has educated himself for service. His aspiration is true andsteady. He is living purely and unselfishly. He has mastered somewhat themeaning of meditation. He now has to begin to train himself in what is called“occult recognition.”This rule is a most interesting example of the many connotations and numerouscorrespondences which can be conveyed in a few simple words. We are told that hemust “recognize the four”. The Treatise on Cosmic Fire tells us:“This means literally that the magician must be in a position to discriminatebetween the different ethers and to note the special hue of the differentlevels, thereby insuring a balanced building of the ‘shadow.’ He ‘recognizes’them, in the occult sense; that is, he knows their note [546] and key and isaware of the particular type of energy they embody. Enough emphasis has not beenlaid upon the fact that the three higher levels of the etheric plane are invibratory communication with the three higher planes of the cosmic physicalplane, and they (with their ensphering fourth level) have been called in theoccult books ‘the inverted Tetraktys.’ It is this knowledge which puts themagician in possession of the three types of planetary force and theircombination, or the fourth type, and thus releases for him that vital energywhich will drive this idea into objectivity. As the different types of forcesmeet and coalesce, a dim shadowy form clothes itself upon the vibrating astraland mental sheath, and the idea of the solar Angel is attaining definiteconcretion.”The obvious and most apparent meaning is, therefore, recognition of the fourethers, but this is in its turn dependent upon other meanings and based upon therecognition of other quaternaries. I would like to give a short résumé of someof the qualifications needed by the white magician and of some of therecognitions which will gradually emerge in his consciousness.First, he must recognize “the four that constitute the One.” In other words, thefirst quaternary that he must know and know well is that which he is essentiallyhimself:1. Physical body, sensitive emotional nature, mind and soul;2. Soul, mind, brain and the outer world of forces;3. Spirit, soul and body within the great Whole.This presupposes real spiritual attainment and the capacity, therefore, tofunction as a soul. Until this has been achieved, one can be an aspirant to thepractice of white magic, but one is not yet a white magician.Second, he must recognize “the city that stands foursquare.” He must understandthe meaning, of “man, the cube”, and this in three ways: [547]1. Himself as a human being;2. His fellow man in relation to himself and the Whole;3. The fourth kingdom in nature, the human kingdom, viewing that entire kingdomas an entity, an organized life functioning on the physical plane, indwelt bysoul, animated by spirit.This means, therefore, that as a man he is responsive to his kind and is awarealso of the purpose of the kingdom to which he belongs. This can best beexpressed in some wonderful words from an ancient writing in the Masters’Archives. It is said to date back to early Atlantean times. The material onwhich the writing is found is so old and so frail that all that the Mastersthemselves can touch and see is a precipitation made from it, the original beingkept at Shamballa. It runs thus, with certain deletions, which it is wiser notto insert:“At the four corners of the square, the four angelic...are seen. Orange theyare, but veiled in rosy light. Within each form the yellow flame is seen andround each form the blue...“Four words they utter forth, one for each human race, but not the sacred soundwhich bringeth forth the seventh. Two words have died away, four sound today.One sounds in realms so high that man can enter not as man. Thus are the sevenwords of man ringing around the square, passing from mouth to mouth.“Each day of man the words take form and different seem. In...the words will beas follows:“From out the North a word is chanted forth which means...be pure.“From out the South the word peals out: I dedicate and...“From out the East, bringing a light divine, the word comes swinging round thesquare: Love all.“From out the West, answer is thrown back: I serve.”This is a faint effort to express in English these ancient Atlantean phrases,older than Sanskrit or Senzar, and [548] known only to a mere handful of themembers of the present hierarchy. But in the thoughts of purity, dedication,love and service, are summed up the nature and the destiny of man, and it shouldbe remembered that they do not stand for so-called spiritual qualities, but forpotent occult forces, dynamic in their incentive and creative in their result.This should be pondered on carefully by all aspirants. We have, consequently,with these four, added to the first one, spiritual attainment, five of thequalifications of the white magician.Third, the white magician must recognize the cross which stands in the Heavensupon which the cosmic Christ is crucified and on which the white magician, beinga cell in the body of the cosmic Christ, is also crucified. Technically andastrologically speaking, in this present aeon he must understand the innersignificance of Taurus, of Leo, of Scorpio and of Aquarius, for they are potentin our world cycle. He must, if I may express it symbolically, and yet at thesame time accurately, be able to utter forth the achievement which is the goalof his endeavor in each of these four signs and under each of these four powers.In Taurus he must be able to say: “I seek illumination and am myself the light.”In Leo he will say: “I know myself to be the one. I rule by Law.” The word hewill utter forth in Scorpio will be: “Illusion cannot hold me. I am the birdthat flies with utter freedom.” In Aquarius the words spoken will be: “I am theserver, and I the dispenser am of living water.”These occult qualifications upon which I have thus lightly touched, must beclosely studied by the aspirant and as he studies them and lives by these rules,various qualifications will emerge and will distinguish him. It must beremembered that all that I have here said has a different meaning on each planeand in relation [549] to the seven stages of consciousness as these expressthemselves in these seven fields of awareness.Finally, as far as the aspirant who reads these instructions is concerned, hemust have transcended the four noble truths, learned the meaning of the fourgospels, understood the significance and purpose of the four elements—earth,water, fire and air, and, esoterically speaking, passed as a Saviour through thefour kingdoms. This latter phrase will only be really understood at the fourthinitiation. When he has done this, he can say: “Desire holds me not, withfreedom now I stand. I desire all and nothing. I live and die, am offered up andrise again: I come and go at will. Earth lies beneath my feet and water laves myform. The fire destroys that which impedes my way, and master of the air am I.Through all the world of forms my feet have passed. All now exists for me and I,the servant of the whole, persist.”Study these words and note how the concept of the ideal requirements whichconstitute the equipment of the white magician has steadily grown.I could enlarge on many other quaternaries, but the few just quoted suffice toshow some of the recognitions towards which the aspirant strives. The only otherone which I will note is that referred to as the violet four, or the four typesof energy which constitute the vital or etheric body of all forms in the naturalworld. Here again we have a higher three and a lower one, which ever indicatesthe three aspects or principles of divinity and the form through which thesethree must manifest. Spirit, soul and body express the same idea from anotherangle, added to that which is produced through their interaction. It must everbe remembered that from the point of view of Reality what we call the densephysical body, tangible and objective, is but an illusion. We are told again andagain in the ancient writings that it is not a principle. Why is this so?Because it is only an [550] appearance brought about by the merging of thehigher three and the fourth, and this appearance is a fiction or a figment ofthe human mind. I speak not in parable; I utter only facts in nature and onethat is slowly coming into mature consideration among the philosophers of bothhemispheres. Both in the solar system, the macrocosm of the microcosm, andlikewise in the microcosm, there are ever the three highest planes which embodythe principles and produce the dynamic purpose, and which constitute the fourlevels of the etheric body of both God and man, viewing them from what we callthe energy or physical angle. These four are reflected in the four levels of theetheric division of the physical plane as regards the physical body of allforms. These four etheric levels, or these four grades of vital substanceconstitute what is called the “true form” of all material objects or phenomena,and they are responsive to the four higher types of spiritual energy which weusually call divine. This relation between the prototypal trinity and its planeof merging and the etheric reflection is found in all forms according to thetype of energy which predominates. In each of the four kingdoms in nature allfour types are found, but the fourth etheric is found in fuller degree in themineral kingdom than in the human, whilst the highest of the four ethers isfound in greater proportion in the human than in the other three kingdoms. Thiswhich I tell you is apt to be found confusing by the neophyte for the wordsenergy, dynamic purpose, vitality and etheric substance mean little to thebeginner, but they serve to indicate some of the knowledge which the worker inwhite magic has to grasp. This I might illustrate, for instance, by stating thatworking in the mineral kingdom, the fourth kingdom in nature from the standpointof God, and the first from the standpoint of time and space, he will work withthe fourth cosmic ether (buddhic energy) utilizing [551] ether of the fourthgrade in his own body as the transmitting agent, and so on, in connection withthe other three kingdoms in nature. One of the secrets not yet revealed,fortunately, is concerned with the question as to whether light violet is thecolour of the highest or the lowest of the four and this will not be revealedfor some time to come.The consideration of these various quaternaries which it is necessary that thewhite magician understand, and the qualifications which he must possess beforehe is permitted to carry forward the magical work, leads to the followingquestion: Is there some basic formula or proposition which must govern themagical activity?This question is, of course, too general and vague, but until the inclusivenessof the human mind is greater than is now the case, such questions willinevitably be asked. I can, however, give a short reply which holds in it theclue to the entire process. When correctly understood, it will govern the methodof work and the thought life of the worker in white magic. My answer is this:Potencies produce precipitation. In those three words lies the entire story.They sum up the history of the Creator and the life story and environingconditions of every human being. They account for all that is, and lie back ofthe law of rebirth. These potencies are driven into activity by the power ofthought and hence, in training them to be creators and in teaching them togovern and control their own destinies, the Teachers of the race begin with themind aspect of aspirants. They emphasize that which will govern the potencies;they deal with that which produces the objective form, which is qualified bythem, is energized by them and which fulfills the purpose of the Thinker.A thinker, then, is the essential factor, and it will become apparent to you,therefore, as you study these words, just what is going on in the world oftoday. The [552] trend of our modern civilization, in spite of all its mistakesand errors, is to produce thinkers. Education, books, travel, in its many andvaried forms, enunciations of science and of philosophy, and the driving innerurge which we call religious, but which is, in fact, the drive towards truth andits mental verification—all these factors have one objective, and this is toproduce thinkers. Given a real thinker, you have an incipient creator and(unconsciously at first, but consciously later on) one who will wield power inorder to “precipitate” or cause to emerge objective forms. These forms willeither be in line with Divine purpose and plan and, consequently, will furtherthe cause of evolution, or they will be animated by personal intent,characterized by separated, selfish purpose, and constitute, therefore, part ofthe work of the retro-active forces and the material element. They will be ofthe nature of black magic.Again the four appear:1. The thinker.2. The potency.3. The quality of that potency.4. The precipitation.THE PRECIPITATION OF THOUGHT FORMSWhat is a precipitation? Many definitions could be given and most of them—beingclothed in words—would lose much of their true significance, but some idea maybe conveyed in the following terms:“A precipitation is an aggregation of energies arranged in a certain form, inorder to express the idea of some creative Thinker, and qualified orcharacterized by the nature of his thought and held in that peculiar form aslong as his thought remains dynamic.”These words are an attempt to express a symbol found in the same ancient book,or rather compilation, referred [553] to earlier, in our consideration of RuleXIII. Certainly these symbols emerging from the remote past constitute theworking tools, if I might so express it, of the Thinkers Who guide our racialand planetary evolution. This particular symbol might be described as follows:A blazing sun forms the background and at the very center of that sun appears aneye; projecting downwards toward the right from this eye pours forth a stream ofenergy in the form of a beam of light. It rays outward, widening towards theend, into a second circle and in that circle is a cross resembling what iscalled a Maltese cross. At the center of the cross is another eye and within theeye the Sacred Word. Between the arms of the cross forming, therefore, anothercross, is the Swastika, the arms emerging from behind the Maltese cross. At thebottom of the page whereon this symbol is found are four geometrical forms. Someof these are referred to by H. P. B. and were taken by her from this ancientpicture. They are well known but seldom applied by esotericists to the creativework. They are the cube, the five pointed star, the six pointed star and theeight sided diamond, superimposed one upon the other. They constitute,therefore, the base of the symbol. H. P. B. refers also to the point, the lineand the circle, but these, with the triangle, have been exoterically applied toDeity and the manifested universe. Later these other forms will also be appliedto God and to man, in the exoteric sense. But this will only be when the truthsof the Ageless Wisdom are universally recognized.The laws of thought are the laws of creation, and the entire creative work iscarried forward on the etheric level. This constitutes practically a secondformula. The Creator of the solar system confines his attention to the workperformed on what we call the four higher planes of our system. The lower three,constituting the cosmic dense physical plane, are in the nature ofprecipitation. [554] They are objective, because the matter of space respondsto, or is attracted by the potency of the four higher etheric vibrations. These,in their turn, are motivated or swept into activity by the dynamic impact of thedivine thought. There is a similar procedure where man is concerned. Just assoon as man becomes a thinker and can formulate his thought, desire itsmanifestation and can energize “by recognition” the four ethers, a densephysical manifestation is inevitable. He will attract by his pranic energy,coloured by desire high or low, and animated by the potency of his thought, justas much of the responsive matter in space as is needed to give body to his form.Much of this is dealt with in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire and as theseInstructions are intended to deal with the inner development of the aspirant, Ishall not carry these ideas further beyond prophesying that within fifty yearsthe true significance of precipitations will be engrossing the attention of thescientists. Occult students would do well to give the subject careful thought.It can be approached in two ways. There is, first of all, the study of theobjective world in which the individual aspirant finds himself. He will need toconsider the fact that his body of manifestation is a precipitation, that it isa result of his potent thought and desire and of his “recognition” of the fourethers. He will need to understand that this form which he has created willpersist just as long as the dynamic power of his thought holds it together, andthat it will dissipate when he (occultly speaking) “takes his eye away”. He willneed to consider also that his environment is the result of the work of anaggregate of group thinkers—group to which he belongs. This concept can betraced back all the way from a family group to the group of egos who, closelyinterlinked, form a group on the higher level of the mental plane, and on againto the seven major thinkers of the universe, the Lords of the seven rays. Theseseven, in their turn, are [555] swept into activity by the three supreme magicalworkers, the manifested Trinity. These Three, in due course, will be recognizedas responsive to the thought of the One Creator, the Unmanifested Logos.The word “recognition” is one of the most important in the language of occultismand holds the clue to the mystery of Being. It is related to karmic activity andon it the Lords of Time and Space depend. It is hard to illustrate this insimple terms, but it might be said that the problem of God Himself consists inthis, that He must manifest a threefold recognition:1. Recognition of the past, which necessarily involves a recognition of thatmatter in space which is, through past association, already coloored by thoughtand purpose.2. Recognition of the four grades of lives which, again through pastassociation, are capable of response to His new thought for the present and can,therefore, carry out His plans and work in collaboration with Him. They subjecttheir individual purposes to the one divine plan.3. Recognition of the objective which exists in His Mind. This, in its turn,necessitates a one pointed focussing upon the goal and the holding of thepurpose intact throughout the vicissitudes of the creative work, and in spite ofthe potency of the many divine Thinkers who have been attracted to Him bysimilarity of idea.It is hopeless to attempt to avoid the use of personal pronouns when talkingpictorially and symbolically. If the student will bear in mind that such anattempt to reduce cosmic principles and concepts to words is in itselfridiculous and that the only possible thing to do is to present a picture, thenno harm can eventuate. But the pictures change, as evolution proceeds upon itsway, and [556] the picture of today will at a later date be deemed no betterthan a child’s rough scrawl. A new picture will then be presented, simpler andmore harmonious, and more beautiful, until it, in its turn, is deemedinadequate.The same recognitions, on a lesser scale, govern the activities of the solarAngel as he proceeds with the work of incarnation and of manifestation upon thephysical plane. He has in his turn to recognize the matter of the three planesof human expression which are already, through past association, coloured by hisvibration; he has to recognize the groups of lives with which he has hadrelation and with which he again must work. Finally, he has, throughout the tinycycle of an incarnation, to hold his purpose steady and to see that each lifecarries that purpose forward into fuller manifestation and completion.The work of the human being also, as he endeavors to become a creative thinker,lies along analogous lines. His creative work will be successful if he canrecognize the tendency of his mind as that tendency emerges through the mediumof his present interests, for these have their roots in the past. It will besuccessful if he can recognize the vibration of the group of lives in line withwhose thought his creative work must proceed, for unlike the Deity in the solarsystem, he cannot work sole and alone. And who shall say whether in thosegreater spheres of existence in which our Deity plays His part, He is any morefree from cosmic group influences than the human individual is free fromimpression by his environing impulses? He has to recognize the purpose for whichhe has deemed it wise to build a thought-form and he must hold that purposesteady and unimpaired throughout the whole period of objectivity. This we callone pointed attention, and this creative work is one of the, as yetunrecognized, goals of the meditation process. Hitherto the emphasis has beenlaid on the achieving of [557] a focussed attention and on the necessity, whenthat has been attained, of coming in touch with the soul, the spiritual thinker.But later decades will see the emerging of a technique of creation. When soul,mind and brain are unified and facility in unification has been achieved,further instructions will be given in the creative art. Meditation is the firstbasic lesson given when men have achieved the capacity to function on the mentalplane.Down the great cycle upon the wheel of rebirth “the idea of the solar Angel isattaining definite concretion”. A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, p. 1024. Each lifesees the initial purpose clarified and time is literally the length of athought. This same basic truth underlies the creation of all forms on thephysical plane, whether it is a thought-form embodying the urgent desire of aman for selfish acquisition or that thought-form which we call a group or anorganization and which is animated by the unselfish purpose and embodies somedisciple’s mode of helping humanity. It underlies group work, regarding a groupas an entity. If a group could appreciate the power of this fact, and“recognize” its opportunity, it could, by its one-pointed fixity of purpose andits focussed attention to the spiritual objective, perform miracles in salvagingthe world. I here appeal to all who read these words to reconsecrate themselvesand to recognize the opportunity they have of an united effort towards worldusefulness.It might be of use here if I expressed quite simply the requirements needed tobring about the manifestation of individual spiritual purpose or of groupspiritual purpose. These can be summed up in three words:1. Power.2. Detachment.3. Non-criticism.So often simple words are used because of [558] their every day connotationtheir true significance and esoteric value are lost.Let me give you a few thoughts anent each of these, with application only to thecreative work of white magic.Power is dependent for expression upon two factors:a. Singleness of purpose.b. Lack of impediments.Students would be amazed if they could see their motives as we see them whoguide on the subjective side of experience. Mixed motive is universal. Puremotive is rare and where it exists there is ever success and achievement. Suchpure motive can be entirely selfish and personal, or unselfish and spiritual,and in between, where aspirants are concerned, mixed in varying degree.According, however, to the purity of intent and the singleness of purpose, sowill be the potency.The Master of all the Masters has said, “If thine eye be single, thy whole bodyshall be full of light”. These words which He enunciated give us a principleunderlying all the creative work and we can link up the idea which He clothed inwords with the symbol I have earlier described in this Treatise. Power, light,vitality, and manifestation! Such is the true procedure.It will be obvious, therefore, why the manifested unit, man, is urged to bevital in his search and to cultivate his aspiration. When that aspiration isstrong enough, he is then urged to achieve the capacity to “hold his mind steadyin the light”. When he can do this, he will achieve power and possess thatsingle eye which will redound to the glory of the indwelling divinity. Before,however, he has mastered this process of development, he may not be trusted withpower. The procedure is as follows: The individual aspirant begins to manifestsomewhat soul purpose in his life on the physical plane. He is transmutingdesire into aspiration and that aspiration [559] is vital and real. He islearning the meaning of light. When he has mastered the technique of meditation(and with this certain schools in existence at present are concerned) he canproceed to handle power, because he will have learned to function as a divineThinker. He is now cooperative and is in touch with the divine Purpose.As all true students know, however, the number of impediments is legion.Hindrances and obstacles abound. Singleness of purpose may occasionally berealized in high moments, but it does not abide with us always. There are thehindrances of physical nature, of heredity and environment, of character, oftime and conditions, of world karma, as well as individual karma. What shallthen be done? I have only one word to say and that is, persist . Failure neverprevents success. Difficulties develop the strength of the soul. The secret ofsuccess is ever to stand steady and to be impersonal.The second requirement is detachment . The worker in white magic must holdhimself free as much as he can from identifying himself with that which he hascreated or has attempted to create. The secret for all aspirants is to cultivatethe attitude of the onlooker and of the silent watcher, and, may I emphasize theword silent. Much true magical work comes to naught because of the failure ofthe worker and builder in matter to keep silent. By premature speech and toomuch talk, he slays that which he has attempted to create, the child of histhought is still-born. All workers in the field of the world should recognizethe need for silent detachment and the work before every student who reads theseInstructions must consist in cultivating a detached attitude. It is a mentaldetachment which enables the thinker to dwell ever in the high and secret placeand from that center of peace calmly and powerfully to carry out the work he hasset before himself. He works in the world of men; he loves and comforts andserves; he pays no attention to his personality [560] likes and dislikes, or tohis prejudices and attachments; he stands as a rock of strength and as a stronghand in the dark to all whom he contacts. The cultivation of a detached attitudepersonally, with the attached attitude spiritually, will cut at the very rootsof a man’s life; but it will render back a thousandfold for all that it cutsaway.Much has been written anent attachment and the need to develop detachment. May Ibeg all students in the urgency of the present situation to leave off readingand thinking about it aspirationally and to begin to practise it and todemonstrate it.Non-criticism is the third requirement. What shall I say about that? Why is itregarded as so essential a requirement? Because criticism (analysis and,consequently, separativeness) is the outstanding characteristic of mental typesand also of all coordinated personalities. Because criticism is a potent factorin swinging mental and emotional substance into activity and so making strongimpress upon the brain cells and working out into words. Because in a suddenburst of critical thought, the entire personality can be galvanized into apotent coordination, but of a wrong kind and with disastrous results. Becausecriticism being a faculty of the lower mind can hurt and wound and no man canproceed upon the Way as long as wounds are made and pain is knowingly given.Because the work of white magic and the carrying out of hierarchical purposemeets with basic hindrances in the relations existing between its workers anddisciples. In the pressure of the present opportunity there is no time forcriticism to exist between workers. They hinder each other and they hinder thework.I have upon me at this time a sense of urgency. I urge upon all those who readthese Instructions to forget their likes and their dislikes and to overlook thepersonality [561] hindrances which inevitably exist in themselves and in all whowork upon the physical plane, handicapped by the personality. I urge upon allworkers the remembrance that the day of opportunity is with us and that it hasits term. This present type of opportunity will not last forever. The pettinessof the human frictions, the failures to understand each other, the little faultswhich have their roots in personality and which are, after all, ephemeral, theambitions and illusions must all go. If the workers would practise detachment,knowing that the Law works and that God’s purposes must come to an ultimateconclusion and if they would learn never to criticize in thought or word, thesalvaging of the world would proceed apace and the new age of love andillumination would be ushered in."},{"pageContent":"RULE FOURTEENThe sound swells out. The hour of danger to the soul courageous draweth near.The waters have not hurt the white creator and naught could drown nor drenchhim. Danger from fire and flame menaces now, and dimly yet the rising smoke isseen. Let him again, after the cycle of peace, call on the Solar Angel.THE CENTRES AND PRANA[565] The nearer we approach in our thought to the physical plane, the moredifficulty is experienced by the magician, whether he be the solar Angeloccupied with the magical work of manifestation, or an expert worker under theplan. This is due to two causes:1. The automatic response of dense physical matter to substance, rememberingalways that substance is force.2. The dangers incident to working with the fires or with the pranas of theUniverse. This latter danger is that with which Rule XIV concerns itself.There are many ways in which this Rule can be interpreted. We can study the workof the solar Angel as he approaches the dense physical plane to take incarnationand thus arrives at that critical point in his creative work wherein thethreefold sheath is at the stage where it must, inevitably and unavoidably, makea contact with the matter aspect. It is the stage during which, expressing thistruth in occult terms, it is literally called upon to “clothe itself anddisappear into the light of day.” The spiritual man is now veiled by a mental orby a fire sheath. He is clothed “in a watery mist”, which is an ancient way ofreferring to the great illusion. This term conveys not only the concept of thepossession of an astral or watery body, but also presents to the mind the effectwhich that body must have upon the hidden solar Angel. The latter looks outthrough the fire and through [566] the mist and sees distortion and reflection.He sees that which must mislead.Besides the sheath of fire and the sheath of mist he has clothed upon himself anouter web of closely interlocking streams of force. These constitute his ethericor vital body, which is in the nature of a web or mesh of energy nadis, which,in their tens of thousands, are woven together and form in certain localities inthis energy body various focal points of force, of which the most important arethe seven centers. There are, however, many such focal points.When this clothing has been assumed by the solar Angel, a final stage isreached, and solar fire and fire by friction must be brought into contact withthree “most ancient fires”. These are the fires of the dense physical objectivematter or of those material energy units which we normally cover by the words“gaseous, liquid and dense”, a meaningless phrase and only of use to us, throughits teaching of differentiation. These three ancient fires are an aspect of fireby friction.At this point is the hour of danger for the soul courageous. It is the hourwherein the soul must bring into at-one-ment the etheric body and the gaseousenvelope which is the highest aspect of the dense physical sheath, theinstrument of tangible organic manifestation.We can also study this Rule from the point of view of the initiate who isoccupied with the wielding of forces and who, through the power of his thought,may have created a thought-form. This thought-form he has clothed with an astralor desire sheath, deliberately vitalized with his energy, and now seeks to giveit objective existence and send it forth to accomplish his purpose and hisintent. The crucial moment in all creative work is ever to be found at thisstage. It is the stage wherein the vibrant subjective form has to attract toitself that material which will give it organization upon the physical [567]plane. This fact has to be remembered, no matter what the magician is seeking torender objective. It refers equally to an organization, to a group or to asociety; it may refer to the materialization of money or to the clothing orexteriorization of an idea. The moment of danger to the magician comes at thisfinal stage. A point of fine discrimination is reached and the magician has toproceed now with caution. Many good plans fail to materialize and the reasonlies right here. A plan is, after all, an idea let loose in time and space toseek a form and do its work. Many come to naught because their creator, or thecreative mind from which they emanate, understands not this critical period. Aright adjustment of forces has here to be arranged, so that neither too muchenergy is used in the work, nor too little. When too much energy is releasedthrough the medium of the vital body, then a fire blazes forth when the gaseousenergy of the dense physical plane is brought in contact with vital ethericenergy. Thus the embryo form is destroyed. Where there is not sufficient energy,or adequate persistent attention, and when the thought of the magician wavers,then the idea comes to naught, then the infant is still-born, and nothing comesinto objective manifestation. This has a literal correspondence on the physicalplane. Many infants are still-born for this very reason that the solar Angelwavers in his intent and is not sufficiently interested. Many fine ideas equallyfail to materialize or have no persistent living existence “in the light ofday,” because there was not sufficient energy to generate that spark of livingflame which must ever burn at the center of all forms. The danger, therefore, istwofold:1. That of destruction by fire, owing to the expenditure of too much energy andthe expression of too violent a purpose. [568]2. That of death, through lack of vitality and because the “directed attention”of the magician is not of adequate strength and duration to bring the form intobeing. The occult law holds good that energy follows thought.We could study this Rule from the standpoint of the aspirant, as he learns towork with energy and with the forces of nature, as he learns the significanceand the purpose of the vital body, and gains power in the control of the vitalfires or the pranas of his own little system. It seems to me that for ourparticular purpose, this line of approach would be of the most use. TheseInstructions are intended for those who are definitely interested in the way ofliberation from form, and who are seeking to prepare themselves to work incooperation with the Great White Lodge. They are learning the first steps in themagical work and for them, therefore, an understanding of the fires and of theenergies with which they must work, is of prime importance. We will, therefore,confine our attention to this phase of the great work and consider neither thework of the soul as it takes incarnation and manifests objectively through aform, nor with the work of the initiates, as they act as creative magiciansunder group impulse and through an intelligent understanding of the evolutionaryplan. These Instructions are intended to be practical and to convey the teachingneeded to those students who can read between the lines and who are developingthe capacity to see the esoteric meaning behind the outer blinds and exotericforms.We are now going to consider the pranas, and I would here quote some paragraphsfrom The Light of the Soul which give a description of these pranas. We find inBook II, Sutra 39 that there are five aspects of prana, [569] functioningthrough and, therefore, constituting the total etheric or vital body.“Prana is fivefold in its manifestations, thus corresponding to the five statesof mind, the fifth principle, and to the five modifications of the thinkingprinciple. Prana in the solar system works out as the five great states ofenergy which we call planes, the medium of consciousness....The fivedifferentiations of prana in the human body are:“1. Prana, extending from the nose to the heart and having special relation tothe mouth and speech, the heart and lungs.“2. Samana extends from the heart to the solar plexus; it concerns food and thenourishing of the body through the medium of food and drink and has specialrelation to the stomach.“3. Apana controls from the solar plexus to the soles of the feet; it concernsthe organs of elimination, of rejection and of birth, thus having specialrelation to the organs of generation and of elimination.“4. Udana is found between the nose and the top of the head; it has a specialrelation to the brain, the nose and the eyes, and when properly controlledproduces the coordination of the vital airs and their correct handling.“5. Vyana is the term applied to the sum total of pranic energy as it isdistributed evenly throughout the entire body. Its instruments are the thousandsof nadis or nerves found in the body, and it has a peculiar definite connectionwith the blood channels, the veins and arteries.” (Pp. 329-330.)“The etheric body is the force or vital body and it permeates every part of thedense vehicle. It is the background, the true substance of the physical body.According to the nature of the force animating the etheric body, according tothe activity of that force in the etheric body, according to the aliveness orthe sluggishness of the most important parts of the etheric body (the centers upthe spine) so will be the corresponding activity of the physical body. Similarlyand symbolically, according to the wholeness of the breathing apparatus, andaccording to the ability of that apparatus to oxygenate and render pure theblood, so will be the health or wholeness of the dense physical body.” (pp.218-219.)[570] We find it also stated that the forces which make up the vital body or thevarious pranas of which it is constructed emanate:“a. From the planetary aura. In this case it is planetary prana, and so concernsprimarily the spleen and the health of the physical body.“b. From the astral world via the astral body. This will be purely kamic ordesire force and will affect primarily the centers below the diaphragm.“c. From the universal mind or manasic force. This will largely be thought forceand will go to the throat center.“d. From the ego itself, stimulating primarily the head and heart centers.” (P.220.)We read also that “most people receive force only from the physical and astralplanes, but disciples receive force also from the mental and egoic levels.”Finally we read:“It may help the student if he realizes that the right control of prana involvesthe recognition that energy is the sum total of existence and of manifestation,and that the three lower bodies are energy bodies, each forming a vehicle forthe higher type of energy and being themselves transmitters of energy. Theenergies of the lower man are energies of the third aspect, the Holy Ghost orBrahma aspect. The energy of the spiritual man is that of the second aspect, theChrist force, or buddhi. The object of evolution in the human family is to bringthis Christ force, the principle of buddhi, into full manifestation upon thephysical plane and this through the utilization of the lower triple sheath.” (P.227.)This gives a general picture of the subject of our consideration and gives usthe elementary facts upon which all our thoughts must be based. It becomesapparent, therefore, as we study the above that the aspirant has three things todo:First, he has to learn the nature of the energies or [571] pranas which havebrought his magical creation, the physical body, into manifestation and whichkeep it in such a condition that he can or cannot rapidly achieve the spiritualobjective of his soul. This lesson involves:a. Arriving at a knowledge of those forces which are peculiarly potent in hislife and which seem to direct his activities. This will bring to him theknowledge as to which centers of his etheric body are awakened and which aredormant. This all aspirants have to grasp before they really can applythemselves to the real training for discipleship.b. Grasping the relation between these forces of nature which he hasappropriated for his own use and which constitute the sum total of his personal,mental, sentient and vital energies, and those same forces as they are found inthe natural world and govern the manifestation of the Macrocosm.c. Learning to work with these energies in an intelligent manner in order tobring about three happenings:An harmonious cooperation with his own solar Angel, so that solar force mayimpose its rhythm upon the lunar forces.An intelligent response to and affiliation with the group of World Servers whoat any given time have undertaken the work of directing, by the power of theirthought, the forces of nature and so leading the whole creative body forwardalong the line of divine intent.The production on the physical plane of a personality adequate for its creativetask and capable of those forms of activity, emanating [572] from the mind,which will enable him to further the work of the directing agencies.Second, learn to live as a soul and, therefore, free from identification withthe body nature. This brings out three things:a. An ability to withdraw into the head consciousness and from that high placeto direct the life of the personal self.b. The power to pass through the various centers in the body those universalforces and energies which are needed for world work. This has to be doneconsciously and in full awareness of the source from which they come, of themode of their activity and of the purpose for which they must be used. Thisinvolves also the understanding of which force is related to a center. Thisconsequently involves the necessity to develop the centers, to bring them into astate of potency and to harmonize them into a unified rhythm.c. The capacity, therefore, to work at will through the medium of any particularcenter. This is only possible when the soul can dwell as the Ruler on the“throne between the eyebrows” and when the Kundalini fire has been what isoccultly called raised. This fire has to pass up through the spinal column andburn its way through the web which separates center from center on the “GoldenRod of Power.”Third, learn to study the reactions upon others of whatever energy he, throughhis personality, may be expressing, or which, if he be an initiate and,therefore, a conscious worker with the Plan, it may be his privilege to utilizeor transmit. Through a close study of [573] his personal “effect” upon hisfellowmen, as he lives amongst them, and as he thinks, speaks and acts, helearns the nature of that type of force which may flow through him. He canarrive, therefore, at an understanding of its type, its quality, its strength,and its speed. These four words warrant consideration and elucidation.A. The type of force as used by an aspirant will indicate to him its emanatingsource, and a study of it will begin to signify to him the Entity from which ithas emanated. A knowledge of the type answers the question: Along what line ofenergy and upon what ray is this force to be found? A close watch upon thisaspect of work will soon indicate to the aspirant:1. upon what plane he himself may be working,2. the nature of his ray, egoic ray and personality ray. Only the initiate ofthe third degree can ascertain his monadic ray,3. the particular tattva which may be involved,4. the center through which he may be transmitting the force.It will be apparent, therefore, that a study of the types of energy is ofpractical usefulness and will tend to leave no part of the aspirant’s natureuntouched. Think for a minute of the lessons which can be learned by the man whosubmits the energy used in verbal expression, for instance, to the scrutiny ofthe Inner Ruler and who—after talking or after joining in the give and take ofdaily life—asks himself the questions: What was the type of energy used by me inmy speech today? What was the force that I expended in my contacts with myfellowmen? You ask me if I can illustrate this for you? Now let me attempt to doso and so make simple what is deemed so oft to be abstruse and difficult. Letthe student inquire [574] of himself whether the position he held mentally andwhether the words which he spoke on any particular occasion were prompted by adesire to impose his will upon his hearers. This imposition of his will could beeither right or wrong. When right, it would mean that he was speaking under theimpulse of his spiritual will, that his words would be in line with soul purposeand intent and would be governed by love and, therefore, would be constructive,helpful and healing. His attitude would be one of detachment and he would haveno desire to take prisoner the mind of his brother. But if his words wereprompted by self-will and by the desire to impose his ideas upon other peopleand so to shine in their presence, or to force them to agree with hisconclusions, his method would then be destructive, dominating, aggressive,argumentative, forceful, rude or irritable, according to his personality trendsand inclinations. This would indicate the right or the wrong use of first rayforce.Should the type of force he wields be that of the second ray, he can submit itto a similar analysis. He will then find it to be based on group love, serviceand compassion, or upon a selfish longing to be liked, on sentiment and onattachment. His words will indicate this to him if he will closely study them.Similarly, if he is using third ray force, in a personal manner, he will bedevious in his propositions, subtle and elusive in his arguments, usingmanipulation in his relations with his fellowmen, or be an interfering busybody,actively engaged in running the world, in managing other people’s lives forthem, or in grasping so firmly the reins of government in his own self-interestthat he will sacrifice everything and everybody in the work of furthering hisown busy ends. If he is, however, a true disciple and aspirant, he will workwith the Plan and will wield third ray force to bring about the loving purposesof the spiritual Reality. He will be busy and active and his word will carry[575] truth, and will lead to the helping of others, for they will be detachedand true.THE USE OF THE HANDSIt is of value here when we are dealing with the wielding of force to give alittle information anent the use of the hands in such work. One of the Mastershas said, “It is but with armed hand and ready either to conquer or perish thatthe modern mystic can hope to achieve his object.” I intend to speak a few wordsabout the hands, for there is more occult teaching hidden in these words than isapparent on the surface.In one of the old books, available for the instruction of disciples these wordsare found:“The armed hand is an empty hand and this protects its possessor from theaccusations of his enemies. It is a hand freed from the taint of the foursymbolic evils—gold, lust, the dagger, and the finger of enticement.”These words are most significant, and it might be well to study briefly the typeof hands and their quality which are distinctive of disciples. In all forms ofesoteric teaching the hands play a great part and this for four reasons:1. They are the symbol of acquisitiveness.2. They are centres of force3. They are wielders of the sword.4. They are, when employed unselfishlya. Instruments of healing.b. Agencies whereby certain keys are turned.Viewing them as symbols of acquisitiveness it must be remembered that in theaverage man they are employed to “grasp and to hold” and to acquire that whichthe man wants for himself and for the satisfaction of his selfish desire. Inspiritual man, the hands are still symbols of acquisitiveness but he only graspsthat which [576] is needed for the helping of the group and releases at oncetowards that end that which he has thus acquired. The initiate holds nothing forhimself; the saviour of the race may utilise all that is laid up in the divinestorehouse but not for himself, only for those he seeks to help.As centres of force the hands play a most potent part, and one that is littleunderstood. It is an occult fact that the hands of a disciple (once he hasacquired that acquisitiveness which is based on unselfish group work) becometransmitters of spiritual energy. The “laying on of hands” is no idle phrase norconfined solely to the operations of the episcopate of any faith. The occultlaying on of hands can be studied in four aspects:1. In healing . In this case the force which flows through the hands comes froma dual source and via two etheric centres, the spleen and the heart.2. In the stimulation of any specific centre . The energy employed in this casecomes from the base of the spine, and the throat, and must be accompanied byappropriate words.3. In the work of linking a man up with his ego . The force used here must bereceived from three etheric centres, the solar plexus, the heart, and the centrebetween the eyebrows.4. In group work . Here energy is utilised emanating from the ego, via the headcentre, the throat centre and the base of the spine.It will be apparent therefore that the Science of the Hands is a very real oneand the disciple has to learn the nature of the forces in the different centres,how to transmit and unify them and then by an act of the will how to pass themoutward through the chakras in the hands. The hands do their work eitherdirectly, or through the projection of a steady flow once the blended currentshave been tapped, or indirectly, or by manipulation. Through [577] a knowledgeof the law a disciple can not only utilise the current flowing through thecentres of his own body, but can also combine them with the planetary or cosmiccurrents to be found in his environment. This is done unconsciously frequentlyby speakers who magnetically use the hands to any extent and the effects as seenby a clairvoyant are often amazing. When this work is done consciously a mostpotent factor is added to the equipment of any chela.In this connection it must be borne in mind that the matter is a very abstruseone and that certain ray forces pass along the line of least resistance fromleft to right and others from right to left. Certain centres transmit theirenergies via the right hand and others via the left. Much knowledge is thereforerequired in order to work scientifically.I have no time to take up in detail the meaning of the hands as they wield thesword, save to point out that the sword as a symbol stands for many things:1. The sharp, two-edged sword is the discriminative faculty which reaches to theroots of the chela’s being and separates the real and true from the false andimpermanent. It is wielded by the ego from the mental plane and is spoken of asthe “Sword of cold blue steel.”2. The sword of renunciation, or that double-bladed axe which the chelawillingly applies to anything he considers as likely to hold him back from hisgoal. It is applied primarily to the things of the physical plane.3. The sword of the Spirit is that weapon which in the hands of the disciplecuts down before the eyes of the group he is serving the obstacles which standin the way of group progress. It is only wielded safely by those who havetrained their arms to [578] wield the other swords and in the hands of aninitiate is a most potent factor.The Old Commentary to which reference has been oft times made says:“The steel is needed for the transmission of the fire. When the force of theinner man is coupled with the energy transmitted through the chakras of thepalms, it passeth down the shining blade and blendeth with the force of the OneWho is the ALL. Thus is the Plan consumated.”And thus it might be added is the energy of the unit augmented by the force ofthe greater Whole.It is said in the occult books and likewise in The Secret Doctrine that allinitiates must be healers; therefore, that all initiates use the palms of thehands in the work of healing. Only those therefore, who have wielded the sworddare lay the sword down and stand with empty hands, uplifted in blessing. Onlythe “armed hand” can safely be used in the work of salvation; only those whohave “taken the kingdom of Heaven by force” and who are occultly known as the“Violent Ones” can take the heavenly supply and use it in the work of healing.This should be carefully borne in mind. The true healing force can only flowthrough those who in some degree either directly (by right of initiation or ofadvanced discipleship) or indirectly as being used on the inner side by someadept or advanced healer, are linked with the hierarchy. A man should know hisstatus before he can rightly heal. This does not apply to those healers who areunconscious workers, being powerful transmitters of prana or solar vitality.Their name is legion and they do much good even though at times the energy theytransmit serves to stimulate wrongly.As regards the use of the hands in turning key s I will simply give a hint. Onlythose hands can turn the key in the door of initiation who have learnt the artof the [579] centres”, the significance of the hands in service, the wielding ofthe swords, and the four positions in which the hands are held in group service.Study, therefore, the type of force which you usually wield; know along whatline of ray energy it comes and so arrive at a truer knowledge of yourself andof your own inner capacities, and ascertain likewise what types of energy youmay lack and how your equipment can be duly rounded out.B. The quality of the force used is necessarily dependent upon the ray fromwhich it may emanate. You ask me to differentiate between the words type andquality. I would say that the type of force indicates the life aspect, whilstthe quality indicates the consciousness aspect, and that both of them areaspects of the entity or the being who is the embodiment of a ray. The type willmanifest primarily through what we might call dynamic direction and through itspower to produce an effect. This has, of course, to be coupled to right qualityand skill in action. The quality will be indicated more by its power ofattractive approach. It has in it more of the magnetic aspect than the type has.Students can arrive at the quality of the force they may be using by noticingwhat they attract to themselves, both in circumstances, in people, and in thereactions which people show to what the student may say or do. In the type thereis a preponderance of the will aspect, in the quality the desire aspect isprimarily to be found. It is profoundly true that according to a man’s desiresso will be the forms of life which he will, like a magnet, attract to himself.C. The strength of a particular force brings us back to the Rule we arestudying, for it involves in itself the factor of true persistence, and we haveearlier seen that the emergence into functioning life and activity of any formis dependent upon the persistent attention of its [580] creator. Energy can beused dynamically or steadily and the effects of these two modes of theapplication of energy differ. One is primarily used in destructive work, andthis is the dynamic method. There are, for instance, certain dynamic words ofpower which, when employed by the Creative Destroyers, bring about thedestruction of forms. With these, however, aspirants have naught to do. Theirimportant work is to learn the meaning of persistence and of strength. It isliterally a time-persistence, and strength is beyond all other things the powerto endure, to hold out, to stand steady, and to go forward undeterred. Study,therefore, most carefully the types dynamic, the quality magnetic, and thestrength persistent of the forces which constitute your equipment. When you canwield, either destructively or constructively, either selfishly or selflessly,or in line with the Plan Universal, or the plan selfish and personal then youwill work consciously and will knowingly tread the right or the left hand path.D. The speed of the force used is dependent upon these three previous factors.Speed in this sense has no essential relation to time, though it is hard to findanother word to use in the place of speed. It relates to the world of effects asthey emanate from the world of causes. It has, perhaps, essentially a relationto truth, for the truer an impulse is and the clearer the understanding of thesubjective purpose, so will the right direction and the impact of the force,follow automatically. Perhaps speed would be more correctly translated by thewords “correct direction”, for where there is correct direction, trueorientation, exact understanding of purpose and recognition of the type of forcerequired, then there is an instantaneous effect. When the soul has registeredthe desired quality and possesses the strength of the Timeless One and thepersistence of the One Who is from the beginning, the process of forceexpression and the relation [581] between cause and effect is spontaneous andsimultaneous, and not sequential. This can scarcely be understood by those whohave not yet the consciousness of the eternal Now. But this spontaneous andsimultaneous effect is the clue to the entire magical work and in these fourwords—type, quality, strength and speed—the story of the work of a WhiteMagician is told. But more I dare not give and it is not permitted to me tospeak more clearly. Few are yet fitted to be magicians and few (perhapsfortunately) have as yet all the seven centres awakened so that they can workfreely on the seven planes and with the seven types of the seven ray energies.I would point out that these four aspects of energy can be studied by theaspirant in his own nature. On the physical plane he is apparently theinitiating cause and as he works with these energies they will call forth aresponse and a reaction from those who feel the impact of them and whodemonstrate their effect. It is true, therefore, is it not, that we work andlive in a world of forces? We need no distant field or special domain in whichto live and learn and work, for we dwell in a world of force and energy; we areourselves constituted of force or energy units; and we wield force, knowingly orunknowingly, throughout the twenty-four hours of the day. The field of ouroccult training is the field of the world and the world of our peculiarcircumstances and environment.THE TREADING OF THE WAYWe have seen, as we have considered Rule XIV that, in the magical work, thecritical point of objectivity has now been reached by the aspirant. He isendeavouring to become a magical creator and to accomplish two things:1. Re-create his instrument or mechanism of contact, so that the solar Angel hasa vehicle, adequate for [582] the expression of Reality. This involves, wenoted, right type, quality, strength and speed.2. Build those subsidiary forms of expression in the outer world through whichthe embodied Energy, flowing through the re-created sheaths, can serve theworld.In the first case, the aspirant is dealing with himself, working within his owncircumference, and thus learning to know himself, to change himself and torebuild his form aspect. In the other case, he is learning to be a server of therace, and to construct those forms of expression which will embody the newideas, the emerging principles, and the new concepts which must govern and roundout our racial progress.Remember that no man is a disciple, in the Master’s sense of the word, who isnot a pioneer. A registered response to spiritual truth, a realised pleasure inforward-looking ideals, and a pleased acquiescence in the truths of the New Agedo not constitute discipleship. If it were so, the ranks of disciples would berapidly filled and this is sadly not the case. It is the ability to arrive at anunderstanding of the next realisations which lie ahead of the human mind whichmarks the aspirant, who stands at the threshold of accepted discipleship; it isthe power, wrought out in the crucible of strenuous inner experience, to see theimmediate vision and to grasp those concepts in which the mind must necessarilyclothe it, which give a man the right to be a recognised worker with the plan(recognised by the Great Ones, if not recognised by the world); it is theachievement of that spiritual orientation, held steadily—no matter what theouter disturbance in the physical plane life may be—that signifies to Those Whowatch and seek for workers, that a man can be trusted to deal with some smallaspect of Their undertaken work; it is the capacity to submerge [583] and tolose sight of the personal lower self in the task of world guidance, under soulimpulse, which lifts a man out of the ranks of the aspiring mystics into thoseof the practical, though mystically minded, occultists.This is an intensely practical work, on which we are engaged; it is likewise ofsuch proportions that it will occupy all of a man’s attention and time, even hisentire thought life, and will lead him to efficient expression in hispersonality task (imposed by karmic limitation and inherited tendency) and to asteadfast application of the creative and magical work. Discipleship is asynthesis of hard work, intellectual unfoldment, steady aspiration and spiritualorientation, plus the unusual qualities of positive harmlessness and the openedeye which sees at will into the world of reality.Certain considerations should be brought to the notice of the disciple which—forthe sake of clarity—we will tabulate. To become an adept it will be necessaryfor the disciple to:1. Enquire the Way.2. Obey the inward impulses of the soul.3. Pay no attention to any worldly consideration.4. Live a life which is an example to others.These four requirements may sound at the first superficial reading as easy ofaccomplishment, but if carefully studied it will become apparent why an adept isa “rare efflorescence of a generation of enquirers.” Let us take up each ofthese four points:1. Enquire the Way . We are told by one of the Masters that a whole generationof enquirers may only produce one adept. Why should this be so? For two reasons:First, the true enquirer is one who avails himself of the wisdom of hisgeneration, who is the best product of his own period and yet who remainsunsatisfied and with the [584] inner longing for wisdom unappeased. To him thereappears to be something of more importance than knowledge and something ofgreater moment than the accumulated experience of his own period and time. Herecognises a step further on and seeks to take it in order to gain something toadd to the quota already gained by his compeers. Nothing satisfies him until hefinds the Way, and nothing appeases the desire at the centre of his being exceptthat which is found in the house of his Father. He is what he is because he hastried all lesser ways and found them wanting, and has submitted to many guidesonly to find them “blind leaders of the blind”. Nothing is left to him but tobecome his own guide and find his own way home alone . In the loneliness whichis the lot of every true disciple are born that self-knowledge and self-reliancewhich will fit him in his turn to be a Master. This loneliness is not due to anyseparative spirit but to the conditions of the Way itself. Aspirants mustcarefully bear this distinction in mind.Secondly, the true enquirer is one whose courage is of that rare kind whichenables its possessor to stand upright and to sound his own clear note in thevery midst of the turmoil of the world. He is one who has the eye trained to seebeyond the fogs and miasmas of the earth to that centre of peace which presidesover all earth’s happenings, and that trained attentive ear which (having caughta whisper of the Voice of the Silence) is kept tuned to that high vibration andis thus deaf to all lesser alluring voices. This again brings loneliness andproduces that aloofness which all less evolved souls feel when in the presenceof those who are forging ahead.A paradoxical situation is brought about from the fact that the disciple is toldto enquire the Way and yet there is none to tell him. Those who know the Way maynot speak, knowing that the Path is constructed by the aspirant as the spinnerspins its web out of the centre [585] of his own being. Thus only those soulsflower forth into adepts in any specific generation who have “trodden thewinepress of the wrath of God alone” or who (in other words) have worked outtheir karma alone and who have intelligently taken up the task of treading thePath.2. Obey the inward impulses of the soul . Well do the teachers of the raceinstruct the budding initiate to practise discrimination and train him in thearduous task of distinguishing between:a. Instinct and intuition.b. Higher and lower mind.c. Desire and spiritual impulse.d. Selfish aspiration and divine incentive.e. The urge emanating from the lunar lords, and the unfoldment of the solarLord.It is no easy or flattering task to find oneself out and to discover thatperhaps even the service we have rendered and our longing to study and work hashad a basically selfish origin, and resting on a desire for liberation or adistaste for the humdrum duties of everyday. He who seeks to obey the impulsesof the soul has to cultivate an accuracy of summation and a truthfulness withhimself which is rare indeed these days. Let him say to himself “I must to myown Self be true” and in the private moments of his life and in the secrecy ofhis own meditation let him not gloss over one fault, nor excuse himself along asingle line. Let him learn to diagnose his own words, deeds, and motives, and tocall things by their true names. Only thus will he train himself in spiritualdiscrimination and learn to recognise truth in all things. Only thus will thereality be arrived at and the true self known.3. Pay no consideration to the prudential considerations of worldly science andsagacity . If the aspirant has need to cultivate a capacity to walk alone, if hehas to [586] develop the ability to be truthful in all things, he has likewiseneed to cultivate courage. It will be needful for him to run counterconsistently to the world’s opinion, and to the very best expression of thatopinion, and this with frequency. He has to learn to do the right thing as hesees and knows it, irrespective of the opinion of earth’s greatest and mostquoted. He must depend upon himself and upon the conclusions he himself has cometo in his moments of spiritual communion and illumination. It is here that somany aspirants fail. They do not do the very best they know; they fail to act indetail as their inner voice tells them; they leave undone certain things whichthey are prompted to do in their moments of meditation, and fail to speak theword which their spiritual mentor, the Self, urges them to speak. It is in theaggregate of these unaccomplished details that the big failures are seen.There are no trifles in the life of the disciple and an unspoken word orunfulfilled action may prove the factor which is holding a man from initiation.4. Live a life which is an example to others. Is it necessary for me to enlargeupon this? It seems as if it should not be and yet here again is where men fail.What after all is group service? Simply the life of example. He is the bestexponent of the Ageless Wisdom who lives each day in the place where is the lifeof the disciple; he does not live it in the place where he thinks he should be.Perhaps after all the quality which produces the greatest number of failuresamong aspirants to adeptship is cowardice. Men fail to make good where they arebecause they find some reason which makes them think they should be elsewhere.Men run away, almost unrealising it, from difficulty, from inharmoniousconditions, from places which involve problems, and from circumstances whichcall for action of a high sort and which are staged to draw out the best that isin a man, [587] provided he stays in them. They flee from themselves and fromother people, instead of simply living the life.The adept speaks no word which can hurt, harm or wound. Therefore he has had tolearn the meaning of speech in the midst of life’s turmoil. He wastes no time inself pity or self justification for he knows the law has placed him where he is,and where he best can serve, and has learnt that difficulties are ever of aman’s own making and the result of his own mental attitude. If the incentive tojustify himself occurs he recognises it as a temptation to be avoided. Herealises that each word spoken, each deed undertaken and every look and thoughthas its effect for good or for evil upon the group.Is it not apparent therefore why so few achieve and so many fail?THE AWAKENING OF THE CENTRESSpeaking more technically and therefore warranting the use of the wordInstructions in connection with this treatise for aspirants and disciples, itmust be carefully borne in mind that the main task of the aspirant is thehandling of energies, both in himself and in the world of physical phenomena andexternalisation. This consequently involves an understanding of the centres andof their awakening. But understanding must come first, and the awakening at amuch later date in the sequence of time. This awakening will fall into twostages:First, there is the stage wherein, by the practice of a disciplined life and bythe purification of the thought life, the seven centres are automaticallybrought into a right condition of rhythm, vitality and vibratory activity. Thisstage involves no danger and there is no directed thought—in connection with thecentres—permitted to the aspirant. By that I mean he is not allowed toconcentrate his mind upon any one centre, nor may he seek to awaken or energisethem. He must remain engrossed with the [588] problem of purifying the bodies inwhich the centres are found, which are primarily the astral, etheric andphysical bodies, remembering ever that the endocrine system and the seven majorglands, in particular, are the effectual externalisations of the seven majorcentres. In this stage, the aspirant is working all around the centres and isdealing with their environing matter and with the living substance whichcompletely surrounds them. This is all that can be safely undertaken by themajority, and it is with this stage that the bulk of the aspirants in the worldtoday are engaged and with which they must remain engaged for a long time tocome.Secondly, there is the stage wherein the centres, through the effective work ofthe earlier stage, become what is esoterically called “released within theprison house”; they can now become the subject (under proper direction by ateacher) of definite methods of awakening and of charging,—the methods differingaccording to the ray, personality and egoic, of the aspirant. Hence thedifficulty of the subject and the impossibility of giving general and blanketrules.It is interesting here to note, even though it has no bearing on the matter ofpersonal training, that this method, first of a long period of purification andlater of energising scientifically, is the one employed by the guiding hierarchywhich stands behind world affairs. Steadily They have been working at the taskof clarifying world matter, and bringing about world purification on a largescale. This is the first stage of the work and only became generally possiblewhen man became a more truly thinking entity, during the past few centuries, ona wide level. This purification is going on now in all departments of humanexistence, for humanity now stands, or rather three-fifths of it stands, on thepath of probation. Through welfare and uplift movements and the wide spread ofsanitation, the work goes forward [589] on the physical plane; through politicalupheavals which reveal abuses; through economic discontent which is after all astriving to change that which is undesirable so as to give the human unitconditions of living which will lead to thought and from thought to soulcontrol; through religious propaganda and the efforts of the many organisationsand groups throughout the world which hold before the minds of men what I mightsymbolically call “the hope of Heaven” (using the word “Heaven” as a symbol ofperfection and of purity), the work of this stage is going steadily forward. Sosuccessful has it been that now the filth and impurities which surround theworld soul and which keep humanity from its true expression are known andrecognised and there is consequently a steady drive towards betterment. All hasbeen brought to the surface, and the result seems appalling and uncontrollableto those who only see the surface. But underneath, the deep river of purity andtruth is flowing strong.One evidence of the success of the world movement towards pure living and thedestruction of that which hinders is that the work of the second stage is now inprocess of initiation. The hierarchy, for the first time in world history, cannow work directly with the centres in the body of humanity. Thus we have now theformation of the new Group of World Workers, who, in their totality throughoutthe world, constitute the heart centre and the “centre between the eyebrows” ofthe etheric body of the human family. Through the one, spiritual life can beginto flow in and vitalise all the centres, and through the other, the vision canbe seen and the inner worlds sensed and known.I would here like to point out two other matters, and so clarify the entiresituation. There is much confusion on the subject of the centres and mucherroneous teaching [590] leading many astray and causing a great deal ofmisapprehension.First, I would state that no work such as an effort to awaken the centres shouldever be undertaken whilst the aspirant is aware of definite impurities in hislife, or when the physical body is in poor condition or is diseased. Neithershould it be undertaken when the pressure of external circumstances is such thatthere is no place or opportunity for quiet and uninterrupted work. It isessential that for the immediate and focussed work on the centres there shouldbe the possibility of hours of seclusion and of freedom from interruption. ThisI cannot too strongly emphasise, and I do so in order to demonstrate to theeager student that at this period of our history there are few whose livespermit of this seclusion. This is however a most beneficent circumstance and notone to be deplored. Only one in a thousand aspirants is at the stage where heshould begin to work with the energy in his centres and perhaps even thisestimate is too optimistic. Better far that the aspirant serves and loves andworks and disciplines himself, leaving his centres to develop and unfold moreslowly and therefore more safely. Unfold they inevitably will and the slower andsafer method is (in the vast majority of cases) the more rapid. Prematureunfoldment involves much loss of time, and carries with it often the seeds ofprolonged trouble.Over-stimulation of the brain cells is necessarily one of the results of themerging, by an act of will, of the fires which circulate in the human body. Suchstimulation can produce insanity and the breaking down of the cellular structureof the brain, and through the over-activity of the cell life can also inducethat internal friction between them which will eventuate in brain tumors andabscesses. This cannot be too strongly reiterated.The underlying objective in all laya yoga work (or [591] work with the centres)is based upon the fact that the energy of the cells which compose the body orthe matter aspect (called in The Secret Doctrine , and in A Treatise on CosmicFire, “fire by friction”) must be blended with the fire of consciousness. Thislatter is the energy, present in matter yet different from the fire of matteritself, which underlies the entire nervous system and because it so underlies itproduces sensitivity and awareness. It is the cause of response to contact andconfers the ability to register and record impression, as you well know. Thisfire is technically called “solar fire”, and when it blends with the fire ofmatter and with the “electric fire” of the highest divine aspect, then man’sbeing comes into its fullest manifestation and the great work is completed. Butit is a most dangerous undertaking, when induced before the mechanism is readyto deal with it.This triple blending can only be safely undertaken by the highly organised androunded-out person, and by one who has achieved the capacity to focus hisattention in the head and from that high point direct the entire process offusion. It involves the ability to withdraw the consciousness literally into theetheric body and yet at the same time to preserve—in full awareness—a point ofcontact in the head, and from that point direct the automaton, the physicalbody. It presupposes, if successful, certain etheric conditions in the body. Oneof these is the process of burning through or destruction (partial or complete)of any obstructions found along the spinal cord which could prevent the freerising of the fire at the base of the spine, commonly called the kundalini fire,which lies quiescent, latent and potential in the lowest centre. This is “thesleeping serpent which must arise and uncoil”.Each centre in the spine is separated from the one above it and the one below itby an interlaced protective [592] web which is composed of a curious blend ofetheric and gaseous substance. This has to be burnt away and dissipated beforethere can be the free play of the fires of the body. A complete network of nadisand centres underlies and is the subtle counterpart of the nervous and endocrinesystems. A little clear thinking therefore will demonstrate the need forexcessive care, for there will obviously be a direct effect upon the externalapparatus and this in its turn will definitely affect what the psychologistscall “behaviour”. There are four of these interlaced circular “webs” lyingbetween the five centres found on the rod of the spinal column, such as follows:0/0/0/0/0, and three are to be found in the head. These three bisect the head,and form a series of crosses, as follows:[Image00003.jpg]This is much like the cross upon the Union Jack, which has always had anesoteric significance for the student, and indicates a point in racialevolution. This cross in the head separates the ajna centre (the centre betweenthe eyebrows) from the head centre, for it lies behind that centre in theforehead, and at the same time forms a protective shield between the ajna andthroat centres.These etheric webs are in reality disks, rotating or revolving at specificrates, which differ for the different centres, and according to the point inevolution of the system of centres concerned. Only when these webs are burntaway by the ascending and descending fires can the true centres really be seen.Many clairvoyants confuse the centres and their protective counterparts, for thelatter have a radiance and light of their own.As the life achieves an increasingly high vibration through purification anddiscipline, the fire of the soul, which is literally the fire of mind, causesthe centres also to increase their vibration, and this increased activity setsup a contact with the protective “webs”, or disks of pranic energy found oneither side of them. Thus, [593] through the interplay, they are gradually wornaway, so that in the course of time they become perforated, if I might use suchan inadequate term. Many aspirants feel convinced that they have raised thekundalini fire at the base of the spine and are consequently making rapidprogress, whereas all that they have accomplished is to burn or “rub through”the web at some point or other up the spine. A sensation of burning or of painin any part of the spine, when not due to physiological causes, is, in themajority of cases, due to the piercing of one or other of the webs, through theactivity of the centres allied to them. This happens very frequently in the caseof women in connection with the solar plexus centre, and with men in connectionwith the sacral centre. Both these centres—as a result of evolutionarydevelopment—are exceedingly active and highly organised, for they are theexpression of the physical creative nature and of the emotional body. A sensetherefore of burning and of pain in the back indicates usually undue activity ina centre, which produces destructive results upon the protective apparatus, andis no true indication of spiritual unfoldment and superiority. It may indicatethe latter, but it should be remembered that, where there is true spiritualgrowth, pain and danger are in this connection practically eliminated.There has been much loose talk about the raising of the kundalini fire and muchmisapprehension in the matter. Let me assure you that it is most difficult toraise, and can only be done by a definite act of the will and through theintense mental focussing and concentrated attention of the man, seated on thethrone of consciousness in the head. The Masonic tradition has the teachingclearly held in its beautiful ritual of the raising of the great Master-Mason.Only when there is united effort of a fivefold kind, and only after repeatedfailure, does the [594] vivifying life course through the entire body and bringto life the true man.The second point I would touch upon is that all this deeply esoteric work mustonly proceed under the direction of the skilled teacher. Platitudinously, theaspirant is told that “when the pupil is ready, the Master will appear”. He thensettles comfortably back and waits, or focusses his attention upon an attempt toattract the attention of some Master, having apparently settled in his mind thathe is ready or good enough. He naturally gives himself a spiritual prod atintervals, and attends spasmodically to the work of discipline and ofpurification. But steady and prolonged undeviating effort on the part ofaspirants is rare indeed.It is indeed true that at the right moment the Master will appear, but the rightmoment is contingent upon certain self-induced conditions. When the process ofpurification has become a life-long habit, when the aspirant can at willconcentrate his consciousness in the head, when the light in the head shinesforth and the centres are active, then the Master will take the man in hand. Inthe meantime he may have a vision of the Master, or he may see a thought-form ofthe Master, and may get much real good and inspiration from contact with thereflected reality, but it is not the Master and does not indicate the stage ofaccepted discipleship. Through the medium of the light of the soul, the soul canbe known. Therefore seek the light of your own soul, and know that soul as yourdirector. When soul contact is established, your own soul will, if I may soexpress it, introduce you to your Master. With all due reverence again may Iadd, that the Master waits not with eagerness to make your acquaintance. In theworld of souls, your soul and His soul are allied, and know essential unity. Butin the world of human affairs and in the process of the great work it should beremembered that when a Master [595] takes an aspirant into His group ofdisciples, that aspirant is, for a long time, a liability and oft a hindrance.Students over-estimate themselves quite often, even when repudiating such anidea; subjectively they have a real liking for themselves and are frequentlypuzzled as to why the Great Ones give them no sign, nor indicate Their watchingcare. They will not and They need not until such time as the aspirant has usedto the full the knowledge which he has gained from lesser teachers, and frombooks and printed scriptures of the world. Students must attend to the immediateduty and prepare their mechanisms for service in the world, and should desistfrom wasting time and looking for a Master; they should achieve mastery wherenow they are defeated and in the life of service and of struggle they may thenreach the point of such complete self-forgetfulness that the Master may find nohindrance in His approach to them.It will be apparent therefore from the above that I cannot give specificinstructions as to the awakening of the centres and the burning of the ethericweb which will result in the release of energy. Such information is toodangerous and too intriguing to be put in the hands of the general public, whoare driven by desire for some new thing, and lack right poise and the neededmental development. The time has come however when the fact that there is anenergy body underlying the nervous system must be recognized by the world atlarge, and when the nature of the seven centres, their structure and locationshould be grasped technically, and when the laws of their unfoldment should bewidely known. But more than this cannot yet be safely given. The intricatenature of this science of the centres is too great for general usefulness. Theteaching to be given in any particular case and the methods to be applied aredependent upon too many factors for a general rule and instruction to be given.The ray and type, the sex and point in [596] evolution must be considered andalso the balance of the centres. By this I mean the consideration as to theirover-development in one case and under development in another and as to whetherthere is a preponderance of the force below or above the diaphragm, or whetherthe main energy is concentrated in that central clearing house, the solarplexus. The quality and the brilliance of the light in the head has to bestudied, for it indicates the measure of soul control and the relative purity ofthe vehicles, and the various etheric “webs” have to be carefully dealt with,and also the rate of vibration of the web and the centre. A synchronisation hasto be set up and this is most difficult to bring about. These are only a few ofthe points that the teacher has to note, and it is apparent therefore that onlya teacher who has achieved synthetic vision and can see a man “whole,” or as hereally is, can give those instructions which will reverse the ancient rhythm ofthe centres, destroy without pain and danger the protective sheaths, and raisethe kundalini fire from the base of the spine to the exit in the head.Such teachers are found by the pupil when he has carried forward his life workunder the direction of his soul, when he has grasped the theory of the scienceof the centres, and has mastered and controlled the astral nature and itscorresponding centre, the solar plexus. The emphasis laid upon the dominance ofthe Christ principle by Christianity has laid a sure foundation for the work tobe done. This truth is curiously substantiated in a study of the number “eight”in connection with the centres which, we are told, is the number of the Christ.There are eight centres if the spleen is counted, all of them are multiples ofeight with the exception of the centre at the base of the spine which has fourpetals, one half of eight. In our day and in the Anglo Saxon mode of writing,the number eight is the basic symbol [597] of all the centres, for the petalsare really in form like a number of superimposed eights. The word petal ispurely pictorial and a centre is formed on this pattern. First, a circle, O;then two circles, touching each other and making therefore an 8. Then, as thepetals increase in number, it is simply a growth of these double circles,superimposed at differing angles one upon another until we arrive at thethousand-petalled lotus in the head.These centres are, in the last analysis, twofold in function. They demonstratethe form building aspect of divinity and through their activity bring the outerform into manifestation; then towards the end of the evolutionary cycle—both inthe macrocosm and the microcosm—they bring into expression the soul force andlife and produce the incarnation of a fully revealed son of God, with all thepowers and knowledge which divinity contains."},{"pageContent":"RULE FIFTEENThe fires approach the shadow, yet burn it not. The fire sheath is completed.Let the magician chant the words that blend the fire and water.THE ESOTERIC SENSE[601] We come now to the consideration of the last rule for magic. As we castour minds back over this long series of instructions certain basic lines ofteaching stand out with exceptional clarity, casting lesser lines of instructioninto the shade. Students would do well to remember that in the reading of anybasic textbook (and this one is so regarded) a definite procedure should beadopted. The student should first of all read the textbook as a whole, in orderto grasp its outstanding points, its main lines of teaching, and the three orfour propositions upon which its entire structure is founded. Having graspedthese, he can then begin to deal with, and to isolate, those subsidiary pointswhich serve to elucidate and clarify the main essentials. After that, he cansuccessfully deal with the details. Students therefore would find it of interestto review these instructions, and gather out of them the major points; then theycan proceed to fill in the secondary teachings, and finally arrange the detaileddata under the various heads which have emerged. This, when completed wouldconstitute a synopsis of the book and would fix the knowledge it contains firmlyin the student’s memory.One of the main teachings which can be seen most clearly in all instructions ofa truly esoteric character, concerns the attitude of the student of the occult.He is supposed to be dealing with things subjective and esoteric; he aims to bea worker in white magic. As such, he must assume and consistently hold theposition of the Observer, detached from the mechanism of observation [602] andcontact; he must recognise himself as essentially a spiritual entity, differentin nature, objectives and methods of working from the bodies which he considersit wise to occupy temporarily and to employ. He must realise his unity and linesof contact with all similar workers and thus arrive at a conscious awareness ofhis position in the spiritual hierarchy of Beings. So much misinformation hasbeen spread abroad and so much emphasis has been unwisely laid upon status andposition in the so-called hierarchy of souls, that sane and balanced disciplesnow seek to turn their thoughts elsewhere and to eliminate as far as may be allthought of grades and spheres of activity. It is possible, in the swing of thependulum, to swing too far in the opposite direction and to discount thesestages of activity. Do not misunderstand me however; I do not suggest that anattempt be made to place people and to decide where they stand upon theevolutionary ladder. This has been most foolishly done in the past, with muchdishonour to the subject, so much so that, in the minds of the public, the wholematter has fallen into disrepute. If these stages are regarded sanely for whatthey are—states of extended consciousness, and grades of responsibility—then thedanger of personality reaction to the terms “accepted disciple, initiate, adept,master” would be negligible and much trouble would be eliminated. It must everbe remembered that individual status is rigidly kept to oneself, and the pointof evolution (which may be truthfully recognised as lying ahead of that of theaverage citizen) will be demonstrated by a life of active unselfish service andby the manifestation of an illumined vision which is ahead of the racial idea.In the gathering together in the world at this time of the new Group of WorldWorkers, true caution must be preserved. Each worker is responsible for himselfand his service and for no one else. It is wise to gauge and [603] approximatethe evolutionary status, not upon claims made, but upon work accomplished andthe love and wisdom shown. Judgment should be based upon an evidenced knowledgeof the plan as it works out in the wise formulation of the next step ahead forthe human race; upon a manifested esoteric sense, and upon an influence or anauric power which is wide, constructive and inclusive.You ask me to define more clearly what I mean by the words “esoteric sense”. Imean essentially the power to live and to function subjectively, to possess aconstant inner contact with the soul and the world in which it is found, andthis must work out subjectively through love, actively shown; through wisdom,steadily outpoured; and through that capacity to include and to identify oneselfwith all that breathes and feels which is the outstanding characteristic of alltruly functioning sons of God. I mean, therefore, an interiorly held attitude ofmind which can orient itself at will in any direction. It can govern and controlthe emotional sensitiveness, not only of the disciple himself, but of all whomhe may contact. By the strength of his silent thought, he can bring light andpeace to all. Through that mental power, he can tune in on the world thought,and upon the realm of ideas and can discriminate between and choose those mentalagencies and those concepts which will enable him, as a worker under the plan,to influence his environment and to clothe the new ideals in that thought matterwhich will enable them to be more easily recognised in the world of ordinaryeveryday thinking and living. This attitude of mind will enable the disciplealso to orient himself to the world of souls and in that high place ofinspiration and of light, discover his fellow-workers, communicate with themand—in union with them—collaborate in the working out of divine intentions.This esoteric sense is the main need of the aspirant at [604] this time of theworld history. Until aspirants have somewhat grasped it and can use it, they cannever form part of the New Group; they can never work as white magicians, andthese Instructions will remain for them theoretical and mainly intellectual,instead of being practical and effective.To cultivate this inner esoteric sense, meditation is needed, and continuousmeditation, in the early stages of development. But as time elapses and a mangrows spiritually, this daily meditation will perforce give way to a steadyspiritual orientation and then meditation as now understood and needed will nolonger be required. The detachment between a man and his usable forms will be socomplete, that he will live ever in the “seat of the Observer”, and from thatpoint and attitude will direct the activities of the mind and of the emotionsand of the energies which make physical expression possible and useful.The first stage in this development and culture of the esoteric sense consistsin the holding of the attitude of constant detached observation.The new Group of World Workers might well be regarded in its outer ranks as atrained body of organised observers. I would divide the group into threedivisions and I do so in order that aspirants and chelas all over the world maybe guided in their knowledge as to where they stand individually and may, insincerity and truth, begin to work with intelligence. They can be thus aided toplace themselves.First, there are the Organised Observers. These aspirants are learning to do twothings. They are learning to practice that detachment which will enable them tolive as souls in the world of daily affairs and to understand the realsignificance of the words: to work without attachment. They are also, secondly,those students of world affairs in one or other of the seven departments [605]earlier referred to when I brought the new group to the attention of the world.They are studying the signs of the times. They investigate the great drama ofhistory in order to discover its main trend and so express to the ordinaryacademic world and to the thinkers of the race what they see and understand.Running all through human history is a triple thread and in the interplay ofthese three threads the story of evolution is to be found. One thread guides thethoughts of man as he deals with the development of the form aspect, with theracial trends, and it shows how undeviatingly the forms of races, of countries,and of the fauna and flora of our planetary life have kept pace with the needsof the slowly emerging sons of God. The second thread leads us to anunderstanding of the growth of consciousness, and indicates emergence from theinstinctual stage into that of intellectual awareness, and on to thatintuitional illumination which is the present goal of consciousness.The third thread concerns the Plan itself and here we enter the realm of thetruly unknown. What the plan is, and what the goal, is as yet totally unrealisedexcept by the highest adept and the most exalted of the sons of God. Until theillumined mind and the power of intuitional response are developed in the humanfamily, it is not possible for us to grasp the basic concepts which are to befound in the mind of God Himself. Until the highest point of the Mount ofInitiation has been climbed, it is not possible to vision the Promised Land asit is. Until the limitations—the necessary limitations—of the three worlds havebeen surmounted and man can function as a free soul in the spiritual kingdom,that which lies beyond that kingdom must remain hid to man just as much as thehuman state of being and awareness remains a sealed book to the animal. This isa salutary and needed lesson which all disciples should grasp. [606]But observers of times and seasons can make rapid progress in intuitional growthif they persevere in their meditation, train their intellects, and endeavouralways to think in terms of universals. Let them look at the historicalretrospect as part of the emerging preparation which will inaugurate the future.Let them take heart of grace as they recognise the fact that the kingdom ofsouls is steadily becoming a physical plane phenomenon (do I speakparadoxically?) and will be known eventually as a kingdom of nature andconsidered so by the scientists before two centuries have passed away. These“Organised Observers” form the outer circle of the new group and their keynoteis synthesis, the elimination of non-essentials and the organising of humanknowledge. Working in the many fields of human awareness, they are distinguishedby a non-sectarian spirit, and by an ability to deal with foundationalessentials and to link up varying departments of human investigation into oneorganised and unified whole.Second, the next group in the new Group of World Workers is that of thetelepathic communicators . These are much fewer in number and are distinguishedby their relatively close interrelation with each other. They are primarily alinking or a bridging group. They are gathered out of the more exoteric circleof the organised observers, but have a wider scope of service than they have,for they work in a more truly esoteric manner. They are in touch with eachother, and with the organised observers, but they are likewise in touch with thegroup of men and women who stand at the very centre or heart of the world group.Their work is threefold and very difficult. Steadily they have to cultivate thatdetachment which characterises the soul which knows itself. Steadily they takethe knowledge and information accumulated by the organised observers and adaptit to the need of the world, and give out the teaching. They work effectively[607] but always from behind the scenes, and though they may be known in theworld in this early stage of the work of the new group, and though they may betherefore recognised as teachers, writers and workers, later they will recedemore and more into the background and will work through the outer circle. Theywill inspire them, and will place increasing responsibility upon theirshoulders; they will nurture the growth of telepathic interplay in the world andthus weave those strands which will eventually bridge the present gap betweenthe seen and the unseen and so make the new world possible—a world in whichdeath as we know it will be abolished and a trained universal continuity ofconsciousness be established. That is why the emphasis is laid in training themembers of this group in the new group, upon telepathic sensitivity. The membersof this second circle of workers are taught to develop sensitiveness in threedirections: to the thoughts of men in physical incarnation; to the minds ofthose who have passed over and who are still in mind bodies, and thirdly to thegroup of spiritual Beings who stand as the custodians of the evolutionaryprocess and through whose hands the three threads of developing life steadilypass.Their task is exceedingly hard, far harder than that of the first group andharder even than that of the last, for they lack as yet certain powers andneeded experience. Their centre of consciousness is the intuition and not thatof the synthesising intellect, and their state of awareness is wide andinclusive. They therefore can suffer more than the majority, and few there arewho are not at this stage too sensitive for their own comfort and too responsiveto vibrations emanating from the form aspect in all three worlds. Their state ofdetachment is not yet complete. They bridge, and therefore support infiniteproblems and respond to world pain. They see, if I may so express it, too much,for theirs is not yet the privilege [608] of visioning with clarity the goalthat lies two hundred years ahead. They sense the present need. They areresponsive to the new tide of spiritual force which is flowing in. They carrythe weight of humanity on their shoulders, and because they are somewhatcoordinated, they live in all three worlds at once, and this few can do. Theyare aware of the urgency of the present opportunity and also of the apathy ofthe many and for these reasons they work under terrific pressure.Third, the innermost group of all is that of the members of the Hierarchyitself. I care not the least whether these liberated souls are recognised asElder Brethren of the race, as Masters of the Wisdom, as the Cloud of Witnesses,as the Christ and His Church, as Supermen or under any terms which the inheritedtendencies of humanity or tradition may choose to call them. They themselvescare less. The petty quarrels as to their personalities and names and statusmatter not at all. But they are the intelligent forces of the planet; theyexpress, because of their state of expanded consciousness, the Mind of God; theyembody the intelligent principle, immutable and unchanging, and through themflows the energy which we call the Will of God, for lack of betterunderstanding. They know far more of the plan than do the two outer circles inthe new Group of World Workers, for they see clearly just what is the next stepwhich planetary evolution will guide the race to take during the next twohundred years. They do not occupy themselves with idle speculations as to theultimate goal at the close of a world age. This may surprise you in view of themany speculations of the uninitiate. But so it is. They know that there is atime and a season for all things, and looking ahead and comprehendingintuitively the goal for all kingdoms in the immediate future, all their unitedeffort is bent to one end—the cultivating of the intuitional telepathicresponsiveness of the Communicators who bridge the gap [609] between them andthe physical world. These latter in their turn seek to employ the Observers,Knowers, Communicators, and Observers—all working in a close if oft-timesunrealised unity, and all responsive (according to their degree) to theimpulsion of the Mind and Will of the Logos, the solar Deity.Beyond this triple group stand the Thrones, Principalities, and Powers with whomwe need not concern ourselves. On the other side stands humanity torn by thedisasters of the past world war, bewildered by the social, religious andeconomic pressure of the present, sensitive and responsive to the influences andenergies pouring in on the new tide of the Aquarian Age; unable to understandand explain, and conscious only of a longing for liberty of thought and ofphysical condition, snatching at every chance to gain knowledge and so providinga fertile field wherein this new group can work.We have seen that the objective of all inner training is to develop the esotericsense, and to unfold that inner sensitive awareness which will enable a man tofunction, not only as a Son of God in physical incarnation but as one who alsopossesses that continuity of consciousness which will enable him to beinteriorly awake as well as exteriorly active. This is accomplished throughdeveloping the power to be a trained Observer. I commend these words to allaspirants. It is persistence in the attitude of right observation that bringsabout detachment from form, a subsequent power to use form at will and with theend in view of furthering hierarchical plans and consequent usefulness tohumanity. When this power to observe has been somewhat brought about, we thenhave the aspirant joining that intermediate group of trained Communicators whostand between the aforementioned groups (the exoteric groups and the group ofspiritual workers on the subjective plane), interpreting the one to the other.It is well to remember that even the members [610] of the Hierarchy profit bythe opinions and advice of those disinterested disciples who can be trusted torightly recognise and interpret the need of the hour.When this stage has been reached and a man is in conscious touch with the planthen true magical work can begin. Men and women, who are beginning to live assouls, can undertake the magical work of the new age, and can inaugurate thosechanges and that rebuilding which will bring about the manifestation of the newheavens and the new earth, to which all the Scriptures of the world beareloquent testimony. They can then work with forces in etheric matter and sobring into being those physical plane creations and organisations which willmore adequately embody the life of God in the Aquarian Age which is now upon us.It is to this stage that Rule XV refers.These words mark the consummation of the magical work, and are equally true ofthe magical work of a solar Logos, of a planetary Logos, of an incarnating soul,or of that advanced human being who has learnt to work as a white magician underthe plan of the great White Lodge. It, of course, refers to the work of thosewho through intellectual achievement have learnt to work as magicians but onwhat is called the black side, for the same rules of magical work hold good forboth groups, though the motivating impulse differs. But with the work of theblack magician we have naught to do. That which they do is powerful in transienteffect, using the word transient in its cyclic sense; but these effects must indue time cease, and be subordinated to the claims and the work of the bringersof light and of life.The shadow stage is the dim and uncertain period which is found prior to denseand concrete manifestation. It does not here refer to the shadow as thecounterpart in physical manifestation of the soul. It refers to one of theintermediate stages in the creative process. [611] It is technically called the“stage of the waxing and the waning of the nebulae”, and this stage precedes theappearance of the more stabilised and relatively static exoteric form. In theformation of a solar system, this is recognised as a preliminary period and canbe seen going on in the starry heavens. It indicates the stage wherein the GreatMagician is only in process of carrying forward His work; He has not yet finallychanted those mystic words or those spiritual sounds which will produceconcretion and the tangible appearance of form.The Secret Doctrine refers to the three fires, and these are of ancient usage;the Vishnu Purana gives these fires exactly the same nomenclature as does H.P.B.who borrowed the terms from the ancient Scripture. Electric Fire, Solar Fire andFire by Friction, when brought into conjunction, produce the manifestedmacrocosm and microcosm, and to this conjunction my earlier Treatise on CosmicFire referred. These fires are esoterically one fire but this fire produces,according to the witnessing consciousness (itself at varying stages ofevolutionary development) the effect of differentiated fiery essence. This fieryessence can be known as Life itself, or as the “Self-shining Light,” or it canbe known as the active form inherent in the one substance which underlies allphenomena. In this final rule for magic the fires which are considered are thoseof matter itself which approach the shadow and (as the Old Commentarysymbolically expresses it) “rise up from the second darkness at the call of thespirit of light and meet in their appointed place that which will absorb themand raise them to the fiery point from whence the fires of living light andradiant life have come.”THE NEGATION OF THE GREAT ILLUSIONThe phrase in Rule XV which says “that blend the fire and water” has referenceto the effect produced at the [612] point of condensation, after the great wordsbringing about that effect have been pronounced. This rule is almost incapableof explanation and it is not permitted to me to give to you the words thateffect this process. Only some hints may be given which will serve to encouragethe true aspirant to think and may, alas, only irritate the casual thinker whoseeks easy and quick methods and formulas through which to work. Heat andmoisture are present in the production of all forms of life, but the greatmystery (and almost the final mystery to be explained to the adept) is how themerging of three fires can produce moisture or the watery element. This problemand this phenomenon constitute the basis of the Great Illusion to which theancient books refer; through the agency of the combination, the enveloping mayais produced. There is, in reality, no such thing as water; the watery sphere,the astral plane, is, could you but realise it, an illusory effect and has noreal existence. Yet—in time and space and to the understanding of the witnessingconsciousness—it is more real than that which it hides and conceals. I cannotmake this clearer in words. It is only possible to suggest to the intelligentstudent that the light of his soul (reflected in his mind) and the energy ofform (as expressed in his etheric body) are for him, in the realm of temporaryduality, his two basic realities. The watery nature of his astral experience inwhich these two aspects of divinity seem (again illusion, be it noted) to meetand work is but a glamorous phenomenon and in an occult sense is not based onfact. Any true aspirant knows that his spiritual progress can be gauged in termsof his freedom from this illusion and of his release into the clear air and purelight of his spiritual consciousness. In its consciousness, the animal kingdomworks with the second of these two basic realities, and for it the life of theetheric body and the force which governs the animal or material nature are the[613] prime expression of truth. Yet the animal is beginning to sense dimly theworld of illusion and possesses certain psychic powers and senses whichrecognise yet fail to interpret the astral plane. The veil of illusion isbeginning to fail before the eyes of the animal but it knows it not. The humanbeing has wandered for ages in the world of illusion, for it is of his owncreating. Yet man in his turn, from the standpoint of consciousness, has contactwith both the realities and learns little by little to dissipate the illusion bythe steady growth of the radiant light of the soul. May I pause here to remindyou that duality is only a stage on the evolutionary arc, leading eventually tothe realisation of unity.The veil of illusion resembles the moment before dawn when the world of familiarthings is seen through the fogs and the streamers of mist which veil the worldform and also veil the rising sun. Then we have that half-time, that mysteriousand vague period when the real is hidden by the unreal; then we have that weirdand distorted condition when forms are not seen as they truly are but lose theirshape and colour and perspective. True vision is then impossible. The astralstage and the vast cycle of time in which the great illusion holds sway cantherefore be judged, from the above symbolic approach, to be but temporary andtransient. It is not the stage of a definitely divine manifestation; it is notthe stage of pure undimmed awareness; it is not the stage of the perfected work.It is that period of time wherein the half-Gods walk; it is the time whereintruth is only dimly sensed, the vision only vaguely and occasionally seen; it isthe stage of the half-realised Plan, and when one works on partial knowledge,difficulty and mistakes are bound to supervene. It is also the stage ofdistortion and of constant mutability: whilst it is in evidence we have theapparently ceaseless pulling hither and thither by forces, working blindly andseemingly without purpose. [614] As far as humanity is concerned, it is the timewherein man is enveloped in mist and fog, and lost in the miasmas arising out ofthe ground (symbol of the foundational nature of the animal kingdom). Yet attimes this stage is seen to be unreal as the dawning light of the spiritualconsciousness pierces through the surrounding darkness. It is the interludebetween the dominance of the animal consciousness and that of the spiritual, andthis interlude of astral illusion is only known in the human family. There is noastral plane except in the consciousness of the fourth kingdom in nature, forman is “under illusion” in a sense different to the conscious awareness of anyother kingdom—subhuman or superhuman.I despair in making my meaning clear. How can one who is subject to theillusions of the senses, as are all human creatures, conceive of the state ofconsciousness of those who have freed themselves from the illusions of theastral plane or realise the state of awareness of those forms of life which havenot yet developed astral consciousness? It is the dual nature of the mind whichcauses this illusion, for the mind of man presents to him the keys of thekingdom of heaven or locks upon him the door of entrance into the world ofspiritual realities. It is the concretising unprincipled mind which brings aboutall the troubles of humanity. It is the sense of I-ness and the spirit ofseparative individuality which has brought humanity to its present condition,and yet even that is a part of the great developing process. It is theconsciousness of duality, and the subjectively realised and synchronouslyacknowledged sense of “I am God” and “I am form” which has plunged mankind intothe great illusion.Yet it is this very illusion which renders up to man eventually the secretpassword into the kingdom of God and brings about his release. It is this mayaitself which [615] serves to guide him into truth and knowledge; it is on theplane of the astral that the heresy of separateness has to be overcome, and itis on the field of Kurukshetra that the individual aspiring Arjuna, and thecosmic Arjuna learn the lesson that the knower and the known are one. The secretscience of the Master of the Wisdom is the secret of how to dissipate the fogsand mist and darkness and gloom which are produced by the union of the fires inthe early stages. The secret of the Master is the discovery that there is noastral plane; he finds that the astral plane is a figment of the imagination andhas been created through the uncontrolled use of the creative imagination andthe misuse of the magical powers. The work of the hierarchy is primarily tobring to an end the shadows and to dispel the moisture; the aim of the Mastersis to let in the light of the soul and to show that spirit and matter are thetwo realities which constitute the unity and that it is only in time and inspace and through the cyclic misuse of the magical and psychic powers that theastral plane of the great illusion has come into being and is now so real athing that it is—in a certain sense—more real (to man) than the kingdom of lightand the kingdom of form. In one most interesting sense it is true that becausethe human being is a soul and because the light of the soul is found within himand is gradually growing into fuller radiance this itself produces the illusion.Because of this illusion, the magical work has been carried forward along wronglines and has been based on wrong motives and fitted into a scheme which isstronger than the average worker, for the whole force of the world illusion isagainst all the efforts of the beginner in white magic.The rules therefore end with the statement that the magician chants the wordsthat “blend the fire and water”—but these are the rules for the aspirant. Therules for initiates of a paralleling kind end with the [616] words: “Let theinitiate sound the note that unifies the fires”. This is significant and of muchencouragement to the beginner in the magical work. He is still perforce workingon the astral plane and he cannot possibly avoid so doing for much time. Themark of growth for him is the steady withdrawal of his consciousness from thatplane and his attainment of mental poise and of mental awareness, followed bycreative work on the mental plane. There is an interesting and ancientproclamation found in the archives of the adepts which covers some of the stagesin the magical work, couched of course in symbolic form:“Let the magician stand within the great world sea. Let him immerse himself inwater and there let him stand his ground. Let him look down into the waterydepths. Nothing is seen in form correct. Nothing appears but water. Beneath hisfeet it moves, around him, and above his head. He cannot speak; he cannot see.Truth disappears in water.“Let the magician stand within the stream. Around him water flows. His feetstand firm on land and rock, but all the forms he sees are lost in the greyimmensity of mist. The water is around his neck, but, feet on rock and head inair, he maketh progress. All is distortion still. He knows he stands, but whereto go and how to go he knows not, nor understands. He sounds the words of magic,but muffled, dim and lost, the mist returns them to him, and no true note soundsforth. Around him are the many sounds of many forms, which swallow up his sound.“Let the magician stand in watery mist, free of the running stream. Someoutlines dim appear. He sees a little distance on the Path. Flickers of lightbreak through the clouds of mist and fog. He hears his voice; its note isclearer and more true. The forms of other pilgrims can be seen. Behind him isthe sea. Beneath his feet is seen the stream. Around him mist and fog. Above hishead no sky is seen nor sun.“Let the magician stand on higher ground, but in the rain. The drops pour downupon him; the thunder breaks; the lightning flashes in the sky. But as the rainpours down, [617] it dissipates the mist, it washes clean the form and clearsthe atmosphere.“Thus forms are seen and sounds are heard, though dim as yet, for loud thethunder roars and heavy is the sound of failing rain. But now the sky is seen;the sun breaks forth and in between the drifting clouds, expanses of the blue ofheaven cheer the tired eyes of the disciple.“Let the magician stand upon the mountain top. Beneath him in the valleys andthe plains, water and streams and clouds are seen. Above him is the blue ofheaven, the radiance of the rising sun, the pureness of the mountain air. Eachsound is clear. The silence speaks with sound.”Then come the highly significant phrases which give the picture of theconsummation:“Let the magician stand within the sun, looking from thence upon the ball ofearth. From that high point of peace serene let him sound forth the words thatwill create the forms, build worlds and universes and give his life to thatwhich he has made. Let him project the forms created on the mountain top in sucha way that they can cleave the clouds which circle round the ball of earth, andcarry light and power. These shall dispel the veil of forms which hide the trueabode of earth from the eye of the beholder.”Such is the end of the magical work. It involves the discovery that the astralplane and the astral light so-called are but the cinematographs created by manhimself. What man has created he can also destroy.More as to the magical work I may not at this time give. The words that blendmay not under any circumstances be given except under the oath of secrecy whichgoverns automatically the pledged disciple; these oaths are given to no man butare rendered by the aspirant to his own soul when that soul has conveyed to himthe words. He finds them for himself as the result of tireless effort andendeavour. He knows that these formulas are the prerogative of all souls and canonly be known and safely used by those who have realised the Self as One. Hetherefore pledges himself never to reveal these [618] words to any one who isnot functioning as a soul or who is wandering blinded in the vale of illusion.From this automatic response to knowledge by the knowers of the race, theHierarchy of Adepts has gathered its personnel.A CALL TO SERVICEIn closing this treatise on the magical work of the individual aspirant I seekto do two things:1. Indicate the immediate goal for students in this century, and summarise timesteps that they must take.2. Indicate the things which must be eliminated and overcome and the penaltieswhich overtake the probationer and the disciple when mistakes are made andfaults are condoned.First of all, the immediate goal must be well recognised, if lost effort is tobe avoided and real progress achieved. Many well-intentioned aspirants are proneto give undue time to their registered aspirations, and to the formulation oftheir plans for service. The world aspiration is now so strong and humanity isnow so potently orienting itself towards the Path that sensitive peopleeverywhere are being swept into a vortex of spiritual desire, and ardently longfor the life of liberation, of spiritual undertakings and of recorded soulconsciousness. Their recognition of their own latent possibilities is now sostrong that they over-estimate themselves; they give much time to picturingthemselves as the ideal mystic or in deploring their lack of spiritualachievement or their failure to achieve a sphere of service. Thus they becomelost, on the one hand, in the vague and misty realms of a beautiful idealism, ofcolourful hypotheses, and of delightful theories; on the other hand, they becomeengulfed in a dramatisation of themselves as centres of power in a field offruitful service; they [619] draw up, mentally, plans for world endeavour to seethemselves as the pivotal point around which that service will move; theyfrequently make an effort to work out these plans and produce an organisation,for instance on the physical plane, which is potentially valuable but equallypotentially useless, even if not dangerous. They fail to realise that themotivating impulse is primarily due to what the Hindu teachers call a “sense ofI-ness”, and that their work is founded on a subjective egoism which must—andwill—be eliminated before true service can be rendered.This tendency to aspiration and to service is right and good and should be seenas forming part of the coming universal consciousness and equipment of the raceas a whole. It is steadily coming to the surface owing to the growing strengthof the Aquarian influence which (from about the year A.D. 1640) has been gainingin potency and is producing two effects: it is breaking down the crystallisedold forms of the Piscean age, and is stimulating the creative faculties, as theyexpress themselves in group concepts, and group plans. As all of you well know,this is the cause of the present disturbed conditions, and these conditions canbe summed up in the words: impersonalisation wherein the state, group or groupsare regarded as of more importance than the individual and his rights;amalgamation , which is the tendency to fuse, blend, and cohere and to producethat interrelation which must eventually mark the intercourse of humanity andproduce that “synthesis of all the single men”, which Browning so truly remarksis the goal of the evolutionary process and marks the conclusion of the journeyof the divine prodigal; and sensitive intercommunication between units, groupsand combinations of groups, both on the subjective and objective sides ofmanifestation. In these three words—impersonalisation, amalgamation, andintercommunication—you [620] have summed up for you the outstanding phenomenawhich are appearing among us at this time. Students are urged to consider theplan as it is thus expressing itself, and to study these growing tendencies inhuman affairs. The fact that they are so prominent will appear, if the studentwill take the trouble to consider the panorama of history; he will then notethat even the history of five hundred years ago will reveal to him the fact thatat that time great individuals were the prominent factors, and that history isconcerned largely with the doings of powerful personalities who cast their spellover their time and age; then isolation and separateness governed human affairsand every man fought for his own land and every man forgot his brother and livedselfishly; then there was little interrelation between different races orbetween human families, and there was no real means of communication, exceptthat of personal contact, which was frequently impossible.Students should therefore ponder on these words which will be found to become ofincreasing importance during the next fifty years. This is far enough ahead forthe average student to look and to plan, and in their recognition of this phaseof the working out of the divine Purpose, they would do well to study theirindividual life expression and to ask themselves the following questions:1. Are they wasting time in mystical dreams, or are they occupied in a practicalapplication of the sensed spiritual truths, thus making them part of their dailyexperience?2. Do they find that their reaction to the growing impersonality of the age isone of resentment, or do they find that this relatively new attitude of personaldetachment is tending to solve their own personal problems? [621]3. Can they register an increasing ability to sense the thoughts and ideas ofothers, and do they find that they are becoming more sensitive and thereforemore able to swing into the great tide of intercommunication?4. How much is the faculty of dramatisation governing their daily life? Do theyfind that they are the centre of the universe, which revolves automaticallyaround them, or are they working at the problem of decentralising themselves andat absorption in the whole?These and other questions which will arise may serve to indicate theresponsiveness of the aspirant to the coming in of the new age.In this treatise on individual development and on astral control, a vision hasbeen given and a rule of life expounded which holds in it the needed instructionfor the interlude between the two great ages—the Piscean and the Aquarian. Apart of the underlying purpose has been expressed in words—a purpose which isrecognised by many all over the world and which is working out in practicallyevery department of human life. It is subconsciously registered and intuitivelyfollowed by many who know nothing of the technicalities of the plan. Those whoguide the human race are not particularly concerned as to the success of theemerging new conditions. That is most definitely assured, and the growth ofhuman realisation and of the spiritual consciousness of non-separateness cannotbe arrested. The problem is what means to continue to employ to bring thesedesired ends about in such a way that the form nature can be keyed up andprepared to handle its new responsibilities, and deal with its new knowledgeswithout undue suffering and those painful cleavages and hours of agony whichattract more attention than the more subtle and [622] successful growth ofdivine awareness. Every time there is a tendency towards synthesis andunderstanding in the world, every time the lesser is merged in the greater andthe unit is blended in the whole, every time great and universal concepts maketheir impact upon the minds of the masses, there is a subsequent disaster andcataclysm and breaking down of the form aspect and of that which might preventthose concepts becoming physical plane facts. This is therefore the problem ofthe hierarchical workers:—how to avert the dreaded suffering and carry man alongwhilst the tidal wave of this spiritual realisation sweeps over the world anddoes its needed work. Hence the present call to service which is sounding like atrumpet in the ear of all attentive disciples.This call to service usually meets with a response, but that response iscoloured by the personality of the aspirant and tinctured with his pride, andhis ambition. Need is truly realised. The desire to meet the need is genuine andsincere; the longing to serve and lift is real. Steps are taken which areintended by the aspirant to enable him to fit in with the plan. But the troublewith which we on the inner side have perforce to deal is, that though there isno question as to willingness and desire to serve, the characters andtemperaments are such that well nigh insuperable difficulties are presented.Through these aspirants we have to work, and the material they present gives usmuch trouble frequently.These latent characteristics often do not make their appearance until after theservice has been undertaken. That they are there, the watching guides maysuspect, but even they have not the right to withhold opportunity. When there isthis delayed appearance the tragedy is that many others suffer besides theaspirant concerned. As the human fabric makes itself felt and stands out of themist of idealism, of lovely plans and much talk and arranging, many are in themeantime attracted by synchronous [623] idealism, and gather around the server.When the hidden weaknesses appear, they suffer as well as he. The method of theGreat Ones, which is to seek out those who have trained themselves somewhat insensitive response and to work through them, carries with it certain dangers.The ordinary well-meaning aspirant is not in such danger as the more advancedand active disciple. He is in danger in three directions and can be swept offhis feet in three ways:1. His whole nature is under undue stimulation on account of his inner contactsand the spiritual forces with which he is in touch, and this carries with itreal danger, for he hardly knows as yet how to handle himself, and is scarcelyaware of the risk entailed.2. The people with whom he is working, in their turn, make his problem. Theirgreed, their adulation, and praise, and their criticism tend to becloud his way.Because he is not sufficiently detached and spiritually advanced, he walksbemused in a cloud of thought-forms, and knows it not. Thus he loses his way andwanders from the original intent and again he knows it not.3. His latent weaknesses must emerge under the pressure of the work, andinevitably he will show signs of cracking at times, if I may use such a word.The personality faults become strengthened as he seeks to carry his particularform of service to the world. I refer to that service which is self-sought andformulated on a background of personal ambition and love of power, even if onlypartially recognised or not recognised at all. He is under strain naturally,and—like a man carrying a heavy load up a steep hill—he discovers points ofstrain, and evinces a tendency to break [624] down physically, or to lower hisideal so as to conform to weaknesses.To all this must be added the strain of the period itself, and the generalcondition of unhappy humanity. This subconsciously has its effect on alldisciples, and upon all who are now working in the world. Some are showing signsof physical pressure, though the inner life remains poised and normal, sane andrightly oriented. Others are breaking up emotionally and this produces twoeffects according to the point of development of the aspirant to service. He iseither, through the strain, learning detachment, and this curiously enough iswhat might be called the “defense mechanism” of the soul in this present periodof world unfoldment, or he is becoming increasingly nervous and is on the way tobecome a neurotic. Others, again, are feeling the pressure in the mental body.They become bewildered in some cases and no clear truth appears. They then workon without inspiration, and because they know it to be right and they also havethe rhythm of work. Others are grasping opportunity as they see it and, to doso, fall back on innate self-assertion (which is the outstanding fault of themental types) and build up a structure around their service, and construct aform which in reality embodies what they desire, what they think to be right,but which is separative and the child of their minds and not the child of theirsouls. Some, in their turn, more potent and more coordinated, feel the pressureof the entire personality; the versatile psychic nature responds both to needand to the theory of the plan; they realise their truly valuable assets and knowthey have somewhat to contribute. They are still, however, so full of what iscalled personality that their service is gradually and steadily stepped down tothe level of that personality, and is consequently coloured by their personalityreactions, their likes and dislikes, [625] and their individual life tendenciesand habits. These eventually assert themselves and there is then a worker, doinggood work but spoiling it all by this unrealised separateness and individualmethods. This means that such a worker gathers to himself only those whom he cansubordinate and govern. His group is not coloured by the impulses of the newage, but by the separative instincts of the worker at the centre. The dangerhere is so subtle that much care must be taken by a disciple in self-analysis.It is so easy to be glamoured by the beauty of one’s own ideals and vision, andby the supposed rectitude of one’s own position, and yet all the time beinfluenced subjectively by love of personal power, individual ambition, jealousyof other workers, and the many traps which catch the feet of the unwarydisciple.But if true impersonality is cultivated, if the power to stand steady isdeveloped, if every situation is handled in a spirit of love and if there is arefusal to take hasty action and to permit separation to creep in, then therewill be the growth of a group of true servers, and the gathering out of thosewho can materialise the plan and bring to birth the new age and its attendantwonders.To do this, there must be courage of the rarest kind. Fear holds the world inthrall, and no one is exempt from its influence. For the aspirant and for thedisciple are two kinds of fear which require to be especially considered. Thefears that we dealt with in the earlier part of the treatise, and the fears thatare inherent, as you know, in existence itself are familiar to all of us. Theyhave their root in the instinctual nature (economic fears, fears arising out ofthe sex life, physical fear and terror, fear of the unknown, with thatdominating fear of death which colours so many lives) and have been the subjectof much psychological investigation. With them I do not seek to deal. They areto be overcome by the life of the soul as it permeates and transforms the dailylife, [626] and by the refusal of the aspirant to accord them any recognition.The first method builds towards future strength of character, and prevents thecoming in of any new fears. They cannot exist when the soul is consciouslycontrolling life and its situations. The second negatives the old thought formsand brings about eventually their destruction through lack of nourishment. Adual process is therefore carried forward, producing a genuine manifestation ofthe qualities of the spiritual man and a growing freedom from the thralldom ofage-old fear concepts. The student finds himself becoming steadily detached fromthe prime governing instincts which have hitherto served to weld him into thegeneral scheme of the elementary planetary life. It might be valuable here topoint out that all the major instincts have their roots in that peculiar qualityof the planetary life,—fear reactions, leading to activity of some kind. As youknow the psychologists list five main and dominant instincts, and we will verybriefly touch upon them.The instinct of self-preservation has its roots in an innate fear of death;through the presence of this fear, the race has fought its way to its presentpoint of longevity and endurance. The sciences which concern themselves with thepreservation of life, the medical knowledge of the day, and the achievements ofcivilised comfort have all grown out of this basic fear. All has tended to thepersistence of the individual, and to his preserved condition of being. Humanitypersists, as a race and as a kingdom in nature, as a result of this feartendency, this instinctual reaction of the human unit to self-perpetuation.The instinct of sex has its main root in the fear of separateness and ofisolation, and in a revolt against separative unity on the physical plane,against aloneness; and it has resulted in the carrying forward of the race and[627] the persistence and propagation of the forms through which the race cancome into manifestation.The herd instinct can easily be seen to have its root in a similar reaction; forthe sense of safety and for convinced assured security—based on numericalaggregations—men have always sought their own kind and herded themselvestogether for defense and for economic stability. Out of this instinctualreaction of the race as a whole, our modern civilisation is the result; its vastcentres, its huge cities and its massed tenements have emerged, and we havemodern herding, carried to the n th degree.The fourth great instinct, that of self-assertion , is also based on fear; itconnotes the fear of the individual that he will fail of recognition and thuslose much that would otherwise be his. As time has progressed, the selfishnessof the race has thus grown; its sense of acquisitiveness has developed and thepower to grasp has emerged (the “will to power” in some form or another) untiltoday we have the intense individualism and the positive sense of importancewhich have produced much of the modern economic and national troubles. We havefostered self-determination, self-assertion and self-interest until we arepresented with a well-nigh insuperable problem. But out of it all, much good hascome and will come, for no individual is of value until he realises that valuefor himself, and then with definiteness sacrifices the acquired values for thegood of the whole.The instinct to enquire in its turn is based on fear of the unknown, but out ofthis fear has emerged—as a result of age-long enquiry—our present educationaland cultural systems and the entire structure of scientific investigation.These tendencies, based on fear have (because man is divine) acted as atremendous stimulation of his entire nature, and have carried him forward to hispresent point [628] of wide comprehension and usefulness; they have produced ourmodern civilisation with all its defects and yet with all its indicateddivinity. Out of these instincts carried forward into infinity, and out of theprocess of their transmutation into their higher correspondences the full flowerof soul expression will emerge. I would like to point out the following:The instinct of self-presentation finds its consummation in assured immortality,and of this the work undertaken by the spiritualists and psychic investigatorsright down the ages is the mode of approach and the inevitable guarantee.The sex instinct has worked out and finds its logical consummation in therelationship—consciously realised—of the soul and the body. This is the keynoteof mysticism and religion, which is today, as ever, the expression of the Law ofAttraction, not as it expresses itself through physical plane marriage, but asit finds its consummation (for man) in the sublime marriage carried forward withconscious intent between the positive soul and the negative and receptive form.The herd instinct finds its divine consummation in an awakened groupconsciousness, which is evidenced today in the general tendency towardsamalgamations, and the widespread fusing and blending which are going oneverywhere. It demonstrates in the ability to think in terms ofinternationalism, of universal concepts, which will eventually result in theestablishing of universal brotherhood.The instinct of self-assertion, in its turn, has given to our moderncivilisation its intense individualism, the cult of the personality, and theproduction of ancestor and hero-worship. It is leading, however, to theassertion of the Self, of the divine inner Ruler, and out of our newest science,psychology, will emerge a knowledge of the assertive and dominant spiritualSelf, and lead [629] finally to the manifestation of the kingdom of souls onearth.And what of the instinct to enquire? Transmuted into divine investigation andtransformed by the application of the light of the soul in the realm of enquiry,we shall have humanity carried forward into the Hall of Wisdom and thus man willleave behind the experiences of the Hall of Knowledge. Our great educationalcentres will become schools for the development of intuitive perception and ofspiritual awareness.Instinct Correspondence Mode 1.

When,however, they are rightly understood and used, and transmuted by the knowingsoul, they produce awareness and are the source of growth and that which conveysto the dormant sou-—in time and space—the needed impulse, impetus and urge toprogress which have carried man forward from the caveman stage and theprehistoric cycle, through the long period of history, and can be trusted todayto carry him forward with increasing rapidity, as he now arrives at intellectualcomprehension and can apply himself to the problem of progress in fullawareness.Students need to realise more deeply that the whole process is a divine one, andthat evil, so-called, is but an illusion and an inherent part of duality, givingplace in [630] time and out of time to a divine unity. Evil is due to wrongperception and erroneous interpretation of that which is perceived. Theachievement of true vision, plus right understanding, brings about freedom fromthe instinctual reactions and evokes that inner detachment which enables a manto walk at liberty in the kingdom of God.But what of the two fears with which the aspirant has peculiar concern? What ofthe fear of public opinion, and fear of failure? These are two potent factors inthe life of service, and hinder many.Those who are beginning to work in cooperation with the plan and are learningthe significance of service are prone to fear that what they do will becriticised and misjudged, or fall a victim to the reverse idea that what they dowill not be sufficiently liked, appreciated and understood. They demand likingand praise. They gauge success by numbers and by response. They dislike to havetheir motives impugned and misjudged, and rush violently into explanation; theyare unhappy if their methods, the personnel of their group, and the way in whichtheir service is rendered comes under the tongue of criticism. The falseobjectives of numbers, of power or of a formulated doctrine control them. Unlesswhat they do measures up to the standards or conforms to the technique of thegroup of minds which surrounds them or appeals the most to them, they areunhappy and consequently frequently change their plans, alter their viewpoint,and lower their standard until it conforms to their immediate mass psychology,or their chosen counsellors.The true disciple sees the vision. He then seeks to keep so closely in touchwith his soul that he can stand with steadiness whilst he endeavours to makethat vision a reality; he aims to achieve what, from the standpoint of the worldseems to be impossible, knowing that the vision is not materialised throughexpediency and undue [631] adaptation of the suggested ideas of worldly orintellectual counsellors. Public opinion and the advice of those who are Pisceanin their tendencies and not Aquarian are carefully considered but not unduly so,and when advice is found to be separative and tends to eliminate harmony, andproduces a lack of brotherly love and understanding, it is discarded at once.When there is evidenced a constantly critical attitude towards other workers inthe field of world service and where there is a capacity to see only selfishnessand fault and to impute wrong motives and to believe evil, then the trueaspirant refuses to be swayed and goes serenely on his way.In the coming cycle I emphatically tell you that the true work will be carriedforward (the work of spiritually welding the world into a synthesis and theproduction of a recognised brotherhood of souls) only by those who refuse to beseparative and whose words are watched so that no evil is spoken; these are theworkers who see the divine in all and refuse to think evil and impute evil; theywork with sealed lips; they deal not with their brothers affairs, nor revealthat which concerns them; their lives are coloured by understanding and by love;their minds are characterised by a trained spiritual perception and thatspiritual awareness which employs a keen intellect as the corollary of a lovingspirit.May I repeat in other words this theme, for its importance is vital and theeffect of the work of these instruments on the world is immense. These men andwomen whose mission it is to inaugurate the New Age have learned the secret ofsilence; they are animated ceaselessly by a spirit of inclusive love; theirtongues lead them not astray into the field of ordinary criticism, and theypermit no condemnation of others; they are animated by the spirit of protection.To them will be committed the work of fostering the life of the New Age. [632]To those who have not yet reached this point in evolution and whose vision isnot so clear, nor their natures so disciplined, there remains the importantwork, on a lower level, of working with their kind. Their attributes andqualities bring to them those who resemble them; they do not work in suchloneliness and their work is more outwardly successful, though not always so.It must be remembered that all work, in the sight of the Great Ones, is of equalimportance. For those souls who are at the stage where a home or office providessufficient experience, that is for them the supreme effort; their attempt towork is—on its own level—as great an achievement as to fulfill the destiny of aChrist or a Napoleon. Forget this not and seek to see life truly and not withits distinctions—men-made and dangerous. A disciple who has not yet the fullervision of a more trained worker and who is only just learning the ABC of publicwork may, with all his failures and dense stupidities, be doing as well as anolder disciple with his wider knowledge and experience.THE NEW AGE GROUPS AND TRAININGTo those of us who are working on the inner side, the workers in the world fallinto three groups:1. Those, few and far between, who are true Aquarians. These work under realdifficulties, for their vision is beyond the grasp of the majority, and theymeet often lack of understanding, frequent disappointment in their fellowworkers, and much loneliness.2. Those who are straight Pisceans. These work with much greater facility andfind a more rapid response from those around them. Their work is more doctrinal,less inclusive and coloured by the spirit of separation. They include the massof [633] world workers in all the various departments of human thought andwelfare.3. Those Pisceans who are enough developed to respond to the Aquarian message,but who—as yet—cannot trust themselves to employ the real Aquarian methods ofwork and message.For instance, they have in the political field, a sense of internationalism, butthey cannot apply it when it comes to the understanding of others. They thinkthey have a universal consciousness, but when it comes to a test, theydiscriminate and eliminate. They constitute a much smaller group than the truePisceans and are doing good work and filling a much needed place. The problemthey present however to the Aquarian worker lies in the fact that though theyrespond to the ideal and regard themselves as of the new age, they are not trulyso. They see a bit of the vision and have grasped the theory but cannot expressit in action.Thus we have these three groups doing much needed work and reaching throughtheir united undertakings the mass of people and fulfilling thus their dharma.One group works necessarily under the glamour of public opinion. Theintermediate group has a most difficult task to perform, for where there is noclear vision the voice of their chosen environment and the voice of the innergroup of world Knowers are often in conflict and they are pulled hither andthither as they respond first to one and then to the other. The group of thosewho respond more fully to the incoming Aquarian vibration register the voices ofthe leaders of the other two groups, but the voice of the guiding Masters andthe voice of the group of world Masters serve to guide them unerringly forward.I have sought to explain the above modes and methods [634] of work, for thetimes are hard and clarity of thought is needed if the work is to go forward asdesired. Even such triple distinctions as exist between the groups arethemselves of a separative tincture, and it is yet impossible to preserve anyidea in its true and synthetic relation. It is a gain when the many thousands ofseparative groups can be grouped into three comprehensive ones and the mind ofthe disciple be thus freed from the detailed analysis of the world situationamong the workers with the Plan.The second great test of the sensitive disciple is fear of failure. This isbased on past experience (for all have failed), on a realisation of theimmediate need and opportunity, and on an acute appreciation of individuallimitation and deficiency. It is the result oft times of a response to thelowered spiritual and physical vitality of the race today. Never before hasthere been a time when fear of failure has more widely haunted the human family.Another cause of this reaction is to be found in the fact that mankind as awhole and for the first time in the history of the race, senses the vision andhas therefore a truer sense of relative values than ever before. Men knowthemselves to be divine, and this is becoming increasingly a universalrealisation. Hence the present unrest and revolt from tramelling conditions. Itis however a serious waste of time for a disciple to ponder upon a failure or tofear failing. There is no such thing as failure; there can only be loss of time.That in itself is serious in these days of dire world need, but the disciplemust inevitably some day make good and retrieve his past failures. I need notpoint out that we learn by failure, for that is a well known truth, and is knownas such by all who are attempting to live as souls. Nor need the disciple sorrowover the failures, apparent or real, of his fellow disciples. The sense of timeproduces glamour and disappointment, whereas the work goes truly [635] forward,and a lesson learnt by failure acts as a safeguard for the future. Thus it leadsto rapid growth. An honest disciple may be momentarily glamoured, but in thelong run nothing can really deter him. What are a few brief years in acomparative cycle of aeons? What is a second of time in a span of man’s allottedseventy years? To the individual disciple they appear most important; to theonlooking soul, they seem as nothing at all. For the world perhaps, a temporaryfailure may connote delay in expected help, but that again is brief, and helpwill come from other sources, for the Plan goes unerringly forward.May I in all earnest offer to you the paradoxical injunction to work with utterearnestness, and yet at the same time to refuse to work with such earnestness,and not to take yourself so earnestly? Those who stand on the inner side andstudy the work of the world aspirants today see an almost pitiful distress ofindividual deficiency, a sustained and strenuous effort on their part to “makethemselves what they ought to be”, and yet at the same time a distressing lackof proportion, and no sense of humour whatsoever. I urge upon you to cultivateboth these qualities. Do not take yourself so seriously, and you will find thatyou will release yourself for freer and more potent work. Take the Planseriously and the call to serve, but waste not time in constant self-analysis.Therefore the immediate goal for all aspiring disciples at this time can be seento be as follows:1. An achievement of clarity of thought as to their own personal and immediateproblems and primarily the problem as to their objective in service. This is tobe done through meditation.2. The development of sensitivity to the new impulses which are flooding theworld at this time. This is [636] to be brought about by loving all men more andthrough love and understanding contacting them with greater facility. Lovereveals.3. The rendering of service with complete impersonality. This is done byeliminating personal ambition and love of power.4. The refusal to pay attention to public opinion or to failure. This is done bythe application of strict attention to the voice of the soul, and by anendeavour to dwell ever in the secret place of the Most High.We have merged our first point as to the immediate goal and the steps to betaken to reach it with our second point as to conduct and the factors which mustbe eliminated. It only remains therefore to point out the penalties which willovertake the probationary disciple and the trained worker should he give way tothe glamour and to the faults inherent in his nature and permit them to hinderhis work and come between him and the visioned goal.It might be pointed out that there are three main points of danger in the lifeof service. I am not here dealing with the individual training of the disciplebut with his life of service, and with the activities in which he is engaged asa worker. His temperament, equipment of characteristics (physical, emotional,and mental) do have a potent effect on his environment and on the people heseeks to help, and also his family background, his world training and hisspeech.The first point of danger is his physical condition. On this I cannot enlargebeyond begging all disciples to act with wisdom to give themselves sufficientsleep, right food (which must vary for each individual), and those surroundings,if possible, which will enable them to work with the greatest facility. Thepenalty for the infringing [637] of these suggestions works out in lack of powerin service and in the growing thralldom of the physical body. Where the physicalbody is in poor condition, the disciple has to add the liabilities incident uponthe bringing in of force which he finds himself unable to handle.The second point of danger is to be found in the astral illusion in which allhumanity lives, and its power to glamour even experienced workers. I haveconsidered this at length in this treatise, which is, as you know, a treatise onthe control of the astral body and a right understanding of its laws. Onlymental control, plus true spiritual perception, will suffice to pierce thisillusory astral miasma, and reveal to the man that he is a spiritual entity inincarnation and in touch—through his mind—with the Universal Mind. The penaltywhich overtakes the disciple who persistently permits himself to be glamoured isobvious. His vision becomes fogged and misty and he “loses the sense of touch”as it is called in the old commentaries. He wanders “down the lanes of life andmisses that straight highway which will lead him to his goal.”The third danger (and one that is very prevalent at this time) is that of mentalpride and consequent inability to work in group formation. The penalty for thisis often a temporary success and an enforced working with a group, which hasbeen devitalised of its best elements and which has in it only those people whofeed the personality of the head of the group. Because of the emphasis upon hisown ideas and his own methods of working, a disciple finds that his group lacksthose factors and those people who would have rounded it out, who would havebalanced his endeavour, and given to his undertaking those qualities which hehimself lacks. This is, in itself, a sufficient punishment, and quickly bringsthe honest disciple to his senses. Let a disciple who is [638] intelligent,honest and basically true so err, and in time he will awaken to the fact thatthe group he has gathered around him are moulded by him or he is moulded bythem; they are oft embodiments of himself and repeat him. The law works rapidlyin the case of a disciple, and thus adjustments are speedily made.I would like to point out to the student that, having with steadfastness goneforward he will discover that the exoteric and esoteric linking of the outerschools and inner school or rank of knowers of truth is so close that not oneearnest student goes totally unrecognised. In the press of the work and in theburden and toil of the day’s labours it is an encouragement to know that thereare those who watch, and that every loving deed, every aspiring thought andevery unselfish reaction is noted and known. Bear in mind, however, that itcomes to the recognition of the Helpers through the increased vibration of theaspirant and not through a specific knowledge of the deed accomplished or thethought sent out. Those who teach are occupied with principles of truth, withvibratory rates and with the quality of the light to be seen. They are not awareof, nor have they the time to consider, specific deeds, words and conditions,and the sooner students grasp this and put out of their minds any hope ofcontacting a phenomenal individual whom they call a Master, with so muchleisure, of such developed powers that he can occupy himself with their trivialaffairs in time and space, the more rapidly will they progress.Where, however, there is steady growth, an application to occult principles sothat definite changes are produced in the bodies used, and an increasingradiatory light, it is known and recorded, and the aspirant is rewarded byincreased opportunity to serve his fellowmen. They do not reward bycommendation, by patting on the [639] head, or by expressing their pleasure inwords. They are occupied in making knowers and masters out of everyday men andwomen by:1. Teaching them to know themselves.2. Setting them free from authority by awakening interest and enquiry in theirminds, and then indicating (not more than that) the direction in which theanswer should be sought.3. Giving them those conditions which will force them to stand on their own feetand rely on their own souls and not on any human being, be he a beloved friend,teacher, or a Master of the Wisdom.I seek not to repeat myself. Most of the points that concern the work of theaspirant today I have considered earlier in this treatise. It remains now forall of you to study it with care. I close with an appeal to all who read theseinstructions to rally their forces, to renew their vows of dedication to theservice of humanity, to subordinate their own ideas and wishes to the groupgood, to take their eyes off themselves and fix them anew upon the vision, toguard their tongues from idle speech and criticism, from gossip and inuendo, andto read and study so that the work may go intelligently forward. Let allstudents make up their minds in this day of emergency and of rapid unfoldingopportunity to sacrifice all they have to the helping of humanity. Now is theneed and the demand. The urgency of the hour is upon us, and I call upon all ofyou whom I am seeking to help, to join the strenuous effort of the Great Ones.They are working day and night in an effort to relieve humanity and to offsetthose evils and disasters which are immanent in the present situation. I offerto you opportunity and I tell you that you are needed—even the very least ofyou. I assure you that groups of students, working in [640] unison and with deepand unfaltering love for each other, can achieve significant results.That each of you may so work, and that each of you may lose sight of self in therealisation of world need, is the earnest prayer and deepest aspiration of yourbrother, THE TIBETAN."},{"pageContent":"ARCANE SCHOOL TRAININGTraining for new age discipleship is providedby the Arcane School.
