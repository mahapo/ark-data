Where we find a populartrend in any particular direction, which is one-pointed and steady, it may besafe to assume that out of it will emerge that which the race needs in itsonward march. That meditation is regarded, by those who define loosely, as a“mode of prayer” is, unfortunately, true. But it can be demonstrated that in theright understanding of the meditation process and in its right adaptation to theneeds of our modern civilization will be found the solution of the presenteducational impasse and the method whereby the fact of the soul may beascertained — that living something which we call the “Soul” for lack of abetter term.The purpose of this book is to deal with the nature and true significance ofmeditation, and with its use on a large scale in the West. It is suggested thatit may eventually supplant the present methods of memory training, and prove apotent factor in modern educational procedure. It is a subject that hasengrossed the attention of thinkers in the East [4] and in the West forthousands of years, and this uniformity of interest is in itself of importance.The next developments which will carry the race forward along the path of itsunfolding consciousness must surely lie in the direction of synthesis. Thegrowth of human knowledge must be brought about by the fusion of the Eastern andthe Western techniques of mental training. This has already proceeded apace andthinkers in both hemispheres are realizing that this fusion is leading towardssome most significant realization. Edward Carpenter says that:“We seem to be arriving at a time when, with the circling of our knowledge ofthe globe, a great synthesis of all human thought...is quite naturally andinevitably taking place.... Out of this meeting of elements is already arisingthe dim outline of a philosophy which must surely dominate human thought for along period.”Carpenter, Edward, “The Art of Creation”, p. 7.Herein lies the glory and hope of the race and the outstanding triumph ofscience. We are now one people. The heritage of any race lies open to another;the best thought of the centuries is available for all; and ancient techniquesand modern methods must meet and interchange. Each will have to modify its modeof presentation and each will have to make an effort to understand theunderlying spirit which has produced a peculiar phraseology and imagery, butwhen these concessions are made, a structure of truth will be found to emergewhich will embody the spirit of the New Age. Modern thinkers are realizing thisand Dr. Overstreet points out that: [5]“Eastern philosophy, one suspects, has had small effect upon western thoughtchiefly because of its manner. But there is every reason to believe that as theinfluence of western thinking — particularly its experimental hard-headedness —is felt in the East, a new philosophic manner will be adopted, and the profoundspirituality of eastern thought will be expressed in ways more acceptable to thewestern mind.”Overstreet, H. A., “The Enduring Quest”, p. 271.Both schools have hitherto tended to antagonize each other, yet the quest fortruth has been one; the interest in that which is, and that which can be, is notconfined to either group; and the factors with which each has had to work havebeen the same. Though the mind of the eastern thinker may run to creativeimagery and that of the western worker to creative scientific achievement, yetthe world into which they enter is curiously the same; the instrument of thoughtwhich they employ is called the “mind” in the West and “mind-stuff” (chitta) inthe East; both use the language of symbology to express their conclusions andboth reach the point where words prove futile to embody the intuitedpossibilities.Dr. Jung, one of the people who is seeking to bring these hitherto discordantelements together, touches on this in the following extract from his Commentaryon an ancient Chinese writing. He says“Western consciousness is by no means consciousness in general, but rather ahistorically conditioned, and geographically limited, factor, representative ofonly one part of humanity. The widening of our own consciousness ought [6] notto proceed at the expense of other kinds of consciousness, but ought to takeplace through the development of those elements of our psyche which areanalogous to those of a foreign psyche, just as the East cannot do without ourtechnique, science and industry. The European invasion of the East was a deed ofviolence on a great scale, and it has left us the duty — noblesse oblige — ofunderstanding the mind of the East. This is perhaps more necessary than werealize at present.”Wilhelm, Richard, and Jung, Dr. C. G., “The Secret of the Golden Flower”, p.136.Dr. Hocking of Harvard also brings us the same idea when he says:“There seems reason to hope for a better physical future of the race by the aidof a sound mental hygiene. After the era of the charlatans has gone by, and tosome extent by their aid, there appears a possibility of steadily enlargingself-mastery, as the spiritual sense of such discipline as the Yoga joins withthe sober elements of Western psychology and a sane system of ethics. No one ofthese is worth much without the others.”Hocking, Wm. E., Self, “Its Body and Freedom”, p. 75.Those who have studied in both schools tell us that the mystical imagery of theEast (and also of our Western mystical exponents) is only a veil behind whichthose gifted with intuitive perception have always been able to penetrate. Thescience of the West, with its emphasis upon the nature of the form, has also ledus into the realm of the intuition and it would seem as if the two ways couldblend and that it should be possible for each — discarding the non-essentials —to arrive at a basis of understanding. [7] Thus they work out a new approach tothe central mystery of man founded on old and demonstrated truths. Dr. Jungagain takes this up as follows:“Science is the best tool of the Western mind and with it more doors can beopened than with bare hands. Thus it is part and parcel of our understanding andonly clouds our insight when it lays claim to being the one and only way ofcomprehending. But it is the East that has taught us another, wider, moreprofound, and a higher understanding, that is, understanding through life. Weknow this way only vaguely, as a mere shadowy sentiment culled from religiousterminology, and therefore we gladly dispose of Eastern ‘wisdom’ in quotationmarks, and push it away into the obscure territory of faith and superstition.But in this way Eastern ‘realism’ is completely misunderstood. It does notconsist of sentimental, exaggeratedly mystical, intuitions bordering on thepathological and emanating from ascetic recluses and cranks; the wisdom of theEast is based on practical knowledge...which we have not the slightestjustification for undervaluing.”Wilhelm, Richard, and Jung, Dr. C. G., “The Secret of the Golden Flower”, p. 78.It is in the training of the mind that the crux of the situation lies. The humanmind is apparently an instrument which we are able to use in two directions. Onedirection is outward. The mind, in this mode of functioning, registers ourcontacts with the physical and mental worlds in which we live, and recognizesemotional and sensory conditions. It is the recorder and correlator of oursensations, of our reactions, and of all that is conveyed to it via the fivesenses and the brain. This is a field of knowledge [8] that has been extensivelystudied, and much headway has been made by psychologists in understanding theprocesses of mentation. “Thinking,” Dr. Jung tells us, “is one of the four basicpsychological functions. It is that psychological function which, in accordancewith its own laws, brings given presentations into conceptual connection. It isan apperceptive activity — both active and passive. Active thinking is an act ofthe will; passive thinking is an occurrence.” (Dibblee, George Binney, “Instinctand Intuition”, p. 85.)As we shall see later, it is the thought apparatus which is involved inMeditation and which must be trained to add to this first function of the mindan ability to turn in another direction, and to register with equal facility theinner or intangible world. This ability to re-orient itself will enable the mindto register the world of subjective realities, of intuitive perception and ofabstract ideas. This is the high heritage of the mystic, but seems as yet not tobe within the grasp of the average man.The problem facing the human family today in the realms both of science and ofreligion results from the fact that the follower of both schools finds he isstanding at the portal of a metaphysical world. A cycle of development has cometo an end. Man, as a thinking, feeling entity, seems now to have arrived at afair measure of understanding the instrument with which he has to work. He isasking himself: What use is he to make of it? Where is the mind, [9] which he isslowly learning to master, going to lead him?What does the future hold for man? Something, we feel, of greater beauty andcertainty than anything we have hitherto known. Perhaps it will be a universalarrival at that knowledge which the individual mystic has had. Our ears aredeafened by the din of our modern civilization and yet at times we catch thoseovertones which testify to a world which is immaterial. Our eyes are blinded bythe fog and the smoke of our immediate foreground, yet there do come flashes ofclear vision which reveal a subtler state of being, and which lift the fog,letting in “the glory which never was on sea or land.” Dr. Bennett of Yaleexpresses these ideas in very beautiful terms. He says:“A film falls from the eyes and the world appears in a new light. Things are nolonger ordinary. There comes the certainty that this is the real world whosetrue character human blindness has until now concealed.Not where the wheeling systems darkenAnd our benumbed conceiving soars; —The drift of pinions, would we harken,Beats at our own clay-shuttered doors.The angels keep their ancient places;Turn but a stone and start a wing!‘Tis ye, ‘tis your estrangèd facesThat miss the many-splendoured thing.“The experience is at first tantalizing, alluring. There is a rumor of a newworld and the spirit is eager for the voyage upon strange seas. The familiarworld must be left behind. The great adventure of religion begins.... [10]“There must somewhere be a point of certainty. A growing universe may providefor open futures, but whoso declares that the universe is growing states anunalterable fact about its structure, which fact is the eternal guarantee of thepossibility and validity of experiment....“Man is a bridge. Even the superman, once we perceive that he is only the symbolof the strenuous ideal, turns out to be a bridge too. Our only assurance is thatthe gates of the future are always open.”Bennett, Charles A., “A Philosophical Study of Mysticism”, pp. 23, 117, 130.Perhaps the problem consists in this: that the gates of the future seem to openupon an immaterial world, and upon a realm that is intangible, metaphysical,supersensuous. We have well-nigh exhausted the resources of the material world,but we have not yet learned to function in a non-material one. We even deny itsexistence at times. We face the inevitable experience, which we call death, andyet take no rational steps to ascertain whether there really is a life beyond.The progress of evolution has produced a wonderful race, equipped with asensitive response apparatus and a reasoning mind. We possess the rudiments of asense which we call the intuition and, with this equipment, we stand before thegates of the future and ask the question: “To what purpose shall we put thiscomposite, complex mechanism which we call a human being?” Have we reached ourfull development? Are there shades of meaning to life which have hithertoescaped our attention, and have they escaped our attention because we havelatent powers and capacities as yet [11] unrealized? Is it possible that we areblind to a vast world of life and of beauty, with its own appropriate laws andphenomena? Mystics, seers and thinkers of all ages and in both hemispheres havesaid such a world exists.With this equipment, which we might call the personality, man stands with thepast behind him, in a present that is full of chaos, and before a future intowhich he cannot look. He cannot stand still. He must go forward, and the vasteducational, scientific, philosophic and religious organizations are all doingtheir utmost to tell him which way to go and to present to him a solution of hisproblem.That which is static and crystallized eventually falls to pieces and, wherethere is arrested growth, abnormalities will occur and retrogression be found.Someone has said that the danger which we must avoid is that of a“disintegrating personality.” If humanity is not potential, if man has reachedhis zenith and can go no further, then he should recognize this fact and makehis decline and fall as easy and as beautiful as possible. It is encouraging tonote how in 1850 the dim outlines of that portal into the New Age were vaguelyseen and how much concern thinkers then evinced that man should not fail tolearn his lesson and go forward. Read the words of Carlyle and note howappropriate they are to the present time.“In the days that are passing over us, even fools are arrested to ask themeaning of them; few of the generations of men have seen more impressive days.Days of endless [12] calamity, disruption, dislocation, confusion worseconfounded....It is not a small hope that will suffice us, the ruin beingclearly...universal. There must be a new world if there is to be a world at all.That human beings in Europe can ever return to the old sorry routine, andproceed with any steadiness or continuance therein, — this small hope is not nowa tenable one. These days of universal death must be days of universal rebirth,if the ruin is not to be total and final. It is a time to make the dullest manconsider whence he came and whither he is bound.”Jacks, L. P., “Religious Perplexities”, p. 46.Looking back over the seventy or more years that have elapsed since Carlylewrote these words, we know that mankind did not fail to go forward. Theelectrical age was inaugurated and the wonders of the scientific achievements ofour time are known by us all. With optimism, therefore, in a time of freshcrisis, we can go forward with true courage, for the portals into the New Ageare far more clearly seen. Perhaps it is true also that man is only nowattaining his majority and is about to enter upon his inheritance and todiscover within himself powers and capacities, faculties and tendencies whichare the guarantee of a vital and useful manhood, and of eternal existence. Weare completing the stage wherein the emphasis has been laid upon the mechanism,upon the sum-total of cells, which constitute the body and the brain, with theirautomatic reaction to pleasure, to pain and to thought. We know much about Man,the machine. The mechanistic school of psychologists have placed us deeply intheir debt [13] with their discoveries about the apparatus whereby a human beingcomes into contact with his environment. But there are men among us, men who arenot mere machines. We have the right to measure our ultimate capacities and ourpotential greatness by the achievements of the best among us; these great onesare not “freak” products of divine caprice or of blind evolutionary urge, butare themselves the guarantee of the ultimate achievement of the whole.Irving Babbitt remarks, that there is a something in man’s nature “that sets himapart simply as man, from other animals, and that something Cicero defines as a‘sense of order and decorum and measure in deeds and words’.” Babbitt adds (andthis is the point to note) that “the world would have been a better place ifmore persons had made sure they were human before setting out to be superhuman.”(Babbitt, Irving, “Humanism: An Essay at Definition” .) There is, perhaps, anintermediate stage wherein we function as men, sustain our human relations, anddischarge our just obligations, thus fulfilling our temporary destiny. Thequestion arises here as to whether such a stage is even yet generally possiblewhen we remember that there are millions of illiterate persons on our planet atthis time!But, along with this tendency toward pure humanity and the drift away from thestandardization of the human unit, there emerges a group to whom we give thename of mystics. They testify to another world of experience and contacts. Theybear witness [14] to a personal realization and to a phenomenal manifestationand satisfaction of which the average man knows nothing. As Dr. Bennett says“the mystics themselves have described their attainment as a seeing into themeaning of the universe, a seeing of how all things belong together. They havefound the clue.” (Bennett, Charles A., “A Philosophical Study of Mysticism”, p.81. ) Down the ages they have come forth and said in unison: there is anotherkingdom in nature. This kingdom has its own laws, its own phenomena and its ownintimate relationships. It is the kingdom of the spirit. We have found it andyou too can ascertain its nature. These witnesses fall into two groups; thepurely mystical and emotional quester who sees the vision and falls down in anilluminated rapture before the beauty that he has sensed, and secondly, theknowers, who have added to the emotional rapture an intellectual achievement (anorientation of the mind) which enables them to do more than sense and enjoy.They understand; they know, and have become identified with that new world ofbeing towards which the pure mystic reaches. The line of demarcation betweenthese knowers of divine things and those who sense the vision is very slight.There is, however, a no-man’s ground between the two groups on which a greattransition takes place. There is an interlude in experience and in developmentwhich changes the visionary mystic into the practical knower. There is a processand a technique to which the mystic can subject himself which coordinates himand develops in him a new and subtle [15] apparatus, by means of which he nolonger sees the vision of divine reality but knows himself to be that realityitself. It is with this transitional process and with this work of educating themystic, that the meditation technique has to do. It is this with which we dealin this book.The problem of leading man into his heritage as a human being is the function ofthe educators and of the psychologists. They must lead him up to the door of themystical world. Paradoxical as it may sound, the work of leading him into hisspiritual heritage is the work of religion and of science. Dr. Pupin tells usthat “science and religion supplement each other, they are the two pillars ofthe portal through which the human soul enters into the world where divinityresides.” (Pupin, Michael, “The New Reformation”, p. 217.)Let us give the word “spiritual” a wide connotation! I do not here speak ofreligious truths; the formulations of the theologians and the churchmen in allthe big religious organizations, both Eastern and Western, may, or may not, betrue. Let us use the word “spiritual” to signify the world of light and beauty,of order and of purpose, about which the world Scriptures speak, which is theobject of the attentive research of the scientists, and into which the pioneersof the human family have always penetrated, returning to tell us of theirexperiences. Let us regard all manifestations of life as spiritual, and so widenthe usual meaning of this word to signify [16] the energies and potencies whichlie back of every form in nature and which give to each of them their essentialdistinguishing characteristics and qualities. For thousands of years all overthe planet, the mystics and knowers have borne witness to experiences in subtlerworlds where they have been brought into contact with forces and phenomena whichare not of this physical world. They speak of meeting with angelic hosts; theyrefer to the great cloud of witnesses; they commune with the elder brothers ofthe race who work in other dimensions and who demonstrate powers about whichordinary human beings know nothing; they speak of a light and of a glory; of adirect knowledge of truth and of a world of phenomena which is uniform to themystics of all races. That much of the testimony can be discarded on the groundsof hallucination may be true; that many of the saints of old were psychopathiccases and neurotics may be equally true; but there still remains a residue oftestimony and a sufficient number of reputable witnesses, substantiating thistestimony, to force our belief in its verity. These witnesses to the unseenworld spoke with words of power and gave forth messages which have moulded thethoughts of men, and directed the lives of millions. They claimed there was ascience of spiritual knowledge and a technique of development whereby men couldattain to the mystical experience and whereby they could know God.It is this science which we will study in this book, [17] and this techniquewhich we will seek to unfold. It deals with the right use of the mind, wherebythe world of souls reveals itself and that secret door is found and opened whichleads from darkness to light, from death to immortality and from the unreal tothe Real.The ultimate solution of our world problem lies in our arrival at this knowledge— a knowledge that is neither eastern nor western, but which is known to both.When we have joined hands with the Orient and when we have united the bestthoughts of the East with those of the West, we shall have a synthetic andbalanced teaching which will liberate the coming generations. It must begin inthe educational field and with the young.In the West, consciousness has been focused upon the material aspects of living,and all of our mental power has been concentrated upon the control andutilization of material things, the perfecting of physical comforts, and theaccumulation of possessions. In the East, where the spiritual realities havebeen more uniformly held, mental power has been used in concentration andmeditation and in deep philosophical and metaphysical study, but the masses ofthe people, not capable of these activities, have been left in peculiar andstrikingly terrible conditions, from the standpoint of physical living. Throughthe blending of the achievements of the two civilizations (now going on withincreasing rapidity) a balance is being struck by means of which the race [18]as a whole will be able to demonstrate its full potency. Both the East and theWest are gradually learning to take from each other to mutual advantage, andwork in this field is one of the fundamental and necessary things of the presentcycle."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO - THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION“...education is undergoing important transformations. From a relativelyexternal process of pouring in facts, it is increasingly becoming a process ofevoking the deeper, generative possibilities that lie within the individual.”H. A. Overstreet[21] One of the many factors which have brought humanity to its present point ofdevelopment has been the growth and perfecting of its educational methods andsystems. At first this was in the hands of the organized religions, but now itis practically divorced from the control of the religious bodies, and lies inthe hands of the state. In the past, education was largely colored by theologyand its methods were dictated by the churchmen and the priests. Now the vastbody of teachers are trained by the state; any religious bias is ignored onaccount of the many differentiated religious bodies, and the trend of theteaching is almost entirely materialistic and scientific. In the past, both inthe East and in the West, we have had the education of the more highly evolvedmembers of the human family. Today we have mass education. In approaching anyunderstanding of the future and (we believe) higher education, these two factsmust be borne in mind for it will be in a synthesis of these two methods —individual and mass education — religious and scientific — that the way out willbe found.Like everything else in this transitional period, our educational systems are ina state of flux and [22] of change. A general feeling that much has been done toraise the level of the human mind is everywhere to be found, coupled with a deepundercurrent of dissatisfaction with the results. We are questioning whether oureducational systems are achieving the widest good. We appreciate the enormousadvance that has been made during the past two hundred years, and yet we wonderwhether we are, after all, getting as much out of life as should be possible topeople with an adequate system of training. We are smugly satisfied with ourgrowth in knowledge, our accumulation of information, and our control of theforces of nature, and yet we hold collegiate debates as to whether we have anytrue culture. We teach our children to memorize an enormous array of facts, andto assimilate a vast amount of widely diversified detail, and yet we questionsometimes whether we are teaching them to live more satisfactorily. We usebillions of dollars to build and endow universities and colleges and yet ourmost far-sighted educators are gravely concerned as to whether this organizededucation is really meeting the needs of the average citizen. It certainly seemsto fail in its mission with the unusual child and with the gifted man or woman.Our mode of training our youth is standing decidedly before the bar of judgment.Only the future can settle whether some way out will not have to be foundwhereby the culture of the individual can proceed alongside the civilizing,through education, of the masses.In an age of scientific achievement and of a synthesis [23] of thought in everydepartment of human knowledge, one of our educators, Dr. Rufus M. Jones says:“But, alas, none of these achievements makes us better men. There is no equationbetween bank accounts and goodness of heart. Knowledge is by no means the samething as wisdom or nobility of spirit....The world has never seen before such animmense army of educators at work on the youth of the country, nor has thereever been before in the history of the world, such a generous outlay of moneyfor education both lower and higher. The total effect, however, isdisappointing, and misses the central point. Our institutions of learningproduce some good scholars and give a body of scientific facts to a greatnumber. But there is a pitiable failure in the main business of education whichis, or should be, the formation of character, the culture of the spirit, thebuilding of the soul.”Jones, Rufus M., “The Need for a Spiritual Element in Education”. World UnityMagazine, October, 1928.Old Mother Asia and Europe, up to the eighteenth century, trained and culturedthe individual. An intensified training was given to the so-called upperclasses, and to the man who showed a marked aptitude for spiritual culture.Under the Brahmanical system in the East, and in the monasteries in the West, aspecialized culture was imparted to those who could profit by it, and rareindividuals were produced, who, to this day, set their mark upon human thought.For this our modern Occidental world has substituted mass education. For thefirst time, men in their thousands are being taught to use their minds; they arebeginning to assert their own individualities, [24] and to formulate their ownideas. The freedom of human thought, liberation from the control of theologies(religious or scientific) are the war cries of the present, and much has therebybeen gained. The masses are beginning to do their own thinking. But it islargely mass thinking, and haphazard public opinion now moulds thought just asmuch as theologies formerly did. The pioneering individual has still as muchdifficulty in making himself felt in the present world of thought and ofendeavor, as of old.Perhaps in the turning of the great wheel of life, we are due again to revert tothe ancient method of specialized training for the special individual-—areversion which will not involve a discarding of mass education. In this way, wemay ultimately unify the methods of the past and of the East with those of thepresent and of the West.Before considering these two methods let us attempt to define education, toexpress to ourselves its goal and so clarify our ideas as to the objectivesahead of all our endeavor.This is no easy thing to do. Viewed from its most uninteresting aspect,education can briefly be defined as the imparting of knowledge to a student, andusually to an unwilling student, who receives a mass of information that doesnot interest him in the least. A note of dryness and of aridity is struck; wefeel that this presentation deals primarily with memory training, with theimpartation of so-called facts, and with giving the student a little information[25] on a vast number of unrelated subjects. The literal meaning of the word,however, is “to lead out of,” or “to draw out,” and this is most instructive.The thought latent in this idea is that we should draw out the inherentinstincts and potentialities of the child in order to lead him out of one stateof consciousness into another and wider one. In this way we lead children, forinstance, who are simply conscious of being alive, into a state ofself-consciousness; they become aware of themselves and of their grouprelationships; they are taught to develop powers and capacities, especiallythrough vocational training, in order that they may be economically independent,and thus self-supporting members of society. We exploit their instinct ofself-preservation in order to lead them on along the path of knowledge. Could itbe said that we begin with the utilization of their instinctive apparatus tolead them on to the way of the intellect? Perhaps this may be true, but Iquestion whether, having brought them thus far we carry on the good work andteach them the real meaning of intellection as a training whereby the intuitionis released. We teach them to utilize their instincts and intellect as part ofthe apparatus of self-preservation in the external world of human affairs, butthe use of pure reason and the eventual control of the mind by the intuition inthe work of self-preservation and of continuity of consciousness in thesubjective and real worlds, is as yet but the privileged knowledge of a fewpioneers.[26] If Professor H. Wildon Carr is right, in his definition of the intuition,then our educational methods do not tend to its development. He defines it as“the apprehension by the mind of reality directly as it is, and not under theform of a perception or a conception, nor as an idea or object of the reason,all of which by contrast are intellectual apprehension.” (Carr, H. Wildon,“Philosophy of Change”, p. 21.)We rate the science of the mind or the modifications of the thinking principle(as the Hindu calls it) as strictly human, relegating man’s instinctualreactions to qualities he shares in common with the animals. May it not bepossible that the science of the intuition, the art of clear synthetic vision,may some day stand to the intellect as it, in its turn, stands to theinstinctual faculty.Dr. Dibblee of Oxford makes the following interesting comments upon instinct andintuition, which have their place here on account of our plea in this book forthe recognition of an educational technique which would lead to the developmentof a faculty of a higher awareness. He says:“...both instinct and intuition begin within the extra-conscious parts ofourselves, to speak in a local figure, and emerge equally unexpectedly into thelight of every day consciousness....The impulses of instinct and the promptingsof intuition are engendered in total secrecy. When they do appear, they arenecessarily almost complete, and their advent into our consciousness is sudden.”Dibblee, George Binney, “Instinct and Intuition”, p. 128.[27] And he adds in another place that intuition lies on the other side ofreason to instinct. We have, therefore, this interesting triplicity — instinct,intellect and intuition — with instinct lying below the threshold ofconsciousness, so to speak, with the intellect holding the first place in therecognition of man, as human, and with the intuition lying beyond both of them,and only occasionally making its presence felt in the sudden illuminations andapprehensions of truth which are the gift of our greatest thinkers.Surely there must be something more to the educational process than just fittinga man to cope with external facts and with his arbitrary environment? Humanitymust be led out and into a deeper and wider future and realization. It must beequipped to meet and handle whatever may come, so as to get the highest and thebest results. Men’s powers should be drawn out to their fullest constructiveexpression. There must be no standardized limit of achievement, the attainmentof which will leave them complacent, self-satisfied and, therefore, static. Theymust always be led from lower to higher states of realization, and the facultyof awareness must be steadily expanded. Expansion and growth is the law of lifeand while the mass of men must be lifted by a system of education, fitted tobring the greatest good to the greatest number, the individual must be given hisfull heritage, and special culture provided which will foster and strengthen thefinest and the best amongst us, for in their achievement lies the [28] promiseof the New Age. The inferior and the backward must also have special training inorder that they may come up to the high standard which the educators set. But itis of even greater importance that no man, with a special aptitude andequipment, should be held down to the dead level of the mass standard of theeducated class.It is right here that the difficulty of defining education becomes apparent, andthe questions arise as to the real goal and the true objectives. Dr. Randallrealizes this in an article he wrote, in which he says:“I would like to recommend the defining of education as a possible exercise forprivate meditation. Let each one ask himself what he means by ‘education’; andif he ponders the question deeply he will discover that in order to answer it hewill have to probe down to the innermost meaning of life itself. Thinkingearnestly about the meaning of education compels us to face the fundamentalquestions of life as we never have before....Is the goal of education knowledge?Assuredly yes, but knowledge for what? Is its goal power? Again yes, but powerto what end? Is its goal social adjustment? The modern age replies emphatically,yes, but what kind of adjustment shall it be, and determined by what ideals?That education aims not at mere knowledge or mere power of any kind, but atknowledge and power put to right uses is clearly recognized by the mostprogressive educational thought, though not by the popular opinion of theday....“The new education has for its great end, therefore, the training anddevelopment of the individual for social ends, that is, for the largest serviceto man....“We commonly classify education under three heads — primary, secondary andhigher. To these three I should like [29] to add a fourth, highest. The highesteducation is religion but it is also education.”Randall, John Herman, “Education and Religion”, World Unity Magazine, October,1928.It is interesting to note that the same ideas are expressed by Bhagavan Das atthe First All-Asia Educational Conference. He says:“The rules of Religion, i.e., of the larger Science, enable us...to dischargeall these wider debts and duties. Religion has been described as the command orrevelation of God. This only means, in other words, the laws of God’s Nature, asrevealed to us by the labours, intellectual, intuitional, inspirational, of theseers and scientists of all religions and all nations....We have heard of thethree R’s long enough. This fourth R, of genuine Religion, is more importantthan them all....But it has to be carefully discovered and thought out first. Itbehooves all sincere educators to help in this work by applying the scientificmethod of ascertaining agreements amidst differences.”Das, Bhagavan, “The Unity of Asiatic Thought, i.e., Of All Religions”, p. 12.Both East and West seem to feel that an educational system that does noteventually lead a man out of the world of human affairs into the widerconsciousness of spiritual things has failed in its mission and will not measureup to the soaring demand of the human soul. A training that stops short with theintellect, and ignores the faculty to intuit truth which the best mindsevidence, lacks much. If it leaves its students with closed and static minds, ithas left them without the equipment to touch that intangible and finest“four-fifths of life” which Dr. Wiggam tells us, lies outside the realm ofscientific [30] training altogether. (Wiggam, Albert Edward, “The New Decalogueof Science”.) The door must be opened for those who can go beyond the academictraining of the mind with relation to physical plane living.The success of the future of the race is bound up with the success of thoseindividuals who have the capacity to achieve greater, because more spiritual,things. These units of the human family must be discovered and encouraged to goon and to penetrate into the realm of the intangible. They must be cultured andtrained and given an education which will be adapted to the highest and the bestthat is in them. Such an education requires a proper perception of individualgrowth and status, and a right understanding of what the next step in any givencase should be. It requires insight, sympathy and understanding on the part ofthe teacher.There is an increasing realization among educators of this need to lift the moreadvanced educational processes and so raise those subjected to their influenceout of the realm of the purely analytical critical mind into that of pure reasonand intuitive perception. Bertrand Russell points out that “Education should notaim at a passive awareness of dead facts but at an activity directed towards theworld that our efforts are to create.” But we must remember that creation positsan alive and functioning creator, acting with intention and utilizing thecreative imagination. Could it be said that this is the effect of our moderneducational systems? Is not the mind standardized and held down by our masssystem [31] and by the method of cramming the memory with ill digested facts? IfHerbart is right when he says that the “chief business of education is theethical revelation of the universe” then perhaps Dr. Moran is also right when hepoints out that “one of the underlying causes, perhaps the greatest, of ourmaterialistic age is the lack of the spiritual element in our formal education.”Some of us feel also that there exists an even wider goal than an ethicalrevelation; and that it is possible that humanity is the custodian of anillumination and a glory which will only be realized in its fulness when themasses achieve some of the magnificence which has characterized the WorldFigures of the past. Is it not in line with evolutionary development that thereal goal of education is to lead humanity out of the fourth or human kingdominto that spiritual realm where the pioneers whom we call Mystics, and thestandard-setting Figures of the race live and move and have their being? Thusmankind will be raised out of the objective material world into the realm ofspirit, where the truer values are to be found, and wherein that larger Self iscontacted which the individual selves exist only to reveal. Keyserling hints atthis in the following words:“We are aware of the limits of human reason; we understand the significance ofour striving; we are the masters of nature. We can simultaneously overlook theinner and the outer world. Since we can scientifically determine what are ourreal intentions, we need no more become the prey [32] of self-deceptions....Fromnow on, this possibility must become the conscious motive of life. Hitherto ithas not yet played that part. Yet this precisely is all-important for the centreof consciousness determines the starting-point of man. Wherever he shifts theemphasis within himself, there it actually rests; the whole Being of man isreorganized accordingly...therefore, an education to the synthesis ofunderstanding and action is necessary for a life based on recognition.“All education in the East is purely directed towards Sense-understanding,which...is the only way that can be shown as leading to a raising of the levelof essential Being....The essential thing is not information, but understanding, and understanding can be attained only by personal creativeapplication....Sense-perception always means giving a thing meaning; thedimension of Significance lies in the direction from within to the outside.Therefore, knowledge (in the sense of information) and understanding in reality,bear the same relationship to each other as nature and Spirit. Information isgained from without to the inside; understanding is a creative process in theopposite direction. Under these circumstances, there is no direct way leadingfrom one goal to the other. One may know everything without at the same timeunderstanding anything at all. And that is precisely the pass to which oureducation, that aims at a hoarding of information, has brought the majority.”Keyserling, Count Hermann, “Creative Understanding”, pp. 257, 216, 217.This book seeks to deal with the method whereby the capacity to function in thelarger consciousness can be developed, and man can re-organize his Being towardsthe wider issues. It concerns itself with the technique by which a specializedtraining and self-culture can be applied by every individual unit who [33] iscapable of desiring this larger goal. If that desire can take a clear andrational form in his mind and can be appreciated as a perfectly legitimateobjective, capable of successful achievement, he will eagerly grasp at it. Ifsociety can provide the means and opportunity for such advancement, many willgladly seek the way. The method proposed is an individual technique which willenable the student, who has profited by the usual academic educationaladvantages and the experiences of life, to expand his consciousness until hegradually transcends his present limitations and reorients his mind to widerrealizations. He will discover the soul as the great Reality, thus gainingdirect experience of spiritual things.Everett Dean Martin defines education for us as a “spiritual revaluation ofhuman life. Its task is to reorient the individual, to enable him to take aricher and more significant view of his experiences, to place him above and notwithin the system of his beliefs and ideals.” (Martin, Everett Dean, “TheMeaning of a Liberal Education”, p. viii, Preface.) This definition necessarilyopens the door to controversy, for we live, each of us, in a differentenvironment; we have each our special problems and characteristics, based uponour heredity, our physical condition and many other factors. The consequentstandard of values will have to be modified for each person, for eachgeneration, country and race. That education is intended to prepare us for“complete living” (as Herbert Spencer [34] says) may be true, but the scope andcapacity of each man differs. The lowest and the highest attainable point formen varies infinitely, and a man, moreover, who is equipped to function in oneparticular sphere might prove ludicrously inadequate in another. Some standardof “complete living” must therefore be worked out if the definition is to beuseful. To do this we shall have to ascertain what is the pure type of therounded out and perfected man, and what is the sum total of his range ofcontacts. It does not seem possible that we have exhausted the possibilities ofman’s response apparatus, nor of the environment with which it can put him intouch. What are the limits within which man can function? If there are states ofawareness, ranging all the way from that of the Hottentot up to that of ourintelligentsia and on to the geniuses and leaders in all fields of humanexpression, what constitutes the difference between them? Why are their fieldsof perception so widely diverse? Racial development, one will reply; glandularstability, or instability, another will say; the possession, or the lack, ofadequate educational advantages, differences in environment and in heritage,other groups of thinkers will decide.But out of the welter of opinion emerges the basic fact of the wide range of thehuman states of awareness, and the wonder of the realization that humanity hasproduced such marvels of comprehensive understanding, of purity of expressionand of perfected world-wide influence as we see evidenced by [35] the Christ,the Buddha, Plato and many others, whose thoughts and words have set their markupon the minds of men for thousands of years. What has made them what they are?Are they miracles, emerging from the heart of the Infinite, and, hence, cannever find their equal? Are they products of the evolutionary process, and sohave become potent through vast experience and unfoldment? Or are they theflower of the human race, who added to their equipment and training aspecialized culture which enabled them to enter a spiritual world, which issealed to the majority, and to function in a dimension of which even our mostadvanced thinkers know nothing? Have our present educational systems broughthumanity, as a whole, to a condition where many thousands are ready for thisspecialized culture, and, therefore, are we facing a crisis in the educationalfield which has its roots in a success, which, if carried forward along the samelines, will become a detriment instead of a help, — because man is ready forsomething new? Some of us believe that this is possible, and that it is timethat educators should begin to prepare men for the new and divine experience andfor that wonderful experiment which will put them everywhere in possession ofthemselves — a thing hitherto the choice prerogative of the mystics and knowersof the race. These knowers have testified to a wider world than the one revealedto us by the mechanism of the nerves, and investigated by the chemist, thephysicist, the biologist and the anthropologist. They have spoken in nouncertain [36] terms of a realm of contacts and of awareness in which theordinary senses are useless. They claim to have lived and moved in these subtlerrealms, and the perseverance displayed in the mystical search for reality, andthe similarity of their testimony down the ages lead one to believe in thepossibility of that intangible world and of a response apparatus, by means ofwhich it can be contacted. The ranks of these “deluded” mystics and intuitionalthinkers number tens of thousands of the best minds of the race. They say to usin the words of Walt Whitman: “I and my kind do not convince by argument; weconvince by our presence.” (Whitman, Walt, “Leaves of Grass”.)Education has also been expressed as “an adventurous quest for the meaning oflife, involving an ability to think things through.” Who said this I do notknow, but it seems to me a most excellent description of the way of the mysticand the technique of meditation whereby the mystic becomes the fully consciousknower. However much one may seek to explain it away, the fact remains that mangoes questing through the ages, and his quest leads him far deeper than theconcrete externals of the world in which he lives. Dr. Overstreet calls this toour attention in words that carry the true mystical message. He says:“In the main, we are creatures who see ‘things’. We see what we see and usuallynot beyond what we see. To experience the world as merely a world of things isdoubtless to fail of something that is significant. The experience of [37]things, to be sure, is good as far as it goes. It enables us to move about ourworld and to manipulate the life-factors with some success....It is possible,however, to get a different ‘feel’ of one’s world if one is able to developanother habit of mind. It is, in short, the habit of seeing the invisible in thevisible reality; the habit of penetrating surfaces, of seeing through things totheir initiating sources.”Overstreet, H. A., “The Enduring Quest”, p. 114.Men are now perhaps ready to penetrate beneath the surface and to carry theirsearch within the outer form of nature to that which is its cause. We areperhaps, too apt to confuse the religious spirit with the mystic search. Allclear thinking about life and about the great laws of nature, if carried forwardwith persistence and steadfastness, leads eventually into the mystic world, andthis the foremost scientists of our day are beginning to realize. Religionstarts with the accepted hypothesis of the unseen and the mystical. But sciencearrives at the same point by working from the seen to the unseen and from theobjective to the subjective. Thus, as has been said, by the process ofinvestigation and of passing inwards from form to form, the mystic arriveseventually at the glory of the unveiled Self. It seems to be unalterably truethat all paths lead to God — viewing God as the ultimate goal, the symbol ofman’s search for Reality. It is no longer a sign of superstition to believe in ahigher dimension and in another world of Being. Even the word “supernatural” hasbecome deeply and profoundly respectable, and it seems possible that some dayour [38] educational systems may regard the preparation of the individual totranscend his natural limitations as an entirely legitimate part of its affairs.It is interesting to note what Dr. C. Lloyd Morgan in the Gifford Lectures,delivered in 1923, has to say about this word “supernatural.” He says:“There is, I submit, an intelligible sense in which it may be said that, in theascending hierarchy of stages of progress, regarded as manifestations of DivinePurpose, each higher stage is in turn super natural to that which precedes it.In this sense life is supernatural to the inorganic; reflective comprehension inthought is supernatural to naive unreflective perception; the religiousattitude, with acknowledgement of Divine Purpose, is supernatural to the ethicalattitude in social affairs. For those who reach this highest stage, as they deemit, the religious attitude affords the supreme exemplar of the supernatural. Itis distinctive of the spiritual man.”Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Life, Mind and Spirit”, p. X, Preface.and, he adds most beautifully and most appositely, as far as our subject isconcerned, that “The stress for us is on a new attitude , for it is this thatis, as I think, emergent. Hence we may speak of a new ‘vision,’ and a new‘heart,’ capable of a higher and richer form of joy.” (Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Life,Mind and Spirit”, p. X, Preface.).In Dr. Hocking’s notable book “Human Nature and Its Remaking” he points out thateducation has two functions. It must first of all communicate the type and thenprovide for growth beyond that type. Education is intended to make man trulyhuman; it must round out and perfect his nature, and so reveal [39] and makepossible those deeper potentialities towards which all humanity tends. Theevocation of the will-to-know, and, later, of the will-to-be, must follow anatural process of development. It is in this connection that the method ofmeditation will be seen as a part of the technique of the higher education whichthe New Age will see developed; it will be found to be the means whereby therounded out human being can be still further developed, and led forth into a newkingdom in nature. Meditation is primarily a self-initiated process ofeducation, calling forth all the powers of the will, basing itself upon theequipment present, but producing at the end a new type, the soul type, with itsown internal apparatus, and holding within itself again the seeds of stillgreater unfoldment.From being something imposed from without, the new educational process wells upfrom within, and becomes that self-imposed mental discipline, which we cover bythose much misunderstood words — concentration, meditation, and contemplation.From being a process of memory training, and the development of a quick handlingof the response apparatus which puts us in touch with the external world, theeducational technique becomes a system of mind-control, leading eventually to aninner awareness of a new state of being. It produces at length a rapid reactionand responsiveness to a world, intangible and unseen, and to a new series ofinstinctual recognitions which have their seat in a subtler response apparatus.The soul type imposes itself upon the [40] human type, as the human has doneupon the animal, and just as the human type is the product of mass training andinstinct and has been tremendously unfolded by our modern educational systems,so the soul type is the product of a new method of mental training, imposed onthe individual by his soul, and called forth by the urgency of the quest and bythe act of his will. This soul is always latent in the human form, but is drawninto demonstrated activity through the practice of meditation.These two methods of rounding out the human being and raising him to a massstandard, and of producing the emergence of the new type, the soul, constitutethe main distinction between the western and eastern educational methods.The contrast between the two ways of development is most instructive. In theEast we have the careful culture of the individual, with the masses leftpractically without any education. In the West we have mass education, but theindividual is left, speaking generally, without any specific culturing. Thesetwo great and divergent systems have each produced a civilization, expressingits peculiar genius and manifestations, but also its marked defects. Thepremises upon which the systems are based are widely divergent, and it would beworth our while to consider them, for in understanding them and in the eventualunion of the two it is possible that the way out may be found for the new racein the New Age.First: In the eastern system, it is assumed that [41] within every human formdwells an entity, a being, called the self or soul. Second: This self utilizesthe form of the human being as its instrument or means of expression, andthrough the sum total of the mental and emotional states will eventuallymanifest itself, utilizing the physical body as its functioning mechanism on thephysical plane. Finally, the control of these means of expression is broughtabout under the Law of Rebirth. Through the evolutionary process (carriedforward through many lives in a physical body) the self gradually builds a fitinstrument through which to manifest, and learns to master it. Thus the self orsoul becomes truly creative and self-conscious in the highest sense and activein its environment, manifesting its true nature perfectly. Eventually it gainscomplete liberation from form, from the thralldom of the desire nature, and thedomination of the intellect. This final emancipation, and consequent transfer ofthe centre of consciousness from the human to the spiritual kingdom, is hastenedand nurtured by a specialized education, called the meditation process, which issuperimposed upon a mind widely and wisely cultured.The result of this intensive and individual training has been spectacular in theextreme. The eastern method is the only one which has produced the Founders ofall the world religions, for all are Asiatic in origin. It is responsible forthe appearance of those inspired Scriptures of the world which have moulded thethoughts of men, and for the coming [42] forth of all the world Saviours — theBuddha, Zoroaster, Shri Krishna, the Christ, and others. Thus the East hasmanifested forth, as the result of its particular technique, all the GreatIndividuals, who have sounded the note for their particular age, given theneeded teaching for the unfoldment in the minds of men of the God-Idea, and soled humanity forward along the path of spiritual perception. The exoteric resultof their lives is to be seen in the great organized religions.In the training of the highly developed individuals, however, the massesthroughout Asia have been neglected, and the system, consequently, (from theangle of racial development), leaves much to be desired. The defects of thesystem are the development of visionary and impractical tendencies. The mysticis frequently unable to cope with his environment, and where the emphasis islaid entirely upon the subjective side of life, the physical welfare of theindividual and the race is neglected and overlooked. The masses are left tostruggle in the mire of ignorance, disease and dirt, and, hence, we have thedeplorable conditions found throughout the Orient, alongside the highestspiritual illumination of the favored few.In the West the emphasis is entirely reversed. The subjective is ignored andregarded as hypothetical, and the premises upon which our culture is based areas follows: First, there is an entity, called the human being, who possesses amind, a set of emotions and a response apparatus through which he is [43]brought into contact with his environment. Second, according to the calibre ofhis apparatus and the condition of his mind, plus the nature of his environingcircumstances, so will be his character and disposition. The goal of theeducational process, applied wholesale and indiscriminately, is to make himphysically fit, mentally alert, to provide a trained memory, controlledreactions, and a character which makes him a social asset and a contributingfactor in the body economic. His mind is regarded as a storehouse for impartedfacts and the training given every child is intended to make him a useful memberof society, self-supporting and decent. The product of these premises is thereverse of the Oriental. We have no specific culture of a kind to produce suchworld figures as Asia has produced, but we have evolved a mass system ofeducation, and we have developed groups of thinkers. Hence, our universities,colleges and public and private schools. These set their mark upon tens ofthousands of men, standardizing them and training them so that we turn out ahuman product, possessing a certain uniform knowledge, a certain stereotypedstore of facts and a smattering of information. This means that there is no suchdeplorable ignorance as we find in the East, but a fairly high level of generalknowledge. It has produced what we call civilization, with its wealth of books,and its many sciences. It has produced the scientific investigation of man, and(on the crest of the wave of human evolution) the great Groups incontradistinction to the great Individuals. [44] The contrasts might be crudelysummed up as follows:WEST EAST Groups Individuals Books Bibles Knowledge Wisdom ObjectiveCivilization Subjective Culture Mechanical Development Mystical DevelopmentStandardization Uniqueness Mass Education Specialized Training Science ReligionMemory Training Meditation Investigation ReflectionYet the cause is basically one — a method of education. Both are alsofundamentally right, yet both are needed to supplement and complement eachother. The education of the masses of the Orient will lead to the rectifying oftheir physical plane problems which call aloud for solution. A wide generalsystem of education reaching down among the illiterate masses of the people inAsia is the outstanding need. The culturing of the individual in the West, andthe grafting upon his body of imposed knowledge, of a technique of Soul Culture,as it has come to us from the Orient, will lift and salvage our civilizationwhich is so fast breaking down. The East needs knowledge and the imparting ofinformation. The West needs wisdom and the technique of meditation.This scientific and cultural system, when applied to our highly educated humanbeings, will produce [45] that bridging body of men, who will unify theachievements of the two hemispheres and link the subjective and objectiverealms. They will act as the pioneers of the New Age, when men will be practicalmen of affairs with their feet firmly planted on earth and yet, at the sametime, be mystics and seers, living also in the world of spirit and carryinginspiration and illumination with them into the life of every day.For the bringing about of these conditions and the production of that greatgroup of practical mystics who will eventually save the world, two things areneeded: — trained minds with wide general knowledge as a foundation (and thisour western system can give), plus a spiritual awareness of the indwellingdivinity, the soul, to be achieved through the eastern system of scientificmeditation. Our greatest need in the West lies in our failure to recognize theSoul and the faculty of the intuition which in its turn leads to illumination.The late Professor Luzzatti, Prime Minister of Italy, in the Preface to his mostvaluable and scholarly book “God and Freedom” says: “It is everywhere noticedthat the growth of the empire of man over himself does not keep step with thegrowth of the empire of man over nature.” (Luzzatti, Luigi, “God and Freedom”.)It is essential that the western world should perfect its educational systems insuch a way as to bring about this conquest of the empire of ourselves."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE - THE NATURE OF THE SOUL“Philosophers say the Soul is double-faced, her upper face gazes at God all thetime and her lower face looks somewhat down, informing the senses; and the upperface, which is the summit of the soul, is in eternity and has nothing to do withtime: it knows nothing of time or of body.”Meister Eckhart[49] In detailing the technique whereby it is claimed the educated intellectualcan become the intuitional knower it might be well to state the hypotheses uponwhich the science of meditation is based. In the process the various aspects (innature, or of divinity, whichever is preferred) of which man is the expressionhave to be recognized, but the basic connection which holds him together as anintegrated unity must never be forgotten. Man is an integrated being, butexistence means more to some men than to others. For some it is purely animalexistence; for many it connotes the sum total of emotional and sensoryexperience; for others, it involves all this, plus a mental awareness whichgreatly enriches and deepens life. For a few (and those the flower of the humanfamily) Being stands for a recognition of ability to register contacts that areuniversal and subjective as well as individual and objective. Keyserling saysthat:“When we speak of the Being of a man in contradistinction to his ability, wemean his vital soul; and when we say this Being decides, we mean that all hisutterances are penetrated with individual life, that every single expression[50] radiates personality, and that this personality is ultimately responsible.”Keyserling, Count Hermann, “Creative Understanding”, p. 180.It might be stated here as sine qua non that only those people who areresponsible thinking beings are ready for the application of those rules andinstructions which will enable them to make that transition and to come to thatconsciousness which is the hallmark of the illuminated mystic and theintuitional knowers. The beautiful lines found in Dr. Winslow Hall’s Illuminanda, point the goal:“In all men lurks The Light; yet, in how fewHas it blazed forth, as rightfully it ought,Illuming, from within, our fleshly lamp,And kindling cosmic time in nigh-brought souls!Splendour of God, how few! And ours the blame;For, ever, crassly, by routine and wrath,We undiscerningly damp down and chokeThe spark of God that glints in every child.All children are, by nature, bits of God;And God, if they but had their freedom, wouldUnfold himself in them, would burgeon forthTinting and moulding, till, as perfect flowersThey bloomed, fulfilled of loveliness unveiled.”Hall, W. Winslow, M.D., “Illuminanda”, p.218.This is the goal of the meditation process — to lead men forth into the Lightthat is within themselves and enable them, in that light, to see Light. Thiswork of revelation is based on certain definite theories as to the constitutionand nature of the human being. The evolution and perfecting of the mind facultyin man, with its keenness and capacity for [51] concentration gives the West atthis time the opportunity to put these theories to the test. An intelligentexperiment is now naturally in order. “The new synthesis of mind and soul,”Keyserling says, “must originate from the mind, on the height of supremeintellectuality, if something decisive is to happen.” (Keyserling, CountHermann, “Creative Understanding”, p. 125.)But to do this, there must be a clear understanding of three points upon whichthe Oriental position is based, and which, if true, validate the entirecontention of the student of the Oriental technique of meditation, neverforgetting, however, the proverb of the Chinese which says that, “If the wrongman uses the right means, the right means work in the wrong way.” These threepremises are:First: There is a soul in every human form, and that soul uses the lower aspectsof man simply as vehicles of expression. The objective of the evolutionaryprocess is to enhance and deepen the control of the soul over this instrument.When this is complete, we have a divine incarnation.Secondly: The sum total of these lower aspects, when developed and co-ordinatedwe call the Personality. This unity is composed of the mental and emotionalstates of being, the vital energy and the physical response apparatus, and these“mask” or hide the soul. These aspects develop sequentially and progressively,according to the eastern philosophy, and only on reaching a relatively highstate of unfoldment does it become possible for man to [52] coordinate them andlater to unify them, in consciousness, with the indwelling soul. Later comescontrol by the soul, and a steadily increasing expression of the nature of thesoul. This is sometimes symbolically expressed as a light in a lamp. At firstthe lamp gives forth no radiance, but gradually the light makes its presencefelt, till the meaning of the words of the Christ becomes clear. He said, “I amthe light of the world,” and enjoined upon His disciples to “let your lightshine that man may see.”Thirdly: When the life of the soul, acting under the Law of Rebirth, has broughtthe personality to such a condition that it is an integrated and coordinatedunit, then there is set up between the two a more intensive interaction. Thisinteraction is brought about though the processes of self-discipline, an activewill towards spiritual Being, unselfish service (for that is the mode in whichthe group-conscious soul manifests itself) and meditation. The consummation ofthe work is the conscious realization of union — called, in Christianterminology, the at-one-ment.These three hypotheses must be accepted, at any rate, tentatively, if thisprocess of education through meditation is to be rendered effective. InWebster’s Dictionary, the soul is defined in line with these theories, and thedefinition runs as follows:“An entity conceived as the essence, substance, or actuating cause of individuallife, especially of life manifested in psychical activities; the vehicle ofindividual existence, [53] separate in nature from the body and usually held tobe separable in existence.”“Webster’s New International Dictionary”, Edition of 1923.Webster adds the following comment which is appropriate in its application toour theme that “some conceptions, such as that of Fechner, that the soul is thewhole unitary spiritual process in conjunction with the whole unitary bodilyprocess, appear to stand midway between the idealistic and materialistic views.”(“Webster’s New International Dictionary”, Edition of 1923.) The strictlyOriental position is given us by Dr. Radhakrishnan, of the University ofCalcutta, as follows:“All organic beings have a principle of self-determination, to which the name of‘soul’ is generally given. In the strict sense of the word, ‘soul’ belongs toevery being that has life in it, and the different souls are fundamentallyidentical in nature. The differences are due to the physical organizations thatobscure and thwart are the life of the soul. The nature of the bodies in whichthe souls are incorporated accounts for their various degrees ofobscuration....The ego is the psychological unity of that stream of consciousexperiencing which constitutes what we know as the inner life of an empiricalself.“The empirical self is the mixture of free spirit and mechanism, of purusa andprakriti....Every ego possesses within the gross material body, which suffersdissolution at death, a subtle body, formed of the psychical apparatus,including the senses.”Radhakrishnan, S., “Indian Philosophy”, Vol. II, pp. 279, 283, 285.This soul, we are told, is a fragment of the Oversoul, a spark of the one Flame,imprisoned in the body. It is that life aspect which gives to man — as to [54]all forms in manifestation — life, or being and consciousness. It is the vitalfactor, that integrating coherent something which makes the human being(composite, yet unified, as he is) a thinking, feeling and aspiring entity. Theintellect in man is that factor or quality of soul-awareness which enables himto orient himself to his environment during the stages in which his personalityis under development, but which later, through proper meditation, enables him toorient himself towards the soul, as detached from the mechanism, and thus,therefore, towards a new state of awareness of being.The relation of the soul to the Oversoul is that of the part towards the Whole,and it is this relation and its consequent recognitions, which develop into thatsense of oneness with all beings and with the supreme Reality to which themystics have always testified. Its relation to the human being is that of theconscious entity towards its medium of expression; of the one who thinks,towards the instrument of thought; of the one who registers feeling, towards thefield of sensuous experience, and of the actor, towards the physical body — thesole means of contact with that particular field of activity, the world ofphysical life. This soul expresses itself through two forms of energy, thatwhich we call the vital principle or fluid, the life aspect, and the energy ofpure reason. These energies are focussed during life in the physical body. Thelife stream centres itself in the heart, utilizing the blood stream, thearteries and the veins, and animating every part of the organism; [55] the otherstream, of intellectual energy, centres itself in the brain, and utilizes thenervous apparatus as its medium of expression. In the heart, therefore, is theseat of the life-principle; in the head is the seat of the reasoning mind and ofthe spiritual consciousness, which latter is attained through a right use of themind. Dr. C. Lloyd Morgan says in connection with this word, “soul:”“In any case what is currently understood by ‘the soul-theory’ has its roots indualism. And what some people mean when they speak of ‘a psychology without asoul’ is a psychology other than dualistic....There is, however, a sense inwhich he may, under suitable definition, speak of the soul as distinctive ofthat level of mental development at which a concept of Spirit is within thefield of reflective reference.”Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Life, Mind and Spirit”, p. 35.Earlier in the same book he says that:“Each of us is a life, a mind, and Spirit — an instance of life as oneexpression of world-plan, of mind as a different expression of that world-plan,of Spirit in so far as the Substance of that world-plan is revealed within us.The world-plan, through and through, from its lowest to its highest expression,is manifestation of God; in you and me — in each of us severally — God as Spiritis partially revealed.”Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Life, Mind and Spirit”, p. 32.It is this revelation of Deity that is the goal of the mystical endeavor and theobject of the dual activity of mind — God as life in Nature, God as love,subjectively, and as plan and as purpose, and it is this that the unification,which meditation brings about [56] reveals to man. Through its orderedtechnique, man discovers that unity which is himself. Through it, he laterdiscovers his relation to the universe; he finds that his physical body and hisvital energies are part and parcel of Nature itself, which is, in fact, theouter garment of Deity; he finds that his ability to love and to feel makes himaware of the love that pulses at the heart of all creation; and he discoversthat his mind can give him the key which unlocks for him the door ofunderstanding and that he can enter into the purposes and the plans which guidethe Mind of God Himself. In fact, he arrives at God and discovers God as thecentral Fact. Knowing himself to be divine, he finds the whole is equallydivine. Dr. F. Kirtley Mather of Harvard University has said in a mostilluminating article:“That there is an administration of the Universe cannot be denied. Something hasdetermined and continues to determine the functioning of natural law, theorderly transformation of matter and of energy. It may be the ‘curvature of thecosmos’, or ‘blind chance’, or ‘universal energy’, or ‘an absentee Jehovah’, oran ‘all-pervading Spirit’, but it must be something. From one point of view, thequestion: Is there a God? is promptly answered in the affirmative.”Thus, through finding himself and understanding his own nature, man arrives atthat centre within himself which is one with all that is; he finds he isequipped with an apparatus which can put him in touch with the differentiatedmanifestations through which Deity seeks to express itself. He possesses a [57]vital body, responsive to universal energy, and the vehicle for the two forms ofsoul energy to which I referred above. The subject of the vital body, itsrelation to this universal energy, and its seven points of contact with thephysical organism are covered in my book, The Soul and Its Mechanism, and willnot be enlarged upon here, beyond quoting one paragraph.“Behind the objective body lies a subjective form constituted of etheric matter,and acting as a conductor of the life principle of energy, or prana. This lifeprinciple is the force aspect of the soul, and through the medium of the ethericbody the soul animates the form, gives it its peculiar qualities and attributes,impresses upon it its desires and, eventually, directs it through the activityof the mind. Through the medium of the brain the soul galvanizes the body intoconscious (directed) activity and through the medium of the heart all parts ofthe body are pervaded by life”.Bailey, Alice A., “The Soul and its Mechanism”, p. 62.There is also another “body” which is composed of the sum-total of all emotionalstates, moods and feelings. This body reacts to a man’s physical environment inresponse to information received by the brain through the medium of the fivesenses, and conveyed to it via the vital body. Thus it is swept into activity ofa purely selfish and personal nature; or it can be trained to react primarily tothe mind, regarding the mind (as it so seldom is) as the interpreter of thespiritual self, the soul. It is this emotional body, characterized by feelingand desire, that acts most potently, in the majority of cases, upon [58] thephysical body. This latter is regarded by the esotericist as a pure automaton,driven into action by the desire nature and energized by the vital energy.As the race progresses, another “body,” the mind body, comes into being andactivity, and gradually assumes an active and natural control. Like the physicaland emotional organisms, this mental mechanism is at first entirely objective inits orientation, and swings into activity through impacts coming to it from theouter world, via the senses. Becoming increasingly positive, it slowly andsurely begins to dominate the other phenomenal aspects of man until thepersonality, in all its four aspects, is completed and unified as a functioningentity on the physical plane. When this happens, a crisis is reached and newdevelopments and unfoldments become possible.All this time, the two energies of the soul, life and mind, have been workingthrough the vehicles, without the man being aware of their source or purpose. Asa result of their work, he is now an intelligent, active, high-grade humanbeing. But, as Browning puts it: “In completed man begins anew a tendency toGod,” (Browning, Robert, “Paracelsus”) and he is driven by a divine unresttowards a conscious awareness of, and a conscious contact with, his soul — theunseen factor which he senses, but of which he remains personally unaware. Nowhe enters upon a process of self-education and of an intensive investigationinto his true nature. [59] His personality, which has been outgoing towards theworld of physical, emotional and mental life, with its attention focussedobjectively, goes through a process of reorientation, and turns inward towardsthe Self. Its focus becomes subjective and has for its purpose the emergenceinto manifestation of that “Deeper Being” about which Keyserling speaks.Conscious union with the soul is sought, and this not only from the emotionaland sensuous angle of the devotee and mystic. Direct experience is sought.Knowledge of the divine Self, and mental assurance as to the fact of theindwelling Son of God becomes the goal of all endeavor. This method is not thatof the mystical devotee who through the driving love of his emotional nature hassought after God. It is the method of intellectual approach and of thesubordination of the entire personality to the drive towards spiritualrealities. All purely mental types and all truly coordinated personalities aremystics at heart, and have passed through the mystical stage at some time orother in some life . As the intellect takes hold and the mind develops, this maytemporarily fade into the background and be relegated for a time to the realm ofthe subconscious. But the emphasis is eventually and inevitably laid upon thewill to know, and the drive of the life (no longer satisfied with the outer andexternal aspects of manifestation) is towards knowledge of the soul and the useof the mind in the apprehension of spiritual truth..The head and the heart become united in their endeavor. Mind and pure reasonare blended with [60] love and devotion in an entire re-adjustment of thepersonality to a new realm of awareness. New states of consciousness areregistered, a new phenomenal world is gradually perceived, and it begins to dawnupon the aspirant that his life-focus and his consciousness can be liftedentirely out of all past fields of endeavor. He finds that he can walk with God,dwell in Heaven, and be aware of a new world lying within the familiar outerforms. He begins to regard himself as a conscious denizen of another kingdom innature, the spiritual, which is as real and as vital, as ordered and asphenomenal as any we now know. He steadily assumes the attitude of the soultowards his instrument, the human body. He regards himself no longer as a man,controlled by his emotions, impelled by energy, and directed by his mind, butknows himself to be the Self, thinking through the mind, feeling through theemotions, and acting consciously. As this consciousness stabilizes and becomespermanent, the work of evolution in his case is consummated, the greatat-one-ment is made, and the union between the Self and its vehicle ofexpression is established. Thus a divine Son of God consciously incarnates.Through the work of education in all its many branches, the co-ordination of thepersonality has been tremendously hastened. The mentality of the race issteadily mounting the ladder of achievement. Humanity, through its vast groupsof educated and mentally focussed people is ready for self-determination andsoul-direction. Now the intensive culture [61] of the individual, as taught inthe Eastern system, can be undertaken. The education and reorientation of theadvanced human being must find its place in our mass education. This is the pleaof this book and the object of its writing. How can a man find his soul, orascertain the fact of its existence? How can he re-adjust himself to theconditions of soul life, and begin to function consciously and simultaneously asa soul and as a man? What must he do to bring about that union between the souland its instrument which is essential if the driving urge of his nature is everto be satisfied? How can he know, and not just believe and hope and aspire?The experienced voice of the eastern wisdom comes to us with one word: —Meditation. The question naturally arises: “Is that all?” and the answer is:“Yes.” If meditation is rightly followed, and if perseverance is the keynote ofthe life, then increasingly soul contact is established. The results of thatcontact work out in self-discipline, in purification, and in the life ofaspiration and of service. Meditation in the eastern sense is, as we shall see,a strictly mental process, leading to soul knowledge and illumination. It is afact in nature that “as a man thinketh so is he.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR - THE OBJECTIVES IN MEDITATION“Union is achieved through the subjugation of the psychic nature, and therestraint of the mind-stuff. When this has been accomplished, the Yogi knowshimself as he is in reality.”Patanjali[65] Assuming the correctness of the theories outlined in the precedingchapters, it might be of value if we were to state clearly toward what definitegoal the educated man aims as he enters on the way of meditation, and in whatway meditation differs from what the Christian calls prayer. Clear thinking onboth these points is essential if we want to make practical progress, for thetask ahead of the investigator is an arduous one; he will need more than apassing enthusiasm and a temporary endeavor if he is to master this science andbecome proficient in its technique. Let us consider the last point first, andcontrast the two methods of prayer and of meditation. Prayer can perhaps be bestexpressed by certain lines, by J. Montgomery, well known to all of us.Prayer is the soul’s sincere desireUttered or unexpressed,The motion of a hidden fire,That trembles in the breast.The thought held is that of desire, and of request; and the source of the desireis the heart. But it must be borne in mind that the heart’s desire may be eitherfor the acquisition of those possessions [66] which the personality desires, orfor those heavenly and transcendental possessions which the soul craves.Whichever it may be, the basic idea is demanding what is wanted, and theanticipation factor enters in; also something is eventually acquired, should thefaith of the petitioner be sufficiently strong.Meditation differs from prayer in that it is primarily an orientation of themind, which orientation brings about realizations and recognitions which becomeformulated knowledge. Much confusion exists in the minds of many on thisdistinction and Bianco of Siena was really speaking of meditation when he said:“What is prayer but upward turning of the mind to God direct.”The masses of the people, polarized in their desire nature, and beingpredominantly of a mystical tendency, ask for what they need; they wrestle inprayer for the acquiring of longed-for virtues; they beg a listening Deity toassuage their troubles; they intercede for those near and dear to them; theyimportune high Heaven for those possessions — material or spiritual — which theyfeel essential to their happiness. They aspire and long for qualities, forcircumstances and for those conditioning factors which will make their liveseasier, or release them for what they believe will be freedom to be of greaterusefulness; they agonize in prayer for relief from illness and disease, and seekto make God answer their request for revelation. But it is asking, demanding andexpecting which are the main characteristics of [67] prayer, with desiredominant, and the heart involved. It is the emotional nature and the feelingpart of man which seeks after that which is needed, and the range of needs iswide and real. It is the heart approach.Four degrees of prayer might be recognized:1. Prayer for material benefits, and for help.2. Prayer for virtues and for graces of character.3. Prayer for others, intercessory prayer.4. Prayer for illumination and for divine realization.It will be seen from a study of these four types of prayer that all have theirroots in the desire nature, and that the fourth brings the aspirant to the pointwhere prayer can end and meditation begin. Seneca must have realized this whenhe said: “No prayer is needed, except to ask for a good state of mind, forhealth (wholeness) of soul.”Meditation carries the work forward into the mental realm; desire gives place tothe practical work of preparation for divine knowledge and the man who startedhis long career and life experience with desire as the basic quality and whoreached the stage of adoration of the dimly seen divine Reality, passes now outof the mystical world into that of the intellect, of reason, and eventualrealization. Prayer, plus disciplined unselfishness, produces the Mystic.Meditation, plus organized disciplined service, produces the Knower. The mystic,as we have earlier seen, senses divine realities, contacts (from the heights ofhis aspiration) the mystical vision, [68] and longs ceaselessly for the constantrepetition of the ecstatic state to which his prayer, adoration and worship haveraised him. He is usually quite unable to repeat this initiation at will. PèrePoulain in Des Grâces d’Oraison holds that no state is mystical unless the seeris unable to produce it himself. In meditation, the reverse is the case, andthrough knowledge and understanding, the illuminated man is able to enter atwill into the kingdom of the soul, and to participate intelligently in its lifeand states of consciousness. One method involves the emotional nature and isbased on belief in a God who can give. The other involves the mental nature andis based on belief in the divinity of man himself, though it does it negate themystical premises of the other group.It will be found, however, that the words mystic and mystical are very looselyused and cover not only the pure mystic, with his visions and sensory reactions,but also those who are transiting into the realm of pure knowledge and ofcertainty. They cover those states which are unexpected and intangible, beingbased on pure aspiration and devotion, and also those which are the outcome ofan ordered intelligent approach to Reality, and which are susceptible ofrepetition under the laws which the knower has learnt. Bertrand Russell dealswith these two groups in a most interesting way, though he uses the one termMystic in both relations. His words form a most fascinating prelude to ourtheme.[69] “Mystical philosophy, in all ages and in all parts of the world, ischaracterized by certain beliefs which are illustrated by the doctrines we havebeen considering.“There is, first, the belief in insight as against discursive analyticknowledge; the belief in a way of wisdom, sudden, penetrating, coercive, whichis contrasted with the slow and fallible study of outward appearance by ascience relying wholly upon the senses....“The mystic insight begins with the sense of a mystery unveiled, of a hiddenwisdom now suddenly become certain beyond the possibility of a doubt. The senseof certainty and revelation comes earlier than any definite belief. The definitebeliefs at which mystics arrive are the result of reflection upon theinarticulate experience gained in the moment of insight....“The first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination is belief inthe possibility of a way of knowledge which may be called revelation or insightor intuition, as contrasted with sense, reason and analysis, which are regardedas blind guides leading to the morass of illusion. Closely connected with thisbelief is the conception of a Reality behind the world of appearance and utterlydifferent from it. This Reality is regarded with an admiration often amountingto worship; it is felt to be always and everywhere close at hand, thinly veiledby the shows of sense, ready, for the receptive mind, to shine in its glory eventhrough the apparent folly and wickedness of Man. The poet, the artist, and thelover are seekers after that glory: the haunting beauty that they pursue is thefaint reflection of its sun. But the mystic lives in the full light of thevision: what others dimly seek he knows, with a knowledge beside which all otherknowledge is ignorance.“The second characteristic of mysticism is its belief in unity, and its refusalto admit opposition or division anywhere....“A third mark of almost all mystical metaphysics is the [70] denial of thereality of Time. This is an outcome of the denial of division; if all is one,the distinction of past and future must be illusory....“The last of the doctrines of mysticism which we have to consider is its beliefthat all evil is mere appearance, an illusion produced by the divisions andoppositions of the analytic intellect. Mysticism does not maintain that suchthings as cruelty, for example, are good, but it denies that they are real: theybelong to that lower world of phantoms from which we are to be liberated by theinsight of the vision....”Russell, Bertrand, “Mysticism and Logic”, pp. 8, 9, 10, 11.But the mystical way is a preparation for the way of knowledge and where themystic stops in adoration of the vision and in yearning after the Beloved, theseeker after true knowledge takes up the task and carries the work forward. Dr.Bennett of Yale says, at the close of his book on Mysticism, “The mystic at theend of his preparation is simply waiting for an apparition and an event which heis careful not to define too particularly; he is waiting, too, with the fullconsciousness that his own effort has now carried him as far as it can go andthat it needs to be completed by some touch from without.” (Bennett, Charles A.,“A Philosophical Study of Mysticism”, p. 192) This thought confines the wholeidea within the realm of sensuous perception, but there is something more. Thereis direct knowledge. There is an understanding of the laws governing this newrealm of being. There is submission to a new procedure and to those steps andpasswords which lead to the door and procure its opening. It is here thatmeditation plays its part [71] and the mind steps in to fulfil its new functionof revelation. Through meditation, the union for which the mystic yearns, andwhich he senses, and of which he has brief and fleeting experience, becomesdefinite and is known past all controversy, being recoverable at will. FatherJoseph Maréchal in his notable book points out that:“...the symbol vanishes, imagery fades, space disappears, multiplicity isreduced, reasoning is silent, the feeling of extension gathers itself togetherand then breaks down; intellectual activity is entirely concentrated in itsintensity ; it seizes without intermediary, with the sovereign certitude ofintuition, Being, God....“The human mind, then, is a faculty in quest of its intuition — that is to sayof assimilation of Being, Being pure and simple, sovereignly one , withoutrestriction, without distinction of essence and existence, of possible andreal.” (Italics by A. A. B.)Marechal, Joseph, S.J, “Studies in the Psychology of the Mystics”, pp. 32, 101.To take the Mind and bend it to its new task as a revealer of the divine is nowthe objective of the convinced mystic. To do this with success and withhappiness, he will need a clear vision of his goal and a lucid understanding ofthe results eventually to be demonstrated. He will need a keen formulation ofthe assets with which he approaches his endeavor, and an equally keenappreciation of his lacks and defects. A view, as balanced as may be, of himselfand of his circumstances, should be gained. Paralleling this, however, thereshould be also an equally balanced view of the goal and an understanding of [72]the wonder of the realizations and gifts which will be his, when his interesthas been transferred from the things that now engross his attention, and hisemotions, to the more esoteric values and standards.We have touched upon the point that meditation is a process whereby the mind isreoriented to Reality, and, rightly used, can lead a man into another kingdom innature, into another state of consciousness and Being and into anotherdimension. The goal of achievement has shifted into higher realms of thought andrealization. What are the definite results of this reorientation?It might be stated first of all that meditation is the science which enables usto arrive at direct experience of God. That in which we live and move and haveour being is no longer the object of aspiration, or a symbol to us of a divinepossibility. We know God as the Eternal Cause and the source of all that is,including ourselves. We recognize the Whole. We become one with God by becomingone with our own immortal soul, and when that tremendous event takes place wefind that the consciousness of the individual soul is the consciousness of thewhole, and that separativeness and division, distinctions and the concepts of meand thee, of God and a child of God, have faded away in the knowledge andrealization of unity. Dualism has given place to unity. This is the Way ofUnion. The integrated Personality has been transcended through an orderedprocess of soul unfoldment, and a conscious at-one-ment has been brought aboutbetween the lower or personal self [73] and the higher or divine self. Thisduality has to be first realized and then transcended before the Real selfbecomes, in the consciousness of the man, the Supreme Self. It has been saidthat the two parts of man have had for long ages nothing in common; these twoparts are the spiritual soul and the form nature, but they are joined eternally(and here lies the solution of man’s problem) by the mind principle. In anancient book of the Hindus, The Bhagavad Gita, these significant words arefound:“Self is the friend of self for him in whom the self is conquered by the Self;but to him who is far from the Self his own self is hostile like an enemy”“Bhagavad Gita”, VI, 6.and St. Paul says practically the same thing in his desperate cry:“For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing; for towill is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not....ForI delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in mymembers, warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity tothe law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who shalldeliver me (the real Self) from the body of this death?”“Romans”, VII, 18, 22, 23, 24.This real self is God — God the triumphant, God the Creator, God the Saviour ofman. It is, in the words of St. Paul, “Christ in us, the hope of glory.” Thisbecomes a fact in our consciousness and not simply a much hoped for theory.[74] Meditation causes our beliefs to change into ascertained facts, and ourtheories into proven experience. The statement of St. Paul’s remains only aconcept and a possibility until, through meditation, the Christ life is evokedand becomes the dominating factor in daily life. We speak of ourselves as divineand as sons of God. We know of those who have demonstrated their divinity to theworld, and who stand in the forefront of human achievement, testifying tofaculties beyond our scope of accomplishment. We are conscious, withinourselves, of strivings which drive us on towards knowledge, and of interiorpromptings, which have forced humanity up the ladder of evolution to its presentstatus of what we call educated human beings. A divine urge has driven usforward from the stage of the cave dweller to our modern civilized condition.Above all, we are aware of those who possess, or claim to possess, a vision ofheavenly things which we long to share, and who testify to a direct way into thecentre of divine Reality which they ask us also to follow. We are told that itis possible to have direct experience, and the keynote of our modern times canbe summed up in the words “From authority to experience.” How can we know? Howhave this direct experience, free from the intrusion of any intermediary? Theanswer comes that there is a method which has been followed by countlessthousands and a scientific process which has been formulated and followed bythinkers of all periods, and by means of which they become knowers.[75] The educational process has perhaps done its main theorizing in preparingthe mind to undertake the work of meditation. It has taught us that we possesssuch an apparatus and has presented to us some of its ways of use. Thepsychologists have told us much about our mental reactions, and our instinctualhabits. Now man must possess himself consciously of his instrument and pass outof the initial stages of the educational process into that classroom andinterior laboratory where it is possible to ascertain God for himself as theobjective of all education. Who was it said that the world is not a prison housebut a spiritual kindergarten, where millions of bewildered children are tryingto spell God? The mind sends us hither and thither in the work of spelling outtruth until the day dawns when, exhausted, we retire within ourselves andmeditate and then find God. As Dr. Overstreet says: “All our enduring quest thengets its explanation and its significance. It is the God operative withinourselves. As, then, we discover the more enduring values, or as we create them,we enact God in our own lives.” (Overstreet, H. A., “The Enduring Quest”, p.265.)Again, we might define meditation as the method whereby a man reaches the gloryof the unveiled self by the process of rejecting form after form. Education isnot only purveyed in our schools and universities. The greatest school of all islife experience itself, and the lessons we learn are those we bring uponourselves by identifying ourselves with a succession of forms — forms ofpleasure, forms of those [76] we love, forms of desire, forms of knowledge — thelist is endless! For what are forms but those substitutes which we create andthen set in front of ourselves as objects of worship, or those ideas abouthappiness and truth which others have created and after which we endlessly run,only to find them fade away into mist before our tired eyes. We seeksatisfaction in phenomena of all kinds, only to find them turn to dust andashes, until we reach that something — intangible yet infinitely real — whichgave being to them all. He who sees all forms as symbols of reality is well onthe way to touching the unveiled Self. But it takes a mental apprehension and aguided intuition to do this. Did Sir James Jeans have a glimpse of this when hesaid:“Phenomena come to us disguised in their frameworks of time and space; they aremessages in cipher of which we shall not understand the ultimate significanceuntil we have discovered how to decode them out of their space-time wrappings.”Jeans, Sir James, “The Universe Around Us”, p. 339.Man is a point of divine light, hidden within a number of enveloping sheaths, asa light is hidden within a lantern. This lantern may be either closed and dark,or open and radiant. It may be either a light shining before men’s eyes, or ahidden thing and, therefore, of no use to others. We are assured in that basictext book on meditation, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali , of which an Englishparaphrase and commentary is furnished in my book The Light of the Soul , thatthrough right discipline and meditation [77] “that which obscures the light isgradually removed,” and that “when the spiritual intelligence...reflects itselfin the mind-stuff then comes awareness of the Self.” (Bailey, Alice A., “TheLight of the Soul”, II., 52). At one point in the history of every human beingthere comes a momentous crisis when the light must be sensed, through a rightlyused intelligence, and the Divine inevitably contacted. This Patanjaliemphasizes when he says: “The transfer of the consciousness from a lower vehicleinto a higher is part of the creative and evolutionary process.”(Bailey, AliceA., “The Light of the Soul”, IV., 2). Slowly and gradually the work of directknowledge becomes possible, and the glory which is hidden behind every form canstand revealed. The secret is to know when that time has come and to seize themoment of opportunity. Meister Eckhart says:“If the soul were stripped of all her sheaths, God would be discovered all nakedto her view and would give himself to her, withholding nothing. As long as thesoul has not thrown off all her veils, however thin, she is unable to see God.”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, p. 114.Thus, East and West teach the same idea and in the same symbology.Meditation is, therefore, an ordered process whereby a man finds God. It is asystem, well-tried out and much used, which unfailingly reveals the divine. Theimportant words here are “ordered process.” There are certain rules to befollowed, [78] certain definite steps to be taken, and certain stages ofunfoldment to be experienced before a man can garner the fruits of meditation.It is a part of the evolutionary process, as we have seen, and like all else innature it is slow but sure, and unfailing in its results. There is nodisappointment to the man who is willing to obey the rules and work with thesystem. Meditation calls for self-control in all things, and unless the work ofmeditating is itself accompanied by the other requirements under the “orderedprocess” (such as self-control and active service) it will fail in itsobjective. Fanaticism is not required. This is made clear in the Bhagavad Gita.“There is no meditation for the man who eats too little or for the man who eatstoo much, or for him whose habit it is to sleep too much or too little. But forhim who is regulated in food, in work; regulated also in sleep and in waking,meditation becomes the destroyer of all suffering.”Bhagavad Gita, VI., 16-17.Meditation can be regarded rightly as part of the natural process which thus farhas carried man forward along the path of evolution from a stage but littleremoved from the animal to his present position of mental attainment, scientificachievement and divine unrest. Steadily his centre of consciousness has shifted,and steadily his attention has been focussed on an ever widening range ofcontacts. Man has already passed from the purely animal and physical state ofbeing into that of an intensely emotional and sensory awareness and in thisstate millions [79] remain at this time. But other millions are progressingbeyond this into another and higher field of awareness which we call that of themind. Still another group, much fewer in number, are passing into a sphere wherea universal range of contacts becomes possible. These we call the Knowers of therace. Through all methods employed runs the golden thread of divine purpose, andthe way by which the transfer of the human consciousness into that of soulrealization and soul awareness is effected is that of meditation.This process of unveiling the Self through the negation of the form-side of lifeand the eventual inability of the various sheaths to hide it, can be describedin terms of transmutation as well as in those of transference of consciousness.Transmutation is the changing, and re-directing of the energies of the mind, ofthe emotions and of the physical nature so that they serve to reveal the Self,and not simply to reveal the psychical and body natures.We are told, for instance, that we have five main instincts, which we share incommon with all animals. These, when used with selfish and personal objectives,enhance the body life, strengthen the form or material nature and so serveincreasingly to hide the Self, the spiritual man. These must be transmuted intotheir higher counterparts, for every animal characteristic has its spiritualprototype. The instinct of self-preservation must eventually be superseded byrealization of immortality, and [80] “dwelling ever in the Eternal,” man willwalk the earth and fulfill his destiny. The instinct which causes the lower selfto thrust its way forward, and force itself upward, will eventually betransformed into the domination of the higher or spiritual Self. The assertionof the little or lower self will give way to that of the higher Self. Sex, whichis an animal instinct powerfully governing all animal forms, will give place toa higher attraction, and will, in its noblest aspects, bring about consciousattraction and union between the soul and its vehicle; whilst the herd instinctwill be transmuted into group consciousness. A fifth instinct, namely the urgeto inquire and to investigate, which characterizes all minds at a high or a lowlevel, will give place to intuitive perception and understanding, and so thegreat work will be accomplished and the spiritual man will dominate hiscreation, the human being, and lift all his attributes and aspects into heaven.Through meditation, spiritual knowledge grows up within the mind, and from thebasis of ordinary knowledge, we steadily expand our understanding of the term,until knowledge merges into wisdom. This is direct knowledge of God by means ofthe mental faculty, so that we become what we are, and are enabled to manifestour divine nature. Tagore, in one place, defines meditation as “the enteringinto some great truth until we are possessed by it,” and truth and God aresynonymous terms. The mind knows two objects, we are told — the outer worldthrough the medium of the five senses and the brain, and the soul [81] and itsworld through what we might call an introverted use of the mind and its intensefocussing upon a new and unusual field of contact. Then “the mind stuffreflecting both the knower (the Self) and the knowable, becomes omniscient...itbecomes the instrument of the Self and acts as a unifying agent.” (Bailey, AliceA., “The Light of the Soul”, IV., 22-24 .) All things will stand revealed to theman who truly meditates. He will comprehend the hidden things of nature, and thesecrets of the life of the spirit. He will also know how he knows.Thus, meditation brings about union, or at-one-ment.The Occidental mystic may speak of the At-one-ment, whilst his brother in theOrient may speak of Raja Yoga, or of Union and of liberation, but they mean thesame thing. They mean that the mind and the soul (the Christ within us or theHigher Self) function as a unit, as a co-ordinated whole, thus expressingperfectly the will of the indwelling God. René Guénon, in his book Man and HisBecoming, makes the following interesting comments on the word “union,” whichhave a place here.“The realization of this identity is effected by Yoga , that is, the intimateand essential union of being with the Divine Principle, or, if preferred, withthe Universal. The proper meaning of this word Yoga is in fact ‘union’ andnothing else....It should be noted that this realization ought not strictly tobe regarded as an ‘achievement,’ or as ‘the production of a non-pre-existentresult,’ according to Shankarâchârya’s expression, for the union in question,although not actually realized in the sense in which we here [82] intend it,exists none the less potentially, or rather virtually; what is involved ismerely the effectual attainment by the individual being...of the consciousnessof that which truly is from all eternity.”Guénon, René, “Man and His Becoming”, p. 37.Through the ordered stages of the meditation process, a relationship isgradually and steadily established between the soul and its instruments untilthe time comes when they are literally one. Then the sheaths serve simply toreveal the light of the indwelling Son of God; the physical body is under directcontrol of the soul, for the illuminated mind transmits (as we shall see later)soul knowledge to the physical brain; the emotional nature is purified andsimply reflects the love nature of the soul, as the mind reflects the purposesof God. Thus, the hitherto disorganized and separative aspects of the humanbeing are synthesized and unified and brought into harmonious relation with eachother and with the soul, their creator, their source of energy, and theirmotivating power.This science of union involves the disciplining of the life, and an experimentalsystem of co-ordination. Its method is that of focussed attention, of mindcontrol, or of meditation, and is a mode of development whereby we effect unionwith the soul, and become aware of inner states of consciousness. This is summedup for us in the familiar words of Browning:“Truth is within ourselves; it takes no riseFrom outward things, whate’er you may believe. [83]There is an inmost centre in us all,Where truth abides in fulness; and aroundWall upon wall, the gross flesh hems it in,...and to knowRather consists in opening out a wayWhence the imprisoned splendor may escape,Than in effecting entry for a lightSupposed to be without.”Browning, Robert, “Paracelsus”.The whole object of the science of meditation is, therefore, to enable man tobecome in outer manifestation what he is in inner reality, and to make himidentify himself with his soul aspect and not simply his lower characteristics.It is a quick process for the unfolding of the reasoning consciousness, but inthis instance must be self-applied and self-initiated. Through meditation, themind is used as an instrument for observing the eternal states, and becomes intime an instrument for illumination, and through it the soul or Self transmitsknowledge to the physical brain.Finally, meditation brings about illumination. Meister Eckhart in his book ofSermons, written in the fourteenth century, says:“Three kinds of men see God. The first see him in faith; they know no more ofHim than they can make out through a partition. The second behold God in thelight of grace but only as the answer to their longings, as giving themsweetness, devotion, inwardness and other such-like things....The third see himin the divine light.”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, p. 191.[84] It is this light that the process of meditation reveals and with which welearn to work.The heart of the world is light and in that light shall we see God. In thatlight we find ourselves. In that light all things are revealed. Patanjali tellsus that “when the means to union have been steadily practised and when impurityhas been overcome, enlightenment takes place, leading up to full illumination.”“The mind then tends towards increasing illumination as to the true nature ofthe Self.” (Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, II., 27-28, IV., 26.)As a result of meditation comes the shining forth of the light. This“illumination is gradual and is developed stage by stage.” (Bailey, Alice A.,“The Light of the Soul”, III., 5-6.)This we shall take up in greater detail later on.Through meditation, as a consequence of all the preceding factors, the powers ofthe soul are unfolded. Each vehicle through which the soul expresses itselfcarries latent within itself certain inherent potencies, but the soul, which isthe source of them all, has them in their purest and most sublimated form. Thephysical eye, for instance, is the organ of physical vision. Clairvoyance is thesame potency demonstrating in what is regarded as the psychical world — theworld of illusion, of feeling and of emotion. But in the soul, this same powershows forth as pure perception, and infallible spiritual vision. The highercorrespondences of the lower physical and psychical powers are brought [85] intofunctioning activity through meditation, and so supersede their lowerexpressions.These powers unfold normally and naturally. This they do, not because they aredesired and consciously developed, but because as the inner God assumes controland dominates His bodies, His powers become apparent upon the physical plane andpotentialities will then demonstrate forth as known realities.The true mystic does not concern himself with the powers and faculties, but onlywith the Possessor of those powers. He concentrates upon the Self, and not uponthe potencies of that Self. As he merges himself more and more in the Realitywho is himself, the powers of the soul will begin to demonstrate normally,safely and usefully. The process is summed up for us by Meister Eckhart in thesewords:“The soul’s lower powers should be ordered to her higher and her higher ones toGod; her outward senses to her inward, and her inward ones to reason; thought tointuition and intuition to the will and all to unity....”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, p. 40.The words of Dr. Charles Whitby, the translator of Rene Guenon’s book, Man andHis Becoming , are pertinent to this chapter on the objectives of the meditationprocess. He refers to the“... overwhelming testimony to the mutually-confirmatory agreement, on allessential points, of the Western, Hindu, Moslem and Far-Eastern esoterictraditions. The Truth we so rashly term unattainable awaits us there in [86]unchanged and changeless majesty, veiled indeed from hasty and scornful eyes butever increasingly apparent to earnest unbiased seekers. According to Plotinus,the act of contemplation which essentially constitutes the life of everyindividual and that of mankind as a whole, ascends gradually and by a naturaland inevitable progression from Nature to Soul, from Soul to pure Intellect,from Intellect to the supreme ‘One’. If this be so, the present preoccupationwith psychic or quasi-psychic matters of the more advanced representative ofWestern thought and science, may or rather must sooner or later be succeeded byan equally serious attention to matters of higher and even of highest import.”Guénon, René, “Man and His Becoming”, p. X.Thus it will be seen that the claims made for meditation are very high, and theweight of the testimony of the mystics and initiates of all the ages can bebrought in corroboration of them. The fact that others have achieved mayencourage and interest us but does no more unless we ourselves take somedefinite action. That there is a technique and a science of union, based on theright handling of the mental body and its correct use may be profoundly true,but this knowledge serves no purpose unless each educated thinker faces theissue. He must decide upon the values involved and set himself to demonstratethe fact of the mind, its relation in the two directions (to the soul on the onehand and to the outer environment on the other) and finally his ability to usethat mind at will as he may choose. This involves the development of the mind asa synthesized, or common sense, and governs its use [87] in relation to theworld of the earthly life, of the emotions and of thought. It involves also itsorientation at will to the world of the soul, and its capacity to act as anintermediary between the soul and the physical brain. The first relation isdeveloped and fostered through sound methods of exoteric education and oftraining; the second is made possible through meditation, a higher form of theeducational process."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE - STAGES IN MEDITATION“What would you do within, O Soul, my Brother?What would you do within?Bar door and window that none may see:That alone we may be(Alone! face to faceIn that flame-lit place!)When first we beginTo speak one with another.”Evelyn Underhill[91] We have studied briefly the objectives which we set before ourselves as weseek to reorient the mind to the soul, and through the union thus effected,enter into communication with a higher world of Being. We are seeking to utilizethe equipment with which a long series of life experiments and experience hasendowed us, and whether we undertake the work from the standpoint of themystical devotee or the intellectual aspirant, there are certain basicrequirements which must precede any definite exercises. The words of the Rev. R.J. Campbell state succinctly our story and our task. He says:“For the purpose of realizing the nature of the Self, we have had to come outfrom our eternal home in God that we might strive and suffer amid the illusionsof time and sense. We have to overcome before we can enter into the eternaltruth that lies beyond all seeming. In that overcoming we have to master theflesh and magnify the spirit, despise the world to save it, and lose the life tofind it.”Now let us consider the situation and the processes to which we must subjectourselves if the goal is ever to be attained. The preliminary requirements needonly just be noted, for they are universally recognized and are met in part byevery beginner, or [92] he would not be entering upon this particular phase inthe age-long pursuit of truth. We are conscious within ourselves of duality, andof a state of warfare between the two aspects of which we are constituted. Weare conscious of a profound dissatisfaction with physical life as a whole, andwith our inability to grasp and understand the divine Reality which we hopeexists. But it remains for us a matter for faith, and we want certainty. Thelife of the senses does not seem to carry us far enough along the path towardsour goal. It is a fluid existence which we lead, being sometimes carried by ourhigh desires to a mountain top of wonder on which we stay just long enough toget a vision of beauty, and then are hurled into the abyss of our dailyenvironment, our animal nature and the chaotic world in which our destiny placesus. We sense a certainty which ever eludes us; we strive for a goal which seemsoutside ourselves and which evades our most frantic efforts; we struggle andfight and anguish to achieve a realization to which the saints have testifiedand to which the Knowers of the race bear continuous witness. If our will isstrong enough and our determination rooted in steadfast and undeterredperseverance, and if the ancient rules and formulas are grasped, we can approachour problem from a new angle and utilize our mental equipment in place ofemotional application and feverish desire.The heart activity has its place, however, and Patanjali in his well knownAphorisms , which have [93] guided the enterprise of hundreds of Knowers, saysthat:“The practices which make for union with the soul are first, fiery aspiration,then spiritual reading and, lastly, complete obedience to the Master.”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, II., 1, 2.The word “aspiration” comes from the Latin “ad” = “to”, and “spirare” = “tobreathe, to breathe towards,” as Webster puts it. The word “spirit” comes fromthe same root. Aspiration must precede inspiration. There must be a breathingout from the lower self before there can be a breathing in by the higher aspect.From the standpoint of eastern mysticism, aspiration involves the idea of fire.It denotes a burning desire, and a fiery determination which eventually doesthree things for the aspirant. It throws a fierce light upon his problems, andconstitutes the purificatory furnace into which the lower self has to go inorder that all dross may be burned out, and it also destroys all hindranceswhich might keep him back. This same idea of fire runs through all books onChristian mysticism, and many passages in the Bible of a similar nature willcome readily to mind. Willingness to “bear the cross,” to “enter the fire,” to“die daily,” (it matters not what the symbology employed may be), is thecharacteristic of the true aspirant, and, before we pass on to the way ofmeditation and place our footsteps in those of the myriads of sons of God whohave preceded us, we must gauge the depth and the [94] height and braceourselves for the arduous climb and the fierce endeavor. We must say with J. C.Earle:“I pass the vale. I breast the steep.I bear the cross: the cross bears me.Light leads me on to light. I weepFor joy at what I hope to seeWhen, scaled at length the arduous height,For every painful step I trod,I traverse worlds on worlds of lightAnd pierce some deeper depth of God.”Earle, John Charles, “Onward and Upward” (Oxford Book of English MysticalVerse), p. 508.We start with an emotional realization of our goal and from then pass on,through the fire of discipline, to the heights of intellectual certainty. Thisis beautifully pictured for us in the Bible in the story of Shadrach, Meschachand Abednego. We read that they were cast into the midst of the burning fieryfurnace, yet the result of that apparent tragedy was the releasing in theirmidst of the form of a fourth identity, whose appearance was like unto that ofthe Son of God. These three friends are symbols of the threefold lower man. Thename Meschach means “agile,” a faculty of the discriminative mind, the mentalbody. Shadrach means “rejoicing in the Way” and describes the transmutation ofthe emotional body, and the turning of the desire towards the Way: Abednegomeans “a servant of the Sun,” and thus emphasizes the fact that the solefunction of the physical body is to be the servant of the Son [95] (Sun), of theego or soul (see Daniel III, 23-24). There is no escaping the fiery furnace, butthe reward is commensurate with the trial.The significance of the second requirement, spiritual reading, must also begrasped. The word, to “read,” is very obscure in its origin, and philologistsseem to think that two words are responsible. One is the Latin word “reri,” tothink, and the other the Sanskrit word “radh,” to be successful. Perhaps bothideas are permissible, for it is certainly true that the man who can think themost successfully, and who can control and utilize his apparatus of thought, isthe man who can the most easily master the technique of meditation.Prayer is possible to all. Meditation is only possible to the mentally polarizedman, and this is a point which needs emphasis and which frequently meets withopposition when stated. All men who are willing to subject themselves todiscipline and transmute emotion into spiritual devotion can be saints, and manydo so subject themselves. But all men cannot yet be knowers , for it involvesall that the saint has achieved, plus the use of the intellect and the power tothink through to knowledge and understanding. The man who is successful is theman who can think, and who can utilize the sixth sense, the mind, to producecertain specific results. Other suggested origins have to do with words denotingthe taking of counsel or of advice, so that three basic ideas are brought out: —the attainment of success through the agency of the mind, the achievement of[96] perfection, the taking of counsel, and the utilization of all channels ofinformation in order to gain knowledge.This is fundamentally the meaning of Patanjali when he uses the expressiontranslated “spiritual reading.” It really signifies reading with the eyes of thesoul, with the inner vision alert to find out that which is sought. It isrealized that all forms are only symbols of an inner or spiritual reality, andspiritual reading involves the development of the faculty of “reading” or seeingthe life aspect which the outer form veils and hides. This will be found toapply equally to a human form as to any other form in nature; all forms veil adivine thought, idea, or truth and are the tangible manifestation of a divineconcept. When a man knows this he begins to read spiritually, to see below thesurface and so contact the idea which gave birth to the form. Gradually, as hegains practice in doing this, he arrives at a knowledge of Truth and is nolonger taken in by the illusory aspects of the form. This, in its most practicalapplication, will lead a man for instance, to negate the form aspect which hisfellowman may assume, and deal with him on the basis of the hidden divinereality. This is no easy thing to do, but it is possible through training inspiritual reading.The third requirement is obedience to the Master. This is no servile attentionto the commands of some supposed hidden Teacher, or Master, functioningmysteriously behind the scenes, as so many [97] schools of esotericism claim. Itis much simpler than that. The real Master, claiming our attention andsubsequent obedience, is the Master in the Heart, the soul, the indwellingChrist. This Master first makes His presence felt through the “still smallvoice” of conscience, prompting us to higher and more unselfish living, andsounding a quick note of warning when there is deviation from the strict path ofrectitude. Later this comes to be known as the Voice of the Silence, that wordthat comes from the “Word incarnate,” which is ourselves. Each of us is a Wordmade flesh. Later still, we call it the awakened intuition. The student ofmeditation learns to distinguish accurately between these three. Thisrequirement, therefore, calls for that implicit obedience which the aspirantrenders promptly to the highest impulse which he can register at all times andat any cost. When this obedience is forthcoming it calls forth from the soul adownpouring of light and knowledge, and Christ points this out in the words: “Ifany man shall do his will, he shall know...” (John 7, 17).These three factors — obedience, a search for truth in every form, and a fierylonging for liberation — are the three parts of the stage of aspiration and mustprecede that of meditation. They need not be expressed in their fullness andcompleteness, but must be incorporated in the life as working rules of conduct.They lead to detachment, a quality which is emphasized both in the East and inthe West. This is the freeing of the soul from the thralldom of the [98] formlife, and the subordination of the personality to the higher impulses. Dr.Maréchal expresses the Christian intention along these lines as follows:“This ‘detachment from self’, what does it mean?“First of all, clearly, it is detachment from the lower and sensible Ego — thatis, the habitual subordination of the fleshly to the spiritual point of view,the co-ordination of the lower multiplicity under a higher unity.“Again, it is detachment from the ‘vainglorious Ego,’ the dispersed andcapricious Ego, the plaything of external circumstances, the slave offluctuating opinion. The continuity of the inner life could not accommodateitself to so fluctuating a unity.“Above all, it is detachment from the ‘proud Ego.’ We must have a rightunderstanding of this, for humility is rightly considered as one of the mostcharacteristic notes of Christian asceticism and mysticism.”Maréchal, Joseph, S.J. “Studies in the Psychology of the Mystics”, p. 166.Here we have the subordination of the physical, emotional, and mental life tothe divine project of achieving unity, emphasized, for capriciousness is aquality of the sensory apparatus, and pride that of the mind.The meditation process is divided into five parts, one part leading sequentiallyto another. We will take these various stages and study each of them separately,for in their mastery we can trace the steady ascent of the conscious spiritualman out of the realm of feeling into that of knowledge and then of intuitiveillumination. These stages might be briefly enumerated as follows: [99]1. Concentration . This is the act of concentrating the mind, learning to focusit and so use it.2. Meditation . The prolonged focussing of the attention in any direction andthe steady holding of the mind on any desired idea.3. Contemplation . In activity of the soul, detached from the mind, which isheld in a state of quiescence.4. Illumination . This is the result of the three preceding processes, andinvolves the carrying down into the brain consciousness of the knowledgeachieved.5. Inspiration . The result of illumination, as it demonstrates in the life ofservice.These five stages, when followed, lead to union with the soul and directknowledge of divinity. For the majority of those who take up the study ofmeditation, the stage which should engross their attention for a long time —practically to the exclusion of the others — is that of concentration, thegaining control of the mental processes. Aspiration is presumably present tosome degree or there would be no desire to meditate. It should be pointed out,however, that aspiration avails nothing unless it is endorsed by a strong will,a capacity to endure, and patient persistence.I. The Stage of Concentration .In all schools of advanced or intellectual mysticism, the first and necessarystep is the attainment of mind control. Meister Eckhart, writing in thefourteenth century, tells us that!“St. Paul reminds us that we being planted in the likeness of God may attain tohigher and truer vision. For this [100] St. Dionysius says we require threethings. The first is, possession of one’s mind. The second is, a mind that isfree. The third is, a mind that can see. How can we acquire this speculativemind? By a habit of mental concentration.”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, pp. 196-197.This is in the strictest conformity with the eastern method, which aims first toput a man in control of his mental apparatus, so that he becomes the one whouses it at will and is not (as is so often the case) the victim of his mind,swayed by thoughts and ideas over which he has no control, and which he cannoteliminate, no matter how strong may be his desire to do so.The same ideas that Meister Eckhart expressed can also be found in that ancientIndian scripture, the Bhagavad Gita :“The mind wavers, Krishna, turbulent, impetuous, forceful; I think it is as hardto hold as the wind.“Without doubt...the wandering mind is hard to hold; but through assiduouspractice...it may be held firm.“When thy soul shall pass beyond the forest of delusion, thou shalt no moreregard what shall be taught or what has been taught.“When withdrawn from traditional teaching, thy soul shall stand steadfast, firmin soul vision, then thou shalt gain union with the soul.”“Bhagavad Gita”, VI., 34-35, II., 52-53.The first step, therefore, is mind control. This means the power to make themind do as you want, to think as you choose, to formulate ideas and sequences ofthought under direction. The function of [101] the mind, in the majority ofcases, is first of all to receive messages from the outer world, via the fivesenses, and transmitted by the brain. Hume tells us that the “mind is a kind oftheatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance.” It isthe seat of the intellectual functions, and a great recording centre forimpressions of all kinds, upon which we act, or to which we refuse admission ifwe do not like them. The mind has a tendency to accept what is presented to it.The ideas of the psychologists and of science as to the nature of the mind aretoo much to touch upon here. Some regard it as a separate entity; others as amechanism, of which the brain and the nervous system are integral parts. Oneschool deals with it as “a sort of superior, nonphysical structure...capable ofstrict scientific study and liable to its own disorders.” Some look upon it as aform of the self, with a life of its own; as a defense mechanism built up duringthe ages; as a response apparatus through which we contact aspects of theUniverse otherwise untouchable. To some, it is simply a vague term signifyingthat by which we register thought or respond to vibrations, such as thoseincorporated in public opinion and in the books written throughout the ages. Tothe esotericist, it is simply a word standing for an aspect of man which isresponsive in one direction — the outer world of thought and of affairs — butwhich could be equally responsive in another — the world of subtle energies andof spiritual being. This is the concept we shall hold in our thoughts as westudy [102] the technique of meditation. Dr. Lloyd Morgan sums it up for us insuch a way that all lesser definitions are included. He says:“...the word ‘mind’ may be used in three senses; first, as Mind or Spirit inreference to some Activity, for us God; secondly, as a quality emergent at ahigh level of evolutionary advance; and thirdly, as a psychical attribute thatpervades all natural events in universal correlation.”Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Emergent Evolution”, p. 37.Here we have the idea of the divine purpose, the universal mind, of that humanmentality which distinguishes man on the ladder of evolution from the animals,and reference also to that universal psychical consciousness which pervades theanimate and the so-called inanimate. It is with mind as a quality emerging at ahigh level of evolution that we as human beings deal. It is for us a mode ormeans of contact, receiving information from various sources, and by differentmeans. Through the five senses, information is conveyed, and the man becomesaware of the world of physical phenomena and of psychical life in which he isimmersed. Not only that, but the mind registers impressions emanating from otherminds, and the thoughts of men (both ancient and modern) are conveyed to himthrough the medium of leading and the spoken word, through the drama, throughpictures and through music. Most of it is simply registered and stored up,finding later expression as memory and anticipation. Moods, emotional reactions,feelings and desires, are also recorded [103] by the mind, whether of a highgrade or a low, but with the average person that is all that happens. Verylittle real thinking follows upon the registering of information, and no clearformulation of thoughts occurs. The clothing of ideas with words which clearlyexpress them is one of the functions of the mind, yet, how few people have ideasor originate really intelligent thoughts! Their minds respond to that which isconveyed to them from the outer world, but have no inherent or self-initiatedactivities of their own.Therefore, the process at present controlling in the case of the average man isfrom the outside world inwards, through the senses, to the brain. The brain then“telegraphs” the information registered to the mind, which, in its turn, recordsit. That usually closes the incident.But, in the case of the truly thoughtful, there is more than this. Upon therecording follows an analysis of the incident or the information, itscorrelation with other incidents, and a study of cause and effect. The“mind-stuff,” as the Oriental calls it, is swept into activity, andthought-forms are created and mental images built in connection with thepresented idea. Then, if desired, the clear thinking of the man is impressedupon the brain and so a return activity is instituted. But, in the case of themystic and of the man who is beginning to meditate, something further isdiscovered. He finds that the mind, when properly governed and disciplined, iscapable of wider and deeper responses; that it can become [104] aware of ideasand concepts which emanate from a deeply spiritual realm and which arecommunicated by the soul. Instead of impressions from the outer daily liferecorded on the sensitive receiving-plate of the mind, they may come forth fromthe kingdoms of the soul and are caused by the activity of a man’s own soul, orby other souls with whom his soul may be in touch.Then the mind enters upon a new and fresh usefulness and its range of contactincludes not only the world of men but also the world of souls. Its function isto act as an intermediary between the soul and the brain and to transmit to thebrain that of which the man, as a soul, has become aware. This becomes possiblewhen the old mental activities are superseded by the higher, and when the mindcan be rendered temporarily insensitive to all outer calls upon its attention.This, however, is not brought about by any methods of rendering the mind passiveand receptive, or by any system of “blanking” the mind, or stunning it intonegativity, or other forms of self-hypnotism. It is caused by the expulsiveforce of a new and bigger interest, and by the one-pointed attention of thefocussed mental faculties to a new world of phenomena and of force. This systemis that of concentration, the first and most arduous step towards theillumination of the life.The word “concentration” comes from the Latin words “con” = “together” and“centrare” = “to centre.” It means the “bringing together or the [105] drawingto a common centre or focal point;” it connotes the gathering together of ourwandering thoughts and ideas, and holding the mind firmly and steadily focussedor centred on the object of our immediate attention, without wavering ordistraction. It involves the elimination of all that is foreign or extraneous tothe matter under observation. Patanjali defines it thus: “The binding of theperceiving consciousness to a certain region is attention or concentration.”(Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, III., 1.)This necessarily involves a distinction between the Thinker, the apparatus ofthought, and that which is to be considered by the Thinker. We need, therefore,to distinguish between ourselves, the one who is thinking and that which are useto think with, the mind. Then there comes in the third factor, that which isthought.Students would do well at the very beginning of their meditation work to learnto make these basic differentiations, and to cultivate the habit every day ofmaking these distinctions. They must distinguish always between:1. The Thinker, the true Self, or the Soul.2. The mind, or the apparatus which the Thinker seeks to use.3. The process of thought, or the work of the Thinker as he impresses upon themind (when in a state of equilibrium) that which he thinks.4. The brain, which is in its turn impressed by the mind, acting as the agentfor the Thinker, in order to convey impressions and information.[106] Concentration is, therefore, the power to focus the consciousness on agiven subject and to hold it there as long as desired; it is the method ofaccurate perception, and the power to visualize correctly, being the qualitywhich enables the Thinker to perceive and know the field of perception. Anotherword for concentration is attention, that is, one-pointed attention. It isinteresting to note what Father Maréchal says in this connection. He points outthat “attention is a direct pat h to full perception, to hallucination, or, moregenerally, to belief....It brings about an at least momentary unification of themind by the predominance of one mental group....But this ‘mental unity,’realized to some degree in the phenomenon of attention, is also the solesubjective condition which, we have seen, accompanies always the true or falseperception of the real.” (Maréchal, Joseph, S.J. “Studies in the Psychology ofthe Mystics”, p. 90.)The question may be asked, what is the easiest way to teach oneself toconcentrate? One might reply, in the words of the French proverb: “Le meilleurmoyen de déplacer est de remplacer;” — “the best way to eliminate is tosubstitute,” and one way that may be employed is to utilize what has been calledthe “expulsive power of a new affection.” To be profoundly interested in somenew and intriguing subject, and to have one’s attention focussed on some freshand dynamic matter will automatically tend to make the mind one-pointed. [107]A second answer might be given: Be concentrated in all that you do all day everyday. Concentration will be rapidly developed if we cultivate the habit ofaccuracy in all the affairs of life. Accurate speech should necessitate accurateattention to that which is said, read or heard, and this would necessarilyinvolve concentration and so develop it. True meditation is after all anattitude of mind and will grow out of an attitude of concentration.The objective, therefore, of all our endeavor is to train the mind so as to makeit our servant and not our master, and to cultivate the power of concentrationpreparatory to true meditation work. The earnest student, therefore, will carrythis close attention into the affairs of everyday life and will thereby learn toregulate his mind as an apparatus for his thought.Let me emphasize here the necessity of a constantly concentrated attitude tolife. The secret of success can be expressed in the simple words: Pay attention.In talking to people, in reading a book, in writing a letter, let us steadilyfocus our thought on what we are doing and so gradually develop the capacity toconcentrate.To this cultivated attitude there must be added definite concentrationexercises, carried forward each day, with perseverance. This involves the fixingof the mind upon a particular object, or a chosen topic for thought. To thissucceeds a process of steadily and quietly learning to abstract theconsciousness [108] from the outer world and exoteric conditions and focus it atwill on any subject.The regular unremitting work of daily concentration gradually overcomes thedifficulty of control and brings about results which might be enumerated asfollows:1. The reorganization of the mind.2. The polarizing of the man in his mental, instead of his emotional vehicle.3. The withdrawal of the man’s attention from the sense perceptions and hislearning to centre himself in the brain. Most people, like the animals, use thesolar plexus.4. The development of a faculty of instantaneous concentration as a preliminaryto meditation.5. The capacity to focus the attention unswervingly upon any chosen seedthought.II. The Stage of Meditation.Patanjali defines concentration as the holding of the perceiving consciousnessin a certain region and meditation as the prolonged holding of the perceivingconsciousness in a certain region. This implies only a difference in the timefactor and would seem to make of both stages an achievement of control. Throughthe practice of concentration sufficient control should be achieved, so that thestudent is not bothered by the necessity of repeatedly recollecting his thought.Therefore, an act of prolonged concentration gives opportunity for the mind toact upon whatever object lies within the ring-pass-not of the region chosen. Thechoosing of a word or a phrase as the subject of the meditation establishes thisring-pass-not [109] and if the meditation is well conducted the mind neverleaves its consideration of the object so chosen. The mind remains focussed andis continuously active during the entire meditation period. Moreover, the mindis not allowed to do as it pleases with the object, or seed thought. Inconcentration there should be a consciousness in the meditator all the time thathe is using his mind. In meditation this consciousness of the mind being used islost, but there can be no day-dreaming and no following of chance ideas whichemerge in relation to the object of thought. The seed thought has been chosenfor a purpose, — either for its effect on the meditator or for its effect inservice upon some other person or in relation to some spiritual work, or in somephase of the search for wisdom. If the process is successful, there is evokedlittle or no reaction in the meditator, either of pleasure or absence ofpleasure. Emotional reactions are transcended and the mind is, therefore, leftfree to act in its own right. The result is a clarity of thought never beforeachieved, because the mind in ordinary activity is always associated with andaffected by desire of some sort. In this state of consciousness desire istranscended, just as later in the stage of contemplation, thought istranscended. When the mind is stunned into inaction by inhibition or persistentrepetitions, it cannot be transcended in contemplation, nor used in meditation.To practice making the mind blank, is not only foolish, but actually dangerous.[110] In The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali we find these words:“The gradual conquest of the mind’s tendency to flit from one object to anotherand the power of one-pointedness make the development of contemplation.”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, III., 11.Meditation is the result of experience. It is the instantaneous attainment of anattitude of mind as a consequence of long practice. In the Bhagavad Gita we findit is stated that in all action the five following factors are dependant:“1. The material instrument the brain 2. The doer the Self 3. The organ themind 4. The impulse energy 5. Destiny Karma”“Bhagavad Gita”, XVIII., 13-14Meditation is activity of a very intense kind and it will be found that allthese five factors are involved. The material instrument which we have to use inmeditation is the physical brain. Many people think that they must transcend thebrain, reach some tremendous altitude and stay upon some pinnacle of thoughtuntil something transcendent happens, and they can then say they know God. Whatis really needed is that we should get control of the mind and of the brainprocesses, so that the brain becomes a sensitive receiver of the thoughts anddesires of the soul, the Higher Self, as He transmits them through the medium ofthe mind. The mind is regarded as in [111] the nature of a sixth sense, and thebrain as a receiving plate. We are already utilizing the five senses as avenuesof perception, and they telegraph constant information to the brain. Throughtheir medium, information as to five vast fields of knowledge, or of five rangesof vibrations, is made available to man. It is intended that the mind shouldserve a similar purpose. This is summarized for us by Meister Eckhart, andembodies the position of all the mystics in both hemispheres:“First, see that thy outward senses are properly controlled....Now turn to theinward senses or noble powers of the soul, lower and higher. Take the lowerpowers first. These are intermediate between the higher powers and the outwardsenses. They are excited by the outward senses; what the eye sees, what the earhears, they offer forthwith to desire. This offers it again, in the ordinarycourse, to the second power, called judgment, which considers it and once morepasses it on to the third power, reckoning or reason....“A man, moreover, must have a mind at ease...the body should be rested frombodily labor, not only of the hands but of the tongue as well and all fivesenses. The soul keeps clear best in the quiet, but in jaded body is oftoverpowered by inertia. Then by strenuous effort we travail in divine love forintellectual vision, till, clearing a way through recollected senses, we risepast our own mind to the wonderful wisdom of God....Man rising to the summit ofhis mind is exalted God.”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, pp. 279, 47.Through the agency of the mind as a directed instrument, the soul can manipulatethe impulses or thought currents. These forces pour into the field of [112]experience of the Thinker and he must learn to direct them consciously and towork with them, so as to produce the desired result.The fifth factor reminds us that a certain stage of evolutionary developmentmust be reached before true meditation becomes possible; certain work must bedone and certain refinements in our instrument made, before a man can safely andwisely meditate. All men are not equipped to meditate with hope of completesuccess. This need in no way discourage any student. A beginning can always bemade and a sound foundation laid. The control of the mental processes can bebegun, and brought to a high point of achievement, making it possible for thesoul to have an apparatus of thought ready to its use. Reacting to the threeparts of the meditation, but reacting in a unified manner the physical or formnature has been studied, the quality animating it and the motive or cause of themanifestation of the form has been considered. At the same time there has beenan ever deeper concentration, and a more intense meditation. The attention hassunk inward increasingly, and outer things have been steadily negated; this hasnot been accomplished through a passive attitude, but through one of a most keenand vital interest. The meditation has been positive in its method and has notled to a negative or trance condition. The mind has been busy all the time, butbusy in one direction.Finally, there comes the stage which is called [113] bliss, or identification.The consciousness is no longer focussed in the intellect but becomes identifiedwith the object of the meditation work. This we will consider later.We have, therefore, the four stages briefly summarized as follows andconstituting what is called “meditation with seed:”1. Meditation on the nature of a particular form.2. Meditation upon the quality of a particular form.3. Meditation upon the purpose of a particular form.4. Meditation upon the life animating a particular form.All forms are symbols of an indwelling life, and it is through meditation withseed that we arrive at the life aspect.In A Treatise on Cosmic Fire the following words occur:“The wise student regards all forms of expression as in the nature of symbols. Asymbol has three interpretations; it is itself the expression of an idea, andthat idea has behind it, in its turn, a purpose or impulse inconceivable as yet.The three interpretations of a symbol might be dealt with as follows:“1. The exoteric interpretation of a symbol is based largely upon its objectiveutility, and upon the nature of the form. That which is exoteric and substantialserves two purposes: [114]“a . To give some faint indications as to the idea and concept. This links thesymbol...with the mental plane, but does not release it from the three worlds ofhuman appreciation.“b . To limit and confine and imprison the idea and so adapt it to the point inevolution which the man has reached. The true nature of the latent idea is evermore potent and complete than the form or symbol through which it seeksexpression. Matter is a symbol of a central energy. Forms of all kinds in allthe kingdoms of nature, and the manifested sheaths in their widest connotationand totality are but symbols of life — what that Life itself may be remains asyet a mystery.“2. The subjective interpretation or meaning is the one which reveals the idealying behind the objective manifestation. This idea, incorporeal in itself,becomes a concretion on the plane of objectivity....These ideas become apparentto the student after he has entered into Meditation, just as the exoteric formof the symbol is all that is seen by the man who is just beginning. As soon as aman begins consciously to use his mental apparatus and has made even a smallcontact with his soul three things occur:“a . He reaches out beyond the form and seeks to account for it.“b . He arrives in time at the soul which the [115] form veils, and this he doesthrough the understanding of his own soul.“c . He begins then to formulate ideas and to create and make manifest thatsoul-energy or substance which he finds he can manipulate.“To train people to work in mental matter is to train them to create; to teachpeople to know the nature of the soul is to put them in conscious touch with thesubjective side of manifestation and to put into their hands the power to workwith soul-energy; to enable people to unfold the potencies of the soul aspect isto put them en rapport with the forces and energies hidden in all the kingdomsof Nature.“A man can then — as his soul contact and his subjective perception isstrengthened and developed — become a conscious creator, co-operating with theplans of evolution and of God. As he passes through the different stages, hisability so to work and his capacity to get at the thought lying behind allsymbols and forms increases. He is no longer taken in by the appearance butknows it as the illusory form which is veiling, imprisoning and confining somethought.“3. The spiritual meaning is that which lies behind the subjective sense andwhich is veiled by the idea or thought just as the idea is veiled by the form itassumes when in exoteric manifestation. This can be regarded as the purposewhich prompted the idea and led to its emanation into the world of forms. It isthe central [116] dynamic energy which is responsible for the subjectiveactivity....”Bailey, Alice A., “A Treatise on Cosmic Fire”, pp. 1233 et seq.It is this process of arriving at the reality behind each and every form whichis the result of meditation with seed. It involves the realization of thesethree aspects of the divine Life. This is why students are advised to take somespecific words or a verse from some sacred book for their meditation so as totrain them in their power to get behind the form of the words and so to arriveat the true meaning.We have penetrated into the world of causes; we have to seek to apprehend thePlan as it exists in the mind of God and as it expresses itself through thelove, emanating from the Heart of God. Is it possible for human minds to reachany further than the love and will of God? Right at this point, Divinity iscontacted. The mind ceases to function, and the true student of meditation slipsinto a state of conscious identification with that spiritual reality we call theindwelling Christ, the divine Soul. Man, at this point, enters into God."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX - STAGES IN MEDITATION (CONTINUED)Milarepa was one who eventually rid himself of the Two-Fold Shadow and soaredinto Spiritual Space, till he attained the Goal wherein all doctrines merge inat-one-ment....Having all his ideas and concepts merged with the Primal Cause(he) had eliminated the Illusion of Duality.Rechung (from the Tibetan)[119] We have carried our meditation work forward along what might be termedsecular lines, for the use of the mind has been involved, and though the subjectof the meditation process has presumably been religious, yet the same resultscan be equally well reached with a purely worldly theme as the “object” or “seedthought.” The educating of the mind to hold itself attentively upon a chosenidea has been the aim. We have, therefore, been dealing with what mightlegitimately be called a part of the educational process.It is at this point that the divergence of our eastern and western methodsbecomes apparent. One school teaches its students to gain control of theinstrument of thought before anything else is done, to discover the existence ofthis instrument through primary failure in control, and then, throughconcentration and meditation, to achieve facility in forcing the mind to beone-pointed in any direction. The other school posits the possession ofsomething that is called the mind, and proceeds then to fill it withinformation, and to train the memory aspect to be retentive, and the content ofthat memory to be easily available to the student. From this stage a [120]relatively few in number pass on to a real use of the mind through a profoundinterest in some science or some way of living, but the majority never attainmind control. Educational methods as we now have them do not teach theirstudents this preliminary technique, and, hence, the wide confusion as to thenature of the mind and as to the distinction between the mind and the brain.If the brain and the brain cells are all that there is, then the position of thematerialistic thinker, that thought is entirely dependent upon the quality ofthe brain cells, is logical and correct. The part that the brain plays in theprocess is ably put for us in Ludwig Fischer’s book, The Structure of Thought :“The perfection of processes of apprehension depends in the main on thestructure and functioning of a certain organ which receives and connects thedifferent impressions of the senses, and which, further, partly retains thetraces of previous impressions and allows them indirectly to enter into action.This organ is the brain with its ramifications and subsidiary organs. Theperfection of the structure and of the functioning of this organ determines theperfection with which we can succeed in a deliberate attempt at producing arepresentation of the complex of the Whole, using the specific forms of sensualperception which are at our command....“The brain allows us to have an intuition and an intellectual apprehension ofthe world in its complexity. The manner in which this is brought about dependson the exceedingly complicated internal structure of this organ, and on itsreciprocal relation to the other parts of the Whole, a relation which has manygradations.”Fischer, Ludwig, “The Structure of Thought”, p. 135.[121] If perception and sensuous apprehension, with their consequentrationalizings and the institution of a subsequent mental process, have theirsource in the brain, then Dr. Sellars is right in his book, EvolutionaryNaturalism , when he says that mind can be regarded as a “physical category” andthat “we should mean by it the nervous processes which find expression inintelligent conduct.” (Sellars, Dr. Roy Wood, “Evolutionary Naturalism”, p. 300)But this idea fails to satisfy the majority of thinkers and most of them —belonging to other schools than the purely materialistic — posit something morethan matter, and regard the mind as distinct from the brain; they hold thehypothesis that it is a subjective substantial reality, which can use the brainas its terminal of expression and which it can impress in order to express thoseconcepts and intuitions which a man can consciously utilize. What we areconsidering is in no wise a supernormal faculty, or the possession of aspecialized instrument by a gifted few; the mind should be used by all educatedpeople, and at the close of the educational process (carried on in the formativeyears) a man should be in possession of a faculty that he understands and usesat will. Dr. McDougall points out in Psychology, the Science of Behavior thatour mental activity (which is usually unconscious) can be either subnormal,normal or supernormal. (McDougall. William, “Psychology, the Science ofBehavior”.) In the first case, you will have the idiot or the feeble-minded; inthe second, you will have the intelligent average citizen [122] whose mind is atheatre or rather a cinematograph, registering anything that happens to comealong; and, finally, we shall discover those rare souls whose consciousness isilluminated and whose minds record that which is hidden to the majority. Withthis last class we have as yet nothing to do. They are the product of the finalstages of the meditation work, — contemplation and illumination. Concentrationand meditation have definite reference to the many and to the normal.In the East, and by many in the West, the mind is regarded as separate anddistinct from the brain. Dr. C. Lloyd Morgan in Emergent Evolution quotesDescartes as saying that “there are indeed (1) corporeal substance (res extensa), and (2) mental or thinking substance (res cogitans ); but they need for theirbeing the concurrence of God....Apart from this common dependence on God neitheris dependent on the other.” (Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Emergent Evolution”, p. 291). Hesums up his own point of view in another book, Life, Mind, and Spirit , asfollows:“Spirit is nowise separable from life and mind, nor they from it. What is givenfor reflective contemplation is a world-plan of natural events. I hold that thisworld-plan is a manifestation of Divine Purpose....We too are manifestations ofSpirit which is ‘revealed’ within us. Each of us is a life, a mind, and Spirit —an instance of life as one expression of the world-plan, of mind as a differentexpression of that world-plan, of Spirit in so far as the Substance of thatworld-plan is revealed within us....This revelation is only partial since eachof us is only an individual [123 ] instance of that which in full manifestationis universal.”Morgan, C. Lloyd, “Life, Mind, and Spirit”, p. 32.God reveals His purpose through the activity of the form. He does the samethrough the activity of the mind which impresses in its turn the brain, attunedto receptivity. Later again, the mind becomes responsive to an illumination,emanating from the Spirit aspect, and this we will shortly consider. Thisapproaches very close to the Oriental position which infers a “mind-stuff” whichis thrown into activity from the outer world of human affairs by the agency ofthe senses, by the emotions and by other minds. This intense activity of themind-stuff has to be definitely offset through concentration and meditation ifthe mind is to be brought into a condition wherein it can be refocussed andreoriented to another field of perception and another range of ideas. For theesotericists, therefore, the objective of the meditation (carried forward intoits later stages) is that the mind should cease to register any form activitywhatsoever, no matter of how high an order, but should begin to registerimpressions emanating from that steadily manifesting Factor which we call (forlack of a better term) the Mind of God, the Universal Mind. This mind isdistinguished by a sense of Wholeness, and of synthesis.The entire history of evolving humanity might be considered from the angle ofthis Plan concept, and the focus of interest might be noted to be that of agrowing consciousness in man of a Universe which [124] is a revelation of a Lifeand of Deity, and in which mankind plays its part in the greater Whole. LudwigFischer calls our attention to the fact that all our faculties “are founded onthe mysterious and unconscious something which dominates the whole of ourintellectual life,” and points out the necessity for what he calls thenon-rational element in the answers which we give to the complex questions ofevery day. His conclusions as to the basic situation which man has to face inconnection with thought and our progress into higher and non-rational realms aretrue and forceful. He says:“One way of advancing only is possible. The way is led by the intuition of mindsof a more than average instinctive sensitiveness; analytical reason follows,consolidating the position and making practicable the road for the rest ofmankind. The advance into the unknown begins with a hypothesis, and a hypothesisis nothing but a more or less non-rational structure, obtained intuitively. Onceit has been set up, it is compared in all its implications with experience, sothat, if possible, the hypothesis can be tested and rationalized.”Fischer, Ludwig, “The Structure of Thought”, p. 361.We have reached the stage in our study of the process of mind control when aremust proceed upon hypothesis. Yet, primarily, it will be hypothesis only to thematerially-minded, for the conclusions reached and the realm of knowledgeentered are recorded as truth and proven fact by many thousands down the ages.We have outlined a method, old and tried, whereby it is claimed the mind can begrasped and used at [125] will, and we have pointed out a way in which thefactors which have hitherto engrossed its attention can be negated and a newfield of awareness become possible. Before carrying the instructions forward, itmight be of value if we defined the hypothesis upon which we will now proceed.It might be expressed as follows:There is a kingdom of the soul, called often the kingdom of God, which is inreality another kingdom in nature, a fifth kingdom. Entry into that kingdom isas much a natural process as has been the transit of the evolving life from anykingdom in nature to another in the process of evolution. When the senses, andall that they convey, are focussed into that “common-sense,” which was the namethat mystics such as Meister Eckhart gave to the mind, they enrich that mind andopen up to it many states of awareness. When these activities can be negated andthe rich and sensitive mind can be refocussed in its turn, it becomes asensitive apparatus (a sixth sense, if you like) which registers “the things ofthe kingdom of God” and opens up, to the man in deep meditation, states ofconsciousness and ranges of knowledge which have hitherto been sealed to him butwhich are just as much a part of the Whole and of the world content as any otherfield of investigation. This is our hypothesis and upon it we will proceed.Instinctual awareness has given place in man to intellectual knowledge. Is itnot possible that this intellectual perception may, in its turn, be transcendedand superceded by intuitional awareness?[126] Certain propositions seem necessary at this point in our argument and maybe of value in elucidating the theme of this book: They are three in number.First: In the long evolutionary process which has led man from the animal stageto that of the human being, we find that we have now arrived at the phase inwhich he is self conscious, or self-referring. He stands at the centre of hisown world, and the universe revolves around him. All that occurs has referenceto him and to his affairs, and to the effect of life and circumstance upon himas the important factor.Second: As man grows in knowledge and in intellectual awareness, the brain andthe mind become coordinated. The former becomes simply the tool or instrument ofthe trained instincts and of the controlled mind. This mind draws on what hasbeen called “the content of the subconscious,” on the active memory, and on theenvironment, for what is needed to carry forward the process of living in anexigent world. Man becomes an efficient and useful human being, and takes hisplace as a conscious cell in the body of humanity. He is beginning to get somerealization of group relations. But more remains.Third: From the earliest stage of human existence up to that of the high gradeco-ordinated functioning man, there has always been present a consciousness ofsomething Other, of a factor lying beyond known human experience, of a goal orquest, of a Deity. This subtle and indefinable awareness [127] emergesinevitably and keeps man pushing forward, and seeking for that which neither themind (as he knows it) nor his circumstances and environment seem able to give.This can be called the search for certainty, an endeavor after the mysticexperience, or the religious impulse. But no matter by what name we call it, itis unfailingly present.These three propositions roughly outline the way that man, in his consciousness,has travelled. They portray the condition in which we find a vast number ofhuman beings at this time — efficient, intellectual, well-informed, responsible,but at the same time, dissatisfied. They look with questioning into the futureor face the inevitability of death; they are anxious to go forward into a widerconsciousness and into a certainty as to spiritual things and as to the ultimateReality. This urge to a wider understanding and knowledge is being demonstratedon a large scale at this time, and the sequence of the evolutionary growth,already established, is apparently persisting and must do so if another kingdomor state of consciousness is to be added to those already achieved.It is at this point that all the great world religions offer to man a way ofknowledge and a process of unfoldment which can and does hasten the work ofdevelopment. Dr. Otto in The Idea of the Holy says that man “must be guided andled on by consideration and discussion of the matter through the ways of his ownmind, until he reach the point at which [128] the ‘numinous’ in him perforcebegins to stir, to start into life and into consciousness.” (Otto, Rudolf, “TheIdea of the Holy”, p. 7)The word “numinous,” we are told, comes from the Latin numen , meaningsupernatural divine power. It stands for “the specific non-rational religiousapprehension and its object, at all its levels, from the first dim stirringswhere religion can hardly yet be said to exist to the most exalted forms ofspiritual experience.” (Otto, Rudolf, “The Idea of the Holy”, p. XVII ofTranslator’s Preface).His translator, Dr. Harvey, Professor of Philosophy at Armstrong College, addsthat there develops in man a “growing awareness of an object, deity...aresponse, so to speak, to the impact upon the human mind of ‘the divine’, as itreveals itself whether obscurely or clearly. The primary fact is theconfrontation of the human mind with a Something, whose character is onlygradually learned, but which is from the first felt as a transcendent presence,‘the beyond’, even where it is also felt as ‘the within’ man.” (Otto, Rudolf,“The Idea of the Holy”, p. XV of Translator’s Preface.)Through attention to life purpose, through concentration on life work, throughkeen interest in the sciences which engage the attention of our best minds, andthrough meditation, as practised by a few in the religious field, many havearrived at a point where two things happen: the idea of the holy, of Being andof relationship to that Being enter in as dominating factors in the life.Secondly, the mind [129] begins to demonstrate a new activity. Instead ofregistering and storing up in memory the contacts which the senses havecommunicated, and absorbing that information which is the common heritage of theday through books and the spoken word, it reorients itself to new knowledge andbegins to tap new sources of information. Instinct and intellect have done theirwork; now the intuition begins to play its part.It is to this point that the meditation work we have been considering hasbrought us and for which the education of the memory and the cataloguing ofworld knowledge has prepared us. They have had their day. For many thousands,therefore, a new endeavor is in order. Is it perhaps possible that for thosesouls now being born into world experience, the old education with its memorytraining, its books and lectures and its appropriation of so-called facts hasbecome insufficient? For them we must either formulate a new method, or modifythe present technique and so find time for the process of mind reorientationwhich will enable a man to be aware of more fields of knowledge than he nowcontacts. Thus we shall demonstrate the truth of the words of Mr. Chaplin in hisvaluable little book The Soul , that “...it is through Soul that bodilyprocesses attain their significance.” (Chaplin, F. K.., “The Soul”, p. 63).The conquest of the kingdom of the soul looms before man. The day when the wordPsychology will return to its original meaning is at hand. Education [130] willthen have two functions. It will fit man to handle his worldly contacts with thegreatest efficiency and use intelligently that apparatus which the Behavioristshave done so much to explain, and it will also initiate him into the realm towhich the mystics have always testified and to which the mind — rightly used —holds the key.In the preceding chapter the method was dealt with through which a man couldbegin to be master of his instrument, the mind, and learn so to focus histhought upon a chosen theme or idea that he could close out all outer conceptsand shut the door entirely on the phenomenal world. We shall consider the mannerhow he could carry his focussed thought higher and higher (to use the languageof the mystic) until mind itself failed, and he found himself on a peak ofthought from which a new world could be visioned. In the meditation process upto this stage there has been an intense activity, and no condition ofquiescence, of negativity, or of passive receptivity. The physical body has beenforgotten and the brain held in a state of positive receptiveness, ready to beswept into action by the mind when it again turns its attention downwards. Wemust remember that in using all such words as “upwards” and “downwards,”“higher” and “lower,” we are talking symbolically. One of the first things amystic learns is that dimensions do not exist in consciousness, and that the“within” and “without,” the “higher” and the “lower” are only figures of [131]speech, by which certain ideas are conveyed as to realized conditions ofawareness.The point that we now have reached brings us to the verge of the transcendental.We proceed upon hypothesis. The tangible and the objective are temporarilyforgotten and no longer engross the attention, nor is any form of sensation theaim. All manner of feeling must be, for the time, shut off. Petty annoyances andthe like, along with sorrow, will be forgotten, and likewise joy, for we are notseeking the “consolations of religion.” The attention is focussed in the mindand the only reactions recorded are mental. Thought has dominated theconsciousness during the stage of “meditation with seed” or with an object, butnow even this has to go. As one mystical writer puts it: “How shall I put mindout of mind?” For as my objective is neither sensation nor feeling, neither isit thought. Here lies the greatest obstacle to the intuition and the state ofillumination. No longer is the attempt to hold anything in the mind to beprolonged, nor is there anything to be thought out. Ratiocination must be leftaside, and the exercise of a higher and hitherto probably unused faculty musttake its place. The seed thought has attracted our attention, and awakened ourinterest, and this has sustained itself into the phase of concentration. Thisagain prolongs itself into contemplation, and the result of the latter isillumination. Here we have a brief summation of the entire process — Attraction,Interest, [132] Concentrated Attention and prolonged one-pointed Reflection orMeditation.What have been the results of the meditation process up to this point? Theymight be enumerated as follows :1. The reorganizing of the mind and its reorientation.2. The centering of a man’s attention in the world of thought, instead of on theworld of feeling, and hence the withdrawal of the focus of attraction from thesenses.3. The development of a faculty of instantaneous concentration as a preliminaryto meditation, and the capacity to focus the mind unswervingly upon any chosensubject. Evelyn Underhill defines this faculty as follows:“The act of perfect concentration, the passionate focussing of the self upon theone point, when it is applied in ‘the unity of the spirit and the bonds of love’to real and transcendental things, constitutes in the technical language ofmysticism the state of meditation or recollection, and...is the necessaryprelude of pure contemplation.”Underhill, Evelyn, “Mysticism”, p. 58.III. The Stage of ContemplationWe are entering a realm of realization now which is much handicapped by twothings: the use of words, which only serve to limit and distort, and thewritings of the mystics themselves which — while they are full of wonder and oftruth — are colored by the symbolism of their race and age, and by the [133]quality of feeling and emotion. The mystics, as a general rule, drift to and frobetween moments of high illumination or of vision, and “the misty flats” ofintense feeling and longing. They are either undergoing the joy and ecstasy ofrealization that lasts but a fleeting moment, or the agony of desire for thecontinuation of the experience. There seems (in the majority of cases) no senseof security or certainty of repetition, and only a longing for the attainment ofsuch a state of holiness that the condition could be continuously present. Inthe ancient technique and the orderly meditation with which the East has latelydowered us, it seems possible that through knowledge of the way and throughunderstanding of the process, the mystical experience may itself be transcended,and knowledge of divine things, and identification with the indwelling Deity maybe brought about at will . The race now has the necessary mental equipment andcan add to the way of the mystic that of the conscious intellect.But between the stage of prolonged concentration, which we call meditation, andthat of contemplation, which is of an entirely different category, there comes atransition period, which the Oriental student calls “meditation without seed,”or, “without an object.” It is not contemplation. It is not a process ofthought. That is past, while the later stage is not yet achieved. It is a periodof mind steadiness, and of waiting. Fr. Nouet describes this perhaps as well asanyone in the following words:[134] “When the man of prayer has made considerable progress in meditation, hepasses insensibly to affective prayer, which, being between meditation andcontemplation, as the dawn is between the night and the day, possesses somethingboth of the one and of the other. In its beginnings it contains more ofmeditation, because it still makes use of reasoning ;...because having acquiredmuch light by the prolonged use of considerations and reasonings, it enters atonce into its subject, and sees all its developments without much difficulty....Hence it follows as it perfects itself it discards reasonings....”Nouet, Fr., “Conduite de l’Homme d’Oraison”, Book IV, ch. 1.The versatility of the rapidly moving and sensitively responsive mentalsubstance can be brought, we have seen, into a stabilized condition, throughprolonged meditation. This brings about a state of mind which renders thethinker unresponsive to vibrations and contacts coming from the outer phenomenalworld and from the world of the emotions, and so renders passive the sensoryapparatus, the brain and that vast inter-locking network which we call thenervous system. The world in which man usually functions is shut off, yet hepreserves at the same time an intense mental attention and a one-pointedorientation to the new world in which that which we call the soul lives andmoves. The true student of meditation learns to be wide awake mentally, andpotently aware of phenomena, vibration and states of being. He is positive,active and self-reliant, and the brain and the focussed mind are closelycoordinated. He is no impractical dreamer, yet the [135] world of practical andphysical affairs is temporarily negated.If the student is not naturally of the positive mental type, some serious,persistent, intellectual training (designed to create mental alertness andpolarization) should be taken up along with the practice of meditation,otherwise the process will degenerate into an emotional revery, or a negativeblankness. Both conditions carry with them their own dangers, and, if prolonged,will tend to make a man an impractical person, impotent and inefficient in dailyaffairs. His life will become less and less useful to himself or to others. Hewill find himself dwelling more and more in uncontrolled irrational fancies, andemotional fluctuations. In such a soil the seeds of egoism easily sprout, andpsychism flourishes.The mind, therefore, positive, alert and well-controlled, is carried forward onthe wings of thought and then held steady at the highest attainable point. Acondition is then brought about in the mind which is analogous to one which hasalready taken place in the brain. It is held in a waiting attitude, whilst theconsciousness of the thinker shifts into a new state of awareness and he becomesidentified with the true inner and spiritual man. What is technically called the“perceiving consciousness” waits.These two stages of meditation, one of intense activity and the other of anintense waiting, have been called the Martha and Mary states, and the idea,through this metaphor, becomes somewhat clearer. It is a period of silencewhilst something inner [136] transpires, and is perhaps the hardest part of thetechnique to master. It is so easy to slip back into the intellectual activitywhich ordinary meditation connotes, for one has not yet learnt to contemplate.Dr. Bennett describes this stage in some comments upon Ruysbroeck. He says:“Ruysbroeck here distinguishes two marks of ‘true’ passivity: first, it is‘actively sought,’ that is, a certain effort is necessary to maintain it.Second, it differs from any natural or automatic type of relief by the moralpreparation which precedes it....This enforced waiting, this self-imposedreceptivity, which is the defining mark of the stage of contemplation, is notthe end of the mystic’s career. It is the end of his efforts, in the sense thathe can do no more, but it is destined to give way to the stage of ecstasy whenmatters are taken out of the hand of the individual and he becomes the vehicleof a power greater than himself. ‘Remain steadfastly in thyself until thou artdrawn out of thyself without any act of thine’.”Bennett, Charles A., “A Philosophical Study of Mysticism”, p. 62.He speaks later on in the same chapter of the breathless attention, thehard-earned and hard-held waiting for the divine revelation. The ancient sage ofIndia, Patanjali, tells us the same thing, when he says that, when “themind-stuff becomes absorbed in that which is the Reality (or the idea embodiedin the form) and is unaware of separateness or of the personal self,” thisbrings him to the stage of contemplation and he enters into the consciousness ofthe soul. He discovers that all the time it has been the soul which has luredhim on into union with itself. How? Another Hindu teacher tells us that [137]“the soul has the means. Thinking is the means. When thinking has completed itstask of release, it has done what it had to do and ceases.” (“The VishnuPurana”, VI., 7, 90.)In contemplation, a higher agent enters in. It is the Soul that contemplates.The human consciousness ceases its activity and the man becomes what he is inreality — a soul, a fragment of divinity, conscious of its essential onenesswith Deity. The Higher Self becomes active, and the lower or personal self isentirely quiescent and still, whilst the true spiritual Entity enters into itsown kingdom and registers the contacts that emanate from that spiritual realm ofphenomena.The world of the soul is seen as a reality; the transcendental things are knownto be facts in nature; union with Deity is realized as constituting as much afact in the natural process as is the union between the life of the physicalbody and that body.The man’s consciousness, therefore, is no longer focussed in that waiting mind,but has slipped over the borderland into the realm of spirit and he becomesliterally the soul, functioning in its own realm, perceiving the “things of theKingdom of God,” able to ascertain truth at first hand, and aware in full wakingconsciousness of its own nature, prerogatives and laws. Whilst the truespiritual man is thus active in his own nature and in his own world, the mindand brain are held steady and positive, oriented to the soul, and according tothe facility with [138] which this is done will be the capacity of both toregister and record that which the soul is perceiving.In meditation we endeavor to receive impressions from the inner God, the HigherSelf, direct to the physical brain, via the mind. In contemplation a stillhigher stage is entered upon and we endeavor to receive into the physical brainthat which the soul itself perceives as It looks outward upon those new fieldsof perception.In the average man, the soul is occupied (as the Perceiver) with the threeworlds of human endeavor, and looks out, therefore, upon the physical, emotionaland mental states of being. The soul identifies Itself for aeons with the formsthrough which contact has to be made if those lower states of consciousness areto be known. Later, when a man has gained control of the mind and can offer itto the soul as a transmitting agent, then a vast region of spiritual awarenesscan unfold itself. The soul itself can then become a transmitting agent, and canpass on, via the mind and from thence to the physical brain, some of therealizations and concepts of the Spirit aspect. Students would do well toremember the words in The Secret Doctrine .“Matter is the Vehicle for the manifestation of Soul on this plane of existence,and Soul is the Vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation of Spirit, andthese three are a Trinity synthesized by Life, which pervades them all.”Blavatsky, H. P., “The Secret Doctrine”, Vol. I, p. 80.This, in the academic language of occultism, is the realization of the mystic.Cardinal Richelieu [139] calls contemplation that state “in which man sees andknows God without using the imagination and without discursive reasoning,” andTauler expresses it thus:“God desires to dwell in the superior faculties — the memory, the intellect, andthe will, and to operate in these after a divine manner. This is His true abode,His field of action; it is there that He finds His likeness. It is there that wemust seek Him if we desire to find Him and by the shortest way. Then the spiritis transported high above all the faculties into a void of immense solitudewhereof no mortal can adequately speak....When, afterwards, these persons cometo themselves again, they find themselves possessed of a distinct knowledge ofthings, more luminous and more perfect than that of others.”Quoted by Poulin, R. P., S.J., “Graces of Interior Prayer”, p. 272Contemplation has been described, as a psychic gateway, leading from one stateof consciousness to another. Jeremy Taylor calls it the “transition from intensemeditation to that contemplation which attains to the vision of the wonders ofGod, as the human soul enters the realm of the divine light.” (Puglisi, Mario,“Prayer”, p. 181. ) Francois Malaval, who lived and wrote in the 17th centuryputs it most beautifully. He says:“This act (contemplation) is also more perfect than reasoning because inreasoning the soul speaks, whilst in this act it enjoys. Reasoning...convincesthe soul by its principles, but here the soul is rather illumined thanconvinced, it sees rather than examines. Reasoning occupies itself in theconsideration of a word, a proposition, or a discourse; but this simple sight ofGod, supposing all [140] reasonings as things passed and known, contemplates itsobject in God Himself....”Malaval, F., “A Simple Method of Raising the Soul to Contemplation”, p. 102.Through this gateway of vision the man passes and finds himself to be the soul.From the vantage of the soul, he realizes himself to be the Perceiver, who canperceive equally the world of spiritual realities and the world of dailyexperience; he can look, if he so chooses, in either direction.The problem is to acquire an equal facility in the work of perception onspiritual levels as we have learned on worldly levels, and one of the importantpoints to remember is that in both cases the triplicity of soul, mind, and brainmust play their part, but with a differing orientation and attention. It becomessimply a question of focus. The brain is active in practically a subconsciousmanner towards the instincts and habits which guide our physical plane life andappetites. Through right education, it learns to be receptive towardsimpressions emanating from the mind, and instead of being only a sensoryregister or recorder, it learns to respond to thought impressions. The mind inits turn has an instinctive tendency to record all outer information, but can betrained to be receptive towards the soul, and to register information comingfrom that higher source. In time we can acquire facility and practice inutilizing either brain or mind actively or passively, and eventually bringingabout a perfect interplay between them and finally between the soul, the mind[141] and the brain. We can sum up all that has happened during the three stageswe have considered in the words of Patanjali —“The gradual conquest of the mind’s tendency to flit from one object to another(that is, concentration) and the power of one-pointedness (that is, meditation)make the development of contemplation.”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, III., 11.and when these three are simultaneously performed we are told that “thisthreefold power of attention, meditation and contemplation is more interior thanall means of growth previous described.” It is interesting to note that Malavalin his second Treatise, Dialogue III, makes the same point, linking faith,meditation and contemplation together as a synthetic act. The knowers in boththe East and the West think alike.Contemplation has been also defined by Evelyn Underhill in her most useful book,Mysticism, as the “lull between two activities.” During this lull a new methodof knowing and of being is instituted. This is perhaps one of the simplest andthe most practical ways of understanding contemplation. It is the interludewherein the soul is active . This soul activity is preceded by what we mightcall an upward activity. The physical brain has been quieted and held steady;the feeling or sensory apparatus has also been stilled and is no longerpermitted to register information from its usual field of awareness; the mindhas been focussed and held actively passive in the light which streams from thekingdom of the [142] soul. We refuse the passage of any information from theworld of ordinary phenomena. This has been brought about through rightconcentration and meditation. This achieved, there ensues the interlude whereinthe man knows himself to be a soul, dwelling in the eternal and freed from thelimitations of form. This interlude is necessarily brief at first but asprogress in control develops, it lengthens. The key to the whole process is thesustained concentration and attention of the mind “whilst the soul, thespiritual man, the perceiving being, contemplates.”In a former book I have dealt more fully with this use of the mind as theinstrument of the soul, and will repeat one paragraph here:“It should be made clear, however, that the perceiver on his own plane hasalways been aware of that which is now recognized. The difference lies in thefact that the instrument, the mind, is now in a state of control. It is,therefore, possible for the thinker to impress the brain, via the controlledmind, with that which is perceived. Man on the physical plane simultaneouslyalso perceives, and true meditation and contemplation for the first time becomepossible. At first this will only be for a brief second. A flash of intuitiveperception, a moment of vision and of illumination and all has gone. The mindbegins again to modify itself and is thrown into activity, the vision is lostsight of, the high moment has passed, and the door into the soul realm seemssuddenly to shut. But assurance has been gained; a glimpse of reality has beenregistered on the brain and the guarantee of future achievement is recognized.”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, III., 9.[143] The second activity concerns itself with a dual work carried on by themind. Having been held steady in the light, it now records and registers theideas, impressions and concepts imparted to it by the contemplating soul,formulating them into phrases and sentences, building them into thought formsand constructing clear mental images. It is for this that the need of a goodmental apparatus will become apparent. A trained mind and a well-stocked memoryand a carefully cultured mentality will greatly facilitate the work of the soulin gaining a right record and an accurate registering of its knowledge. Then,following upon this mental activity, will ensue a process of transmitting thegained information to the waiting quiescent brain.When the soul has learned to handle its instrument, through the medium of themind and the brain, direct contact and interplay between the two becomesincreasingly possible and steady, so that a man at will can focus his mind uponearthly affairs and be an efficient member of society, or upon heavenly thingsand function in his true being as a son of God. When this is the case, the soulutilizes the mind as a transmitting agent and the physical brain is trained tobe responsive to that which is transmitted. The true son of God can live in twoworlds at once; He is a citizen of the world and of the Kingdom of God. I cannotdo better than close this chapter with some words of Evelyn Underhill:“The full spiritual consciousness of the true mystic is developed not in one butin two apparently opposite but [144] really complementary directions....On theone hand he is intensely aware of, and knows himself to be at one with thatactive world of becoming....Hence though he has broken forever with the bondageof the senses, he perceives in every manifestation of life a sacramentalmeaning; a loveliness, a wonder, a heightened significance which is hidden fromother men....On the other hand, the full mystic consciousness also attains towhat is, I think, its really characteristic quality. It develops the power ofapprehending the Absolute, Pure Being, the utterly Transcendent....Thisall-round expansion of consciousness, with its dual power of knowing bycommunion the temporal and eternal, immanent and transcendent aspects ofreality...is the peculiar mark, the ultimo sigillo of the great mystic....”Underhill, Evelyn, “Mysticism”, pp. 42-43..The results of this dual activity and facility of interplay we will considernext. The intuition begins to function; illumination is experienced, and thelife of inspiration, with its many special characteristics must be studied, andthis we will attempt in our next chapter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN - INTUITION AND ILLUMINATION“And God said:Let there be light!And there was light.”Bible[147] We have laid down the general premise that modern educational methods inthe West have familiarized man with the idea that he possesses a mind; they havebrought him to an appreciation of the intellect, so much so, that to many theachievement of intellectual ability is the consummation of the work ofevolution. We have suggested further that when the eastern technique ofmeditation (with its stages of concentration, meditation and contemplation) hasbeen applied by the western intellectual, the mind processes can be trained toreach their highest point of development and can then be superseded by a stillhigher faculty, that of the intuition. We have, in the West, noted also that thefinest minds we have, through an intense interest and application, reach thesame standard of achievement to which meditation brings the eastern aspirant toknowledge. But at this point the parallel breaks down. Education in the Occidentfails to carry its exponents on into the realm of the intuition, or ofillumination. In fact, we rather smile at the idea of an illumined consciousnessand ascribe much of the testimony available to the hallucinations of theover-stimulated mystic or to [148] the psychopathic cases with which ourpsychologists are constantly dealing.But it can be proved, I believe, that the developed spiritual perception and anillumined intellect can be part of the equipment of the sane and balancedbusiness man or scientist, and need not necessarily indicate a lack of psychicbalance, or emotional instability. The light of illumination and of inspirationis quite compatible with the pursuit of one’s daily occupations, and this hasbeen told us for centuries in an ancient Chinese teaching, dating back to theeighth century:“Master Lü Tzŭ said: When there is gradual success in producing the circulationof the Light, a man must not give up his ordinary occupation in doing it. Theancients said: When occupations come to us, we must accept them; when thingscome to us, we must understand them from the ground up. If the occupations areregulated by correct thoughts, the Light is not scattered by outside things, butcirculates according to its own law.”Wilhelm, Richard, and Jung, C.G., “The Secret of the Golden Flower”, p. 57.These characteristics of illumination and its results are to be found workingout in the consciousness of the man who has progressed through the stages wehave earlier outlined, and form the theme of this chapter. Illumination is astage in the meditation process, for it entails careful control of the mind anda scientific approach to the subject; it is a result of the true contemplativestate and of soul contact, and indicates, with its sequential effects, the [149]institution of the second activity of the mind, considered a few pages earlier.According to the pioneers into the realm of the soul, the condition ofillumination supervenes directly upon the stage of contemplation, and might bedescribed, in its turn, as producing three effects: That of an illuminedintellect, of intuitive perception, and an inspired life upon the physical planeof existence. This condition is recognized by all mystics, and by all writersupon the subject of the mystic revelation. The thought of a Light which entersin and which shines upon our way, the symbolism of an intense irradiation orblinding radiance which accompanies the phase of divine contact, are so generalin their use that we have come to look upon them simply as something couched inmystical phraseology, which means relatively little more than an attempt of thevisionary aspirant to express in words the wonders that he has sensed.It seems, however, on investigation, that there is a good deal of meaning inthis special terminology and these symbolic phrases. The uniformity of thelanguage, the testimony of the many thousands of reputable witnesses and thesimilarity of the related occurrences seem to indicate something in the natureof a genuine phenomenal happening. Dr. Overstreet, in The Enduring Quest ,mentions a large number of those great individuals for whom it is claimed thatthey were illumined, and points out that “these men do not reason their way toconclusions, although reason — the search for truth — apparently played a [150]part in preparation for their final insight. In every case,” he adds, “theyexperienced what, for want of a better term, we may call ‘illumination’.” Hegoes on to warn us also that “we may, to be sure, brush these experiences asideas aberrations....” But he says “these men do not act after the manner of mensuffering from an aberration. Out of them has come a great portion of thespiritual wisdom of the race. They are, as it where, among the illuminati ofmankind. If ‘by their fruits ye shall know them,’ these men have shown fruits sofar above the average as to make them spiritual leaders of mankind.”(Overstreet, H. A., “The Enduring Quest”, pp. 239, 239, 240.)The trouble has been that with the average mystic, though not with theoutstanding figures to whom Dr. Overstreet refers, there has usually been aninability to define or express clearly this state of illumination. “The mystic,”we are told in the Bampton Lectures for 1930, “cannot explain, but he knows thathe has known and not merely felt, and often that knowledge remains an abidingpossession which no criticism can touch...though the mystics seem to be unableto convey to others any body of truth which cannot be reached by more ordinarychannels of experience and reasoning, it is nevertheless possible that theintensity of their special apprehension of reality may serve, as extreme casesserve to test the truth of some general geometrical theorem, to set ourfundamental problem in a clearer light.” (Grensted, Rev. L. W., “Psychology andGod”, pp. 203-204.)[151] It is here that the East steps in and shows the system wherebyillumination can be gained, and produces for our consideration an orderedprocess and method which carries man to the state of identification with thesoul. It posits — as a result of that identification and its subsequent effects— an illuminated perception and an intuitive apprehension of truth. It is, weare told in the eastern Scriptures, the mind that reflects the light andknowledge of the omniscient soul, and the brain that, in its turn, isilluminated. This is only possible when the interplay between the three factorsof soul, mind and brain is complete. Patanjali tells us in his Yoga Sutras ,“The Lord of the mind, the perceiver. is ever aware of the constantly activemind stuff.“Because it can be seen or cognized it is apparent that the mind is not thesource of illumination.“When the spiritual intelligence which stands alone and freed from objects,reflects itself in the mind stuff, then comes awareness of the Self.“Then the mind stuff, reflecting both the knower and the knowable, becomesomniscient.“The mind then tends towards discrimination and increasing illumination.“When the means to union have been steadily practised, and when impurity hasbeen overcome, enlightenment takes place, leading up to full illumination.“The knowledge (or illumination) achieved is seven-fold and is attainedprogressively.”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, pp. 408, 409, 415, 416, 422, 178,172.Patanjali goes on later to point out that, after proper concentration,meditation and contemplation, [152] that which obscures the light is graduallyremoved, and he adds:“When that which veils the light is done away with, then comes the state ofbeing called discarnate (or disembodied) freed from the modification of thethinking principle. This is the state of illumination.”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, pp. 118, 240.It is perhaps possible, therefore, that when Christ enjoined upon His disciplesthat they should “let their light shine,” He was not speaking symbolically atall, but was urging upon them the necessity of arriving at a state of freedomfrom the body consciousness in order that the light of the soul could pourthrough the mind into the brain and produce that illumination which enables aman to say: “In that Light shall we see light.”The way to that freedom has always been understood by the Christian Church andis called the “Way of Purification.” It entails the purifying or rarefaction ofthe lower body nature, and the wearing away of the veil of matter, which hidesthe light within each human being. The veil must be pierced and there are manyways of doing it. Dr. Winslow Hall in Illuminanda (Hall, W. Winslow, M.D.,“Illuminanda”, p. 93.) tells us of three ways, — the way of Beauty the way ofthe Intellect, and the way of the Soul. Through beauty and the search for thereality which has produced it, the mystic forces himself behind the outer formand finds the good and the wonderful. Dr. Otto (Otto, Rudolf, “The Idea of theHoly”) deals with this in his [153] exegesis of the faculty of “divination,”that capacity to recognize with awe and wonder the essential holy and beautifulbehind all forms. His chapter is well worth careful consideration. Thus themystic “divines” (through the divine within himself) the reality which the veilof matter hides. This is the way of the senses. Then there is the way of theintellect, of the intense focussing of the mind upon a problem and upon the formaspect in order to arrive at the cause of its being. In this way, the scientistshave made so much progress and have penetrated so far within the veil that theyhave arrived at a something which they call “energy”. Dr. W. Winslow Halldefines the third way, as follows:“The way of the soul is at once the oldest and the widest of the threeways...for the soul does more than pierce the veil of matter; it identifiesitself both with the veil and with the Reality behind the veil. Thereby soul andveil and Reality are felt to be one.”Hall, W. Winslow, M.D., “Illuminanda”, p. 94.We are thus brought back to the idea of Wholeness and of Oneness with theUniverse, which we touched upon earlier, and Dr. Hall adds that “I would defineillumination as an overwhelming sense of oneness with The Whole.” (Hall, W.Winslow, M.D., “Illuminanda”, p. 21.)Let us attempt at this point to express as simply as possible where ourconclusions have led us, and see what has happened to the man who has carriedforward his education from the stage of memory training and the grasping ofinformation to that of [154] a conscious use of the intellect and from then oninto the realm of the conscious knower.Through concentration and meditation he has achieved a large measure of mindcontrol and learned how “to hold the mind steady in the light.” Theconsciousness then slips out of the lower self (out of the realm of awareness ofthe brain and the mind) and the mystic passes into the contemplative state,wherein he functions as the soul, and realizes himself as a Knower. The natureof the soul is knowledge and light, and its realm of existence is the kingdom ofGod. All the time that this identification with the soul continues, the mind isheld steady and refuses all response to contacts emanating from other states ofawareness, such as those coming from the emotional and physical worlds. Absorbedin union with God, transported into the “Third Heaven” (like St. Paul) andcontemplating the beatific vision of Reality, he knows nothing, sees nothing,hears nothing except the phenomena which are appropriate to the world in whichhe is living. But in that world, he hears, and sees, and knows; he becomes awareof Truth, unveiled and freed from the glamour which the veil of matter castsupon it; he listens to the Wisdom which is stored up in his own unfathomablesoul, and is that Wisdom itself, for subject and object no longer exist for him:he is both and knows it. He enters into the Mind of God — that universalstorehouse of knowledge whose door stands ever open to those individual mindswhich can be sufficiently quieted and controlled to permit [155] of theirvisioning the door and passing through it. And still, throughout all thistranscendental process, the mind has been held steady in the Light.Presently, however, the contemplative state comes to an end, and the mind isswept into a renewed activity, an activity based on its reaction to the light,and on its power to register and record the information with which the soulseeks to dower it. The energies of the soul have been outward-going into theworld of divine realities. Now the focus of attention changes, and Deity turnsits eyes upon the waiting instrument, and seeks to impress upon it as much ofits Wisdom and Knowledge as it is capable of receiving and reflecting.There is an aptitude among those writers on mysticism who are concerned with thepurely mystic way, and have not studied adequately the technique of the East, toconfound illumination with feeling. Evelyn Underhill, for instance, says “...Theilluminated state entails a vision of the Absolute: a sense of the DivinePresence: but not true union with it.” “It is,” she says, “a state ofhappiness.” (Underhill, Evelyn, “Mysticism”, p. 206.) The illumination of themind with knowledge and with a realization of union with Deity and itsapprehension of the laws which govern the spiritual realm may, ultimately,produce happiness, but that happiness is an after effect and not a part of theillumined state. True illumination is related to the intellect, and should be —in its purest aspect — divorced from feeling altogether. It is a condition [156]of knowledge, it is a state wherein the mind is brought into relation with God,and the longer that condition can be held free from emotional reactions, themore direct will be the communication between the soul and its instrument, andthe freer from deterioration will be the imparted truths.A comparison of the way of the Knower and the way of the mystic might be ofvalue here. The mystic, especially in the West, gains his flash of insight; hesees the Beloved; he touches heights of awareness, but his approach, in themajority of cases, has been the heart approach, and has involved feeling,sensory perception, and emotion. The result has been ecstasy. His technique hasbeen that of devotion, discipline, an emotional striving forward, the “liftingup of the heart unto the Lord,” the “vision of the Beloved,” and “the marriagein the Heavens,” the pouring out of the love nature at the feet of the Beloved,and consequent ecstasy. Afterwards, if we are to believe the writings of themystics themselves, there has followed a period of readjustment to the life ofevery day, and, frequently, a sense of depression and disappointment that thehigh moment has passed, coupled with an inability to speak with clarity of thatwhich has been experienced. Then a fresh cycle of devotion and discipline isinitiated, until again the vision is seen and the Beloved contacted anew. Fromcertain angles the self-centeredness of the Western mystic is notable, and hisfailure to use the intellect most remarkable. We must except, however, suchmystics [157] as Boehme, Ruysbroeck, or Meister Eckhart, in whose writings theelement of the intellect is strongly stressed, and the quality of knowledge mostapparent. Note what Meister Eckhart himself says:“There is one power in the soul: intellect, of prime importance to the soul formaking her aware of, for detecting, God....The soundest arguments expresslystate (what is the truth) that the kernel of eternal life lies rather inknowledge than in love....The soul is not dependent upon temporal things but inthe exaltation of her mind is in communication with the things of God”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, pp. 114, 83, 288.The Knower has a different method from that of the mystic. His is the directingof the intellect to the object of its search; his is the way of the mind, andits discipline and control. He steadies the mind; he stops its versatility andfocusses it; he seeks out after God; he divorces himself from feeling and is notinterested in his own personal satisfaction, for the mind is the “common-sense,”and in its highest use is dowered with the faculty of synthesis, of Wholeness.He will, as Dr. Müller-Freienfels puts it, “no longer speak of ‘his ’ soul, butof the universal soul which manifests itself in him, and unfolds itself in himas in all other creatures, and will endure even though this illusion ofindividuality perishes....He will live his life as ‘life’, that is, asself-realization and self-completion, with the consciousness that it is notmerely his own self that is [158] being realized and perfected, but theuniverse, the deity, of whom this apparent self is a part.” (Müller-Freienfels,Richard, “Mysteries of the Soul”, p. 336).Personal feeling is ruled out. The aspirant masters the mind, holds it steady inthe light and then sees and knows. Then the stage of ILLUMINATION follows.Meister Eckhart sums up the difference between the two ways as follows:“Knowledge raises the soul to the rank of God; love unites the soul with God;use perfects the soul to God. These three transport the soul right out of timeinto eternity.”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, p. 286.These distinctions should be carefully noted. For many at this time, theachievement of knowledge of God is of greater importance than love of God. Thatthey already possess; it is the background of their effort, but not of theirpresent objective and discipline. For the vast and unthinking majority, it isperhaps true that the mystic way of love and devotion should be the goal, butfor the thinkers of the world the attainment of illumination should be the goalof their endeavor.In the truly illuminated man, we have that rare combination of the mystic andthe knower; we have the product of the mystical methods of the East and of theWest; we have the union of head and heart; of love and the intellect. Thisproduces what, in the Orient, is called the Yogi (the knower of union) and, inthe Occident, is termed the practical mystic — which is our ratherunsatisfactory way of designating [159] that mystic who has combined theintellect with the feeling nature, and is, therefore, a co-ordinated human being— with brain, mind and soul functioning with the most perfect unity andsynthesis.The illumination of the mind by the soul, and the throwing down into the waitingand attentive “mind-stuff” of that knowledge and wisdom which is the prerogativeof the soul, produce, in the truly unified and co-ordinated man, results whichdiffer according to the part of his instrument with which contact is effected.Leaving the subject of Union and the growth of transcendental powers for laterconsideration, we will confine ourselves to the direct effects of illumination.We might, for the sake of clarity, sum up these results as follows:The effect on the mind is direct apprehension of truth and direct understandingof a knowledge which is so wide and synthetic in its grasps that we cover it bythe nebulous term, the Universal Mind. This type of knowledge is sometimescalled the Intuition, and is one of the main characteristics of illumination. Asecond effect on the mind is responsiveness to telepathic communication and asensitiveness to other minds which have achieved an ability to function on soullevels. I do not here refer to so-called telepathic communication on psychiclevels, or to that between brain and brain in the ordinary intercourse of dailylife, with which we are all familiar. I refer to the interplay that can be setup between souls, divinely attuned, and which has resulted in [160] the past inthe transmission of the inspired utterances of the world, in the worldScriptures, and in those divine pronouncements which have emanated from certaingreat Sons of God, such as the Christ and the Buddha. Intuition and telepathy inits purest form are, therefore, two results of illumination upon the mind.On the emotional nature, or, in the language of the esotericist, in the desireor feeling body, we have the registering of joy, of happiness, and theexperience of ecstasy. There is a sense of completion, of satisfaction and ajoyous expectancy, so that the world is seen in a new light and circumstancestake on a happier coloring.“Heaven above is brighter blue,Earth beneath is sweeter green,Something lives in every hueChristless eyes have never seen.”In the physical body there are certain most interesting reactions. These fallinto two main groups: First, a stimulation to an intense activity, which has adefinite effect upon the nervous system, and secondly, there is frequently theappearance of a light within the head, which can be seen even when the eyes areclosed, or in the dark.Dr. W. Winslow Hall, in his book on illumination, deals with this aspect of thelight, and says in one place that he wishes to prove that “Illumination is — notonly a psychological, but also — a physiological fact.” (Hall, W. Winslow, M.D.,“Illuminanda”, p. 19.)[161] These results on the triple instrument — mental, sensory and physical —which we designate as a human being, are only manifestations of the same basicenergy as it is transferred from one vehicle to another. It is the same divineconsciousness making its presence felt in different spheres of human awarenessand behavior.Let us deal first with the mental reaction. What is this mysterious thing wecall the intuition? It is interesting to note that the word is totally ignoredin some books on psychology, and those often by the biggest men in the field.The intuition is not recognized. We might define it as direct apprehension oftruth, apart from the reasoning faculty or from any process of intellection. Itis the emergence into the consciousness of some truth or beauty never beforesensed. It does not emerge from the subconscious, or from the stored up memory,racial or individual, but drops into the mind directly from the superconscious,or from the omniscient soul. It is immediately recognized as infallibly true andarouses no questioning. All sudden solutions of apparently insoluble or abstruseproblems, and numbers of the great revolutionizing inventions, come under thiscategory. Evelyn Underhill speaks of this in the following terms:“...this illuminated apprehension of things, this cleansing of the doors ofperception, is surely what we might expect to occur as man moves towards highercentres of consciousness. His surface intelligence, purified from the dominationof the senses, is invaded more and more by [162 ] the transcendent personality,the ‘New Man’ who is by nature a denizen of the independent spiritual world, andwhose destiny, in mystical language, is a ‘return to his Origin’. Hence aninflow of new vitality, extended powers of vision, an enormous exaltation of hisintuitive powers.”Underhill, Evelyn, “Mysticism”, p. 311.This immediate access to Truth is the ultimate destiny of all human beings, andit seems probable that some day the mind itself will lie as much below thethreshold of consciousness as the instincts now do. We shall then function inthe realm of the intuition and shall talk in terms of the intuition with as muchfacility as we now talk in terms of the mind, and endeavor to function as mentalbeings.Father Maréchal, in Studies in the Psychology of the Mystics , defines theintuitive perception in these terms:“Intuition — defined in a quite general manner — is the direct assimilation of aknowing faculty with its object. All knowledge is in some sort an assimilation;intuition is an immediate ‘information,’ without an objectively interposedintermediary; it is the only act by which the knowing faculty models itself, noton an abstract likeness of the object, but on the object itself; it is, if youwill, the strict coincidence, the common line of contact of the knowing subjectand the object.”Maréchal, Joseph, S.J. “Studies in the Psychology of the Mystics”, p. 98.One of the most notable and suggestive books on the subject of the intuition,and one which gears in amazingly with both the eastern and western positions, isentitled Instinct and Intuition , by Dr. Dibblee [163] of Oriel College, Oxford.In it, he gives us several interesting definitions of the intuition. He remarksthat “as sensation is to feeling, so intuition acts to thought, in presenting itwith material,” (Diblee, George Binney, “Instinct and Intuition”, p. 85) and hequotes Dr. Jung as saying that it is an extraconscious mental process of whichwe are from time to time dimly aware. He also gives us Professor H. WildonCarr’s definition: “Intuition is the apprehension by the mind of realitydirectly as it is and not under the form of a perception or conception, (nor asan idea or object of the reason), all of which by contrast are intellectualapprehension.” (Carr, H. Wildon, “Philosophy of Change”, p. 21). The intuition,he tells us “is interested in purely intangible results and, if it disregardstime, it is also independent of feeling.” (Diblee, George Binney, “Instinct andIntuition”, p. 132.) In a particularly clear passage, he defines (perhapsunintentionally, for his theme is with other matters) the co-ordinated practicalmystic or knower.“...intuitive inspiration and instinctive energy are finally tamed and unifiedin the complete self, which ultimately forms one single personality.”Diblee, George Binney, “Instinct and Intuition”, p. 130.Here we have the mechanism guided and directed in its physical relations andreactions by the apparatus of the instincts, working through the senses, and thebrain, and the soul in its turn, guiding and directing the mind through theintuition, and having its physical point of contact in the higher brain. [164]This idea Dr. Dibblee sums up in the words: “The point at which I have arrivedis the definite acceptance of two distinct organs of intelligence in humanbeings, the thalamus, which is the seat of instinct, and the cerebral cortex,which is the seat of the allied faculties of intellect and intuition.” (Diblee,George Binney, “Instinct and Intuition”, p. 165.) This position is closelyparalleled with that of the Oriental teaching, which posits the functioningco-ordinating centre of the entire lower nature to be in the region of thepituitary body, and the point of contact of the higher Self and the intuition tobe in the region of the pineal gland.The situation is, therefore, as follows: The mind receives illumination from thesoul, in the form of ideas thrown into it, or of intuitions which convey exactand direct knowledge, for the intuition is ever infallible. This process is inturn repeated by the active mind, which throws down into the receptive brain theintuitions and knowledge which the soul has transmitted. When this is carriedforward automatically and accurately, we have the illumined man, the sage.The second activity to which the mind responds as the result of illumination istelepathy. It has been said that “illumination itself may be regarded as thehighest known example of telepathy; for throughout the blazing forth of thatsupreme enlightenment, the human soul is a percipient and the Father of Lights,the agent.” The agent may work through the medium of many minds, for the world[165] of the soul is the world of group awareness, and that opens up a field ofcontacts which is wide indeed. Not only is the soul of man en rapport with theUniversal Mind, but also with all minds through which that Divine Purpose wecall God may be working. In this way we can account for the coming forth of thesteady stream of illuminated writings and of the world messages down the ages,which have guided the thoughts and destiny of men and brought them forward alongthe path of realization from the stage of animism and fetishism to that of ourpresent concept of an immanent Deity. From the point of view of man and naturewe have progressed to that of a divine Whole in which we live and move and haveour being, and with which are identified in consciousness. We know ourselves tobe divine. One after another the Sons of God have entered into their heritageand found themselves sensitive to the world plan. They have, thoughsteadfastness in contemplation, equipped themselves to act as interpreters ofthe Universal Mind and as intermediaries between the non-telepathic multitudeand the eternal fountain of wisdom. To the illuminates of the world, to theintuitive thinkers in all fields of knowledge, and to the telepathic andinspired communicators can be traced the best that man now knows, the origin ofthe great world religions, and the triumphs of science.This telepathic communication must not be confused with mediumship, or with themass of so-called inspirational writings, which are flooding our [166] marketsat this time. Most of these communications are mediocre in character, and carrynothing new, or any message which will lead man on another step into the NewAge, or guide his feet, as he mounts the stair towards the Heavenly Places. Thetapping of the sub-conscious, the enunciations of a worthy and high-gradementality, will account for ninety-eight percent of the material now appearing.They indicate that man has achieved much, and that he is becoming co-ordinated.They do not indicate the functioning of the intuition, nor the activity of thefaculty of spiritual telepathy. People need most carefully to distinguishbetween the intuition and instinct; between the intellect in its lower aspectsand the higher or abstract mind. The line of demarcation must be preservedbetween the inspired utterances of a soul in touch with Reality, and with othersouls, and the platitudes of a nice and cultured mentality.The effect of the illuminative process on the emotional nature takes two forms —and, paradoxical as it may seem — two exactly opposite forms. It will produce insome types the quieting of the nature, so that all anxieties and mundane worriescease and the mystic enters into the peace that passeth understanding. He canthen say:“There is a flame within me that has stoodUnmoved, untroubled through a mist of years,Knowing nor love nor laughter, hope nor fears,Nor foolish throb of ill, nor wine of good. [167]I feel no shadow of the winds that brood,I hear no whisper of a tide that veers,I weave no thought of passion, nor of tears,Unfettered I of time, of habitude.I know no birth, I know no death that chills;I fear no fate, nor fashion, cause nor creed,I shall outdream the slumber of the hills,I am the bud, the flower, I the seed;For I do know that in whate’er I seeI am the part, and it the soul of me.”Muirhead, John Spencer, “Quiet” (“The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse”),p. 629.Contrariwise, it may produce the mystical ecstasy — that uplifting andoutpouring of the heart towards Divinity, to which our mystical literature bearsconstant witness. It is a condition of exaltation and of joyous certainty as tofelt realities. It carries its possessor forward on the wings of bliss, so thattemporarily, at any rate, nothing can touch or hurt. Figuratively, the feet arefleet to speed to the Beloved, and the interplay between the Lover and the LovedOne is great, but always there is the sense of duality, of something other orbeyond that which has been reached. This must be held in consciousness as longas possible or else the ecstatic vision will disappear, the clouds will veil thesun, and the world, with all its cares, will obscure the heavens. We are told inMysticism that ecstasy, physically considered, is trance. It is a state ofrapture, and can be either good or bad. Evelyn Underhill quotes Father Malavalas follows: [168]“The great doctors of the mystic life teach that there are two sorts of rapturewhich must be carefully distinguished. The first are produced in persons butlittle advanced in the Way, and still full of selfhood; either by the force of aheated imagination which vividly apprehends a sensible object, or by theartifice of the Devil....The other sort of Rapture is, on the contrary, theeffect of pure intellectual vision in those who have a great and generous lovefor God. To generous souls who have utterly renounced themselves, God neverfails in these raptures to communicate high things.”Underhill, Evelyn, “Mysticism”, p. 431 .The same writer goes on to tell us what, psychologically, is ecstasy. “Theabsorption of the self in the one idea, the one desire, is so profound — and inthe case of the great mystics — so impassioned that everything else is blottedout.” (Underhill, Evelyn, “Mysticism”, p. 434.) It will be noted how the idea ofdesire, of feeling and of duality characterizes the ecstatic condition. Passion,devotion and a rapturous going-out to the source of the realization are everpresent, and a careful distinction has to be made by the experiencer or theywill degenerate into morbidity. With this condition of sensory awareness, wehave basically nothing to do. Our goal is the high one of constant intellectionand steady mental control, and it is only in the early stages of illuminationthat this condition will be found. Later it will be seen that true illuminationautomatically rules out all such reactions. The soul knows itself to be freefrom the pairs of opposites — pleasure as well as pain — and stands steadily in[169] spiritual being. The line or channel of communication eventually is directand eliminative from the soul to the mind, and from the mind to the brain.When we arrive at the physical level of consciousness and of the reaction to theillumination which is streaming down into the brain, we have two predominanteffects, usually. There is a sense or an awareness of a light in the head, andfrequently also a stimulation to an activity which is abnormal. The man seemsdriven by the energy pouring through him, and the days are all too short forwhat he seeks to accomplish. He finds himself so anxious to co-operate with thePlan which he has contacted that his judgment is temporarily impaired and heworks, and talks, and reads and writes with a tireless vigor which does,nevertheless, wear out the nervous system, and affect his vitality. All who haveworked in the field of meditation, and who have sought to teach people alongthese lines are well aware of this condition. The aspirant does enter the realmof divine energy, and finds himself intensely responsive to it; he senses hisgroup relations and responsibilities and feels as if he must do his uttermost tolive up to them. This registering of a constant pouring in of vital force iseminently characteristic, for the co-ordination between the soul and itsinstrument, and the subsequent reaction of the nervous system to the energy ofthe soul is so close and exact that it takes the man quite a little time tolearn the necessary adjustments.A second effect, as we have seen, is the recognition [170] of the light in thehead. This fact is so well substantiated that it needs little reinforcing. Dr.Jung refers to it in the following manner:“...the light-vision, is an experience common to many mystics, and one that isundoubtedly of the greatest significance, because in all times and places itappears as the unconditional thing, which unites in itself the greatest powerand the profoundest meaning. Hildegarde von Bingen, a significant personalityquite apart from her mysticism, expresses herself about her central vision in aquite similar way. ‘Since my childhood,’ she says, ‘I always see a light in mysoul, but not with the outer eyes, nor through the thoughts of my heart; neitherdo the five outer senses take part in this vision....The light I perceive is notof a local kind, but is much brighter than the cloud which bears the sun. Icannot distinguish in it height, breadth, or length....What I see or learn insuch a vision stays long in my memory. I see, hear, and know at the same time,and learn what I know in the same moment....I cannot recognize any sort of formin this light, although I sometimes see in it another light that is known to meas the living light....While I am enjoying the spectacle of this light, allsadness and sorrow disappear from my memory....’“I know a few individuals who are familiar with this phenomenon from personalexperience. As far as I have ever been able to understand it, the phenomenonseems to have to do with an acute condition of consciousness as intensive as itis abstract, a ‘detached’ consciousness...,which, as Hildegarde pertinentlyremarks, brings up to consciousness regions of psychic events ordinarily coveredwith darkness. The fact that, in connection with this, the general bodilysensations disappear, shows that their specific energy has been withdrawn fromthem, and has apparently gone toward heightening the clearness of consciousness.As a rule, [171] the phenomenon is spontaneous, coming and going on its owninitiative. Its effect is astonishing in that it almost always brings about asolution of psychic complications, and thereby frees the inner personality fromemotional and imaginary entanglements, creating thus a unity of being, which isuniversally felt as a ‘release.’” (Wilhelm, Richard, and Jung, C. G., “TheSecret of the Golden Flower”, pp. 104-105.)These words any experienced teacher of meditation can unequivocally endorse. Thephenomenon is most familiar and goes to prove surely that there is a closephysical correspondence to mental illumination. Hundreds of cases could beproved, were people willing to relate their experiences, but too many refrainfrom so doing because of the mockery and scepticism of the man who knows little.This light in the head takes various forms, and is often sequential in itsdevelopment. A diffused light is first seen, sometimes outside the head and,later, within the brain, when in deep thought or meditation; then it becomesmore focussed and looks, as some express it, like a radiant and very brilliantsun. Later, at the centre of the radiance, a point of vivid electric blueappears (perhaps the “living light” referred to above) and from this a goldenpathway of light leads out. This has sometimes been called “the Path,” and thereis a possibility that the prophet was not speaking merely symbolically when hesaid that “the path of the just is as a shining light that shineth more and moreuntil the day be with us.”In this light in the head, which seems a universal accompaniment of theilluminative state, we have [172] probably also the origin of the halo depictedaround the heads of the illuminati of the world.Much investigation remains to be done along this line, and much reticence andprejudice has to be overcome. But many are beginning to record their experiencesand they are not the psychopathics of the race, but reputable and substantialworkers in the varying fields of human endeavor. The time may shortly be with uswhen the fact of illumination may be recognized as a natural process, and thelight in the head be regarded as indicating a certain definite stage ofco-ordination and of interplay between the soul, the spiritual man, and the manon the physical plane. When this is the case, we shall have brought our humanevolution to such a point that instinct, intellect and intuition can be used atwill by the trained and fully educated man, and the “light of the soul” can beturned upon any problem. Thus the omniscience of the soul will be manifested onearth.Let me close this chapter with some words written by a Hindu mystic and some bya modern Christian mystic, typical examples of the two points of view of themystic and the knower. The Hindu says:“They are called Brahmins only that have an inner light working in them...thehuman soul is a lamp not covered over with a bushel. The lamp emits not the raysof the flesh but the rays of mental light to illuminate all humanity and istherefore the channel for the world soul. The rays of mental light assist allhumanity in its mental growth and expansion, and the lamp is therefore one ofthe Eternal [173] World Brahmins. It gives light unto the world but takesnothing that the world can give.”The Christian writes:“I saw a life ablaze with God!My Father, give to meThe blessing of a life consumed by GodThat I may live for Thee.A life of fire! a life ablaze with God.Lighted by fires of pentecostal love!A life on fire! on fire with love for menLit by divine compassion from above.A burning life, which God can take and dropIn house, or street, or whereso’er He will,To set some other life alight for HimAnd thus to spread the fire on further still.”Then we shall have evidenced the final stage of the meditation process which wecall Inspiration. To the possibility of such a life the Great Ones of the agestestify. They knew themselves to be Sons of God and they carried that knowledgedown into full realization in physical incarnation. They are inspired Declarersof the reality of truth, of the immortality of the soul, and of the fact of thekingdom of God. They are lights set in a dark place to light the way back to theFather’s Home."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT - THE UNIVERSALITY OF MEDITATION“To every man there openethA Way, and Ways, and a Way.And the High Soul climbs the High WayAnd the Low Soul gropes the Low;And in between, on the misty flats,The rest drift to and fro.But to every man there openethA High Way and a Low,And every man decidethThe Way his Soul should go.”John Oxenham[177] We have outlined the method through which the mystic can become theconscious knower, and have defined the sequence of the development whicheventually brings about illumination of the physical brain, and the living of aninspired life upon earth. We started with the man who, having exhausted theresources and the satisfactions of physical living and facing the inevitabilityof a great transition to another dimension of living, seeks the way to knowledgeand certainty. He discovers — when he investigates with impartiality — thatthere have been at all times those who knew, those who had penetrated to theheart of the mystery of being, and who have returned carrying the assurance ofthe immortality of the soul, and of the reality of the Kingdom of God. Theyspeak, likewise, of a method by means of which they have arrived at thisapprehension of divine Truth, and of a technique which has made possible theirtransition out of the fourth into the fifth kingdom in nature.We found that these illuminated men, right down the ages, testify to the sametruth, and that they claim for this universal method that it brings them certainresults that might be enumerated as follows: [178]First: They achieve direct experience of divine realities, of transcendentaltruths and of the supernatural world. These appear, when contacted, to be asmuch a natural process and as vitally a part of the evolutionary development asare any of the processes to which the sciences of biology, of physics or ofchemistry bear witness. Just as these three great sciences are occult to, andpractically unattainable by, the average grade school student, so the highermetaphysics is occult and unattainable, even to the academician who lacks theneeded open-mindness, the definite training and the equipment.Second: Another development is the unveiling of the Self. Through the mental andspiritual education which advanced meditation practices confer, the problem ofthe psychologists as to the nature of the Self, the soul, the psyche, is solved,and the word can be resolved back into its original meaning — Psyche, the nameof the soul. The process has been that of a gradual unveiling, and of asequential approach nearer and nearer to the soul. The psyche emerges in itstrue being.Back of matter, there can be found an immanent and potent factor which isresponsible for the coherence of the form nature, and which constitutes theacting personality in the physical world. This can be regarded as the lifeaspect, and scholars are wrestling all the time with the problem of life, tryingto arrive at its origin and its cause. More deeply seated still can be found thefeeling, suffering, experiencing emotional aspect of the Self, working [179]through the nervous system and the brain, and governing most potently allactivities in the world of human affairs. It feels pleasure and pain; it isengrossed with moods and emotional reactions to life, and with worries anddesires of all kinds. This is the usual personal life for most of us, for wefeel more than we think at this stage of human development. The reason for thisis told us with clarity by Patanjali as follows:“The sense of personality is due to the identification of the knower with theinstruments of knowledge....The illusion that the Perceiver and that which isperceived are one and the same is the cause of the pain-producing effects whichmust be warded off.”(Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, pp. 115, 116.)We are told by him in another place that life experience and the process ofphysical plane living and feeling come from “the inability of the soul todistinguish between the personal self and the spirit. The objective forms existfor the use and experience of the spiritual man. By meditation upon this, arisesthe intuitive perception of the spiritual nature.” (Bailey, Alice A., “The Lightof the Soul”, p. 239.)Through this vital experience and through the process of sensory desire andsubsequent awareness, the man exhausts that aspect of his nature and penetratesdeeper until he arrives at a third factor, the mind. At this point ofinvestigation man now stands, and the close consideration of the mentalprocesses and the study of mind reactions, their causes and objectives, areengrossing the attention [180] of psychologists everywhere. Amongst them aremany schools of thought, holding widely opposing views, but that a somethingcalled the mind exists, and that it is increasingly influencing the race, is nowuniversally recognized.Whither do we go from this point? It has been a steady progression down the agesof the evolving human consciousness, and a steady growth of awareness of nature,of the world in which men live, and an increasing grasp of the Whole, until nowthe entire world is knit together through the radio, the telegraph andtelevision. Man is omnipresent, and the mind is the main factor in the bringingabout of this apparent miracle. We have arrived at an understanding of the lawswhich govern the natural world, and some of those which govern the psychical.The laws of the spiritual realm, so-called, remain to be scientificallydiscovered and utilized. A few have known them and spoken to humanity aboutthem, but they are only utilized by the pioneering spirits of our race. Amongthese few who stand out as the eminent Knowers, are the Buddha, the Christ,Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Meister Eckhart, Jacob Boehme, Spinoza — the listis long. We are now beginning to ask the pertinent question: Is it not possiblethat many hundreds now are at the point where they can co-ordinate the brain,the mind and the soul, and so pass through the portal of mental awareness intothe realm of light, of intuitive perception, and the world of causes? From thestandpoint of the mental world into which we have now penetrated, [181] leavingbehind us the veils of the physical body and the psychical nature, may we not beable now to pass on to our next evolutionary development? Having arrived at someunderstanding of the nature of humanity and the mind, can we not begin to graspthe nature of the intuition and to function in another kingdom in nature with asmuch realization and facility as we function as men? The Knowers say that wecan, and they tell us of the way.Third: In the language of some of the pioneers into the spiritual realm, thethird result of meditation is that we find God. It is relatively unimportantwhat we mean in detail by that little word of three letters. It is but a symbolof Reality. Every world religion posits a Life that is immanent in form, and aCause that has brought all things into being. Every human being is consciouswithin himself of the dim struggles (becoming more fierce as the intellectdevelops) to know, to understand, and answer the questions of Why and Wherefore.The majority of men, no matter what their theology, when they stand before theportal of death, assert their belief in the Father of Beings and accept theimplications of that Fatherhood. Let us regard God as that “High and UnknownPurpose” which can be recognized as the sum-total of all forms which express theLife, of all states of consciousness, and as the Life itself; let us regardDeity as that in which we live and move and have our being, and which is workingout through every form in nature (including the human form), His own inclusiveand [182] synthetic Plan. The Knowers tell us that when they have arrived,through a method at a Way, and through the following of that Way have enteredinto a new state of being, the Divine Purpose and Plan stands revealed to them.They can enter into active participation with it, and become conscious andintelligent workers on the side of evolution. They know what is happening, forthey have seen the blue prints.Fourth: In the words of all schools of mystics in both hemispheres, theseresults are summed up in the words: Union with God, or At-one-ment withDivinity. God and man are at-one. The Self and Not-Self are unified. Taulerexpresses it thus:“In this union...the man does not attain to God by images or meditations, nor bya higher mental effort, nor as a taste or a light. But it is truly Himself thathe receives inwardly, and in a manner that greatly surpasses all the savour, allthe light of created beings, all reason, all measure, all intelligence.”Quoted by Poulain, R. P., S.J., “The Graces of Interior Prayer”, p. 80All other factors below the spiritual reality are but ways to the centre, andmust be entirely superseded in the contemplative state wherein the man slips outof the form consciousness into that of the spiritual reality, the soul. This,being a conscious indivisible part of the Universal Soul (paradoxical as thosewords may be), is devoid of all sense of separateness; hence the union with Godis a realization of a fact in nature which has always been. The [183] soulconsciously knows itself to be one with God. With this idea in our minds andwith an understanding of the part that intellection has played, the words of St.Paul take on a new clarity, when he says: “Let this mind be in you which wasalso in Christ Jesus, Who, being in the form of God thought it not robbery to beequal with God.”The results of this realized union (realized when in the contemplative state) isillumination of the mind and of the brain, provided that they have both beenheld positively steady and in a waiting condition. The illumination, when it hasbecome frequent and, finally, when it can be drawn upon at will, produceseventually the life of inspiration.If these stages are grasped and mastered and if the intelligent man or woman canbe found willing to submit to the outlined technique, we shall have many comingforth as demonstrators of this divine science. The words that I used in my book,The Soul and Its Mechanism , will be found true that “there will emerge a newrace, with new capacities, new ideals, new concepts about God and matter, aboutlife and Spirit. Through that race and through the humanity of the future therewill be seen not only a mechanism and a structure, but a soul, an entity, who,using the mechanism, will manifest its own nature, which is love, wisdom andintelligence.” (Bailey, Alice A., “The Soul and Its Mechanism”, p. 130.)It is interesting here to note the uniformity of the teaching of all religionsand races as to the technique of entrance into the kingdom of the soul. At a[184] certain point on the path of evolution, it would appear as if all waysconverge and all pilgrims arrive at the same identical position on the Way. Fromthis point of junction, they travel the same way, and employ the same methods,and use a curiously similar phraseology. That the time has come when this shouldbe definitely realized becomes apparent when we note the wide study ofcomparative religion, and the interplay between the races. These two factors aresteadily breaking down the old barriers, and demonstrating the oneness of thehuman soul.Speaking generally, this Way is almost universally divided into three maindivisions, which are to be seen, for instance, in the three great religions, theChristian, the Buddhist and the Hindu faiths. In the Christian church, we speakof the Path of Probation, the Path of Holiness, and the Path of Illumination.Dr. Evans-Wentz of Oxford, in his introduction to Tibet’s Great Yogi, Milarepa ,quotes a Hindu teacher in the following terms:“The three chief Tibetan schools, to my mind, mark three stages on the Path ofIllumination or spiritual progress. In the first, the devotee is subject toinjunctions and prohibitions...i.e., ‘bound by the ordinances’. In the second,he adheres to traditional ways...wherein the ordinary restrictions are to acertain extent relaxed, although the devotee is not yet altogether free. In thethird, the Ādi-Yoga, when through yoga practices the Light is seen, there are nolonger any restrictions; for the state of Buddha...has been attained. Thesethree stages correspond, roughly speaking, with what the Tantras mean by [185] the...State of the Animal-Man...State of the Hero, and State of the Divine orEnlightened.”Evans-Wentz, W. Y., “Tibet’s Great Yogi, Milarepa”, p. 5.The Method in Tibetan BuddhismIn studying the life of Milarepa, the Holy One of Tibet, who lived in theeleventh and twelfth centuries, A.D., we find it claimed for him that heattained union through the method of discipline, meditation and practice, and,ultimately, Illumination. We read as follows:“He was one, who, having mastered the mystic and occult sciences, hadcommunicated to him...continuously the four blissful states of ecstaticcommunion....“He was one, who having attained to omniscience, all-pervading goodwill, andglowing love, together with the acquisition of transcendental powers andvirtues, became a self-developed Buddha who towered above all conflictingopinions and arguments of the various sects and creeds....“He was a being most diligent and persevering in meditation upon the RarePath....Having acquired full power over the mental states and faculties within,he overcame all dangers from the elements without....“He was a being perfect in the practice of the four stages of meditation(analysis, reflection, fondness, bliss. These are the four progressive mentalstates, leading to complete concentration of mind, producing ecstaticillumination)....“He was a most learned professor in the Science of the Mind, having proved theMind to be, beyond dispute, the Beginning and End of all visible phenomena, bothmaterial and spiritual, the Rays whereof, being allowed to shine unobstructedly,develop themselves, as he knew, into the three-fold [186] manifestation of theUniversal Divine Being, through their own free, inherent power.”Evans-Wentz, W. Y., “Tibet’s Great Yogi, Milarepa”, pp. 32, 33, 35, 38.Thus we have the same procedure — mental activity, contemplation, union andillumination.The Method in Chinese BuddhismOne of the main contributions to the process of enlightenment is anunderstanding of the way in which the Buddha found the Light. It demonstrates ina most remarkable way the use of the mind to overcome ignorance and itssubsequent futility to carry a man on into the world of Light and spiritualbeing. Dr. Suzuki, Professor of Zen Buddhism at the Buddhist College at Kyoto,tells us about it in the following illuminating paragraphs. He tells us that itwas through “supreme perfect knowledge” that the Buddha arrived at the wisdomwhich changed him from a Bodhisattva into a Buddha. This knowledge is“...a faculty both intellectual and spiritual, through the operation of whichthe soul is enabled to break the fetters of intellection. The latter is alwaysdualistic inasmuch as it is cognisant of subject and object, but in the Prajñawhich is exercised ‘in unison with one-thought-viewing’ there is no separationbetween knower and known, these are all viewed in one thought, and enlightenmentis the outcome of this....“Enlightenment we can thus see is an absolute state of mind in which no‘discrimination’...takes place, and it requires a great mental effort to realizethis state of viewing [187] all things ‘in one thought’. In fact our logical aswell as practical consciousness is too given up to analysis and ideation; thatis to say, we cut up realities into elements in order to understand them; butwhen they are put together to make the original whole, its elements stand outtoo conspicuously defined, and we do not view the whole ‘in one thought’. And asit is only when ‘one thought’ is reached that we have enlightenment, an effortis to be made to go beyond our relative empirical consciousness....The mostimportant fact that lies behind the experience of Enlightenment, therefore, isthat the Buddha made the most strenuous attempt to solve the problem ofIgnorance and his utmost will-power was brought forth to bear upon a successfulissue of the struggle....Enlightenment therefore must involve the will as wellas the intellect . It is an act of intuition born of the will....The Buddhaattained this end when a new insight came upon him at the end of hisever-circulatory reasoning from decay and death to Ignorance and from Ignoranceto decay and death....But he had an indomitable will; he wanted, with the utmostefforts of his will, to get into the very truth of the matter; he knocked andknocked until the doors of Ignorance gave way; and they burst open to a newvista never before presented to his intellectual vision.”Suzuki, Daistz Taitaro, “Essays in Zen Buddhism”, pp. 113-115.Earlier he points out that the attainment of Nirvana is after all essentiallythe affirmation and realization of Unity. In the same essays we find the words:“They (Buddhists) finally found out that Enlightenment was not a thingexclusively belonging to the Buddha, but that each one of us could attain it ifhe got rid of ignorance by abandoning the dualistic conception of life and ofthe world; they further concluded that Nirvana was not vanishing into a state ofabsolute non-existence which [188] was an impossibility as long as we had toreckon with the actual facts of life, and that Nirvana in its ultimatesignification was an affirmation — an affirmation beyond opposites of allkinds.”Suzuki, Daistz Taitaro, “Essays in Zen Buddhism”, p. 47.The term Prajñā used above is very interesting. It is “the presence in everyindividual of a faculty....This is the principle which makes Enlightenmentpossible in us as well as in the Buddha. Without Prajñā there could be noenlightenment, which is the highest spiritual power in our possession. Theintellect...is relative in its activity....The Buddha before his Enlightenmentwas an ordinary mortal, and we, ordinary mortals, will be Buddhas the moment ourmental eyes open in Enlightenment.” ( Suzuki, Daistz Taitaro, “Essays in ZenBuddhism”, pp. 52, 53.)Thus we have the mind focussed and used to its utmost capacity, and then thecessation of its work. Next comes the use of the will to hold the mind steady inthe light, and then — the Vision, Enlightenment, Illumination!The Method in Hindu YogaThe Hindus have analyzed the process of mental approach to Reality, and the partthe mind should play, more clearly, perhaps, than any other group of thinkers.Shankarâchârya tells us that:“The Yogi, whose intellect is perfect, contemplates all things as dwellingwithin himself (in his own ‘Self,’ without [189] any distinction of outer andinner), and thus, by the eye of Knowledge (Jnâna-chaksus, an expression whichmight be rendered fairly accurately as ‘intellectual intuition’), he perceives(or rather conceives, not rationally or discursively, but by a direct awarenessand an immediate ‘assent’) that everything is Atma.”Quoted by Guénon, René, in “Man and His Becoming”, p. 254.The Yogi, or the one who has achieved union (for Yoga is the science of union)knows himself as he is in reality. He finds, when ignorance gives place totranscendental awareness, that he is identified with Brahma, the Eternal Cause,the One and the Alone. He knows himself to be, past all controversy, God — Godimmanent and God transcendent. The seer goes on to tell us that“He is ‘the supreme Brahma which is eternal, pure, free, alone (in Its absoluteperfection), incessantly filled with Beatitude, without duality, (unconditioned)Principle of all existence, knowing (without this Knowledge implying anydistinction of subject and object, which would be contrary to ‘non-duality’),and without end’.“He is Brahma , by which all things are illumined (partaking of Its essenceaccording to their degrees of reality), the Light of which causes the sun toshine and all luminous bodies, but which is not made manifest by their light.“The ‘Self’ being enlightened by meditation...,then burning with the fire ofKnowledge (realizing its essential identity with the Supreme Light), isdelivered from all accidents,...and shines in its own splendour like gold whichis purified in fire.“When the sun of spiritual Knowledge arises in the heart’s heaven (that is tosay at the centre of the being...), it dispels the darkness (of ignoranceveiling the [190] single absolute Reality), it pervades all, envelops all, andillumines all.”Guénon, René, “Man and His Becoming”, pp. 256, 258, 259, 260.Father Maréchal tells us that the“... psychological experience lived by the contemplative passes through the twophases of mental concentration and unconsciousness described by M. Oltramare,according to the Sarvadarsanasangraha: ‘It is in two successive phases that theYogi saps by anticipation the basis of further existences and effaces theimpressions that determine the present existence. In the first it is conscious...; thought, then, is exclusively attentive to its proper object, and all themodifications of the thinking principle are suspended in the degree that theydepend on exterior things; the fruits it gains under this form are eithervisible — the cessation of suffering — or invisible — immediate perception ofBeing which is the object of the meditation....The second period of Yoga is thatin which it is unconscious ...the thinking organ is resolved into itscause...the feeling of personality is lost; the subject who is meditating, theobject on which his thought dwells, the act of meditation itself, make but onething....”Maréchal, Joseph, S.J. “Studies in the Psychology of the Mystics”, pp. 312-313.Patanjali, the greatest teacher of the science of Yoga in the world, has summedup the final stages in his fourth Book in the following words:“The state of isolated unity (withdrawn into the true nature of the Self) is thereward of the man who can discriminate between the mind stuff and the Self, orspiritual man.“The state of isolated unity becomes possible when the three qualities of matter(the three gunas or potencies of [191] nature) no longer exercise any hold overthe Self. The pure spiritual consciousness withdraws into the One.“When the spiritual intelligence which stands alone and freed from objects,reflects itself in the mind stuff, then comes awareness of the Self....The mindthen tends towards...increasing illumination...”Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of the Soul”, IV., 25, 34, 22.Here again the same idea. The use of the mind, final withdrawal from the mindconsciousness, and the realization of unity. This tends to steady illumination.The Method of SufismThe writings of the Sufis are much veiled in imagery and symbolism and have astronger sense of duality than perhaps any other religious esoteric system,except the Christian mystical writings. But there emerges even from them thesame expression of truth and the same basic method. The following excerpts fromthe oldest Persian Treatise on Sufism will show. It is interesting to note thatthose writings persist the longest and show the most wide usefulness which comefrom those who are Knowers, and who can relate their experience of divinity insuch a way that they can teach and outline, as well as declare and affirm.“The first step in unification is the annihilation of separation becauseseparation is the pronouncement that one has become separated fromimperfections, while unification is the declaration of a thing’sunity....Accordingly, the first step in unification is to deny that God has apartner and to put admixture aside....[192]“Our principles in unification are five; the removal of phenomenality, and theaffirmation of eternity, and departure from familiar haunts, and separation frombrethren and forgetfulness of what is known and unknown.“The removal of phenomenality consists in denying that phenomena have anyconnection with unification or that they can possibly attain to His holyessence; and the affirmation of eternity consists in being convinced that Godalways existed...; and departure from familiar haunts means, for the novice,departure from the habitual pleasures of the lower soul and the forms of thisworld, and for the adept, departure from lofty stations and glorious states andexalted miracles; and separation from brethren means turning away from thesociety of mankind and turning towards the society of God, since any thought ofother than God is a veil and an imperfection, and the more a man’s thoughts areassociated with other than God the more is he veiled from God, because it isuniversally agreed that unification is the concentration of thoughts, whereas tobe content with other than God is a sign of dispersion of thought....”Nicholson, Reynold A., “The Kashf Al-Mahjúb”, pp. 281, 282Again we find these words:“One of the Shaykhs says: ‘Four things are necessary to him who prays:annihilation of the lower soul, loss of the natural powers, purity of the inmostheart, and perfect contemplation.’ Annihilation of the lower soul is to beattained only by concentration of thought; loss of the natural powers only byaffirmation of the Divine Majesty, which involves the destruction of all that isother than God; purity of the inmost heart only by love; and perfectcontemplation only by purity of the inmost heart.”Nicholson, Reynold A., “The Kashf Al-Mahjúb”, pp. 302-303.Thus again we have the same truth. [193]The Method in ChristianityIt is, of course, easy to find many passages which link the way of the ChristianKnower with that of his brother in the East. They bear witness to the sameefficacy of method and they too use the intellect just as far as it will go andthen suspend all effort whilst a new condition of being is instituted and a newstate of awareness supervenes. St. Augustine says: “Just as that is ineffableout of which the Son leaps from the Father in the first procession, so thereexists some occult thing behind the first procession, intellect and will.”Meister Eckhart links himself with the Oriental Knowers in the following words:“Intellect is the highest power of the soul and therewith the soul grasps thedivine good. Free will is the power of relishing the divine good which intellectmakes known to it. The spark of the soul is the light of God’s reflection, whichis always looking back to God. The arcanum of the mind is the sum-total, as itwere, of all the divine good and divine gifts in the innermost essence of thesoul, which is as a bottomless well of divine goodness.“The soul’s lower powers should be ordered to her higher, and her higher ones toGod; her outward senses to her inward, and her inward ones to reason; thought tointuition, and intuition and all to unity so that the soul may be alone withnothing flowing into her but sheer divinity, flowing here into itself.“When a man’s mind has lost touch with everything, then, and not till then, itcomes in touch with God.“In this inflowing grace there forthwith arises that light of the mind intowhich God is sending a ray of his unclouded splendour. In this powerful light amortal is as far [194] above his fellows as a live man is above his shadow onthe wall.“The man of the soul, transcending his angelic mode and guided by the intellect,pierces to the source whence flowed the soul. Intellect itself is left outsidewith all named things. So the soul is merged into pure unity.”Pfeiffer, Franz, “Meister Eckhart”, pp. 338, 144, 66, 101.Thus, the great schools of intellectual meditation (devoid in the final stagesof feeling and emotion) all lead to the same point. From the standpoint ofBuddhism, of Hinduism, of Sufism, and of Christianity, there is the same basicgoal: Unification with Deity; there is the same transcendence of the senses, thesame focussing of the mind at its highest point, the same apparent futility ofthe mind beyond that point to carry the aspirant to his objective; there is thesame entering into the state of contemplation of Reality, the same assimilationinto God, and awareness of identity with God, and the same subsequentIllumination.All sense of separateness has disappeared. Unity with the Universe, realizedIdentity with the Whole, conscious awareness of the Self and assimilation infull waking consciousness with both interior and exterior Nature — this is thedefinite goal of the seeker after knowledge.The self, the not-self, and the relation between the two, are known as one fact,without differentiation. God, the Father, God, the Son, and God, the Holy Ghost,are realized as working smoothly together as one Identity — the Three in One andthe One in [195] Three. This is the objective of all the schools wherein themystic transcends feeling, and even thought, in the last analysis, and becomesunited with the ALL . Individuality, however, remains in consciousness, but itis so identified with the sum-total that all sense of separateness disappears.Naught is left but realized Unity."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE - THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION“It is to be noticed that the Doctrine of this Book instructs not all sorts ofPersons, but those only who keep the Senses and Passions well mortified, whohave already advanced and made progress in Prayer, and are called by God to theInward Way, wherein He encourages and guides them, freeing them from theobstacles which hinder their course to perfect Contemplation.”Michael de Molinos, “The Spiritual Guide”[199] Up to this point our discussion has been academic and comparative,discursive and indicatory. The Way that many have trodden has been pointed out,and the Path to Illumination has been considered. Now it behoves us to applyourselves to an understanding of the practical work that we ourselves can do.Otherwise the entire objective of our study of meditation will be lost, and weshall only have increased our responsibility, without having made any realadvance upon the Way.Two pertinent questions immediately arise and should receive attention.First: Can anyone, who has the desire, profit by and master the technique ofMeditation?Second: The Knowers of the East gained Illumination by retiring from the worldinto seclusion and silence. Owing to conditions of life in our Occidentalcivilization, this is not possible. Can there be hope of success without thisdisappearance into the solitudes of the world, into the forests and jungles, andinto monastic seclusion?Let us take each question and deal with it. These two questions must be disposedof and answered before we can go on to outline meditation work and indicate themethod which it is advisable to follow.[200] In replying to the first question, as to the general suitability of allaspirants for this arduous work, it should be remembered, at the outset, thatthe very urge itself to do so can be taken as indicating the call of the soul tothe Path of Knowledge. No one should be deterred if he discovers that he lacksin certain essentials the needed qualifications. Most of us are bigger andwiser, and better equipped than we realize. We can all begin to concentrate atonce if we choose. We possess a great deal of knowledge, mental power, andcapacities, which have never been drawn forth from the realm of the subconsciousinto objective usefulness; anyone who has watched the effect of Meditation uponthe beginner will substantiate this statement — often to the mental bewildermentof the beginner, who does not know what to do with his discoveries. The resultsof the first step in the Meditation discipline, i.e., of Concentration, areoften amazing. People “find” themselves; they discover hidden capacities and anunderstanding never used before; they develop an awareness, even of thephenomenal world, which is, to them, miraculous; they suddenly register the factof the mind, and that they can use it, and the distinction between the knowerand the instrument of knowledge becomes steadily and revealingly apparent. Atthe same time there is also registered a sense of loss. The old dreamy states ofbliss and peace, with which the mystic prayer and meditation had dowered them,disappear; and, temporarily, they experience a sense of aridity, of lack and ofan [201] emptiness which is frequently most distressing. This is due to the factthat the focus of attention is away from the things of the senses, no matter howbeautiful. The things that the mind knows and can record are not yet registered,nor is the feeling apparatus making its familiar impacts upon the consciousness.It is a period of transition, and must be supported until such time as the newworld begins to make its impress upon the aspirant. This is one reason whypersistence and perseverance must play their part, particularly in the earlystages of the meditation process.One of the first effects of the meditation work is usually an increasedefficiency in the daily life, whether lived in the home, the office, or in anyfield of human endeavor. Mental application to the business of living is initself a concentration exercise and brings notable results. Whether a manachieves final illumination or not through the practice of concentration andmeditation, he will nevertheless have gained much, and greatly enriched hislife; his usefulness and power will be enormously increased and his sphere ofinfluence widened.Therefore, from a purely mundane point of view, it is useful to learn tomeditate. Who shall say whether an increased efficiency in living and in serviceis not just as much a step on the path of spiritual progress as any of thevisions of the mystic? The spiritual results of the mental application which ourWestern business world demonstrates may, in the last analysis, be as vital acontribution [202] to the sum-total of spiritual endeavor as any effects whichmay be noted in the world of organized religious effort. Confucius taught us,centuries ago, that implements of civilization were highly spiritual in nature,for they were the results of ideas , and Hu Shih tells us in that interestingsymposium, Whither Mankind , “...that civilization which makes the fullestpossible use of human ingenuity and intelligence in search of truth in order tocontrol nature and transform matter for the service of mankind, to liberate thehuman spirit from ignorance, superstition, and slavery to the forces of nature,and to reform social and political institutions for the benefit of the greatestnumber — such a civilization is highly idealistic and spiritual.” ( Beard,Charles A., “Whither Mankind”, p. 41.)Our idea as to what constitutes spirituality has steadily grown. Through the useof desire, feeling and the reactions of the emotional nature, we have seen manythousands of human beings arrive at the point where they have been driven totransmute desire into aspiration, feeling into sensitivity to the things of thespirit, and love of self into love of God. Thus the mystic emerges.Through the use of the mind in the business world, in professional work, inscience and in art, we have seen two amazing things occur: Organized bigbusiness, with its selfish interests and material ideas, has, notwithstanding,been brought to a condition where it is group-conscious; group interplay and theinterests of the greatest number are being for [203] the first time seriouslyconsidered. These are purely spiritual results; they indicate a growing soulawareness, and are the faint indications of the coming brotherhood of souls.Applied science in all fields has now been so developed that it has entered therealm of energy and of pure metaphysics. The study of matter has landed us inthe realm of mysticism and of transcendentalism. Science and Religion arejoining hands in the world of the unseen and intangible.These are steps in the right direction. When the mental faculties have beendeveloped racially through our Occidental technique in the business world (avast school of concentration), a transmutation analogous to that which occurs inthe realm of the desire nature, must inevitably take place, and has frequentlydone so. The mind can then be reoriented to the truer and higher values, andfocussed in a direction other than that of material living. Thus the knower willemerge.Therefore, any one who is not purely emotional, who has a fair education, andwho is willing to work with perseverance, can approach the study of meditationwith good courage. He can begin to organize his life so that the first steps canbe taken on the path towards illumination, and this organization is one of themost difficult of steps. It is well to remember that all initial steps are hard,for the habits and rhythms of many years have to be offset. But once these havebeen taken and mastered, the work [204] becomes easier. It is far harder tolearn to read, than it is to master a difficult book.The ancient science of Meditation, the “royal road to Union,” as it has beencalled, might equally well be entitled the science of co-ordination. We havealready, through the medium of the evolutionary process, learnt to co-ordinatethe emotional-feeling-desire nature and the physical body, so much so that thestates are automatic and often irresistible; the physical body is now simply anautomaton, the creature of desire — high or low — good or bad — as the case maybe. Many are now co-ordinating the mind with these two, and, through our presentwidespread educational systems, we are welding into a coherent unity thatsum-total which constitutes a human being: the mental, emotional and physicalnatures. Through concentration and the earlier aspects of the meditation work,this co-ordination is rapidly hastened, and is followed later by the unifyingwith the trinity of man of another factor, — the factor of the soul. This hasalways been present, just as mind is always present in human beings (who are notidiots), but it is quiescent until the right time comes and the needed work hasbeen done. It is all a question of consciousness. Professor Max Müller in hisbook Theosophy or Psychological Religion says that:“We must remember that the fundamental principle of the Vedanta-philosophy wasnot ‘Thou art He ,’ but ‘Thou art That !’ and it was not Thou wilt be , but Thouart. This ‘Thou art’ expresses something that is, that has been, and [205] always will be, not something that has still to be achieved, or is to follow,for instance, after death....By true knowledge the individual soul does notbecome Brahman, but is Brahman, as soon as it knows what it really is, andalways has been.”Müller, Max, “Theosophy or Psychological Religion”, p. 284.St. Paul emphasizes the same truth when he speaks of “Christ in me, the hope ofglory.” Through the trained and focussed mind this indwelling Reality is known,and the Three in One and the One in Three are proven facts in the naturalevolution of the life of God in man.It becomes apparent, therefore, that the answer to our first question is asfollows:First: We accept the hypothesis that there is a soul, and that soul can becognized by the man who can train and control his mind.Second: Upon the basis of this hypothesis, we begin to co-ordinate the threeaspects of the lower nature, and to unify mind, emotion and physical body intoan organized and comprehended Whole. This we do through the practice ofconcentration.Third: As concentration merges into meditation (which is the act of prolongedconcentration) the imposition of the will of the soul, upon the mind, begins tobe felt. Little by little the soul, the mind and the brain are swept into aclose rapport. First, the mind controls the brain and the emotional nature. Thenthe soul controls the mind. The first is brought about through concentration.The second through meditation.Out of this sequence of activities, the interested investigator will awaken tothe realization that there is a real work to be done and that the primaryqualification [206] that he needs is perseverance . Here it might be remarkedthat two things aid in the work of co-ordination: First, the endeavor to gaincontrol of the mind, through the endeavor to live a concentrated life. The lifeof consecration and dedication, which is so distinctive of the mystic, givesplace to the life of concentration and meditation — distinctive of the knower.The organization of the thought life at all times everywhere, and, secondly, thepractice of concentration, regularly, every day, at some set time, if possible,make for the one-pointed attitude, and these two together spell success. Theformer takes some time, but it can be entered upon at once. The latterrequirement of stated concentration periods, can also be entered upon, but itssuccess depends upon two things: regularity and persistence. The success of theformer depends upon persistence largely, but also upon the use of theimagination. Through the imagination, we assume the attitude of the Onlooker,the Perceiver. We imagine ourselves to be the One who is thinking (not feeling),and we steadily guide our thoughts at all times along certain chosen lines,making ourselves think what we choose to think and refusing entrance to thosethoughts we choose to exclude, not by the method of inhibition, but by themethod of a dynamic interest in something else. We refuse to permit our minds torange the world at will, or to be swung into activity by our feelings andemotions, or by the thought currents in the world around us. We force ourselvesto pay attention to all that we do, whether [207] it is reading a book, goingabout our business in home or office, social life or profession, talking to afriend, or whatever may be the activity of the moment. Should the occupation besuch that it can be carried forward instinctively and call for no active use ofthought, we can choose a line of mental activity or chain of reasoning andfollow it out understandingly, whilst our hands or eyes are busy with the workto be done.True concentration grows out of a concentrated, thought-governed life, and thefirst step for the aspirant is to begin to organize his daily life, regulate hisactivities, and become focussed and one-pointed in his manner of living. This ispossible to all who care enough to make the needed effort and who can carry itforward with perseverance. This is the first and basic essential. When we canorganize and rearrange our lives, we prove our mettle and the strength of ourdesire. It will be seen, therefore, that no neglect of duty is possible to theone-pointed man. His duties to family and friends and to his business orprofession will be more perfectly and efficiently performed, and he will findtime for the added duties that his spiritual aspiration confer, because he isbeginning to eliminate the non-essentials out of his life. No obligation will beevaded, for the focussed mind will enable a man to do more in a shorter timethan heretofore and to get better results from his efforts. People who aregoverned by their emotions waste much time and energy, and accomplish less thanthe mentally focussed person; [208] it is far easier for an individual who hasbeen trained in business methods and who has risen to the rank of an executive,to practise meditation, than it is for the unthinking mechanical worker, or forthe woman who is living a purely social or family life. These last have to learnto organize their days and leave out the non-essential activities. They are theones who are always too busy to do anything, and to whom the finding of twentyminutes each day for meditation or an hour for study presents insuperabledifficulties. They are so busy with the social amenities, with the mechanics ofhousekeeping, with a multitude of petty activities and pointless conversationsthat they fail to realize that the practice of concentration will enable them todo all they have hitherto done and more, and do it better. The trainedexecutive, with a busy and full life, seems to find it much easier to obtain theextra time required for the soul. He has always time for the one thing more. Hehas learned to concentrate, and, frequently, to meditate; all that he needs todo is to change the focus of attention.The answer to the second question as to the necessity to withdraw into thesolitudes in order to evoke the soul opens up one or two interestingconsiderations. It would appear from the study of conditions that the modernwestern aspirant has either to forego the culture of the soul nature until suchtime as he can conform to the ancient rule of withdrawal, or he has to formulatea new method and take a new position. Few of us are so situated that we canrenounce [209] our families and responsibilities and disappear from the world ofmen to meditate and seek illumination under our particular Bo tree. We live inthe midst of a thronging multitude and a chaotic situation which makes allvision of environing peace and quiet utterly out of the question. Is the problemthen insuperable? Is there no way of overcoming the difficulty? Have we torenounce all hope of illumination because we cannot (from circumstances andclimate, and from economic causes) disappear from the world of men and seek thekingdom of the soul?Undoubtedly the solution does not lie in renunciation of the possibilities towhich men in earlier races and centuries bear witness. It lies in a rightunderstanding of our problem and of the privilege which is ours in demonstratinga newer aspect of the old truth. We belong, in the West, to a younger race. Inthe old, old East, the few adventurous pioneers sought seclusion and ascertainedfor us the opportunities, and safeguarded for us the rules. They held in safetyfor us the technique until such time as the masses of men were ready for a moveforward in their numbers, and not in their ones and twos. That time has nowcome. In the stress and stir of modern living, in the jungles of our greatcities, in the roar and bustle of daily life and intercourse, men and womeneverywhere can and do find the centre of peace within themselves, and they canand do enter into that state of silent positive concentration which enables themto reach the same goal, and attain the same knowledge, and enter into the same[210] Light to which the great Individuals of the race have borne witness. Thesecluded point to which a man withdraws, he finds to lie within himself; thesilent place in which the life of the soul is contacted is that point within thehead where soul and body meet, that region we earlier referred to where thelight of the soul and the life of the body merge and blend. The man who cantrain himself to be sufficiently one-pointed can withdraw his thought at anytime and in any place to a centre within himself, and in this centre within thehead the great work of at-one-ment is carried forward. It involves a moredynamic attention and a more powerful meditation, but the race has progressedand grown in mental power and strength within the past three thousand years andcan do what was not possible to the seers of old.A third question arises at this point: What really happens to the aspirant,psychologically and physiologically, in meditation? The answer is: A great deal.Psychologically speaking, the mind becomes controlled, and passes under thedomination of the soul; at the same time there is no negation of the ordinarymental faculties. They can be used more easily and the mind is keener than everbefore. There is a capacity to think with clarity. The aspirant discovers thatbesides being able to record impressions from the phenomenal world, he is ableto register also impressions from that of spirit. He is mental in twodirections, and the mind becomes a cohering, unifying agency. The emotionalnature, in [211] its turn is controlled by the mind, and is rendered still anduntroubled, and, therefore, presents no barrier to the inflow of spiritualknowledge to the brain. When these two effects have been produced certainchanges take place in the mechanism of thought and awareness in the human head —so the eastern knowers tell us, and so the evidence seems to indicate. Advancedthinkers in the West, as we have seen earlier in this book, place the highermental faculties and the seat of the intuition in the higher brain, and thelower mental faculties and the higher emotional reactions in the lower brain.This is in line with the eastern teaching that the soul (with the higherknowledge and the faculty of intuitional perception) has its seat in a centre offorce in the region of the pineal gland, whereas the personality has its seat ina centre of force in the region of the pituitary body.The hypothesis upon which the newer school in the educational field willeventually proceed (if the theories propounded in this book have any basis infact) might be expressed in the following propositions:One: The centre of energy through which the soul works is in the upper brain.During meditation, if effective, energy from the soul pours into the brain, andhas a definite effect upon the nervous system. If, however, the mind is notcontrolled and the emotional nature dominates (as in the case of the puremystic) the effect makes itself felt primarily in the feeling apparatus, theemotional states of being. [212] When the mind is the dominant factor, then thethought apparatus, in the higher brain, is swung into an organized activity. Theman acquires a new capacity to think clearly, synthetically and potently as hediscovers new realms of knowledge.Two: In the region of the pituitary body, we have the seat of the lowerfaculties, when co-ordinated in the higher type of human being. Here they are coordinated and synthesized, and — as we have been told by certain reputableschools of psychologists and endocrinologists — here are to be found theemotions and the more concrete aspects of the mind (growing out of racial habitsand inherited instincts, and, hence, calling for no exercise of the creative orhigher mind). This was the theme of my earlier book, The Soul and Its Mechanism, and cannot be enlarged upon here.Three: When the personality — the sum-total of physical, emotional and mentalstates — is of a high order, then the pituitary body functions with increasedefficiency, and the vibration of the centre of energy in its neighborhoodbecomes very powerful. It should be noted that according to this theory, whenthe personality is of a low order, when the reactions are mainly instinctual andthe mind is practically non-functioning, then the centre of energy is in theneighborhood of the solar plexus, and the man is more animal in nature.Four: The centre in the region of the pineal gland, and the higher brain, arebrought into activity through learning to focus the attentive consciousness[213] in the head. In the Oriental books this is called by the interesting term“right withdrawal” or “right abstraction.” This means the development of thecapacity to subjugate the outward-going tendencies of the five senses. So theaspirant is taught the right withdrawal or abstraction of the consciousnesswhich is outgoing towards the world of phenomena, and must learn to centre hisconsciousness in the great central station in the head from whence energy can beconsciously distributed as he participates in the great work, from whence he canmake a contact with the realm of the soul, and in which he can receive themessages and impressions which emanate from that realm. This is a definite stageof achievement and is not simply a symbolic way of expressing one-pointedinterest.The various avenues of sense perception are brought into a quiescent condition.The consciousness of the real man no longer surges outwards along its fiveavenues of contact. The five senses are dominated by the sixth sense, the mind,and all the consciousness and the perceptive faculty of the aspirant issynthesized in the head, and turns inward and upward. The psychic nature isthereby subjugated and the mental plane becomes the field of man’s activity.This withdrawal or abstracting process proceeds in stages:1. The withdrawal of the physical consciousness, or perception through hearing,touch, sight, taste and smell. These modes of perception become temporarilydormant, and man’s perception becomes simply [214] mental and the brainconsciousness is all that is active on the physical plane.2. The withdrawal of the consciousness into the region of the pineal gland, sothat man’s point of realization is centralized in the region between the middleof the forehead and the pineal gland. (Bailey, Alice A., “The Light of theSoul”, pp.229, 230.)Five: When this has been done, and the aspirant is acquiring the ability so tofocus in the head, the result of this process of abstraction is as follows:The five senses are being steadily synthesized by the sixth sense, the mind.This is the co-ordinating factor. Later it is realized that the soul has ananalogous function. The threefold personality is thus brought into a direct lineof communication with the soul, and the man, therefore, in time becomesunconscious of the limitations of the body nature, and the brain can be directlyimpressed by the soul, via the mind. The brain consciousness is held in apositive waiting condition with all its reactions to the phenomenal worldutterly, though temporarily, inhibited.Sixth: The high grade intellectual personality, with its focus of attention inthe region of the pituitary body, begins to vibrate in unison with the highercentre in the region of the pineal gland. Then a magnetic field is set upbetween the positive soul aspect and the waiting personality which is renderedreceptive by the process of focussed attention. Then the light, we are told,breaks forth, and we have the illumined man, and the appearance of thephenomenal [215] light in the head. All this is the result of a disciplinedlife, and the focussing of the consciousness in the head. This is, in its turn,brought about through the attempt to be concentrated in the daily life, and alsothrough definite concentration exercises. These are followed by the effort tomeditate, and later — much later — the power to contemplate makes itself felt.This is a brief summation of the mechanics of the process, and is necessarilyterse and incomplete. These ideas have to be accepted tentatively, however,before there can be an intelligent approach to the meditation work. It is asjustifiable to accept such an hypothesis as the above as to accept anyhypothesis, as a working basis for investigation and conduct. It is perhaps morejustifiable, for so many thousands have proceeded upon these assumptions, havefulfilled the needed requirements, and — as a result — have changed assumptioninto certainty and reaped the reward of open-mindedness, persistence, andinvestigation.Having formulated our hypothesis and accepted it temporarily we proceed with thework, until it proves false, or until our attention is no longer engaged. Anhypothesis is not necessarily false because it fails to prove itself in the timewe deem proper. People frequently give up their pursuit in this field ofknowledge because they lack the needed perseverance, or their interest becomesengaged elsewhere. However, we are determined to go forward with ourinvestigation and give the ancient [216] techniques and formulas time to provethemselves. We proceed, therefore, to comply with the first requirements andendeavor to bring to bear upon life a more concentrated attitude of mind, and topractice daily meditation and concentration. If we are beginners, or arepossessed of an unorganized mind, fluidic, versatile and unstable, we start into practice concentration. If we are trained intellectuals, or have the focussedattentiveness that business training confers, we need only to reorient the mindto a new field of awareness and begin truly to meditate. It is easy to teachmeditation to the interested business executive.Next, the regular meditation work is attempted, and a certain time is set aparteach day for this particular work. At the beginning fifteen minutes is ampletime, and no more should be attempted for a year at least. May it not be trulysaid, if any one claims not to be able to find fifteen minutes out of the onethousand four hundred and forty minutes which constitute a day, that they arenot interested? Fifteen minutes can always be found, if the will is on the sideof the effort; it is always possible to rise fifteen minutes earlier everymorning, or to forego that early morning gossip with the family, or to take theneeded time from a book, or the movies, or from another gossip later on in theday. Let us be truthful with ourselves, and recognize things for what they are.The plea, “I have no time,” is an utterly futile one, and indicates simply lackof interest. Let [217] us consider now the rules upon which we will proceed.First of all, we shall endeavor to find time early in the morning for ourmeditation work. The reason for this is, that after we have participated in thehappenings of the day and in the general give and take of life, the mind is in astate of violent vibration; this is not the case if the meditation is performedfirst thing in the morning. Then it is relatively quiet, and the mind can bemore rapidly attuned to the higher states of consciousness. Again, if we startthe day with the focussing of our attention on spiritual things and on theaffairs of the soul, we shall live the day in a different manner. If thisbecomes a habit, we shall soon find our reactions to the affairs of lifechanging and that we are beginning to think the thoughts that the soul thinks.It then becomes the process of the working of a law, for “as a man thinketh sois he.”Next, we shall endeavor to find a place that is really quiet and free fromintrusion. I do not mean quiet in the sense of freedom from noise, for the worldis full of sounds and as we grow in sensitiveness we are apt to find it fullerthan we thought, but free from personal approach and the calls of other people.I should like here to point out an attitude which the beginner should assume. Itis the attitude of silence . Aspirants to meditation talk much about theopposition they meet from their family and friends; the husband objects to hiswife meditating, or vice versa; sons and daughters are [218] inconsiderate andthoughtless in interrupting the devotions of the parent; friends areunsympathetic at the attempts. In the majority of cases this is the fault of theaspirant himself, and women are the worst offenders in this respect. People talktoo much. It is nobody’s business what we do with fifteen minutes of our timeevery morning, and there is no need to talk about it to our households, or toenjoin upon them that they must be quiet because we want to meditate. This willinevitably evoke a wrong reaction. Let us say nothing about the way we areseeking to unfold the spiritual consciousness; that is entirely our own affair.Let us keep silent about what we are doing; let us keep our books and papersshut away from people, and not litter up the family sitting room with a lot ofliterature in which they are not the least interested. If it is impossible toget a moment for meditation before the family disperses for the day’s work, orbefore we ourselves betake ourselves to our business, let us find some time forit later on in the day. There is always a way to be found out of a difficulty,if we want a thing badly enough, and a way that involves no omission of duty orof obligation. It simply involves organization and silence.Then, having found the time and the place, we shall sit down in a comfortablechair and begin to meditate. The questions then arise: How shall we sit? Is thecross-legged attitude the best, or shall we kneel, or sit, or stand? The easiestand most normal position is the best always. The cross-legged attitude [219] hasbeen, and still is, much used in the Orient, and many books have been writtenupon the postures, of which there are approximately eighty. But because it hasbeen done in the past, and in the East, is no indication that it is the best forus in the present and in the West. These postures are the remains of a day whenthe race was being trained psychologically and emotionally, and much resemblethe discipline that we impose upon a child when we set it in a corner and tellit to keep quiet. Some of the postures have relation also to the nervous bodyand that inner structure of fine nerves, called by the Hindus, the nadis, whichunderlie the nervous system as recognized in the West.The trouble with such postures is that they lead to two rather undesirablereactions; they lead a man to concentrate the mind upon the mechanics of theprocess and not upon the goal, and, secondly, they frequently lead to adelightful sense of superiority, that has its basis in our attempt to dosomething that the majority is not doing, and which sets us apart as potentialknowers. We become engrossed with the form side of meditation and not with theOriginator of the form; we are occupied with the Not-self instead of with theSelf. Let us choose that posture that enables us, the most easily, to forgetthat we have a physical body. This is probably for the Westerner the sittingattitude; the main requirements are that we should sit erect, with the spine ina straight line; that we should sit relaxed (without slumping) so that there isno tenseness [220] anywhere in the body, and that we should drop the chinsomewhat, so as to release any tension in the back of the neck. Many people sit,when meditating, gazing at the ceiling with tightly closed eyes, as if the soulwas up above somewhere; they look as if they had swallowed the poker, and theirteeth are often tightly clenched (perhaps to prevent some inspired utteranceescaping them, which must have dropped from the soul). The whole body is poisedand tense and tightly locked. They are then surprised when nothing occurs,except fatigue and headaches. The withdrawal of the consciousness from thechannels of the senses does not involve the withdrawal of the blood in the bodyto the head, or the uncontrolled speeding up of the nervous reactions.Meditation is an interior act, and can only be performed successfully when thebody is relaxed, rightly poised and then forgotten.The hands should be folded in the lap, and the feet crossed. If the westernscientist is right when he tells us that the human body is really an electricbattery, then perhaps his Oriental brother is also right when he says that inmeditation there is a bringing together of negative and positive energy, andthat by this means we produce the light in the head. Therefore, it is wise toclose the circuit.Having attained to physical comfort, relaxation, and having withdrawn ourselvesfrom the body consciousness, we next note our breathing and ascertain whether itis quiet, even and rhythmic. I would like here to sound a note of warning as tothe practice of [221] breathing exercises, except by those who have first givenyears to right meditation and to purification of the body nature. Whereexperience and purity are not present, the practice of breathing exercisesentails very real dangers. It is impossible to put this too strongly. There aremany schools giving breathing instruction at this time, and many exponents ofbreathing as a means to spiritual development. It has nothing whatever to dowith spiritual development. It has much to do with psychical development, andits practice leads to much difficulty and danger. It is possible for instance,to become clairaudient or clairvoyant through the practice of certain breathingexercises, but where there is no true understanding of the process or rightcontrol by the mind of the “versatile psychic nature”, the practicer has onlysucceeded in forcing entrance into new fields of phenomena. He has developedfaculties he is totally unable to control, and he finds very often that he isunable to shut out sounds and sights which he has learned to register and beinghelpless to escape from the contacts of both the physical and the psychical, heis torn in two directions, and gets no peace. Physical sounds and sights are hisnormal heritage, and naturally make their impacts upon his senses, but when thepsychic world — with its own sights and sounds — also makes an impact he ishelpless; he cannot shut his eyes and remove himself from undesirable psychicsurroundings.A Doctor of Divinity and pastor of a large church wrote me not long ago that hehad been taking [222] breathing exercises, with the idea of improving hishealth, from a teacher who had come to his city. The result of hiswell-intentioned ignorance was that he opened up the inner hearing in thepsychic sense. He said in his letter to me, “As I write to you upon mytypewriter I can hear all sorts of voices and words and sounds which are notphysical. I cannot stop them and I fear for my mind. Won’t you please tell mewhat I ought to do to tune them out?” During the past ten years, many hundredsof people have come to me, asking for help, owing to the effects ofindiscriminate following of the advice of teachers of breathing. They are quitedesperate and frequently are in a serious psychic condition. Some we can help.Some few for whom we can do nothing end in asylums for the insane or insanatoriums for the unbalanced. Much experience of these cases leads me to soundthis warning, for in the majority of cases of uncontrolled psychic troubles, thecause is breathing exercises.In the ancient teachings of the East, the control of the breath was onlypermitted after the first three “means to union,” as they are called, had beensomewhat wrought out in the life. These “means” are: First, the fivecommandments. These are, harmlessness, truth to all beings, abstention fromtheft, from incontinence, and from avarice. Second, the five rules, which areinternal and external purification, contentment, fiery aspiration, spiritualreading, and devotion. Third, right poise. When a person is harmless in thoughtand word and deed, [223] when he is unselfish and knows the meaning of poise —emotional as well as physical posture — then indeed he may practice breathingexercises, under proper instruction, and practice them with security. Even thenhe will only succeed in unifying the vital energies of the body, and in becominga conscious psychic, but this may have its place and purpose, if he classeshimself as a research experimenter.Failure to conform to the necessary preliminary steps has landed many a worthyinvestigator in trouble. It is dangerous for an emotional and weak person totake breathing exercises in order to hasten development, and any teacher whoseeks to teach these exercises to large groups, as is frequently done, is layingup trouble for himself and his followers. It is only here and there that, in theancient days, the teachers picked a man for this form of tuition, and it wasadded to a training which had produced a certain measure of soul contact, sothat the soul could guide the energies evoked by the breath for the furtheranceof its objectives and for world service.Therefore, we will do no more than see that our breathing is quiet and regular,and will then withdraw our thoughts from the body altogether and begin the workof concentration.The next step in the practice of meditation is the use of the imagination; wepicture to ourselves the threefold lower man, aligned or in direct communicationwith the soul. There are many ways in which this can be done. We call it work invisualization. It [224] would seem that visualization, imagination and will arethree very potent factors in all creative processes. They are the subjectivecauses for many of our objective effects. At the beginning, visualization ismostly a matter of experimental faith. We know that through the reasoningprocess, we have arrived at an understanding that, within and beyond allmanifested objects, there lies an Ideal Object or Ideal Pattern, which isseeking to become manifest upon the physical plane. The practice ofvisualization, imagination and the use of the will are activities that arecalculated to hasten the manifestation of this Ideal.When we visualize, we use our highest conception of what that Ideal might be,clothed in some sort of material, usually mental, because we are not yet in aposition to be able to conceive of higher forms or types of substance with whichto envelop our Images. When we make a mental picture, the mental substance ofour mind sets up a certain rate of vibration, which attracts to itself acorresponding grade of mental substance, in which the mind is immersed. It isthe will which holds this image steady and which gives it life. This processgoes on, whether we are, as yet, able to see it with the mental eye or not. Itdoes not matter that we are not able to see it, as the creative work is going onjust the same. Perhaps at some time we shall be able to follow and consciouslyperform that whole process.In connection with this work, at the stage of the [225] beginner, some peoplepicture the three bodies (the three aspects of the form nature) as being linkedwith a radiant body of light, or they visualize three centres of vibratingenergy receiving stimulation from a higher and more powerful centre; othersimagine the soul as a triangle of force to which is linked the triangle of thelower nature — linked by the “silver cord” mentioned in the Christian Bible, thesutratma or thread soul of the Eastern Scriptures, the “life-line” of otherschools of thought. Still others prefer to preserve the thought of a unifiedpersonality, linked to and hiding within itself the indwelling Divinity, Christin us, the hope of glory. It is relatively immaterial what imagery we choose,provided that we start with the basic idea of the Self seeking to contact anduse the Not-self, its instrument in the worlds of human expression, and viceversa, with the thought of that Not-self being impelled to turn itself towardsits source of being. Thus, through the use of the imagination and visualization,the desire body, the emotional nature, is brought into line with the soul. Whenthis has been done we can continue with our meditation work. The physical bodyand the desire nature, in their turn, sink below the level of consciousness, webecome centred in the mind and seek to bend it to our will.It is just here that we find our problem confronting us. The mind refuses tomould itself into the thoughts which we choose to think, and rushes all [226]over the world in its usual quest for material. We think of what we are going todo that day, instead of thinking upon our “seed-thought,” we remember some onewe must manage to see, or some line of action which calls for attention; webegin to think of some one we love, and immediately we drop back into the worldof the emotions and have all our work to do over again. So we re-collect ourthoughts and start afresh with much success for half a minute, and then weremember some appointment we have made, or some piece of business which some oneis doing for us, and again we are back in the world of mental reactions, and ourchosen line of thought is forgotten. Again we re-collect our scattered ideas andrecommence our labor of reducing the wayward mind to submission.Will Levington Comfort, in his 113th Letter, sums this up for us as follows:“Our shattered attention — we do not dream how shattered until we begin toconcentrate, until from the practice of concentration, a new fairness and fixitydawns, in the midst of the seething ineffectiveness of personal life. In ourearlier attempts at meditation, we jumped over such commonplace instructions aschoosing the subject, and holding the mind closely and faithfully to it; werushed past all that, passion for ecstasy, for initiation, for means by which wecould shine and lord it over others. We were permitted to pasture up in theboggy meadows of emotion, calling them the bright fields of spirit; we werepermitted to think we think...until in the pinch of lack, or the droop ofimportance, the breath-taking uncertainties and instabilities of our ground-workwere shown up. Convinced [227] at last, we became very eager to begin all overagain at the bottom, and the word Stability looms.”Comfort, Will Levington, “Letters”.He goes on in the same letter to tell us that“Our concentrations are breathless at first from the very effort we put intothem. This rigidity fends off the results we seek for a time, but with practicewe become skilful at length in holding a mental one-pointedness with a kind ofeffortless content which may safely be empowered.”Comfort, Will Levington, “Letters”.How is this condition of empowering reached? By following a form or outline inour meditation work which automatically sets a ring-pass-not around the mind,and which says to the mind, “thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.” Wedeliberately and with intelligent intent set the limits of our mental activityin such a form that we are forced to recognize when we stray beyond thoselimits. We know then that we must retire again within the sheltering wall wehave defined for ourselves. This following of a form in meditation is necessaryusually for several years, unless one has had previous practice, and usuallyeven those who have arrived at the stage of contemplation test themselves outquite often by the use of a form in order to make sure that they are notdropping back into a negative emotional quiescent state.I have used such forms as the following in working with approximately threethousand students of the meditation technique during the last seven years, [228]and it has proved itself in so many cases that I am including it here.MEDITATION FORMTo Develop ConcentrationStages1. The attainment of physical comfort and control.2. The breathing is noted as rhythmic and regular.3. Visualization of the threefold lower self (physical, emotional and mental) asa. In contact with the soul.b. As a channel for soul energy, through the medium of the mind, direct to thebrain. From thence the physical mechanism can be controlled.4. Then a definite act of concentration, calling in the will. This involves anendeavor to keep the mind unmoving upon a certain form of words, so that theirmeaning is clear in our consciousness, and not the words themselves, or the factthat we are attempting to meditate.5. Then say, with focussed attention —“More radiant than the sun, purer than the snow, subtler than the ether is theSelf, The spirit within me. I am that Self. That Self am I.”6. Concentrate now upon the words: “Thou God seest me.” The mind is notpermitted to falter in its concentration on their significance, meaning, andimplications.7. Then, with deliberation bring the concentration work to a close, and say —again with the mind re-focussed on the underlying ideas — the followingconcluding statement:“There is a peace that passeth understanding; it abides in the hearts of thosewho live in the Eternal. There is a power that maketh all things new; it livesand moves in those who know the Self as one.”[229] This is definitely a beginner’s meditation. It has several focal points init where a re-collection process and a re-focussing method is employed. Thereare many other meditation outlines which can bring about the same results, andmany more that are for advanced workers. There are meditation outlines which aredrawn up to produce certain specific results in particular people, but it isobvious that they cannot be included in such a book as this. A safe and generalmeditation form is all that is possible. In all of them, however, the primarything to bear in mind is that the mind must be kept actively occupied with ideasand not with the effort to be concentrated. Behind every word spoken, and everystage followed there must be the will to understand and a mental activity of aone-pointed nature.In the sixth stage where the effort is made to meditate definitely upon a formof words, veiling a truth, there should be nothing automatic in the process. Itis quite easy to induce in oneself an hypnotic condition by the rhythmicrepetition of certain words. We are told that Tennyson induced in himself aheightened state of consciousness by the repetition of his own name. This is notour object. The trance or automatic condition is dangerous. The safe way is thatof an intense mental activity, confined within the field of ideas opened up byany particular “seed-thought” or object in meditation. This activity excludesall extraneous thoughts, except those which the words under considerationarouse. The words taken in this particular form can illustrate [230] this, andthe process depicts a sequence of thought as follows :Thou God seest me.This God is the divine in me, the indwelling Christ, the Soul.For long ages this soul has perceived and observed me.Now for the first time I am in a position to see God.Up till now, I have been negative to this divine Reality.The positive relation is becoming possible.But — this seems to involve the idea of duality.But I and God are one.I am God, and have been all the time.Therefore I have been seen by my Self.I am that Self, That Self am I.This is easily written down, but if the mind is kept actively intent upon thesense and meaning, much hard and focussed thinking will have to be done, andmuch difficulty will be found to eliminate all thoughts other than those havinga bearing upon the subject. Sometimes I have found it helpful to say to thepuzzled beginner, who is discouraged by his inability to think when and as hechooses: “Imagine you have to give a lecture upon these words to an audience.Picture yourself as formulating the notes upon which you will later speak. Carryyour mind on from stage to stage and you will find that five minutes [231] willhave gone by without your attention wavering, so great will have been yourinterest.”Verses should be chosen which are positive in their effect. Those that induce awaiting and negative state of mind should be avoided. A certain amount ofrealization and experience is necessary before such words (so frequently chosenby well-meaning beginners) as “be still, and know that I am God,” can be safelycarried into the meditation work. The call for too great a quiescence of theuntrained personality, and the energy they evoke goes to the stimulation of thepsychic nature. Mr. Comfort points this out most beautifully in the same letter.“I believe that such meditations as ‘be still and know I am God,’ if strenuouslyindulged in may prove disastrous. More than one unripe personality has openedwithin itself receptivity to power which played upon its unfulfillments,arousing secret passions and ambitions beyond his power to cope with. Themeditation ‘I am God’ might therefore, be said to be almost too direct andefficacious until such time as the workman knows exactly what he is about. Onecannot play up to the Ego and continue long to act the part before men. The endof that is disease and desperate fatigue and loss of the way while shouting itto others. This is not a matter of getting something to show men. It is a matterof understanding what we are made of as personalities; of sensing the Key to anew potency altogether and of rendering with ardent entirety the whole humannature to the game of reaching and turning that Key. I realize that thisparagraph touching the ‘I am God’ meditation contains a lure as well as awarning. It is quite true that the time must come for all of us when we shalloperate from the office of the Ego, instead of from the personality, [232] but afine integrity of the personality must be established before we can carry thepower.”Comfort, Will Levington, “Letters”.The sequential method suggested above is a safe way for the neophyte. There areothers that will occur to the mind of the intelligent student. Whole worlds ofthought are open over which the mind can range at will (note those words)provided they have a bearing upon the seed-thought and have a definite relationto the chosen idea upon which we seek to concentrate. It is obvious that eachperson will follow the bent of his own mind — artistic, scientific orphilosophical — and for them that will be the line of least resistance. We shallall formulate our own concepts in our own way. But the “Be still” attitude isnot for us. We inhibit other mental activities by an intense interest, not by amental stunning of ourselves into silence, or by the adoption of a method whichinduces trance or utter thoughtlessness. We are definitely thinking. Any personwho is teaching meditation knows how difficult it is to induce the mystic torenounce his quiescent condition (which is the result of an endeavor to make theemotional nature one-pointed) and force him to begin to use his mind. How oftenone hears the complaint: “I do not like this technique; it is too intellectualand mental and not a bit spiritual.” What they really mean is something likethis: “I am too lazy to use my mind; I suffer from mental inertia; I much preferemotional rhapsodies, and the imposition of a peaceful state upon my emotionalnature. I feel [233] better. This way involves too much hard work.” Why shouldspirituality be confounded with emotions? Why should not knowledge be just asdivine as feeling? Of course, this way does involve hard work, particularly atfirst. But it can be done, if the initial laziness can be overcome, and thosewho have achieved know of its supreme value.In concluding this attempt to indicate the initial work that the aspirant tothis way has to undertake, it should be noted that the key to success lies inconstant and unremitting practice. Often, in our work with students all over theworld, we find the brilliant mind coming out second, because it lackspersevering effort, and the more ordinary mind suddenly breaking through intothe realm of ascertained knowledge and leaving its more brilliant brotherbehind, because it possesses the capacity to keep on going on. Sporadic effortsget the aspirant nowhere; in fact they are definitely harmful, inasmuch as theybreed a constant sense of failure. A little consistent and faithful work doneevery day, over a long period of time, will bring results infinitely greaterthan enthusiastic but spasmodic efforts. A few minutes of concentration ormeditation work done with regularity, will carry the aspirant much farther thanhours of effort given three or four times a month. It has been truly said that“meditation to be effective in producing results must not be merely a sporadiceffort in which we engage when we feel inclined, but it is a steady unremittingpressure of the will.” [234]Another point to be remembered is that the last person to appreciate the resultsof his work is the student himself. The goal he has set himself is so wonderful,that he is more apt to be discouraged than satisfied. The only wise thing to dois to put all thought of eventual results and their phenomenal effects entirelyout of the mind definitely, once and for all, and simply follow the ancientrules. This must be done without a constant plucking of oneself up by the rootsto see how one is growing. Those around us will know surely and truly whatprogress we are making by our increased efficiency, self-control, stability andhelpfulness. We have found it wise to gauge the growth of a student in themeditation work by the extension of his field of service and by the things hisfriends say of him, rather than by his own reports about himself. Our work is togo steadily forward, doing the demanded task “without attachment” as the Hinduaspirant calls it.If success is to be achieved, there must be a genuine and persistent desire, aclear picture of the value of the results, a realization that the goal can beachieved and definite knowledge of the technique of the method. This, with theunremitting pressure of the will is all that is needed, and this is possible forevery reader of this book."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN - THE NEED FOR CARE IN MEDITATION“A clean life, an open mind, a pure heart, an eager intellect, an unveiledspiritual perception, a brotherliness for one’s co-disciple, a readiness to giveand receive advice and instruction,...a willing obedience to the behests ofTruth,...a courageous endurance of personal injustice, a brave declaration ofprinciples, a valiant defence of those who are unjustly attacked, and a constanteye to the ideal of human progression and perfection which the secret sciencedepicts; these are the golden stairs up the steps of which the learner may climbto the Temple of Divine Wisdom.”H. P. Blavatsky[237] The meditation work outline in the previous chapter constitutes a goodconcentration exercise for the beginner and will eventually lead him — if hepossesses persistence — to the genuine practice of meditation. A concentrationthat lasts one minute is difficult to achieve but is a real step upon the way tomeditation, which is the act of prolonged concentration. The outline will helpto produce the condition of active attention. Many such outlines are available,and can be drawn up, by those who know the rules and who are good psychologists,to suit the needs of differing types of people. A few such outlines will befound at the close of the book, but it is obvious that in a book of thisdescription the more advanced practices and the more intensive work have noplace. They can be wisely carried forward only when the earlier stages have beenmastered.It should be noted that any thought process, followed with undeviatingattention, which leads “inward” from the outer form to the energy or life aspectof that form and which enables the thinker to be identified with it, will servea purpose similar to a technical outline. Any noun, for instance, when properlyunderstood as the name of a thing and, [238] therefore, of a form, will serve asa seed thought in meditation. The form will be studied as to its quality andpurpose, and all can in time be traced back to an idea, and all true ideasemanate from the realm of the soul. If the right attitude, therefore is assumedand the processes outlined in Chapter Five are followed, the thinker will findhimself led out of the phenomenal world into the world of Divine Realities. Aspractice in concentration is gained, the consideration of the outer form, and ofits quality and aspect can be omitted, and the act of concentration, havingbecome (through persistence and practice) automatic and instantaneous, thestudent can start with the purpose aspect, or with the underlying idea whichbrought the outer form into being. This entire concept has been expressed for usby Plutarch in these words:“An idea is a Being incorporeal, which has no subsistence of itself, but givesfigure and form unto shapeless matter and becomes the cause of themanifestation.” (De Placit. Philos. )These are significant words and hold much information for the student of thisancient technique of meditation.The goal of meditation, from the angle of the mind, might therefore, be statedto be the attainment of the world of ideas; from the angle of the soul, it isthe identification of the individual soul with the world originator of allideas. Through mind control, we become aware of the ideas which lie back of our[239] world evolution, and the manifestation (through matter) of the form thatthey take. Through meditation, we contact a part of the Plan; we see the blueprints of the Great Architect of the Universe, and are given opportunity toparticipate in their emergence into objective being through our contact with,and right interpretation of, the ideas we succeed in contacting in meditation.It will, therefore, be apparent how necessary it is that the aspirant should bepossessed of a well trained and well-stocked mind, if he is to interpret withaccuracy that which he sees; it is evident that he should be able to formulatewith clarity the thoughts with which he seeks to clothe the nebulous ideas, andin turn, through this clear thinking, impress the waiting brain. It may be truethat “God” works out, in many cases, His plans through the agency of humanbeings, but He needs intelligent agents; He needs men and women who are not morestupid than those chosen by the leaders of the race to participate in theirendeavors. Just to love God is not entirely sufficient. It is a step in theright direction, but devotion, unbalanced by good sense and brains, leads tomuch stupid action and much unconsidered effort. God looks for those who havetrained and highly developed minds, and fine brains (to act as sensitiverecorders of the higher impressions), so that the work may be carried forwardrightly. Perhaps it might be said that the saints and mystics have revealed tous the nature of the Divine Life, and the quality of the ideas which govern His[240] activities in the world of phenomena, and that the knowers of the worldand the intellectuals of the race must, in their turn, reveal to the world thesynthetic Plan and the Divine Purpose. Thus shall we find the thread of goldwhich will guide us out of the maze of our present chaotic world condition intothe light of truth and of understanding.It should be remembered that we live in a world of energies and of forces. Thepower of public opinion (emotional as it usually is, and frequently set inmotion by some basic ideas, formulated by thinkers, good, bad and indifferent)is well known, and is a form of energy, producing big results. The devastatingeffect of uncontrolled emotion, for instance, is equally well known, and isagain a demonstration of force. The expression, so constantly used, “the forcesof nature,” shows us that since man began to think at all he has known that allis energy. The scientists tell us that everything is a manifestation of energy.There is nothing but energy, pouring through us, and working in us, and in it weare immersed. All forms are built of atoms, we are told, and atoms are units ofenergy. Man, therefore, is himself energy, formed of energy units, living in aworld similarly constituted and working with energy all the time.The fundamental law governing all meditation work is the ancient one formulatedby the seers in India centuries ago, that “energy follows thought.” From therealm of ideas (or of soul knowledge) energy pours through. The “public opinion”of the [241] soul realm seeps little by little into the dense minds of men, andto it can be traced all the forward movements of the present time, allorganization of general welfare and of group betterment; all religious conceptsand all outer knowledge of the Causes which produce objectivity. These ideasassume a mental form, first of all, and some mind grasps them and ponders uponthem, or passes them on to some group of thinkers, and the work of “thinkingthrough” goes forward. Then the quality of desire begins to enter in, and thereis an emotional reaction to the thoughts which the ideas have evoked, and theform is gradually built. Thus the work goes on and the energy of the soul and ofthe mind and of the desire nature correlate with the energy of matter, and adefinite form comes into being. Every form, whether it be the form of a sewingmachine, of a social order or of a solar system, can be posited as thematerialization of the thought of some thinker, or of some group of thinkers. Itis a form of creative work, and the same laws of emergence into being havegoverned the entire process, and all the work has been concentrated with energyof some type or another. The student of meditation must, therefore, rememberthat he is always working with energies, and that these varying energies willhave a definite effect upon the energies of which he himself is composed (ifsuch an expression is permissible).It will be apparent, therefore, that the man who is learning to meditate mustendeavor to do two things:First: He must learn to “bring through” into his [242] mind and then interpretcorrectly what he has seen and contacted, and later transmit it correctly andaccurately to the attentive and impressionable brain. Thus the man, in physicalwaking consciousness becomes aware of the things of the Kingdom of God.Second: He must learn the nature of the energies he is contacting, and trainhimself to utilize them correctly. A practical illustration of this can be givenhere, and one universally recognized. We are swept by anger or irritation.Instinctively we begin to shout. Why? Emotional energy has us in its grip. Bylearning to control the energy of the spoken word we begin to master thatparticular type of emotional energy.In these two ideas of right interpretation and right transmission, and of rightuse of energy, the whole story of the meditation work is summed up. It becomesapparent also what is the problem confronting the student, and why all wiseteachers of the technique of meditation urge upon their pupils the need of careand slow procedure.It is essential that we realize that meditation can be very dangerous work andmay land a man in serious difficulty. It can be destructive and disrupting; itcan do more harm than good and lead a man towards catastrophe if he enters uponthe Way of the Knower without a proper understanding of what he is doing andwhere it will lead him. At the same time, it can be, indeed, the “work ofsalvation” and lead a man out of all his difficulties; it can be constructiveand liberating, and guide the man by right [243] and sane methods along the waythat leads from darkness to light, from death to immortality, and from theunreal to the Real.It might be of value here if we considered these two points a little moreclosely.We have seen that the deep need of the aspirant is to see that he succeeds inbringing through into his physical brain-consciousness, with accuracy, thephenomena of the spiritual world which he may succeed in contacting. Theprobability is, however, that it will be a long time before he can penetrateinto that world at all. Therefore, he has to learn to discriminate between thefields of awareness which may open up before him as he becomes more sensitive,and know the nature of what he is seeing and hearing. Let us look for a momentat some of the phenomena of the lower mind which students are so constantlymisinterpreting.They record, for instance, a rapturous encounter with the Christ or with someGreat Soul, who appeared to them when meditating, smiled at them, and told themto “be of good cheer. You are making good progress. You are a chosen worker andto you truth shall be revealed,” or something equally fatuous. They thrill tothe event; they record it in their diary and they write joyously to me that theoccurrence is a most momentous happening in their lives. It may be, if theyhandle it right, and learn its lesson. What has really happened? Has the studentreally seen the Christ? Here we remember the truism that “thoughts are things”and that all [244] thoughts take form. Two things have produced the occurrence,if it has really happened and is not the result of a vivid and overstimulatedimagination. The power of the creative imagination is only just beginning to besensed, and it is quite possible to see just what we desire to see, even if itis not there at all. The desire of the aspirant to make progress, and hisstrenuous effort, has forced him to become awake or aware upon the psychicplane, the plane of vain imaginings, of desire and its illusory fulfillments. Inthat realm, he contacts a thought-form of the Christ or of some great andrevered Teacher. The world of illusion is full of these thought-forms,constructed by the loving thoughts of men down the ages, and the man, workingthrough his own psychic nature (the line of least resistance for the majority)comes in touch with such a thought-form, mistakes it for the real, and imaginesit saying to him all the things he wants said. He wants encouragement; he seeks,like so many, the justification of phenomena for his endeavour; he quiets thebrain and gently slips into a psychic and negative condition. Whilst in thatcondition, his imagination begins to function, and he sees what he wants to see,and he hears the magnificent words of recognition for which he hankers. It doesnot occur to him that the Guides of the race are too busy with group activitiesand with the training of the advanced thinkers and leaders of humanity, throughwhom They can work, to spend any time with the children of the race. The lattermay be left, with complete success, to the tuition of [245] less highly evolvedbeings. Nor does it occur to them that, should they be so advanced and so highlyevolved as to have won the privilege of making such a contact, the Master wouldnot waste His time and theirs by patting them on the back and pronouncing highsounding but inane platitudes. He would improve the brief moment by pointing outsome weakness to be eliminated, or some constructive work to be undertaken.Again, some “force” — a word frequently used — or some entity comes to thestudent, as he meditates, and outlines to him some great work that he has beenchosen to do; some world message that he has to give and to which the entireworld is to listen, or some great invention he is to present some day to awaiting world if he continues to be good. Gladly he grasps the mantle of theprophet, and with unshaken belief in his capacity, his ability to influencethousands, even if he is relatively impotent to influence those around him atpresent, he prepares to carry out his divine mission. In one year, three “WorldTeachers,” who have been studying meditation in some school or other, madeapplication to the group with whom I am associated. This they did, not becausethey wanted to carry their meditation forward, but because they felt we would behappy to have them “feed” into the group some of the many hundreds they were tobe instrumental in saving. I had to decline the honor, and they disappeared, andnothing has since been heard of them. The world still awaits them. Of theirsincerity there is absolutely [246] no doubt. They believed what they said.Neither is there any doubt of their being hallucinated. All of us are in dangerof being deluded in just this way, when we start to meditate, if thediscriminating mind is not on the watch, or if we have a secret longing forspiritual prominence, or suffer from an inferiority complex which must beoffset. Another cause for the delusion lies in the fact that these people haveperhaps made a real contact with the soul. They have had a flash of itsomniscience and are swept off their feet by the very wonder of the contactedvision and knowledge. But they overestimate their capacity; the instrument ofthe soul is totally unable to measure up to requirements; there are aspects oftheir life upon which the light may not shine; there are secret faults whichthey know but cannot break; there is the desire for fame and power; there isambition. They are not yet the soul in functioning activity. They have simplyhad a vision of a possibility. Hence they crash through their failure to see thepersonality as it is.Yet, in spite of the truth of the above, let us always remember that it is theprivilege of the true knower to work in the closest co-operation with the Guidesof the race, but that the method of co-operation is not the one which deceivedthe aspirant. Only when we have begun consciously to function as souls, and onlywhen we are busy with self-forgetting service — a service that isself-initiated, and carried forward because the soul is group conscious, and itis in the nature of the soul to serve — will we make such a contact. [247] TheChrist is the Son of God in full functioning activity, the “Eldest in a greatfamily of brothers.” He has a consciousness which is universal in its scope, andthrough Him the love of God pours, and the purposes of God are working tofruition. He is the Master of all the Masters, and the Teacher alike of Angelsand of men. When He and those associated with Him find an aspirant who isengrossed with the work to be done in self-discipline, who is faithful andconscientious in his endeavor, they look to see if the light within him hasreached the point of “the shining forth.” If they find one who is so anxious toserve his fellowmen that he is looking for no phenomenal contacts for himselfand is not interested in being patted on the back and having his pride andself-satisfaction fed in this manner, then they may reveal to him the work thathe can do in his own sphere of influence to further the Divine Plan. But he willhave to begin where he is; he will have to make his demonstration first of allin his home or office; he will have to prove himself in the small things beforehe can be safely trusted with the big. The ludicrous arrogance of some of thewritings which record the psychic contacts of the writers is almost beyondbelief. They certainly lack a sense of humor at least.The point that every student of meditation should always bear in mind is thatall knowledge and instructions are conveyed to the mind and brain by a man’s ownsoul; it is the soul that illumines his way. The Teachers and Masters of therace work through [248] souls. This cannot be too often reiterated. Therefore,the prime duty of every aspirant should be the perfect performance of meditationand service and discipline, and not the making of contact with some great Soul.It is less interesting, but preserves him from illusion. If he does this, thehigher results will take care of themselves. Should an apparition appear to him,therefore, and should such an entity make platitudinous comments, he will usethe same judgment as he would in business or ordinary life with a man who cameand said to him, “A great work lies in your hands, you are doing well. We seeand know, etc., etc.” He would probably laugh and continue with the activity orduty of the moment.Another effect of meditation, and a very prevalent one at this time, is theflood of so-called inspirational writings which are coming out, with high claimsmade for them, everywhere. Men and women are busily writing automatically,inspirationally, and prophetically, and giving to the public the result of theirlabors. These writings are distinguished by certain uniform features and can beexplained in several ways. They emanate from many different interior sources.They are curiously alike; they indicate a lovely aspirational spirit; they sayno new thing, but repeat what has often been said before; they are full ofstatements and phrases which link them up with the writings of the mystics orwith the Christian teaching; they may contain prophecies as to future events(usually dire and dreadful, and seldom, if ever, of a happy nature) they carrymuch [249] comfort to the writer and make him feel he is a great and wonderfulsoul; and, fortunately, they are generally innocuous. Their name is legion, andthey become exceedingly tiresome after one has toiled through a few of themanuscripts. Some few are definitely destructive. They foretell great andimmediate cataclysms, and breed fear in the world. Even suppose thesepredictions are true, one is tempted to ask whether anything is gained byfrightening the public and whether it is not more constructive to build therealization of their immortal destiny into people than to tell them they aregoing down in a tidal wave, or will be submerged in the catastrophe which isgoing to wipe their particular city off the map. What are these writings — goodand innocuous, or harmful and destructive and subversive of public order? Theyfall roughly into two classes. First, there are the writings of those sensitivesouls who can tune in — again on psychic levels — with the mass of aspirations,longings and ideas of the mystics of all times, or, equally, them can tune in onthe fears of the ages, the racial and hereditary fears, or the fears engenderedby world conditions prevailing at this time. These they record and write downand hand around to their friends. Under this category come the writings of thosewho are sensitive in a more mental manner, and can tune in telepathically withthe mental world; they are responsive to the mind of some powerful thinker, orto the massed concepts of the religious world; they register, on mental levels,the fear and hatred and separativeness [250] of the masses. Whether the materialthey record is good or bad, whether it is happy, which it seldom is, or unhappyin nature, and whether it carries a vibration of fear and foreboding, it is allpsychic stuff, and it in no way indicates the revealing quality of the soul. Theprophecies in the Books of Daniel and Revelations have been responsible for thebuilding up of a thought-form of fear and of terror which has led to muchwriting of a psychic nature, and the exclusiveness of organized religion has ledmany to separate themselves off from the rest of humanity and to regardthemselves as the elect of the Lord, with the mark of the Christ on theirforeheads and, therefore, to take the position that they are safe and the restof the world must perish, unless they can be brought to interpret truth and thefuture in the exclusive terms of the anointed and select.Secondly, these writings can indicate a process of self unfoldment, and a methodwhereby the introverted mystic can become the extrovert. The writer may betapping the wealth of the subconscious knowledge which is his, and which he hasaccumulated through his reading, thinking and contacts. This mind has recordedand stored up much of which he remains for years totally unaware. Then he beginsto meditate and suddenly taps the depths of his own nature and penetrates to theresources of his own subconsciousness and to information which has dropped belowthe threshold of his ordinary consciousness. He begins to write assiduously. Whyhe should regard these thoughts as emanating from the [251] Christ, or from somegreat Teacher is a puzzle. It probably feeds his pride — again quiteunconsciously — to feel he is a channel through which the Christ cancommunicate. I am not referring here to the mass of automatic writings which areso popular now. I am supposing that the student of meditation refuses to haveanything to do with this kind of dangerous work. No true aspirant, in hisefforts to be master of himself, will hand over the reins of government andsubmit to the control of any entity, incarnate or discarnate; neither will herender up his hand blindly for any force to use. The dangers of this kind ofwork are becoming too well known and have landed so many people in thepsychopathic wards, or necessitated their being freed from obsessions or from“idées fixes”, that there is no need for me to enlarge upon it.How, it might be pertinently asked, can one can distinguish between the trulyinspired writings of the true knower, and this mass of literature which isflooding the minds of the public at this time? First, I should say that the trueinspirational writing will be entirely without self-reference; it will sound anote of love and will be free from hatreds and racial barriers; it will conveydefinite knowledge and carry a note of authority by its appeal to the intuition;it will respond to the law of correspondences, and fit into the world picture;above all, it will carry the impress of Divine Wisdom and lead the race on alittle further. As to its mechanics; the writers of such a type of teaching willhave a real understanding [252] of the methods they employ. They will havemastered the technique of the process; they will be able to guard themselvesfrom illusion, and from the intrusion of personalities, and will have a workingknowledge of the apparatus with which they are working. If they are receivingteachings from discarnate entities, and from great Masters, they will know howto receive it, and will then know all about the agent transmitting the teaching.True servers of the race and those who have contacted the world of the soul,through meditation, have no time for platitudes; these can safely be left to theparrots of the world; they are too busy serving constructively to care to pickup mantles which are only a veil to pride; they are not interested in the goodopinion of any person, incarnate or discarnate, and care only for the approvalof their own soul, and are vitally interested in the pioneering work of theworld. They will do nothing to feed hatred and separativeness or to foster fear.There are numbers of people in the world only too ready to do that. They willfan the flame of love wherever they go; they will teach brotherhood in its trueinclusiveness, and not a system which will teach brotherhood to a few and leavethe rest outside. They will recognize all men as sons of God and will not setthemselves upon a pedestal of righteousness and knowledge from whence theyproclaim the truth as they see it and consign those to destruction who do notsee as they do, or do not act as they feel they should, placing them outside thepale; they will not [253] regard one race as better than another, though theymay recognize the evolutionary plan and the work that each race has to do. Theywill, in short, occupy themselves by building up the characters of men, and notwaste their time in tearing down personalities, and dealing with effects andwith results. They work in the world of causes, and enunciate principles. Theworld is full of those who tear down, and who feed the present hatreds, and whowiden the divisions between races and groups, between rich and poor. Let thetrue student of meditation remember that when he makes a contact with his soul,and becomes at-one with Reality, he is entering into a state of group awareness,which breaks down all barriers, and leaves none of the sons of God outside itsfield of knowledge.It is possible to mention other forms of illusion, for the first world theaspirant contacts seems usually to be the psychic world, and that is the worldof illusion. This world of illusion has its uses, and entering it is a mostvaluable experience, provided that the rule of love and of non-self-reference iscarried there, and that all contacts made are subjected to the discriminatingmind and ordinary commonsense. So many aspirants lack a sense of humor, and takethemselves far too seriously. They seem to leave behind them their good sense,when they enter a new field of phenomena. It is useful to record what is seenand heard and then to forget about it until such time as we have begun tofunction in the kingdom of the soul; then we will be no longer interested [254]in its recollection. We must also avoid personalities and pride, for they haveno place in the life of the soul, which is governed by principles and love toall beings. If these things are developed, there is no danger of any student ofmeditation being side-tracked, or delayed; he will inevitably enter some dayinto that world of which it is said “eye hath not seen or ear heard, the thingswhich God hath revealed to them that love him”, the time being dependent uponhis persistence and patience.The second type of difficulty which we should consider is the one that can beinterpreted in terms of energy.Students frequently complain of over-stimulation and of such an increased energythat they find themselves unable to cope with it. They tell us that, whenattempting to meditate, they have an inclination to weep, or to be undulyrestless; they have periods of intense activity wherein they find themselvesrunning hither and thither serving, talking, writing and working so that theyend by undergoing a violent reaction, sometimes to the point of nervouscollapse. Others complain of pains in the head, of headaches immediately aftermeditating, or of an uncomfortable vibration in the forehead, or the throat.They also find themselves unable to sleep as well as heretofore. They are, infact, over-stimulated. The nervous system is being affected through the mediumof fine and subtle “nadis” which underly the nerves and to which we earlierreferred. These troubles are the troubles of the neophyte in the science ofmeditation [255] and must be dealt with carefully. Rightly handled, they willsoon disappear, but if they are ignored they may lead to serious trouble. Theearnest and interested aspirant, at this stage, is himself a difficulty, for heis so anxious to master the technique of meditation, that he ignores the rulesgiven him and drives himself, in spite of all the teacher may say or thewarnings he may receive. Instead of adhering to the fifteen minute formula whichis given him, he endeavors to force the pace and do thirty minutes; instead offollowing his outline, which is so arranged that it takes about fifteen minutesto complete, he tries to hold the concentration as long as possible, and at theheight of his effort, forgetting that he is learning to concentrate , and not tomeditate, at this stage of his training. So he suffers, and has a nervousbreakdown, or a spell of insomnia, and his teacher gets the blame and thescience is regarded as dangerous. Yet all the time, he himself is the one infault.When some of these primary troubles occur, the meditation work should betemporarily stopped, or slowed down. If the condition is not sufficientlyserious to warrant the complete cessation of the work, a close observationshould be made of where (in the human body) the inflowing energy seems to go.Energy is tapped in meditation, and it will find its way to some part or otherof the mechanism.In mental types, or in the case of those who have already some facility in“centering the consciousness” in the head, it is the brain cells which become[256] over-stimulated, leading to headaches, to sleeplessness, to a sense offulness, or to a disturbing vibration between the eyes or at the very top of thehead. Sometimes there is a sense of blinding light, like a sudden flash oflightning or of electricity, registered when the eyes are closed, and in thedark equally as in the light.When this is the case, the meditation period should be reduced from fifteenminutes to five, or meditation should be practiced on alternate days, until suchtime as the brain cells have adjusted themselves to the new rhythm and theincreased stimulation. There is no need for anxiety, if wise judgment is used,and obedience to the advice of the teacher is present, but should the student atthis time begin to push his meditation, or to increase the time period, he maylay up for himself a good deal of trouble. Again common-sense comes into play,and with the reduction of the time, and with the practice of a little meditationevery day, it should soon be possible to bring the work back again to normal. Wehave had students who have suffered this way, but who, by obedience to suggestedrules, and the use of common-sense, are now doing their thirty minutes’ or anhour’s meditation daily.In emotional types, the trouble is first sensed in the region of the solarplexus. The student finds himself prone to irritation and to anxiety and worry;also, particularly in the case of women, there may be found a disposition to cryeasily. Sometimes there is a tendency to nausea, for there is a close [257]relation between the emotional nature and the stomach, as is evidenced byfrequency of vomiting in moments of shock, or fright, or intense emotion. Thesame rules apply as in the first set of cases: common-sense and a careful andslower use of the meditation process.Another result of over-stimulation might be mentioned. People find themselvesbecoming over-sensitive. The senses work overtime and all their reactions aremore acute. They “take on” the conditions, physical or psychic, of those withwhom they live; they find themselves “wide open” to the thoughts and moods ofother people. The cure for this is not to lessen the meditation periods — theseshould be continued as per schedule, — but to become more mentally interested inlife, in the thought world, in some subject which will tend to develop themental capacity and so bring about the ability to live in the head and not inthe emotional region. Focussed attention to life and its problems, and somepotent mental occupation will effect a cure. It is for this reason that wiseteachers of meditation parallel the meditation work with some course of readingand study, so as to preserve the balance of their students. A rounded outdevelopment is needed always, and a trained mind should accompany growth in thespiritual life.There is a third category of undesirable results which should not be omitted.Many students of meditation complain that their sex life has been tremendouslystimulated and is giving them much trouble. [258] We have come across suchcases. On investigation, it will usually be found that these students are peoplewhose animal nature is very strong, who have led an active and ill-regulated sexlife, or whose thoughts are much engrossed with sex, even if the physical lifeis controlled. A strong mental complex as to sex is often discovered, and peoplewho would regard it as wrong to lead an abnormal sex life, or to practiceperversions, are mentally occupying themselves with sex or are discussing it allthe time and letting it play an undue part in their thought life.Some most worthy people have also a settled conviction that celibacy must alwaysaccompany the life of the spirit. May it not be possible that the true celibacyto which the ancient rules are intended to refer concerns the attitude of thesoul, or spiritual man, to the world, the flesh and the devil, as our ChristianScriptures put it? May not the true celibacy have reference to our abstainingfrom all appearance of evil? This may in one man involve his abstaining from allsex relations in order to demonstrate to himself his control over the animalnature; in other cases, it may, for instance, involve refraining from all gossipand idle speech. There is nothing sinful in marriage and it is probably the wayout for many who would otherwise lead an unduly active mental life where sex isconcerned. It is needless, surely, to add here that the true student ofmeditation should not tolerate in his life promiscuous or illegitimate sexualrelations. The aspirant to the [259] life of the spirit conforms not only to thelaws of the spiritual kingdom but to the legalized customs of his age and time.He, therefore, regularizes his physical every day life so that the man in thestreet recognizes the morality, the uprightness and the correctness of hispresentation to the world. A home that is based upon a true and happy relationbetween a man and a woman, upon mutual trust, co-operation and understanding,and in which the principles of spiritual living are emphasized, is one of thefinest aids that can be given to the world at this time. A relation that isbased on physical attraction and the gratification of the sex nature, and whichhas, as its primary objective, the prostitution of the physical nature to animaldesire, is evil and wrong. If the goal of our effort is to demonstrate Godimmanent in form, then no level of consciousness is more intrinsically divinethan another, and divinity can be expressed in all human relations. If a marriedman or woman cannot attain illumination and achieve the goal, then there issomething wrong and divinity cannot express itself on one plane, at least, ofexpression; to put in terms that may sound blasphemous but which will enable usto grasp the futility of these reasonings: God is defeated in one part of HisKingdom.This point has been enlarged upon because so many people, and particularly men,find that the animal nature requires attention when they begin to meditate. Theydiscover within themselves uncontrolled desires, plus physiological effectswhich [260] cause them acute trouble and discouragement. A person may have ahigh aspiration and a strong urge towards spiritual living and yet have aspectsof his nature still uncontrolled. The energy that pours in during meditationpours down through the mechanism and stimulates the entire sex apparatus. Theweak point is always discovered and stimulated. The cure for this situation canbe summed up in the words: — control of the thought life and transmutation. Anintense mental preoccupation and interest should be cultivated in otherdirections than the line of least resistance — sex. There should be an endeavorat all times to keep the energy contacted in the head and to permit it to workout through creative activity of some kind. The eastern teaching tells us thatenergy, usually directed to the functioning of the sex life, has to be raisedand carried to the head and throat, particularly the latter, as it is, we aretold, the centre of creative work. To put it in western terms, this means thatwe learn to transmute the energy utilized in the procreative process or in sexthoughts and use it in the work of creative writing, in artistic endeavor, or insome expression of group activity. The tendency in modern times to find theone-pointed thinker and purely mental type evading marriage and as he frequentlydoes leading a purely celibate life, may be a demonstration of the truth of theeastern position. It is causing a good deal of concern among those who study ourfalling birth rate. Transmutation is not surely the [261] death of an activityor a cessation of functioning on any level of consciousness for the sake of ahigher. It is the right utilization of the various aspects of energy whereverthe Self feels they should be used for the furthering of the ends of evolution,and the helping of the Plan. The mind, illumined by the soul, should be thecontrolling factor, and when we think straight, live straight, and raise allthoughts and energies into the “Heavenly places” we shall solve our problemsthrough the development of a spiritual normality which is greatly needed at thistime, particularly among aspirants and esoteric students.It might be well also, before this chapter comes to a close, to refer to thedangers to which many are liable if they respond to the appeal of teachers forpupils to “sit for development.” They are then taught to meditate upon somecentre of energy, usually the solar plexus, sometimes the heart, curiouslyenough never the head. Meditating upon a centre is based upon the law thatenergy follows thought, and leads to the direct stimulation of that centre andthe resultant demonstration of the particular characteristics for which thesefocal points — scattered throughout the human body — are responsible. As themajority of people function primarily through the collected energies that liebelow the diaphragm (the sex energies and the emotional energies) theirstimulation is most dangerous. In view of this, why take risks? Why not bewarned by the experience of others? Why not learn to function as the spiritual[262] man from that point, so quaintly described by the Oriental writers, as“the throne between the eyebrows,” and from that high place control all aspectsof the lower nature, and guide the daily life in the ways of God."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION“The Spirit within is the long-lost Word,Besought by the world of the soul in painThrough a world of words which are void and vain.O never while shadow and light are blendedShall the world’s Word-Quest or its woe be ended,And never the world of its wounds made wholeTill the Word made flesh be the Word made soul!”Arthur Edward Waite[265] What is to be the result of all our effort?

The search in the worldgoes on; the cry of humanity rises from the depths and mounts to the very throneof God Himself.

We rest not in ourendeavor till the last of the world’s seekers has found his way home.What is going to save this world from its present agony, economic distress, andchaos? What is going to usher in the New Age of brotherhood and group living?Who, or what, will save the world? May it not be the emergence into active beingof a group of practical mystics, who, banded together in the sense of a divineunity, work in practical ways on earth? They will not retire into monasteries orto the silent places of the world, no matter how alluring that may appear, butthey will participate in the normal life of the planet. They will be thebusiness executives in our great cities; they will carry forward our politicalprograms; they will lead the young along the paths of right education; they willcontrol our economic, social and national destinies. They will do all this fromthe centre of their being and from [266] the standpoint of the soul; they willknow the secret of illumination; they will know how to submit all problems tothe omniscience of the soul; they will know the secret of the life that makesall men brothers.They will recognize all those they meet as Sons of God, but they will know alsothe signs of the illumined man and with him they will seek to work for the goodof the whole. Telepathically they will find each other, and work, therefore, inthe closest co-operation.This group is already in existence and the members of it are in the closesttouch with one another. They are to be found in every country in the world, yetdaily they meet in the Kingdom of the soul. They speak the same language; theyhave the same ideals; they know no barriers or divisions; they have no hatredsor class distinction; they set up no racial barriers; they see things as theyare. They are not wild idealists, but they concentrate on the next step thathumanity must take, and not upon the final stages of their own development. Theywork with worldly wisdom as well as spiritual insight. Above all, they worktogether and come into touch with one another through the power of a unifiedrealization.This integrating group of mystics and knowers is the hope of the world andconstitutes the World Savior. They are above and beyond all creeds andtheologies; they work in all fields of human achievement — the scientific field,the political, the religious, the educational and the philosophical. They arenot [267 ] interested in terminologies, nor do they waste time seeking toimpose on others their pet theories, their peculiar terms, or their particularapproach to truth. They recognize the truth underlying all presentations and areonly interested in the principles of brotherhood, in the emphasizing ofessentials and in living the life of the spirit in the world of every day.They know the meaning of meditation and they are with us now.
