xi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Several years ago, a combination of age and abuse finally took its toll on my back and it became increasingly uncomfortable to use an equatorially mounted tele- scope for visual astronomy. I considered the option of setting up a system whereby I could operate a telescope remotely from the warmth and comfort of my study and see the resulting images on my computer screen. Almost immediately it became blindingly obvious to me that while this is a pleasurable option for many amateur astronomers, it was not one that suited me. To do so would take me more into the realms of what some call “serious” amateur astronomy, which has rapidly embraced the advances that modern microelectronic technology has to offer, enabling the serious amateur to make significant contributions to astro- nomical knowledge. The thought of going further down this route brought it home to me: the reason that I “do” astronomy is for pleasure and relaxation, and the option that I was considering was in danger of making it seem to me like another job. I had always used binoculars for quick views of the sky when I did not have time to set up a telescope and for more extended observing when, for example, I was waiting for a telescope to reach thermal equilibrium. I also always keep a binocu- lar in my car so that I usually have an observing instrument reasonably close by. Now my back injury meant that my binoculars were the only astronomical instru- ments that I could comfortably use. I felt as if I was resigning myself to this. I con- sidered my options again and decided that, if I was going to be “stuck” with binoculars, I might as well at least have some good quality ones. Almost simulta- neously, a large astronomical binocular was advertised for sale at an attractive price on UK Astro Ads and I took the opportunity and purchased it. This turned Introduction xiii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy out to be the best decision of my astronomical life; it was like discovering visual astronomy all over again. Why was this? First, I became less “technological.” I no longer had an equator- ial mount to align, computers to set up, CCD camera to focus, or power supplies to manage. Within minutes of making a decision to observe, I could be observing. Second, and there are no other words for it, I was “blown away” by what I saw through the two eyepieces of a good 100-mm binocular. The first object that I turned my new acquisition to was the Great Nebula in Orion. It was like seeing it for the first time. I began to see detail that I had never before noticed visually, and some of this disappeared if I used only one eye. The pleasure of just sweeping the skies seeing what I could find is far greater than it was with a telescope—two eyes give one the impression that one is actually out there! Lastly, I found that I had stopped wondering if I would ever discover a comet or a supernova and had stopped thinking it was about time I did some more occultation timings. I was observing purely for pleasure. I realized that this was something that I had not done since I was a child. I had rediscovered my astronomical roots. There can be pressure in amateur astronomical communities to participate in observing programs, to use one’s hobby to advance the status of amateur astronomers. There can also be a tangible, and not always unspoken, attitude that someone who observes only, or even primarily, for pleasure does not really deserve to be called an amateur astronomer. My one regret is that it took me so many years to realize that this is a load of nonsense. The primary purpose of a hobby is enjoy- ment. If people find enjoyment in “serious” amateur astronomy, then all well and good; but, I contend, it is equally legitimate to enjoy it purely for recreation. Many have found that binoculars lead one to do exactly that. Recreational observing is not the only application of binoculars; they are also well suited to some aspects of serious astronomy. Big binoculars with their wide fields of view are excellent tools for visual comet hunters, as the names George Alcock and Yuji Hyakutaki attest. There are many variable star programs specifically for binoculars, such as that run by the Society for Popular Astronomy. With even modest binoculars, there is sufficient in the sky to keep one enthralled for years; with good quality big binoculars, there must be sufficient for decades. This book is for those who wish to explore that further, either with binoculars as an adjunct to a telescope or, as an increasing number of us are finding, as a main instrument. Its aim is to give a thorough understanding of the optical systems you will be using and to indicate those criteria that should influence your choice of binocular. Once the choice is narrowed down, you will need to evaluate your options, and there are simple tests you can do to give a good indication as to the potential of your choice. As with any aspect of astronomy, things do not stop with the optical system itself. You will, I hope, want to mount your binoculars—even small, normally hand-held binoculars show so much more when mounted—and there are numerous accessories and techniques that can increase your observing comfort, pleasure, and efficacy. Lastly, of course, there are the objects themselves that you will observe. I have grouped these into objects suitable for medium (50-mm aperture) binoculars and giant (100-mm aperture) binoculars. Obviously, all those in the 50-mm class are observable with a larger instrument (although a few are more pleasing with the wider field of the smaller instrument), and most of those for the larger instrument can at least be detected with the smaller one. These xiv"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"are intended as a “taster,” but there are many more available to you. For example, some observers have seen all the Messier objects with 10 × 50 glasses! I hope that Southern Hemisphere readers will feel that I have made sufficient effort to include a good representation from their wonderful skies. The charts are simple black on white, as that is by far the easiest to read under red light. Whatever category of binocular observer you fall into, there is something here for you. I hope you will get out there and find the same enjoyment from your binoc- ulars as I continue to have from mine. Introduction xv"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE Amateur astronomers usually view medium aperture (50–70 mm) binoculars either as an inexpensive “entry instrument” to the hobby, or as a useful accessory to a more experienced observer’s “main” instrument—a telescope. There is a great deal of justification for this. Binoculars indeed make excellent starter instruments for new observers, especially those of limited financial means. Not only is a medium aperture binocular of reasonable quality less expensive than the cheapest useful astronomical telescopes, but it is also more intuitive to use, easier to set up, more portable, and has more obvious uses outside astronomy, for example, bird watching or horse racing. It also enables the new observer to engage in useful observing programs, such as the Society for Popular Astronomy’s variable star program. 1 Where the more experienced observer is concerned, the wider field of a binocular is ideal for having a preliminary scan around the sky in order to evaluate it at the beginning of an observing session, and is also useful in conjunction with the telescope’s finder as an aid to hunting the objects to be observed. Additionally, there are large objects with low surface brightness, such as the Pinwheel Galaxy (M33, NGC 598), that are distinctly easier to see in such binoculars than they are in most telescopes of even twice the aperture. What an increasing number of experienced observers are coming to realize is that the binocular is not limited to being an adjunct to a telescope, but is an excep- tionally valuable astronomical instrument in its own right. Many of the advantages of the binocular, when used for its “beginner” or “adjunct” purpose, translate to its advanced use. Why Binoculars? 1"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy Portability There are two facets to the portability of binoculars. The first is the compactness and weight of the instrument itself. A 10 × 50 binocular is possibly the most common starting binocular and adjunct binocular. It is typically about 18 cm (7 in) long and about the same width, and usually weighs a kilogram (2.2 lb) or less, considerably less in the case of lightweight models. Second, binoculars of this size and weight can easily be hand-held for moderate periods of time, so they do not need a mount to be carried with them. Even 15 × 70 or 16 × 70 binoculars, which are typically about 28 cm (11 in) long and around 2 kg (4.4 lb) in weight may be hand- held for short periods. Of course, all binoculars will benefit from being mounted. If a mount is to be carried with this size of binocular, a reasonably sturdy photographic monopod or tripod with a pan/tilt head will suffice for binoculars up to 80 mm in aperture, or 100 mm if they are the lighter weight ones. However, it does need to be stated at the outset that the photographic tripod with pan/tilt head, although commonly used, is far from ideal as a binocular mount for astronomy (see Chapter 6). Ease of Set-up Binoculars of 100-mm aperture or smaller are usually trivially easy to set up. If they are to be hand-held (usually 50 mm or smaller), all that is required is that the interpupillary distance and focus are set. They do not normally require time to reach thermal equilibrium, so they can literally be regarded as “grab and go” instru- ments, with observations being made within a minute or so of the decision to observe! Even larger binoculars are generally considerably simpler to set up than many telescopes. Binoculars are not generally equatorially mounted on account of the awkward position that such mounting would require of the observer’s head! For this reason, binoculars are usually mounted on some form of altazimuth mount, often a photographic tripod and head. Even with 6 kg (13.5 lb) binoculars on a sophisticated parallelogram mount, I routinely find that I am observing in less than 10 minutes of having made the decision to observe. The Binocular Advantage It is generally acknowledged, and empirical experiments confirm, that when using two eyes, our threshold of detection of faint objects is approximately 1.4 times as good as with one eye. 2 This is a consequence of what is called binocular summa- tion , 3 which is itself probably a result of at least two different phenomena: • Statistical summation . For objects of a low threshold of visibility, there is a greater probability that photons from the object will be detected by at least one of two detectors (in this case, eyes) than by a single detector. If the probability 2"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"of detection in one detector is just over 0.5, then the probability of detection in both is indeed approximately 1.4 times greater. For example, for a detection probability of 0.6 in one detector, the probability of detection in one of two iden- tical detectors is given by: P(Both) = P(Right) OR P(Left) − (P(Right) AND P(Left)) = 0.6 + 0.6 − (0.6 × 0.6) = 0.84 0.84/0.6 = 1.4 • Physiological summation . This is essentially an improvement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The signals from each eye are added, but the random neural noise is partially canceled. If the noise is random, the resulting improvement in SNR will be , or approximately 1.4. The consequence of binocular summation is that, with two eyes, we experience an improvement in both acuity of vision and in contrast. This is apparent when we have our eyes tested by an optometrist, where we notice that the eye chart is easier to read with both eyes than with one eye alone. It is easy to demonstrate this with binoculars: find an object that you can only just detect, or a double star that you can only just split, with both eyes, then cap each objective in turn. You may even notice it while reading this page! However, this is only true for well-corrected vision; if the image in one eye is sufficiently degraded, then the consequence is that binocular vision is degraded to below the performance for the good eye. This obvi- ously has implications for when we use binoculars. Another bonus of using two eyes is stereopsis. Although astronomical objects are obviously far too distant for them to be seen with true stereoscopic vision, when we use both eyes, there is an illusion of stereoscopic vision that enhances the aesthetic attributes of many objects. I find this effect particularly apparent with rich open clusters, especially when there are stars of obviously different colors. Lastly, when you observe with two eyes one eye sees the small part of the field of the other eye that is obliterated by the blind spot, the location on the retina where the optic nerve enters the eye. In this sense, the binocular can be said to give a more complete view than single-eye observing. The 5-mm Exit Pupil Most binoculars for astronomy will give an exit pupil in the region of 3 to 5 mm. There are obvious exceptions to this. There are occasional “fashions” for using exit pupils of up to 7 mm in both medium (e.g., 7 × 50) and giant (e.g., 15 × 110, 25 × 150) binoculars, but there are very good reasons not to do so, as only a few objects can benefit from this even if our eyes’ pupils do dilate that much. Similarly, there are some larger astronomical binoculars, usually with interchangeable eyepieces, where the exit pupil is smaller than 3 mm. There are distinct advantages in using an exit pupil in the 3 to 5 mm range. In no particular order they are: • Most observers’ pupils do not dilate much beyond 6 mm. The eye’s pupil there- fore vignettes the light from the binocular. 2 Why Binoculars? 3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy • There is sufficient brightness to see most of the extended objects that are visible with a larger exit pupil. (Notable exceptions are the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the North American Nebula (NGC 7000), both of which are better with a larger exit pupil, if our eyes can accommodate it. • It is easier to position the eyes so that the entire exit pupil is contained by the eye’s pupil. • Aberrations in the eye’s lens and cornea tend, as they do in the lenses of optical instruments, to be more severe toward the periphery of the pupil than they are at the center. Many normally bespectacled observers find that they can, with smaller exit pupils, observe satisfactorily without spectacles. • Larger exit pupils imply lower magnification. Most binocular objects are easier to resolve with greater magnification and many are easier to identify. An object is fully resolved on the retina when the exit pupil is about 1 mm, although this is impracticably small for binoculars. • The higher magnification results in greater contrast because the sky itself is an extended object and consequently dimmed by greater magnification. • Smaller exit pupils imply smaller real fields of view, so lateral chromatic aberra- tion is reduced. The obvious disadvantages are: • Extended objects are fainter than they are with a larger exit pupil, assuming the eye can accommodate the larger pupil. • Larger exit pupils imply lower magnifications, with consequently more relaxed tolerances for collimation between the tubes. Small Focal Ratio and Aberrations Most binoculars have objectives that operate at around f/4 or f/5, although there are some specialist astronomical binoculars, intended for use at relatively high magnification, that have greater focal ratios. Most optical aberrations are exacerbated with “fast” (i.e., low focal ratio, thus photographically “fast”) objectives. For a normal achromatic doublet that does not use exotic glasses, the rule of thumb is that the focal ratio must be no less than three times the diameter of the aperture, measured in inches (1 inch = 25.4 mm), for axial (longitudinal) color correction to be acceptable. This is equivalent to stating that a 50-mm objective must work at f/6 and a 100 mm at f/12, or that the limit for f/5 is 42 mm. This latter equivalent is a reason for the good reputation for optical quality of many 42 mm binoculars. If optical quality is to be maintained at greater apertures without a concomitant increase in focal ratio, either expensive exotic glasses or extra len elements or both must be employed. Several modern astronomical binoculars have slower focal ratios, such as f/7.5 or f/8. Lower focal ratios have light cones that are more obtuse; and obtuse light cones are more demanding of eyepiece quality than those that are more acute. This means that for image quality not to be compromised, better eyepieces are needed and thus greater expense is required. 4"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Conclusion There are many aspects of telescope astronomy that are unavailable to the binoc- ular user.

Why Binoculars? 5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO There are three main parts to a binocular’s optical system: • Objective lens assembly . Its function is to gather light from the object and form an image at the image plane. • Eyepiece lens assembly . Its function is to examine the image at the image plane, rendering it visible to the observer’s eyes. • Image orientation correction . In modern binoculars this is usually a prism assem- bly. In large binoculars this may also require the eyepieces to be at 45- or 90- degree angles to the main optical tube. Binoculars are usually classified by the type of prism assembly they use (e.g., “Porro prism binocular” or “roof prism binocular”) (Figure 2.1). Astronomical observation is exceptionally demanding of optical quality; this applies equally to binoculars as to telescopes, despite the much lower magnification usually used in the former. Hence, binoculars used for anything other than casual scanning of the sky as a preliminary to using another instrument need to be of the highest optical quality you can afford. Once you have used a high-quality astro- nomical binocular it is very difficult to use one of lesser quality without being dis- satisfied, even irritated, by it. Objective Lens Assemblies The objective lens consists of two or more lens elements in an achromatic or apoc- hromatic configuration. The achromatic doublet is the most common lens in “stan- dard” binoculars, but high-quality binoculars, particularly large astronomical Binocular Optics and Mechanics 7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy binoculars, may have an apochromatic triplet. There may also be additional lenses to correct for other optical aberrations such as spherical aberration (SA), coma, or field curvature. Achromats bring two wavelengths (colors) of light to the same focus. A simple achromatic doublet would have a biconvex element of crown glass in front of a weaker diverging element of flint glass. Modern achromats may use special glasses, such as extra-low dispersion (ED) glass, in order to give better color correction. Apochromats, which bring three wavelengths of light to the same focus, may employ expensive (but brittle) fluorite glass. Large aperture astronomical binoculars have objectives of relatively small focal ratio, often as small as f/5, and sometimes less. An achromatic doublet of 100-mm aperture with a focal ratio of f/5 will have significant chromatic aberration, espe- cially off-axis, no matter which glasses are used. This can be particularly obtrusive on bright objects, such as the Moon or the naked-eye planets. Even a fluorite apoc- hromat of this aperture and focal ratio will show off-axis false color on these objects. 8 Porro prisms Pechan roof prisms Focusing lens Objective Prism assembly Eyepiece Figure 2.1. Light-path through prismatic binoculars."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Eyepieces Binocular eyepieces usually consist of three or more lenses in two or more groups. The most common is the venerable Kellner configuration, a design dating from 1849 that consists of a singlet field lens and a doublet eye lens. Increasingly common are reversed Kellners, a design that was introduced in 1975 by David Rank of the Edmund Scientific Company and used in its RKE eyepieces. The field lens is the doublet and the eye lens is a singlet. The reversed Kellner has the advantages of a slightly wider field (50 degrees as opposed to the 45 degrees of a Kellner), over 50 percent more eye relief, and of working better with the short focal ratios that typify binocular objectives. Wide field binoculars usually use modifications of Erfle eyepieces. These consist of five or six elements in three groups. They can have a field of up to about 70 degrees, but eye relief tends to suffer when the field exceeds about 65 degrees (Figure 2.2). Prisms The prisms in binoculars serve primarily to correct the inverted and laterally reversed image that would otherwise result from the objective and eyepiece alone. A secondary effect is that they fold the light path, so that the binocular is shorter than it would otherwise be, making it easier to handle. As stated above, binoculars are often classified according to their prism type. For modern binoculars without angled eyepieces, there are two basic types: the Porro prism and the roof prism.

Some common binocular eyepieces."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy The Porro prism assembly consists of two isosceles right-angled prisms mounted with their hypotenuses facing each other but with their long axes exactly perpendicular. This latter point is crucial; if they are not exactly at right angles, image rotation (usually referred to as “lean” when it applies to binoculars) will occur. The angle of lean is twice the angle of misalignment and opposite in direc- tion (i.e., a clockwise misalignment of 0.5 degrees will result in an anticlockwise lean of 1.0 degree. The light path in Porro prisms is shown in Figure 2.3. There are four reflections, so the result is a right-handed image. The mutually perpendicu- lar orientation of the prism hypotenuses results in one prism erecting the image and the other reverting it. It is possible, especially when they are used with objectives of low focal ratio, for Porro prisms to reflect rays that are not parallel to the optical axis in such a manner that they are internally reflected off the hypotenuse of the prism (Figure 2.4a). The ray then emerges from the prism, having been reflected a third time, and contributes only optical “noise” to the image, thus reducing contrast. This extra reflection can be eliminated by putting a groove across the center of the hypotenuse (Figure 2.4b). Grooved prisms are a feature of better-quality Porro prism binoculars. A development of the Porro prism is the Abbé Erecting System, also known as a Porro Type-2 prism (Figures 2.5 and 2.6). Its lateral offset is 77 percent that of an equivalent Porro prism assembly 1 , and for this reason it is most frequently 10 Figure 2.3.

An important consideration is the glass used for the prism.

A higher refractive index results in a smaller critical angle, 39.6 degrees in BaK4 as compared to 41.2 degrees in BK7), so there is less light likely to be lost because of nontotal internal reflection in the prisms (Figure 2.7). The difference is more noticeable in wide angle binoculars with objec- tive lenses that have a focal ratio of f/5 or less. The nontotal internal reflection of the peripheral rays of light come from the objective results in vignetting of the image. This effect can easily be seen by holding the binocular up to a light sky or other light surface and examining the exit pupil. The exit pupil of a binocular with BaK4 prisms will be perfectly round, while that of a binocular with BK7 prisms will have tell-tale blue-gray segments around it (Figure 2.8). (Note: Figure 2.8b was taken from a slight angle in order to show the nature of the vignette segments. Viewed from directly behind the exit pupil, there is a square central region with vignette segments on four sides.) The roof prism is shown in Figure 2.9.

The combination is a compact inversion and reversion prism that results in an almost “straight through” light path. The consequence is a very compact binocular. There is, of course, a limit to the aperture of the roof prism binoculars that is imposed by the “straight through” light path because, the centers of the objectives cannot be separated by more than the observer’s interpupillary distance (IPD). Although the roof prism configuration is physically smaller and thus uses less material in its construction, it tends to be significantly more expensive than a Porro prism binocular of equivalent optical quality. This is because the prism system, 16 A B C D E F H G Figure 2.11. Schmidt roof prism. The image is inverted and reverted.

Any thickness or irregularity in the ridge of the roof will result in visible flares, particularly from bright high-contrast objects (i.e. many astronomical targets). Additionally, a result of the wave nature of light is that interference can occur when a bundle (a.k.a. pencil) of rays is separated and recombined, as happens with a roof prism. The consequence is a reduction in contrast. This can be ameliorated by the application of a “phase coating” to the faces of the roof. Binoculars with phase coatings usually have “PC” as part of their designation (see Appendix F). As you will see from Figure 2-9, the light in a roof prism undergoes six reflec- tions (as compared to four in a Porro prism binocular). This results in a “right- handed” image. The same is true of the Abbe-König roof prisms found in the best roof-prism binoculars. A consequence of the extra reflection and the extra lens (as compared to Porro prisms) is more light loss. In order to achieve a similar quality of image, better anti-reflective coatings need to be used. The demand for better quality of the optical elements and their coatings in roof- prism binoculars means that they will inevitably be more expensive than Porro prism binoculars of equivalent optical quality. They do, however, offer three dis- tinct advantages: • They are more compact. This makes them slightly easier to pack and carry; some people (I am one) find the smaller size easier and more comfortable to hold because of the different ergonomics. • They are usually slightly lighter. This makes them easier to carry and generally less tiring to hold. • They are easier to waterproof because of the internal focusing. Although one does not normally do astronomy in the rain (the possible exception being the nocturnal equivalent of a “monkeys’ wedding”), nitrogen-filled waterproof binoculars are immune to internal condensation in damp/dewy conditions and will not suffer from possible water penetration when used for other purposes such as bird watching or racing. It is a matter of personal judgment whether these advantages warrant the extra expense. I find that, on account of their relative lightness and compactness, I observe with my 10 × 42 roof prisms far more than I do with my 10 × 50 Porro prisms. An increasing number of astronomical binoculars have 45- or 90-degree eye- pieces. There are a wide variety of prism combinations that will achieve this, such as a Porro Type-2 with a Semi Penta prism for 45 degrees or with a Penta prism for 90 degrees. Another 45-degree system uses a Schmidt roof with a rhomboid. Binoviewers use a combination of a beam splitter and a pair of rhomboidal prisms (Figures 2.12 and 2.13). The beam splitter divides the light into two mutu- ally perpendicular optical paths. A rhomboidal prism merely displaces the axis of the light path without either inverting or reverting it. In some binoviewers pairs of mirrors perform the same function. Cylindrical light tubes may be used to ensure that the optical path length is identical on both sides. Interpupillary dis- tance is adjusted by hinging the device along the axis of the light path from the objective lens or primary mirror.

The intervening space is filled with a silicon-based oil of very high refractive index. Microelectronic circuitry senses vibration and actuates the vari-angle prisms so as to compensate for the change in orientation of the binoculars. Coatings The most important coatings in binoculars are the antireflective coatings on the surfaces of the optical components.

The coatings are usually optimized for a particular wavelength of light, usually in the range 510 to 550 nm. A single coating of a quarter of the wavelength of light will reflect a small proportion of the incident light. The glass behind it will reflect another small proportion. The path length of the wave reflected off the glass is half (2 × .25) a wavelength greater; the two reflected waves mutually interfere destructively, eliminating the reflection for that particular wavelength (Figures 2.15 and 2.16). At wavelengths significantly distant from the wavelength for which the coating is optimized, interference may be constructive, resulting in more reflected energy than would have occurred in uncoated glass. Additional layers of half- and quarter-wave thickness can reduce reflections at other wavelengths; this is called “multicoating” (Figure 2.17) and “broadband multicoating” (Figure 2.18). Coating is an expensive process, so there are a number of coatings that become uneconomical. It is rare to find more than seven layers on any surface in com- mercial binoculars. Binocular coatings are qualitatively described as “coated,” “fully multicoated,” and so forth. There is no universally agreed meaning to these designations, but they are commonly held to have the following meanings: • Coated : At least one glass-to-air surface (usually the outer surface of the objec- tive) has a single layer of antireflective coating, usually MgF 2 ; other surfaces are uncoated. • Fully coated : All glass-to-air surfaces of the lenses (but not the prism hypo- tenuses) have a layer of antireflective coating. 20 S Light from a source, S, reflects off the surface of the film (X) and off the film/substrate boundary (Y).

There are six optical aberrations that may affect the image produced by a telescope. Some affect the quality of the image, others affect its position. They are: • Chromatic aberration: error of quality • Spherical aberration: error of quality • Coma: error of quality • Astigmatism: error of quality • Field curvature: error of position • Distortion: error of position Chromatic aberration is an error of refractive systems and is therefore of con- sideration for all binoculars. Because any light that does not impinge normally on a refractive surface will be dispersed, single converging lenses will bring different wavelengths (colors) of light to different foci, with the red end of the optical spec- trum being most distant from the lens. This is longitudinal (or axial ) chromatic aberration. Lateral chromatic aberration manifests as different wavelengths of light forming different size images. It is sometimes referred to as color fringing , which is descriptive of the visual effect of its presence. Visible chromatic aberration can exist in objective lenses and eyepieces. Chro- matic aberration can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using multiple lens ele- ments of different refractive indices and dispersive powers. An achromatic lens has two elements and brings two colors to the same focus (Figure 2.20). The choice of glass and lens design will determine not only which colors are brought to the same focus, but also the distance over which the secondary spec- trum is focused. An apochromatic lens uses three elements and will bring three colors to the same focus. Spherical aberration is an error of spherical refractive and reflective surfaces that results in peripheral rays of light being brought to different foci to those near the axis (Figure 2.21). If the peripheral rays are brought to a closer focus than the near-axial rays, the system is undercorrected . If they are brought to a more distant focus, the system is overcorrected . Spherical mirrors and converging lenses are undercorrected and diverging lenses are overcorrected. In compound lenses, spherical aberration can be suppressed in the design of the lens by using several lenses of minimal curvature as a substitute for one of con- siderable curvature, by choosing appropriate curvatures for the converging and diverging elements, or as a combination of both. In Newtonian mirrors, such as those used in most reflecting binocular telescopes, the spherical aberration is cor- rected by progressively deepening the central part of the mirror so that all regions focus paraxial rays to the same point. The shape of the surface is then paraboloid , that is the surface that results from a parabola being rotated about is axis. There are other manifestations of spherical aberration, the most common of which is zonal aberration, in which different zones of the objective lens or primary mirror have different focal lengths. Spherical aberration increases as a direct cubic function of an increase in aperture and is independent of field angle. 24"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Coma is a lop-sided spherical aberration. If an objective lens is corrected for paraxial rays, then any abaxial ray cannot be an axis of revolution for the lens surface and different parts of the incident beam of which that ray is a part will focus at different distances from the lens. The further off-axis the object, the greater the effect will be. The resulting image of a star tends to flare away from the optical axis of the telescope, having the appearance of a comet, from which the aberration gets its name. In objective lenses, coma can be reduced or eliminated by having the coma of one element counteracted by the coma of another.

Coma increases as direct square (quadratic) function of aperture increase and increases as a linear function of increase in field angle. Astigmatism results from a different focal length for rays in one plane as com- pared to the focal length of rays in a different plane. A cylindrical lens, for example, will exhibit astigmatism because the curvature of the refracting surface differs for the rays in each plane and the image of a point source will be a line (Figure 2.23). Astigmatism will, therefore , result from any optical element with a surface that is not a figure of revolution. It can also occur in surfaces that are figures of re- volution. Consider two mutually perpendicular diameters across a beam of light impinging obliquely upon a lens surface. The curvature of the lens under one diameter differs from that under the other, and thus astigmatism will result. Such astigmatism can be corrected by an additional optical element that introduces equal and opposite astigmatism. Astigmatism is not normally a problem in binoc- ulars, which are primarily used for visual work, unless they have very wide fields. Astigmatism increases linearly with an increase in aperture and as a direct square (quadratic) function of an increase in field angle. Field Curvature No single optical surface will produce a flat image—the image is focused on a surface that is a sphere tangential to the focal plane at its intersec- tion with the optical axis (Figure 2.24). Field curvature , which manifests as the inability to focus the periphery of the image at the same time as the center is focused, is particularly noticeable when it is present in widefield binoculars. It can be corrected in the design of the lenses. In particular, if a negative lens can be placed close to the image plane, it will flatten the field.

Distortion is an aberration by which a square object gives an image with either convex lines ( negative or barrel distortion ) or concave lines ( positive or pincushion distortion ). It is the only aberration that does not produce blurring of the image (Figure 2.25). It results from differential magnification at different distances from the optical axis. It almost always originates in the eyepiece, so any correction should be inherent in eyepiece design. A small amount of pincushion distortion can be desirable because it attenuates the “rolling ball” effect that results in an undistorted field of view (see Chapter 3). Distortion is unaffected by aperture and increases as a direct function of the cube of field angle. Aperture Stops and Vignetting Vignetting is the loss of light, usually around the periphery of an image, as a con- sequence of an incomplete bundle passing through the optical system. A vignetted image appears dimmer around the periphery. 28 Original object Positive or ‘Pincushion’ distortion Undistorted image Negative or ‘Barrel’ distortion Figure 2.25. Distortion."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Most binoculars suffer from some degree of vignetting. The exception is some binoculars designed specifically for astronomical use whose construction is based on astronomical refracting telescopes which themselves give unvignetted images. In some, vignetting can be so severe that no part of the image is illuminated by the complete aperture. In normal daylight use, we do not notice vignetting unless it is exceptionally severe; 30 percent is common and 50 percent is sometimes deemed acceptable in wideangle systems. This is because, at any given time, only a tiny region of the image can be examined by the fovea, it is, therefore, only this region that needs to be fully illuminated. As long as the fall-off of illumination toward the periphery is smooth, it will not normally be noticed. Binocular astronomers who, like other astronomers, echo the call for “more light!” sometimes wonder why vignetting is allowed to occur at all. To understand this, we must first understand the role of the aperture stop. An aperture stop crops the light cone and eliminates the most peripheral rays. These peripheral rays have the highest angles of incidence on the optical surfaces and undergo the most refractive bending. For these reasons they also carry with them the greatest amount of aberration. If they are permitted to pass through to your eye, they will add to the degradation of the image. Part of the process of good optical design is to assess how much of the peripheral light needs to be excluded. If bundles of rays from all parts of the field of view fill the aperture stop, then there is no vignetting. On the other hand, if some other mechanical or optical component impedes some of this light, vignetting will occur. An unvignetted binocular requires larger optical apertures all the way through the optical system when compared to one in which vignetting does not occur. This in turn requires larger optical components (such as prisms or focusing lenses). Larger components are not only more expensive, but are also heavier. Heavier components require heavier and more robust mountings. These in turn add to the expense of the binoculars. The overall result is a heavier, more expensive, binocular. In short, vignetted systems are usually smaller, lighter, and produce better images in com- parison to the equivalent unvignetted optical system. Somewhere in the design process a decision is made as to where an acceptable trade-off lies. The more dis- cerning observer may well be prepared to accept a more expensive instrument, but the general user will almost certainly not want to pay considerably more for a hardly noticeable increase in light throughput at the periphery. Even the discern- ing observer may balk at an increase in weight if the binoculars are intended to be hand held.

The disadvantages are that there is almost always some rocking of the bridge, which leads to difficulty in achieving and main- taining focus, the focusing system is difficult to seal so dirt can enter, and the optical tubes are extremely difficult to waterproof, resulting in increased likelihood of internal condensation (Figure 2.27). Center Focus (Roof Prism) Like the Porro prism, with the center focus system there is an external focus wheel and an independent helical focuser (dioptre adjustment) for the right eyepiece (Figure 2.26b), but the similarity ends there. The mechanism is internal, and focus- ing is achieved by changing the position of a focusing lens between the objective lens and the prism assembly (Figure 2.1).

The best quality astronomical (and marine and military) binoculars have independent focusing. The disadvantage is that the eyepieces cannot be focused simultaneously, but this is not an issue for astronomical observation, where refocusing is not nec- essary once good focus has been attained (Figure 2.29). 32 Figure 2.28.

They must not only be aligned to each other, but also to the hinge or other axis about which interpupillary distance is adjusted. If this latter criterion is not met, the result is a phenomenon called con- ditional alignment in which the two optical axes are only aligned at the inter- pupillary distance that was set during collimation and will get progressively out of alignment for other interpupillary distances. This may be acceptable if only one person uses the binoculars. The permitted divergence of the optical axes from true parallelism is deter- mined by the ability of the eyes to accommodate divergence and by the magnification of the binoculars.

Acceptable tolerances in the apparent field of view are: • Vertical misalignment (step, dipvergence): 15 arcmin • Horizontal convergence: 2 45 arcmin • Horizontal divergence: 20 arcmin To ascertain the real tolerances, you need to divide these by the magnification to obtain the collimation tolerances listed in Table 2.1. There are two ways in which the optical axes of the binoculars can be aligned. In almost all binoculars, the objective lenses are mounted in eccentric rings. These can be adjusted to move the optical axis in relation to the body of the binocular. In many other binoculars, the prisms are adjustable, either by grub screws (set screws) that are accessible from the outside or by being housed in a cluster whose adjustment screws are accessible by removing the cover plate on the prism housing. (See Chapter 5 for advice on how to collimate a binocular.) Collimation by eccentric rings on the objectives is preferable because tilting the prisms will result in the introduction of more astigmatism. Bibliography Fischer, R.E., and Tadic-Galeb, B.

There are different conventions for the use of “convergence” (and “divergence”), depend- ing on whether the optical axes of the binocular are converging or the optical axes of the eyes are converging (to accommodate the diverging optical axes of the binocular). The usage here is the latter. It is simple to tell which convention is being used: the greater value is for converging eyes (diverging binoculars). 34 Table 2.1.

Binocular Specifications Binoculars are specified by a series of numbers and letters, for example, 15 × 70 BIF.GA.WA. The numbers tell you the size of the binocular and the letters give addi- tional information. The first number is the angular magnification, the second is the aperture of the objective lens in millimeters. The example therefore has a magnification (“power”) of 15, an aperture of 70 mm, a body of Bausch & Lomb (a.k.a. “American”) construction (B), individually focusing eyepieces (IF), rubber armour (GA), and wide-angle eyepieces (WA). There is a complete list of designa- tion letters in Appendix F. The numbers in the binocular specifications give rise to a variety of binocular ratings that are sometimes quoted by manufacturers and vendors. The most common are: • Relative Brightness . This is the square of the diameter of the exit pupil. The exit pupil diameter is calculated by dividing the aperture by the magnification (power). For example, for 10 × 50, the exit pupil is 5 mm and the relative bright- ness is (50/10) 2 = 5 2 = 25. However the calculation for a 20 × 100 binocular, through which a great deal more can be seen, gives exactly the same relative brightness: Choosing Binoculars 35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy (100/20) 2 = 5 2 = 25, so this is an inadequate rating to use for astronomical binoc- ulars. Incidentally, this is also the relative brightness that is calculated for the Mark-I eyeball (1 × 5) of a human being approximately 60 years old! Whereas it does give information about the surface brightness of extended objects, it says little about the overall performance. I have no doubt that I see far more in my 10 × 50 binoculars than I do with the naked eye, and that I see significantly more in my 20 × 100 binocular. • Tw i l i g h t I n d e x or Twilight Performance Factor . This was used by Carl Zeiss Inter- national as an indication of the distances at which comparable detail would be seen in different binoculars. It is calculated by finding the square root of the product of the magnification and aperture. For the two binoculars above the cal- culations are: In this instance, the larger instrument has an index that is double that of the smaller instrument. In other words, if the smaller binocular is used to observe a target object at a given distance from the observer, the same amount of detail will be visible at double the distance in the larger instrument. This is not really applicable to visual observational astronomy where we are usually not concerned with the relative distances of objects and consider them to be effectively at the same distance. • Visibility Factor . Roy Bishop devised the method to evaluate the visibility factor simply by multiplying the magnification by the aperture in millimeters. For our two binoculars above we obtain: 10 × 50 = 500 20 × 100 = 2000 The larger instrument has a visibility factor four times greater than the smaller one. Bishop justifies this by stating: “in the larger instrument stars will be four times brighter and extended images will have four times the area from which the eyes can glean information, with luminances being the same.” 1 While this is objectively correct, I am not convinced that it reflec ts the subjective experience of observing through both instruments. • Astro Index . Alan Adler’s 2 astro index evaluates the product of the magnification and the square root of the aperture in millimeters. For our two binoculars above, we obtain: This gives the larger instrument an astro Index of 2.8 times the smaller one; this is certainly closer to the experience of observing through them. Others have tried to expand on these by including the effects of coatings, baffles, and other aspects of individual quality, but, although these may be more precise, they incorporate a certain amount of empirical experimental data and are not as valuable for a quick evaluation, prior to purchase, of likely performance. 3 .10 50 10 7 1 71 20 100 20 10 200 ×=×= ×=×= . . 10 50 500 22 36 20 100 2000 44 72 × () == × () == 36"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Field of View In addition to the magnification and aperture, the other numerical factor that is usually stated is the field of view. This is quoted in one of three ways: • Degrees . This is the most useful factor for astronomers, since it gives you an indi- cation of the amount of sky you will be able to see. The area of sky that will be visible is directly proportional to the square of the angular field. • Metres at 1,000 Meters . This factor is more useful for terrestrial use and is cur- rently the most commonly found alternative to degrees. The approximate con- version of this to degrees is to divide by 17.5. Thus 87 m at 1,000 m ≈ (87/17.45)° = 5°. There is a conversion chart given in Appendix H. • Feet at 1,000 Yards . This factor is more useful for terrestrial use and is currently most often found on binoculars intended for the U.S. market. The approximate conversion of this to degrees is to divide by 52. Thus 364 ft at 1,000 yd ≈ (364/52)° = 7°. There is a conversion chart given in Appendix H. Most, but not all, people prefer a wide field of view for astronomy. The true field of view is dependent on the magnification and the apparent field of view of the eyepiece: True field = Apparent field ÷ Magnification Strictly speaking, an eyepiece can have an extremely large field of view, but this deteriorates rapidly toward the edge, so it is limited by a field stop. There is always a trade-off between field of view and edge quality. In general, a 50-degree apparent field is a “standard” field, 65 degrees and above is considered to be “wide angle,” and 80 degrees and above is designated “ultrawide angle.” By comparison, the field of view of the unaided eyes is approximately 45 degrees (excluding peripheral vision). Some manufacturers tend to be optimistic in their stated fields of view. In practice, 65 degrees appears to be the upper limit for an apparent field; all binocu- lars I have used with wider apparent fields have suffered from severe deterioration of quality and easily noticeable vignetting in the outer part of the field, and those of ultrawide angle have also appeared to have a poorer image quality even in the center of the field when compared to standard field binoculars of a similar price. Another problem associated with some very wide field eyepieces is the effect that is colloquially called “kidney-beaning” or “flying shadows.” The colloquial names are descriptive of what you see if your eyepieces are afflicted with this problem, the correct name being spherical aberration of the exit pupil . Different zones of the exit pupil are focused at different distances from the eyepiece, so your eye is unable to focus on the entire field at once. If your eye is slightly off center, the result is these flying shadows that are the shape of kidney beans . They tend to be worse at night when your pupils are more dilated, and some people seem to be more bothered by them than others. While wide field views are an attraction to many people (a 7-degree field shows an area of sky twice as large as a 5-degree field), magnification is an extremely important factor for binocular astronomy, and a small cluster, nebula, or galaxy that is detectable at × 10 may appear to be stellar at × 7.

It is the posi- tion of what physics textbooks call the “eye ring” and can be defined as the posi- tion of the image that the eyepiece forms of the objective lens. At this distance you will be able to see the entire field of view and will have the brightest possible image. Over the past decade manufacturers have become more aware that spectacle wearers will seek out binoculars with adequate eye relief to enable them to see the whole field of view. As with fields of view, several manufacturers tend to be some- what “optimistic” in their quoted eye relief so, if you need to wear spectacles for observing, you should verify in practice that the binoculars have a suitable eye relief. So that binoculars can be used by people both with and without spectacles, they will have eye cups that are either twist-down or fold-down to enable the correct positioning of your eye (Figure 3.1). As eye relief increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to position your eye precisely behind the eyepieces. This can exacerbate the kidney bean effect if it is present. Hand-held Binoculars Hand-held binoculars are the choice for extreme portability, casual observing, and as a preliminary “sky-scanner” used in conjunction with a larger instrument. Almost all binoculars, including cheap plastic opera glasses, will show you more than the naked eye, but a sensible lower limit of aperture for portable astronomi- cal binoculars is 30 mm. If extreme portability is not an issue, 40 mm is significantly better as it will admit more than 75 percent more light. As aperture increases, so does the weight of the binocular, making it increasingly difficult to hold steadily. The sensible upper limit of aperture for hand-holding is normally considered to be 50 mm. Larger apertures than this can be held for short periods, but are too tiring to use for anything other than very brief views. For many years the commonsense view was that the limit to magnification for hand-held 50-mm binoculars was × 7. This is probably because 7 × 50 was, and still is, the most common size of hand-held marine binoculars. While it is true that they are easier to hold steady than, say 10 × 50, most of us do not do our astronomy from the moving deck of a boat. There are very few astronomical objects that are better at 7 × 50 than at 10 × 50, and it is perfectly possible to hold 10 × 50 binoculars sufficiently steady when our observing platform is the ground (see Chapter 6).The increased magnification of the 10 × 50 allows us to see more detail and generally gives more satisfying views. This is reflected in its higher rating in every perfor- mance index except relative brightness, and even this difference is reduced for those of us whose pupils do not dilate sufficiently to enable us to use the full 7-mm exit pupil of the 7 × 50 (Figure 3.2). There is perennial debate on whether, if you use small or medium-sized binoc- ulars for astronomy, you should use Porro prism or roof prism binoculars. The"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy conventional wisdom is that Porro prism binoculars are better for astronomy. While it is certainly true that for the same price Porro prism binoculars tend to have superior optical quality, good quality roof prism binoculars are as optically and mechanically good as good quality Porro prism binoculars. The roof prism binoculars tend to be lighter and more compact and are therefore generally easier and more comfortable to hold. Over recent years I have found that I use my 10 × 42 roof prisms more than my 10 × 50 Porro prisms, and a side-by-side comparison shows that I see no more in the Porros when I hand-hold them, although they do show very slightly more when they are mounted. Roof prism binoculars also have the advantage that they can more easily be made waterproof, as the focusing mech- anism is usually internal. If you choose Porro prism binoculars, you may also have a choice between center-focus and independent eyepiece focus. There are no advantages to center focus if the binoculars are to be used exclusively for astronomy, but if you intend to use them for terrestrial purposes (e.g., bird watching or horse racing) then you should get center focus. My preference for astronomy is independent focusing eye- pieces. They tend to be more mechanically robust, do not suffer from a rocking bridge, and modern ones tend to be waterproof and nitrogen filled, reducing the likelihood of internal fogging. Another option for hand-held binoculars is image stabilization. This feature incorporates an electronic system that compensates for motion and vibration. Dif- ferent manufacturers employ different stabilization systems, which were developed initially for military surveillance and not for astronomy. A test report in Sky&Tele- scope suggests that the best stabilization system for astronomical observation is that employed by Canon, whose optics were also superior. 4 In addition to the sta- bilization system, the optics are essentially a roof prism system with a field flattener (see Chapter 2) incorporated into the design. The stabilization system (see Chapter 2) compensates for shake and the result is that you can see fainter objects and more detail. A 10 × 30 IS binocular will show most people more than a conventional 10 × 50. While a 10 × 30 IS is sufficiently lightweight (600 g/1.25 lb) to be held for rel- atively long periods, the larger 15 × 50 IS and 18 × 50 IS are heavy enough to be tiring 40 Figure 3.2.

If you are considering purchasing image stabilized binoculars, you should be aware that the image stabilization mechanism requires battery power, and that the life of batteries, particularly alkaline batteries, is reduced in cold weather. Without power, the binoculars can be used as conven- tional binoculars (Figure 3.3). Mounted Binoculars All binoculars will show more if they are mounted because this eliminates the jiggles of being held. Even a small binocular will show objects a magnitude or so fainter if it is mounted. If binoculars are going to be a main observing instrument, it makes sense to acquire one of greater aperture and magnification than can be held. Big binoculars in the aperture range of 60 to 100 mm have become readily available in recent years (Figure 3.4). Once you are dealing with big binoculars, you are dealing with specialist instruments and can expect them to have features that enhance the ease and pleasure of astronomical observing. These may include: • Mounting Plate. Because big binoculars necessarily have to be mounted, it is common for them to incorporate a plate, with quarter-inch threaded holes, for direct mounting to a photographic tripod or other mounting. This eliminates the need for an L-bracket, which inevitably introduces an additional potential source of instability and is yet another essential piece of equipment that has to be remembered (Figure 3.5). • Angled Eyepieces. There is little to recommend in straight-through binoculars for astronomical observing. They are considerably less comfortable than those with angled eyepieces when you are observing at high elevations. Angled eyepieces also permit the use of photographic or video tripods and heads because they eliminate the need to “limbo-dance” under the tripod when you observe objects of high elevation. • Interchangeable Eyepieces. If binoculars are mounted, interchangeable eyepieces become functionally useful. The ability to change magnification permits, within Choosing Binoculars 41 Figure 3.3.

On the other hand, their advocates report this feature to be extremely useful. Binocular Telescopes The distinction between “binoculars” and “binocular telescopes” is fuzzy to say the least. The latter term is usually, but not exclusively, applied to binoculars larger than 150 mm (6 inch) aperture, binoculars that use Newtonian- or Cassegrainian- type optical systems, and those that are constructed from optical tubes initially intended or sold as telescope tubes, usually using eyepieces that are sold for tele- scopes. The majority are home constructed, but there are also commercially avail- able models (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). When these telescopes are home constructed, it is crucial to have a good focus- ing mechanism that also allows for collimation. These instruments often work at higher magnifications than equivalent binoculars, and, thus, collimation tolerances are significantly more severe. Typically, they have to be recollimated every time they are used, so ease of collimation is a must (Figure 3.8).

The rationale for their use is that they offer some of the advantages of binoculars with few attendant disadvantages. The obvious advantages are the reduction in eye strain from using two eyes, the suppression of the blind spot, and the aesthetics of false stereopsis (see Chapter 1). The obvious disadvantage is the loss of light into each eye that results from the splitting of the light into two optical paths and from the additional optical elements in each light path. While binocular summation (see Chapter 1) can compensate for some of this loss, the overall perception is that using a binoviewer is equivalent to a loss of about one third of the illumination as compared to a single eyepiece. In addition, the cost of providing matching eyepiece pairs, thus doubling the number of eyepieces required when compared to a conventional telescope, is not one that can be ignored, especially where good quality eyepieces are used. However, this is ame- liorated to some extent by the development of binoviewers that incorporate the facility of multiple magnifications without changing eyepieces. An advantage that is not common to conventional binoculars is the ability to use high magnifications without the need to collimate two optical tubes. Another is that their use with telescopes of large aperture provides an equivalent aperture that would be significantly more expensive and technologically difficult to achieve with binoculars or binocular telescopes. A less obvious advantage when they are used at high power concerns “floaters.” Floaters are strands of protein that float within the transparent humors of the eye and become apparent, sometimes dis- tractingly so, when one is observing with a small exit pupil.

If you are considering a binoviewer, you should ascertain its clear aperture, as this will place a limit on the lowest power of eyepiece that you can use effectively. In cheaper units this can be as little as 20 mm, restricting the eyepieces to those with a field stop less than or equal to this. You should also ascertain whether your telescope has sufficient back focus to permit it to be used with a binoviewer; a Barlow lens in the “nose” of the binoviewer may enable this. Finally, you should consider those that have self-centering eyepiece holders as this will eliminate any miscollimation that may otherwise result from slightly undersized eyepiece barrels being held off-center by thumbscrews. Zoom Binoculars The question of zoom binoculars is one that inevitably arises, not least because there are good quality zoom telescopes and good quality astronomical zoom eye- pieces on the market. I once made the comment that a decent zoom binocular for astronomy had yet to be invented. A vastly experienced binocular repairman, Bill Cook, retorted to the effect that my qualification “for astronomy” was redundant. The reasons for this are simple. Not only must the eyepieces zoom to within 1 percent of exactly the same rate (which means absolutely no perceptible rocking of the bridge), but a zoom binocular requires a system with moveable optical ele- ments that must hold collimation, ideally to better than an arcminute where step (a.k.a. dipvergence, a.k.a. supravergence) is concerned if one is approaching × 30; for the × 125 that I have seen advertised for some zoom binoculars, this translates to better than 15 arcseconds! Now, consider how many good quality center-focus × 30 binoculars you know of—I don’t know of any, and I am sure that part of the reason must be that it would be a feat of technological brilliance (not to say"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"expense!) to bridge two eyepieces in such a way that they maintain collimation to within the tolerances that are required. (And remember that it is unlikely that they will have a “base tolerance” of zero error.) According to Seyfried, zoom binoculars were developed as a “gimmick to stim- ulate sales” on the back of the success of zoom lenses for cameras. 5 He also asserts that the frequency with which they fail results in their being disproportionately represented at binocular repair facilities and states that he has never seen a zoom binocular that can hold collimation.

On the reasoning that “you can’t go wrong at that price,” the colleague acquired a pair for his son, who was very pleased with them. Upon hearing of this, another colleague went to the gas station and bought a pair for herself. When she got home and tried them out, she found that they gave a double image, obviously a case of poor collimation. She returned them, where the sales assistant took them and, without even checking them, placed them in a box and replaced them with a new pair out of another box. My colleague was satisfied with the replacement pair and pleased with the “service” she received from the gas station. A few weeks later, I took a group of students to see an international cricket match; one of them was the son of the first colleague, who brought his new binoculars with him. As usually happens, these binoculars were passed around among the students, most of whom had never used binoculars at a sporting event, and they were impressed with the magnified image and wanted repeated looks through the binoc- ulars. To ease the demand, I passed around my good (but by no means superb) quality 10 × 42. Every student immediately noticed the difference and it was obvious that none had used binoculars of this quality before. As one put it: “These are amazing, Mr. Tonkin. They are even clearer than eyesight!” The colleague’s son was, as you can imagine, a bit deflated because his binoculars seemed so inferior. I pointed out that mine had cost almost exactly a hundred times the cost of his.

Honor was satisfied and we got on with enjoy- ing the match, albeit with my binoculars having far more use than the budget ones. This pair of episodes illustrates several things: • Over the past few decades binocular manufacturing methods have improved to the extent that, without any but the most rudimentary quality control checks, binoculars of reasonable quality can be produced remarkably cheaply. Budget quality binoculars can be produced so cheaply that they are effectively dispos- able items. • It is far more cost-effective for manufacturers of all but the best quality binocu- lars to use the customer to do the quality control. It is cheaper merely to replace the unsatisfactory (to the customer) instruments than it is to employ quality control staff. • People will tend to be satisfied with poor quality unless they have something better with which to compare it. The consequence of this is that many instru- ments, which may have been rejected by effective quality control, will be accept- able to some customers, particularly if the price is right. • Differences in optical quality can often be immediately apparent, even to “untrained” people, most of whom are capable of performing simple tests for common aberrations. • Once you have used good quality binoculars it is difficult to be satisfied with less. However, we do become emotionally attached to our possessions and can readily justify poor quality on the grounds of price or some other comparative benefit like ultraportability. • Optics that are entirely free of aberrations exist only in the imagination and, to a large extent, the old adage that you get what you pay for still holds true. For recreational use, the determination of whether the extra quality is worth the extra price is almost entirely a subjective one. Hence, it is not only possible, but also very desirable, to be able to do some initial testing of binoculars in the store where they are bought. With the advent of the phenomenon that an ever increasing number of goods are bought, for reasons of cost, over the Internet or by mail, the same applies to testing upon receipt of the item. However, as you are aware, there is no substitute for the more demanding tests that astronomical use makes of binoculars, so it is important that you ensure that the vendor has a policy that will permit you to return them if they are unsat- isfactory when they are used under the stars. Preliminary Tests A very large amount of information can be gleaned from some very basic prelim- inary testing. This will eliminate binoculars that are grossly unsuitable. Remem- ber that with very few exceptions, aberrations, faults, or features that are merely irritating during initial testing will become infuriating under the stars. However, while you should not expect to find a binocular that is entirely free of all aberra- tions or faults, you should expect to find that they exist in lesser number and sever- ity in more expensive instruments.

Reject any binoculars that have “ruby” optical coatings, loose screws or screws with damaged heads, covering material that is not in complete close contact with the binocular housing, scuff marks anywhere, any evidence of dust or other foreign matter on the inside of the optics, or internal baffling that is not uniformly matte black. • Mechanical Overview. Give the binoculars a good shake. Reject any in which you feel or hear any movement of components. • Focus Mechanism. Run the focus mechanism through its full range. The feel should be uniform throughout the range and should not be too stiff or too loose. If it is stiff, it is very difficult to find a precise focus. If it is loose, it is difficult to maintain a good focus. Feel for any stiff regions or any “sloppy” regions. A dif- ferent feel in different regions is indicative of poor mechanical tolerances in manufacture. Feel for any difference between dynamic friction and static fric- tion (“stiction”) by stopping the focus at various points throughout the focal range and feeling for a slight jerk or “catch” when you start to refocus. This is usually due to poor-quality lubricant and makes precise focusing difficult. On binoculars that have individual eyepiece focusing, test each eyepiece focus individually. On center-focus eyepieces, remember to test the focus ring of the right-hand eyepiece. • The Bridge. The bridge is the pair of arms that connects the eyepieces to the center-post focus mechanism in Porro prism binoculars. All bridges will rock to some extent and, as they do so, they change the focus of either or both sides of the binocular. On well-made binoculars the rocking is minimal and requires con- siderable pressure, more than will be put on the eyepiece housing in normal use. On budget-quality binoculars there can be considerable rocking with minimal pressure. This rocking gets worse with age. To test the bridge for rocking, merely hold the binoculars by the prism housings with the eyepieces downward, then press down alternately on the eyepiece housings with the tips of the forefingers. The severity of any rocking becomes immediately apparent. If you are unsure how it will affect you, hold the binoculars to your eyes, focus on something and, by rocking the binoculars from side to side, put slight pressure alternately on each eyepiece housing with your eye socket. If the focus changes, reject the binoculars. • Interpupillary Distance (IPD) Adjustment. In hand-held binoculars, the IPD adjustment is usually the central hinge. For larger binoculars, it can be either a hinge or eccentrically rotating prism housings or eyepiece turrets. If it is loose, it is difficult to maintain any given IPD. If it is very stiff, or if it is jerky, it is difficult to set the IPD. If only one person is to use the binoculars at any one time, Evaluating Binoculars 51"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy this need not be a significant problem. Be aware that several center-hinge binoc- ulars need to be folded to near the minimum IPD in order to fit into the case; test if this is necessary with your IPD. Check that the IPD range accommodates all intended users. Most binoculars do not cover the entire range of IPDs for adults; this range is usually considered to be about 43 to 80 mm with a mean at around 65 mm, and about 90 percent of people have IPDs within 8 mm of the mean. Most binoculars do not deviate more than about 10 mm from the mean. If you know your IPD, the binocular IPD adjustment is easy to check merely by using a piece of card with your IPD marked on it and holding it over the binoc- ular eyepieces. If not, you can check this when you test the binoculars for optical quality (below). Check that the eyepieces go comfortably to your eyes when the IPD is set for you. If you have narrow-set or deep-set eyes, or if your nose has a wide bridge, this may not be possible for you especially with wide-angle eye- pieces, which are typically larger in diameter than “normal” ones (Figure 4.1). • Tripod Bush. You will be able to see significantly more with mounted binoculars than with unmounted ones, even if you do intend to use them primarily as a hand-held instrument. Most medium-sized modern binoculars have a quarter- inch UNC (20 t.p.i.) bush in the distal end of the center-post. This bush is covered by a cap, usually made of plastic, but sometimes of metal, which unscrews. Remove it and check the quality of the bush. If possible, try an L-bracket and ensure that you can easily connect the bracket to the binocular, with the thread of the L-bracket bolt easily meshing with the thread in the bush without danger of cross-threading. Remember that you will most likely be wanting to do this in the dark, possibly with cold or gloved hands. • Prisms. Hold the binoculars away from you, pointing toward something relatively bright (e.g., the sky or a light-colored wall or ceiling— not the Sun!), and look at 52 Figure 4.1. Wide- angle eyepieces (top) are of large diameter and may be unusable for people with narrow- set eyes or wide noses."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the bright circle of light in the eyepieces. If it is actually a circle, all well and good. If it is tending toward lozenge shaped, this is an indication of undersized prisms; undersized prisms are themselves indicative of cost-cutting. If there are blue- gray segments of the circle with a brighter lozenge inside, this is indicative of cheaper BK7 glass in the prisms (Figure 2.8). In both cases, the prisms will cause some vignetting of the image. With roof prism binoculars, bring them up to the eyes and carefully examine the image of the bright surface. Do you see a faint line if you defocus your eyes? If so, you are seeing the “ridge” of the roof prism. If the line is obtrusive, it will result in flaring of bright astronomical objects. This is easier to test for using a bright point of light against a dark background, but this is usually not available in the store. • Eye Relief. When you look through the binoculars, the image in the eyepiece should be surrounded by the crisp dark edge of a field stop at the mutual focus of the eyepiece and objective. If there is insufficient eye relief, you cannot get your eye sufficiently close to enable this. Most modern binoculars have fold- down rubber eyecups around the eyepieces to enable their use by spectacle wearers (Figure 3.1). However, not all rubber eyecups fold down, and not all permit a bespectacled observer to get his eyes sufficiently close. Even if you do not wear spectacles, do check that the eyecups fold down. On cold or dewy night, warm moisture evaporating from your eye can condense on the eyepiece, causing it to fog. If you fold the eyecup down, air can circulate between your eye and the eyepiece, reducing the likelihood of fogging. • Comfort. Comfort is particularly important if you intend to use hand-held binoc- ulars for long periods of time. In general, lighter binoculars are less tiring to hold, but this is not always the case. A heavier binocular that is well designed from an ergonomic perspective can be less tiring than a lighter instrument that is poorly designed. There is no substitute for experiment when it comes to deter- mining how a particular binocular suits you as an individual. When you perform the optical tests below, take your time and perform them consecutively without taking the binoculars from your eyes. Be conscious of how tired your arms become. • Focus. (See also “Spherical Aberration” below.) To focus a binocular, do one optical tube at a time, with the other side covered with a lens cap on the objec- tive side. First, set the interpupillary distance. Check by alternately shutting eyes or alternately covering objective lenses, so you have a complete field of view, sur- rounded by the field stop, on both sides. If the eyepieces focus independently, it does not matter in which order you do them. With center-focus binoculars, cap the right-hand objective and focus the left-hand optical tube on a distant object with the focus wheel (called “focus band” in some binocular instruction sheets). Critically examine the image to determine if it “snaps” to a good focus or if there is a range where it looks less “mushy.” When you have the best focus, swap the lens cap to the left objective and, without adjusting the focus wheel , focus the right-hand tube with the focus ring on the right-hand eyepiece housing. Again, critically examine the focus. Remove the lens cap and again examine the focus. Then focus on a nearer object and, by alternately covering the objective lenses, verify that both sides are focused, not merely the one used by your dominant eye. Do not be tempted to use a hand instead of a lens cap or, worse, to focus Evaluating Binoculars 53"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy individual tubes by closing one eye; this is rarely satisfactory. The hand almost always changes the mutual orientation of eyes and binoculars from the usual observing position. This is true also when the binocular is mounted, merely because of the act of stretching the arm to a non-observing position. Closing one eye can cause the other to squint. When you do visual optical tests, you want your eyes and body to be relaxed. • Focal Range. When binoculars are used for astronomy, it is not immediately appar- ent why one would need any focal distance other than infinity. There is, of course, the trivial case of the applicability of binoculars to terrestrial use, which often requires that you can focus them closer than infinity. The other case is that of eye- glass wearers who wish to observe without eyeglasses. If your eyes are hyperme- tropic (farsighted), there is usually no problem because the binocular adjustment is to what would be focus on a nearer object for a person with normal vision. However, if your eyes are myopic (nearsighted), to focus on an object at infinity the binocular must be adjusted to focus on what, to a person would normal vision, would be beyond infinity. Whereas most binoculars have some facility for this, the amount of extra focus travel varies enormously. If your eyes are myopic and you wish to observe without your eyeglasses, you should verify that the binoculars have sufficient focal range to accommodate your eyesight. You should try to focus on an object at as great a distance as possible—at least a Kilometer (about half a mile), but preferably more—away from you. Additionally, because the depth of focus of your eyes is reduced when your pupils are dilated, as they will be when the binoculars are used for astronomy, you should try to focus on a dark object without a bright background. Dark vegetation on the horizon is ideal. Be aware that you will almost certainly need a bit more “beyond infinity” travel at night time than you need during the day, so allow for this. • Internal Reflections. Internal reflections, be they reflections off the interior walls or components of the binoculars, or “ghost” reflections off poorly designed or inadequately coated optical components, are both distracting and detrimental to astronomical observation. They tend to be most obtrusive when a small bright object is observed, off-axis, against a dark background (i.e., exactly the condi- tions that are often found in astronomical observation!). To test for this, use a bright light source ( not the Sun), such as a recessed halogen lamp in the store ceiling or a Mini-Maglite® with the lens assembly removed, slightly off axis. • Chromatic Aberration. All binoculars will exhibit some degree of chromatic aber- ration. In very good binoculars it may only be noticed off-axis and then only just perceptible. The purpose of this test is to compare binoculars, not to find one that is perfectly achromatic. Chromatic aberration is most obtrusive with high- contrast objects, such as many astronomical targets. Although it may not be noticeable on fainter or lower-contrast objects, if it is present it will degrade the image by reducing contrast. The simplest daytime test is usually to view a distant television antenna or electricity post or similar object against a bright sky. It is important to ensure that the IPD is properly set, since chromatic aberration can often be induced by moving the eye off axis. Focus the target object at the center of the field and slowly pan the binoculars so that the object moves toward the edge. Chromatic aberration will be visible as colored fringes at the interface of light and dark, usually magenta on one side and cyan on the other. 54"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"• Spherical Aberration. (See also “Focus” above.) Spherical aberration occurs when light from different regions of the lens is focused at different distances from the lens. It is usually well corrected for in modern binoculars, but does exist in budget ones. It is visible as a “mushy” focus (i.e., an object at the center of the field of view does not “snap” to a good focus). • Field Curvature. Lenses do not focus images on a plane, but on a curved surface that is concave toward the lens. The result is that if the eyepiece is focused on an object at the center of the field of view, objects at the edge will be out of focus. This is field curvature and it is potentially present in all binoculars. In excellent binoculars it may not be noticeable at all; in budget binoculars it can be obtru- sive less than halfway to the edge of the field. Unless it is severe, it is not a major problem for daytime use, where the attention is on objects at the center of the field of view, but astronomers prefer pinpoint star images right to the edge. It can be ameliorated by addition of extra lens elements, and the field of view can be limited by field stops so that it is not apparent. The extra lens elements will absorb some light and reduce contrast, an important consideration for astro- nomical use. In ultrawide-angle binoculars, unless they are extremely well designed, it can render most of the field of view unusable for astronomy, thus negating the perceived advantage of a wide apparent field of view. To test for it, merely focus on an object at the center of the field of view and move the binoc- ulars so that the object moves toward the edge. If it goes out of focus but can be refocused, this is field curvature. (If it cannot be refocused, it is probably coma.) • Coma. Coma is a form of off-axis spherical aberration. It is very difficult to test for during the day as it requires a point source of light. This is sometimes pos- sible by viewing a glint of sunlight reflected off a very curved shiny object such as a metal car radio antenna. Focus the glint on the center of the field and move the binoculars so that the object moves toward the edge. If coma is present, the image of the glint will flare toward the edge of the field, giving it the appearance of a comet (hence the name coma) with its head toward the center. Coma is often present in binoculars that are not specifically designed for astronomy. This is because it is not normally visible or particularly degrading of daylight images, largely because birders, for example, use binoculars to examine birds at the center of the field. • Astigmatism. Astigmatism is an aberration that, like coma, is very difficult to test for during the day. It manifests itself as a point object, such as a glint of sunlight, being seen as a short line when just out of best focus, that changes orientation through 90 degrees from one side of focus to the other. • Vignetting. Vignetting results from the outer parts of the field of view not being illuminated by the whole of the objective lens. It manifests itself as a darkening toward the edge of the image. It is present in all terrestrial binoculars, where it is not obtrusive when they are used to examine objects at the center of the field of view, and most astronomical binoculars. Mild vignetting can be difficult to test for during daylight because the human visual system readily adapts to a very large range of illumination, but flicking the gaze back and forth between the edge and center of the field of view will usually reveal it. • Kidney-bean Effect. The kidney-bean effect, also known as flying shadows, is an affliction associated with some widefield eyepieces and is a result of spherical Evaluating Binoculars 55"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy aberration of the exit pupil. Instead of being a flat disc, the exit pupil is curved and it is therefore impossible to focus the entire field of view at once so you have to hold the binocular slightly further from the eye to focus one zone than another. There is a position at which your iris will cut off the light from a zone between the center and the periphery and, if your eye is not perfectly aligned with the optical axis of the eyepiece, the result is these flying shadows that have the shape of a kidney bean. The effect is more pronounced in daylight, or when viewing a bright Moon, than at night, and is therefore best tested for during daylight. • Distortion. Almost all binoculars will exhibit some distortion toward the edge of the field. To test for it, focus on a straight object, such as a telephone pole or a roof ridge that extends across the diameter of the field of view. Move the binoc- ulars so that the edge of the object forms a chord near the periphery of the field. If the object curves inward toward the middle, you have pincushion distortion; if it curves outward, you have barrel distortion. A small amount of pincushion distortion can be desirable for terrestrial use, but it has no advantages—or significant disadvantages—for astronomy. It is a common phenomenon, even among experienced binocular users, that when they optically evaluate a binocular, they notice pincushion distortion and comment adversely on it. It is far less common (I hope that this book will go some way toward remedying this) that they know the whole reason. It is indeed true that pincushion distortion, which manifests itself as straight lines at the edge of the field of view appearing to curve in toward the middle of the field, results from increasing angular magnification away from the center of the field, but this difference in magnification is not an error, it is intended. If there is equal angular magnification, the linear magnification at the edge of the field is less than in the center, and an optical phenomenon called rolling ball effect occurs when the binocular is panned. This may not be noticeable when the binocular is used astronomically, but when it occurs in terrestrial use, it can be distinctly unpleas- ant and even cause nausea. A small measure of pincushion distortion eliminates this rolling effect. Different manufacturers choose different compromises between rolling ball and pincushion; the choice of which particular compromise is best is entirely subjective. • Collimation. Unless miscollimation is severe, this is usually considered to be the most difficult condition for which to test. Unfortunately, it is present in a large number of lower-priced binoculars. Severe cases manifest as a double image that cannot be eliminated. Our eyes can compensate for mild miscollimation, but the price is eyestrain, which can lead to fatigue and headaches if it is prolonged. The acceptable limits for miscollimation are given in Chapter 2, but these limits are not ones that can be measured during a preliminary test. A daylight test for con- vergence and divergence would be to support the binoculars and focus on a distant vertical target such as the edge of the wall of a building or a telephone pole, and close one eye and place the target at the edge of the field of view. Alter- nately close your eyes and see if the image in one eye is laterally displaced from that in the other. To test for step (i.e., vertical shift), use a horizontal target such as the ridge of a distant roof. We are far less tolerant of step than we are of con- vergence or divergence, so if you detect any step at all, you should reject the binoculars. 56"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Field Tests If binoculars will be used for astronomy, there is no substitute for field testing them under the stars. The night sky offers the potential of objective and quantitative testing that is not easily available in daylight without relatively sophisticated optical equipment. In addition, with the exception of distortion and kidney bean, all the optical tests detailed above are easier to perform under the night sky. You will obtain better, and more easily comparable, results if you mount the binocu- lars. Here is a list of tests to perform at night: • Overall Optical Performance. You can perform a simple and, to some extent, quantifiable test of the optical quality of your binoculars by determining the closest double stars that you can distinguish. In general, double stars, those with components of approximately the same magnitude, are easier to split than those that have components of significantly different magnitudes. The ability to sepa- rate double stars is obviously a function of magnification, so you should there- fore expect binoculars with higher magnifications to routinely outperform those with lower magnifications. Because you are observing at low magnification, you should not expect to see the close separations that are discernible with telescopes of similar aperture working at high magnification. You should also be aware that differences between sky conditions at different times and places and differences in the optical acuity and observing experience of different observers restrict the objectivity of this test. It does, however, enable a single observer to compare the general optical performance of different binoculars with a high level of confidence. A table of appropriate double stars is given in Appendix A. • Limiting Magnitude. The standard way of establishing the limiting magnitude of an instrument is to count the stars in a known region of sky. Some useful regions applicable to binoculars are detailed in Appendix B. • True Field of View. When you are trying to find objects by star-hopping, it is essential to know what the true field of view of your binoculars is. The field of view that manufacturers state for their binoculars are not always correct, and, when wrong, they tend to err on the optimistic side. By placing stars of known separation at diametrically opposite sides of the binocular field, you can easily determine its true field of view. Similarly, if the field of view is severely degraded toward the periphery, you can determine the size of what you consider to be the usable field. A table of convenient star pairings, with relevant charts, is given in Appendix C. • Field of View. Field of view is a very personal thing. Most people seem to prefer a wider field of view, such as that from an ultrawide eyepiece, giving 82 degrees or so of apparent field of view and perceive apparent fields of view of less than about 65 degrees to be akin to tunnel vision. Others find that a narrower appar- ent field of view helps them concentrate on the object under observation and they dislike having to “look around” to find the edges of the field of view. • Collimation. Poor collimation is more obtrusive, and thus easier to test for, at night. Focus the binoculars on a reasonably bright star, then carefully move the binoculars away, keeping the image in view, until the binoculars are about 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) from your eyes. If you still have a single image, the binoculars Evaluating Binoculars 57"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy are probably collimated within acceptable limits. If the images from each optical tube separate from each other, then the binoculars are miscollimated and will cause eye strain. You should not expect to find a binocular that is perfect in every respect, but these simple tests should enable you to make a reasonably good assessment of the binocular in hand and to compare it to other binoculars. 58"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE Binoculars are generally robust and require very little maintenance if they are properly cared for. As with any other optical equipment, indeed any equipment, prevention and preemptive maintenance are considerably preferable to curative maintenance and repair. There are five categories of foreign matter that can threaten the well-being of binoculars. In no particular order these are: • Moisture . This can invade the binocular either by condensation or from direct exposure to water. • User-originated grime . This includes grease from fingers and eyelashes, spillage of food and drink, hair, and flakes of dead skin. • Environmental grime . Dust is the usual culprit here, but grit can also enter the binocular in some circumstances. • Flora . The usual culprits are algae and fungi. • Fauna . Arthropods, especially insects and arachnids, can find ideal homes in the nooks an crannies of binoculars and their cases. William Gascoyne invented the eyepiece reticle after a spider had spun its web near the focal plane of his telescope! Rain Guards A rain guard is a cover for the eyepieces of a binocular. It is intended to protect the eyepieces of binoculars when they are slung from the neck in the rain or snow. As observational astronomers, we tend not to pursue our hobby in the rain, so pre- Care and Maintenance of Binoculars 59"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy cipitation is a relatively unlikely source of moisture. Despite this, a rain guard is an invaluable addition to any binocular, particularly one that is hung from the neck. Rain guards protect the eyepieces against spillage of food and drink and against any other descending particulate matter, whatever its origin. For this reason, a rain guard is most valuable if it is of the kind that can be attached to the neck strap so that it is immediately available for use. It soon becomes second nature to put the guard over the eyepieces when you pause in observing, and the reduc- tion in frequency with which eyepieces need to be cleaned is very noticeable (Figure 5.1). Storage Although moisture from precipitation does not usually affect an astronomical binocular, condensation can affect it. In terms of frequency of occurrence of damage, condensation is by far the most harmful source of deterioration of astro- nomical binoculars. Condensation on the external optical surfaces results in being wiped more frequently than would otherwise be necessary, with the attendant damage that all too often accompanies frequent cleaning. (To protect against con- densation in use, see the section on dew prevention in Chapter 7.) Condensation on internal optical surfaces may lead to inexpert dismantling of the binoculars, which itself can lead to damage, in an attempt to gain access to and clean the affected surfaces. The water itself accelerates the corrosion of the metal parts of the binocular, especially if there are places where two different metals are in contact. This corrosion leads to stiffness in moving parts and this stiffness, allied to the corrosion, accelerates the wear of these parts. Moist surfaces are a sine qua non for the growth of algae and fungi; so if you keep moisture at bay, you will keep these flora at bay also. Much of this condensation damage ultimately results from failing to cap the binoculars at the end of an observation session. The cold binocular is taken into a relatively warm and humid place, where moisture from the air condenses on the 60 Figure 5.1. Eyepiece rainguard. The rainguard attaches to the strap and can be slipped over the eyepieces when the binocular is not being used."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"colder surfaces of the binocular. Lens caps and cases then act to hold the moisture in place. It is a good practice to bring the binoculars indoors uncapped, place them horizontally on a firm flat surface in the room in which they are to be stored until they have reached thermal equilibrium, then cap them and put them in their cases. It is an even better practice to cap them outdoors before bringing them in unless the surfaces have been affected by dew . Ideally, binoculars should be stored in a cool dry place; certainly not one that is subject to great fluctuations of temperature and humidity. I store mine in a closet in an unheated part of the house. Cases and caps help to guard against arthropods that might otherwise take up residence. Multipurpose “grab-and-go” binoculars are often stored, uncased and uncapped, on interior windowsills, where they are instantly available should an object of interest be spotted. They are placed resting on their objective ends, so the objective lenses are protected to some extent. On the other hand, the eyepieces of such binoculars act as dust magnets and soon show the marks of frequent scouring. If you must store your multipurpose bino- culars in this manner, at least use eyepiece lens caps or a rain guard to keep the dust at bay. Even better, store them somewhere where they are less likely to be dis- lodged by other household members and are less likely to have to endure the tremendous temperature ranges to which a black object on a sunny windowsill is subjected. Those who store binoculars on windowsills are second only to those who use unmounted binoculars without a neck strap in ensuring the survival of the binocular repair industry! Desiccants Some years ago I used to maintain a 20 × 120 naval binocular of 1940s vintage. It had two small mesh-lined inserts into which a desiccant, presumably anhydrous calcium chloride, could be placed. This would reduce the likelihood of condensa- tion on the internal optical surfaces. Today we do not use internal desiccants, but rather fill the binocular with dry nitrogen and make it gas-tight. Nevertheless, desiccants still have their place. The currently preferred desiccant is silica gel, an amorphous form of silicon dioxide that can adsorb up to a third of its own weight of water onto its surface (of which it has about 700 m 2 per gram!). It can be regen- erated by heating it in an oven to between 125° and 200°C (250° and 400°F). Sachets of silica gel are included with a multitude of modern electronic devices, as well as with binoculars. I tape a sachet to the inside of each of my small bino- cular cases and also to the inside of each objective lens cap of my 100-mm bino- culars. This is possibly a bit of overkill, but it seems to be a small effort to eliminate an inconvenience that may necessitate a far greater effort to remedy. Grit If binoculars are placed in contact with a gritty surface, it is all but inevitable that some grit will end up where it is not wanted. Sea sand is the most pernicious species of grit; even if you ensure that your hands, and anything else that touches Care and Maintenance of Binoculars 61"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy the binocular, are meticulously clean, you can almost guarantee that wind-blown sand will find a way in. The result is that tell-tale crunching sound as the abrasion of a moving part starts to occur! In reality, you cannot expect to keep grit entirely away from binoculars if they are actually going to be used. You can take the obvious precautions (above) to reduce the contact with grit and also try to ensure that no grease seeps from the moving parts of the binocular. Grease traps grit. It also tends to get transferred, with or without the grit for which it is often a vector, to optical surfaces. Particu- larly unpleasant is the grease that is used in some binoculars of Far Eastern origin; it seems to be more akin to an adhesive than a lubricant. It is important, therefore, to remove any exposed grease. This is most easily done with a paper towel or tissue, since paper tends to absorb oils and grease. Cleaning It cannot be overemphasised that by far the best form of cleaning of optical sur- faces is to prevent the dirt from accumulating there in the first place (i.e., use rain guards, lens caps, and cases whenever appropriate). The reason for this is that it is extremely easy to damage optical surfaces by cleaning them. In reality, an optical surface has to be quite filthy before the dirt has an optical effect that is significantly noticeable during visual observation and there is a real need to clean it. The objec- tive lenses of my binoculars go for years without being cleaned, and the eyepieces may only be cleaned once a year, although those that I use for star parties tend to need a clean after each event. My full binocular optical cleaning kit consists of the following items (Figure 5.2): • Puffer Brush with Retractable Soft Bristles . This is my first line of attack. Most dust and so forth can be blown off with the puffer alone. If it is more stubborn, I deploy the bristles and use them in conjunction with the puffer. Flick the brush quickly over the lens surface while puffing the bulb. After each stroke across the 62 Figure 5.2. Cleaning kit. Top L to R : Lens tissue, microfiber cloth. Middle : camel-hair brush, blower brush, Opti-Clean. Bottom : Lens Pen."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"lens, flick any accumulated dust off the brush, while giving a sharp puff to help dislodge it. Be very careful if you use canned air as a blower—the propellant can damage lens coatings. • Microfiber Cloth . I keep one of these in each binocular case. To use it, hold the binocular so that the affected lens surface is facing down, then gently flick an edge of the cloth over the lens to remove any dust. If any deposit remains, breathe on the lens to moisten it slightly, then gently wipe the lens from center to periph- ery. Microfiber is quite good at removing grease and finger prints. Never rub the lens with a circular motion and never wipe from the periphery to the center. If there are trapped particles that could scratch the optical surface, they will be trapped in the lens surround; they are relatively safe there, so don’t accidentally dislodge them. • Lens Tissue . Lens tissue is particularly useful on small lenses. It can be made into a swab rather like a cotton bud by folding it into a strip and wrapping it around the end of a toothpick. Dampen it in cleaning fluid and use it in light strokes from the center to the periphery of the lens. • Lens Pen ®. A Lens Pen incorporates a retractable soft brush and a cleaning pad that is recharged with cleaning fluid from an impregnated piece of foam in its cap. It is particularly good at removing eyelash grease and fingerprints. First, use the brush to remove any dust. When you are sure that the lens surface is clear of particles, clean the deposits with the pad, taking care not to drag any particles from the lens surround. • Opti-Clean . Opti-Clean is a polymer-based cleaning product that was developed to clean silicon wafers used in the microelectronics industry and is now mar- keted primarily for cleaning photographic lenses. It is suitable for any glass lens. It is a transparent liquid that is applied to the lens surface. As it dries, it forms a skin. When the skin is peeled off with an adhesive tab, it pulls any grease and grime with it, leaving the lens in pristine condition. It seems expensive, but it lasts for a very long time—I have had a 5 ml vial of it for about ten years. Note : There are different products with the same name used for contact lenses and in dentistry. There are other proprietary cleaning fluids available from photographic outlets. Alternatively, you can make your own. My recipe is: 6 parts distilled water 1 part pure isopropyl alcohol (IPA). 2 drops liquid detergent (e.g., mild dishwashing liquid) Apply it to the lens with a a lint-free cotton swab or a swab made of lens tissue wrapped around the end of a toothpick. Dampen the swab and swab the lens from center to periphery, rolling the swab so as to lift any grime away from the surface. Be careful not to overmoisten the swab so you don’t get liquid into the lens sur- round. You can dry the lens with a dry swab or with a clean lens tissue. However you clean the lens, be careful not to rub it any more than absolutely necessary. Not only does rubbing increase the likelihood of damage to the lens surface or coatings, but rubbing with a dry cloth or tissue can cause the build-up of a static electric charge on the lens surface. This charge will attract dust or lint, Care and Maintenance of Binoculars 63"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"and it will be extremely difficult to dislodge. If this does happen, you will need to use a water-based cleaning solution (such as the one above) to get rid of the static electric charge. Dismantling Binoculars In general, you should not attempt to dismantle your binocular. Unless you know precisely what you are doing, you run the risk of causing more damage than you are attempting to remedy! You would also immediately void any warranty. The single exception for the layperson is when a faulty binocular has been pronounced, by someone who is qualified to do so, unworthy of repair, either due to the extent of the damage or because the cost of repair would exceed the value of the bino- culars. In these instances, there is a valuable experience to be gained. The faults that can be relatively easily repaired are dust or flora in the binocu- lar, prisms that have been displaced by impact, and grit or failed lubrication in moving parts. The simplest binoculars to dismantle are Porro prism varieties. If you attempt this, which you do entirely at your own risk, first prepare your work surface. I prefer to cover the work surface with plain white paper—sheets of acid- free tissue are ideal. I have a few plastic containers for components, and I ensure that any tools I use are clean. I use disposable powder-free latex gloves to handle optical components. If the binocular has a Zeiss-type body, the objective tubes can be simply unscrewed from the binocular body (Figure 5.3), giving access to the inside surface of the objective lenses. The lower prism cover plates can then be removed, giving access to the lower prisms. These are often held in place by clips. In the Bausch & Lomb type of body, the objective cell must be removed from the tube. First remove the front protective ring—this usually simply unscrews. In this type of binocular housing, you do not gain access to the prisms from this end. The objective lenses are held into their cells (which, in Zeiss types may be inte- gral with the objective tubes) by a locking ring and usually a seal ring. The locking ring should be removed using a peg-spanner, but this can be done with extreme care with a small screwdriver with a blade that fits into the recess on the ring. The danger of scratching the lens is very great, and you should not attempt this unless you are willing to accept this risk. Before removing the locking ring, mark the eccentric rings with a soft pencil so they can be returned in the same orientation. If you remove the lens elements, mark the edges with a soft pencil with an arrow pointing to the front surface. Wrap them in acid-free tissue and put them safely in a container. The dismantling of the eyepiece end and begins with the removal of the cover at the bottom of the hinge. If there is a tripod bush in the hinge, you will also need to remove this; it is slotted for a screwdriver for this purpose (Figure 5.4). This reveals a hole in the hinge, deep within which is the screw that holds the focus shaft in place. Use a flashlight to ascertain what type of head the screw has, and insert a screwdriver into this hole to undo the screw. A small amount of Blu-tac® or other similar adhesive putty on the end of the screwdriver aids the removal (and replacement) of this screw (Figure 5.5). When the screw is removed, use the focus wheel to drive out the eyepieces and bridge (Figure 5.6).

This may be screwed down at one end (Figure 5.9) or, in cheaper binoculars, have both ends clipped under recesses. The prism may also be protected by a shaped piece of metal or card-type composite. In Bausch & Lomb type bodies, the prisms normally remove as a cluster (Figures 5.10 and 5.11).

If you decide to dismantle the eyepieces to clean the components, be sure to mark the edges of the various lenses and spaces so that you know their order of reassembly and the direction they should face. Also be aware that there may be as many as six separate lens elements. The only time it is necessary to dismantle the hinge is when the tension needs to be adjusted. Remove the cap with the IPD scale on it and you will see a slotted brass tension screw with a locking grub screw (set screw) in it. If you need to adjust the tension, loosen the locking screw and adjust the tension screw with a screw- driver. The correct tension is achieved when it is just sufficient to prevent one side of the binocular from sagging under the effect of gravity when the binocular is held by the other side. When you reassemble the binocular, it may be necessary to lubricate some of the mechanical parts. Use a good quality lithium grease for this. Use the minimum amount necessary and ensure that none is able to escape to the outside, where it will inevitably be transferred to the external optics. If screw threads are slightly stiff and tend to bind, you can lubricate them by running a soft graphite (lead) pencil along the thread. (Incidentally, soft pencils are also useful for lubricating stuck zippers and stiff lock mechanisms.)"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Collimation If miscollimated binoculars are still under warranty, return them to the supplier. The supplier should have access to a binocular repair shop that has proper colli- mating equipment. Proper collimation is a skilled task and miscollimation can be expensive to remedy on binoculars that are out of warranty. It can cost more than the binoculars cost in the first place and is therefore usually not worth having done on budget-priced binoculars. If your binoculars are out of warranty and you feel confident of trying to do it yourself, here is how. The methods described in this book will result in conditional alignment (i.e., the optical tubes will only be aligned at the interpupillary distance at which you perform the alignment). Binoculars can be collimated by either eccentric rings on the objective lenses or by tilting the prisms with grub screws (set screws). There is no substitute for experience in col- limation. If you can, practice on an old misaligned binocular where you will not be upset if you are unable to achieve the collimation you want. Always collimate binoculars outdoors, or indoors by looking through an open window. Window glass is usually nonuniform and can differentially affect what you see through each side of the binocular. Collimate by looking at an object at least 100 m (110 yd) away, but preferably further. If the binoculars were once properly collimated and have suddenly lost colli- mation, this is most likely due to being dropped or bumped, causing a prism to shift. It is therefore worth examining the prisms to see if there is any obvious shift. Often, if a single prism has shifted, a symptom will be that the image in the affected tube will have acquired a “lean” (i.e., it will be tilted slightly to one side or the other). Prisms are held either to the body of the binocular (Zeiss or European style) or in prism housings (Bausch & Lomb or American style) by straps. A sharp jolt can move the prism, and if this has happened, it can usually be replaced. In budget Care and Maintenance of Binoculars 69 Figure 5.11. Prism cluster removed."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy binoculars there is usually no possible adjustment of the prism once it is located and secured into its recess in the binocular body (see Figure 5.9). Prism Adjustment If prisms are adjustable, this will be by external grub screws (set screws) that are accessible under the rubber or leatherette covering of the binocular body, usually close to the edge of the prism housing where they can be accessed by minimal shifting and stretching of the rubber. If the binocular is covered with leatherette, there are usually little tabs in the leatherette that can be lifted to permit access to collimation screws. Alternatively, the collimation screws may only be accessible by removing the cover plate. They are the slotted-head screws (Figures 5.10 & 5.12). Remove the eyepieces and bridge, then remove the cover plate and replace the eyepieces and bridge. The collimating screws are slotted grub screws that are immediately adjacent to the cross-headed screws that secure the prism cluster to the binocular body. The screws adjust in “push-pull” pairs. The procedure is to slacken the securing screw, adjust the collimating screw, then retighten the secur- ing screw. Adjust one pair of screws at a time and turn the collimating screw no more than an eighth of a turn and examine its effect on the image. Adjust in small increments until the images are satisfactorily aligned. Eccentric Rings Binoculars differ from telescopes in that collimation is achieved by lateral move- ment of the objectives, not by tilting them. Moving the lens one way will move the image in the eyepiece the other way. However, it is all but impossible to move an 70 Figure 5.12. Collimation screws."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"objective only either laterally or vertically, and collimation with eccentric rings can be monumentally frustrating until you get the hang of it. It can be a tough test of perseverance and patience—you have been warned! First, mark the positions of the rings (see Figure 5.13) so that if you do not manage to improve the image, you can at least set them to their original position. Next, set the rings so that there is no eccentricity (i.e., the narrowest part of the inner ring aligns with the widest part of the outer ring and vice versa). Rotate the objective lens assembly a small increment—about 10 to 15 degrees—at a time until it has made one revolution and see whether there is any movement of the image and, if so, if it is sufficient to bring the images into proper alignment. If it is not, slip the inner ring about 10 degrees and repeat the rotation of the lens assembly. Repeat this until the images are aligned as well as possible. If there is not sufficient eccentricity in the rings, you will need to adjust the prisms. Note : It is usually better to set the binoculars so that there is a discernible amount of divergence (i.e., so the optical paths from the binoculars are con verg- ing) (see Chapter 2, note 2), and then to gradually collimate from there than it is to approach collimation from the other way. This is because the eyes are more sen- sitive to divergence than to convergence.

Both of these play a significant part in determining how much you will be able to see. If the binoculars are not held in a manner that is reasonably stable, in order to eliminate shake, the amount of detail you see will be severely reduced. If you are not comfortable when you observe, you will quickly tire, and tiredness is always detrimental to observing. Hand-held Binoculars You will not see as much with your binoculars when you hand-hold them as you will if you mount them properly. However, if you use your binoculars for quick “grab-and-go” observing sessions, if you are using them for quick sky-scans in con- junction with a telescope, or if you are using binoculars because they can be hand held and are therefore the ultimate in a portable observing instrument, then you will not want to use a mount. Small and medium-sized binoculars up to about 10 × 50, depending on the ergonomics of the particular binocular, can be effec- tively held for medium periods. Slightly larger ones can be held for short periods and for “quick peeks.” These periods can be extended and made more effective if ergonomic considerations are taken into account. Some people consider an extended discussion of hand-holding to be overkill, but if by understanding and applying a few simple principles you can increase the efficacy and enjoyability of your observing sessions, this discussion is worthwhile. There are four “basic” ways Holding and Mounting Binoculars 73"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy in which a binocular can be held: the normal hold, the triangular arm brace, the rifle sling hold, and the double-handed hold. The “Normal” Hold It seems to be instinctive for most people to hold Porro prism binoculars around the prism housings (Figure 6.1). The weight of the binocular is taken entirely by the arms, and the upper arms are extended forward. Although this initially feels comfortable, it is inherently tiring and unstable, especially when you are observ- ing objects at high altitude. It rapidly results in fatigue, which, even after a few minutes, is easily noticeable, both in the limbs themselves and in the amount you can see. It is very easy to improve upon this, merely by moving your hands an inch or so closer to your face to form the triangular arm brace. The Triangular Arm Brace Hold Many adults feel that 10 × 50 binoculars have too much magnification to be hand- held. For several decades I have run astronomy clubs for youngsters and we have used 10 × 50 binoculars as our “standard” instrument. By teaching this way of holding binoculars, I have enabled children as young as ten years old to effectively use these binoculars for observing. If the detail they report being able to see is any indication, they are seeing noticeably more than adults using the normal hold. 74 Figure 6.1. The “normal” hold."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Hold the binocular with your first two fingers around the eyepieces and the other two fingers around the prism housing. Then raise the binocular to your eyes and rest the first knuckle of your thumbs into the indentations on the outside of your eye sockets, so that your hands are held as if you were shielding your eyes from light from the side. Rest the top knuckle of your thumb against the indent in the bone at the outside of your eye socket and the second joint against your cheek- bone (Figure 6.2). Each of your arms is now locked into a stable triangle with your head, neck, and shoulder as the third “side,” thus giving you a much more stable support for your binoculars. The position of your thumbs keeps the eyepieces a fixed distance from your eyes. You cannot normally reach the focus wheel on center-focus binoculars when you hold them this way (although you can with roof prisms), but you should not need to refocus during an observing session. This grip does feel unusual at first, but it is so superior to the normal way that it soon becomes second nature. The “Rifle Sling” Hold If you want the most stability you can get with medium-sized hand-held binocu- lars, use the rifle sling method. This hold is based on the way one uses a sling for rifle-range shooting, where stability of the rifle is improved if the arm is braced through the sling. Extend the binocular strap to its full extent and hold the bino- cular so that the strap loops down. Place both arms through the strap, so that it Holding and Mounting Binoculars 75 Figure 6.2.

Hold the binocular in the most comfortable way you can and brace it “solid” by pushing your elbows apart (Figure 6.3). It initially feels a bit like getting into a medieval torture instrument, but it is remarkably effective for stability. Because it is not inherently comfortable, I do not use this method for long periods, but only for observations where I want that little bit of extra stability. Double-handed Hold You may sometimes wish to hold a larger binocular for short periods and find that the balance of the binocular makes the triangular arm brace method unstable. The double-handed hold uses both hands on one optical tube of the binocular. Assum- ing your right eye is dominant, use the triangular arm brace with your right hand and hold the right objective barrel of the binocular with your left hand (Figure 6.4). You support the left objective barrel with your left wrist—if you wear a wrist- watch or bracelets, you will probably find it more comfortable if you remove them first. For extra stability, you can combine this with the rifle sling method. An inherent source of fatigue and instability with all hand-holding methods is that your upper arms are extended in front of you. If you can support your elbows 76 Figure 6.3. The rifle sling hold."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"or upper arms, you will notice a drastic improvement in stability and reduction in fatigue. The number of possible arm rests is limited only by your imagination, including the car roof, fences, gates, boulders, height extensions to the armrests of deck chairs, and even the shoulders of a companion. If a suitable arm rest cannot be found, you can increase stability to some extent merely by leaning against some- thing such as a wall, car, boulder, telephone pole—or the ground! Mounting Brackets The most commonly used binocular mount is the photo tripod and L-bracket. Most modern binoculars in the aperture range of 40 to 70 mm have, in the distal end of the center-post hinge, a bush (threaded tripod adapter) for an L-bracket. Porro prism binoculars in the aperture range of 80 to 100 mm may either have a bush for Holding and Mounting Binoculars 77 Figure 6.4. The double-handed hold."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy an L-bracket or a box for direct mounting on a tripod plate. Those of greater aper- ture than 100 mm almost always have a direct-mounting bush (Figure 6.5). Some older 50-mm binoculars also have direct-mounting bushes, usually on the right-hand prism housing (Figure 6.6). Some have suggested that this arrangement can cause the optical tubes to lose alignment with each other, but I have not found this to be the case. However, if you have this type of binocular, you do need to ensure that the tripod head allows it to be mounted in such a manner that your nose does not foul the mounting plate! A tripod bush like this offers no facility for tilting the binocular side to side. Some people deem this to be an advantage. Brackets for mounting a binocular to a tripod come in four distinct categories: hinge clamp, universal L-bracket, roof prism L-bracket, and L-bracket for roof prism. (Figure 6.5). It is important to acquire the one that is specific to your needs. Hinge Clamp As its name suggests, this clamps onto the center-post hinge of Porro prism bino- culars. It is used when there is no mounting bush on the binocular. It may be unsuitable if the binocular has a wide focusing “band,” as opposed to a narrow focusing wheel, because in the former, there is usually insufficient center-post to 78 Figure 6.5.

Universal L-bracket The universal L-bracket fits almost all Porro prism binoculars that have a quarter- inch mounting bush at the distal end of the central hinge. The bracket is usually merely a strip of metal that is bent into an L-shape, painted or coated, and fur- nished with the appropriate holes and bolts. Near the end of the upright of the L, it has a captive screw that screws into the quarter-inch mounting bush of the bino- cular. The foot of the L has one or two quarter-inch threaded holes for the quarter- inch screw on the tripod mounting plate. If there are two holes, use the one that offers the best balance to the binocular (Figure 6.8). Holding and Mounting Binoculars 79 Figure 6.7. Hinge clamp. Figure 6.8. Universal L-bracket for Porro prism binoculars."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy Roof-prism L-bracket The roof prism L-bracket is similar to the universal bracket, but it has recesses for the objective tubes of roof prism binoculars. These are closer together than in Porro prism binoculars and cannot be used with most universal L-brackets. Because the recesses have the potential to weaken the structure of the bracket, they are thicker from front to back than are universal brackets so they do not flex in use (Figure 6.9). Proprietary L-bracket Proprietary L-brackets work in exactly the same way as the universal bracket, except the foot of the L is adapted to fit a proprietary mounting. Monopods For several decades, photographers have been aware of the use of the monopod as an ultraportable and compact camera support. It also makes an ultraportable and compact support for binoculars. The mere fact that the binocular is supported confers a degree of stability that is not obtainable by hand-holding. In order to use a monopod, you will need to obtain a suitable L-bracket or other mounting bracket for your binocular, unless it is already fitted with a mounting bush. These brackets are discussed in more detail in the section on tripod mount- ing below. Monopods can be used for both standing and seated observing, but few are sufficiently long for observing high altitude from a standing position, not to mention it is extremely uncomfortable to try to observe at high elevations while 80 Figure 6.9. L-bracket for roof prism binoculars."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"you are standing unless the binoculars have angled eyepieces. In recent years it has become possible to purchase hiking poles in which the top part of the handle can be removed to reveal a camera-mounting screw. A simple but very effective “poor-person’s” alternative to a monopod is a humble broom or mop (with a clean and dry business end!). You can easily secure the binoculars to the broom- or mop-head with a bungee cord, although many people, myself included, prefer merely to rest the binocular on the head. If the mop has a telescopic pole, such as found in several designs intended for window cleaning, then its utility is increased, as these usually extend to a length that is suitable for high-altitude observing from a standing position. A mop-head with an adjustable angle is somewhat useful, but do not expect to be able to adjust the friction so as to be able to change the angle as you observe. Photographic Tripods Photographic tripods, used as a “normal” photographic tripod head, are usually seen as the most obvious low-cost way of mounting binoculars. Unless the bino- culars have angled eyepieces, photographic tripods and heads are not ideal observ- ing platforms because it is extremely difficult to use them for observing at high elevations. Because photographic tripods are so widely used for their intended purpose, they are mass produced and are readily obtainable at relatively low cost. However, all tripods are not equal, and one that is suitable for binocular observ- ing should meet several criteria. • The tripod should be high enough to permit observations of object near the zenith while you are standing. If you try to observe near the zenith from a seated or reclining position using a tripod and normal photographic head, it is a near certainty that your legs and those of the tripod will, at some stage, need to occupy the same location; the consequences are, at best, infuriating. This requirement automatically eliminates the vast majority of photo tripods. • The height of the tripod head needs to be adjustable so that, for a single observer, the height of the eyepieces of the binocular can be changed over a range of a minimum of 150 mm (6 inches) for straight-through binoculars and 250 mm (10 inches) for those with 45-degree angled eyepieces. However, this is not the total distance through which the tripod head must move. As the binoculars are angled upward, the eyepieces get lower by an amount that is the sum of the distance from the eyepiece to the mounting bush and the distance from the mounting bush to the altitude bearing on the tripod head. To this must be added the dif- ference in height between the tallest and shortest observer who will use this setup in a single observing session (but this latter requirement can be reduced if some sort of simple observing platform, such as an up-turned milk crate, is available for shorter observers). This height adjustment requires some form of center post. The only usable types are those with a handle and ratchet for adjusting the height; those that work on friction alone are difficult to use for our purposes. • The tripod head needs to enable observation near the zenith. Many of the more robust heads only enable, when they are used as intended, an elevation of about Holding and Mounting Binoculars 81"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy 60 degrees (Figure 6.10). However, many of them allow a depression of 90 degrees. If this it the case, it may be possible to use them reversed (Figure 6.11). If this is the case, any handles will also need to be reversed and you should ensure that, in doing so, they do not obstruct or interfere with any locking or friction knobs that you will need to use when you are observing. • The altitude bearing of the tripod head must be sufficiently robust and have sufficient friction to bear the turning moment of the binoculars when they are pointed near the zenith. The great majority of photographic heads are not designed to accommodate this sort of turning moment, which is rarely encoun- tered using a consumer compact or single lens reflex camera, and are inadequate for the task. Consequently, it is usually better to consider a robust video head with fluid motions. Test it to verify that it is sufficiently robust and has sufficient friction control to enable the binoculars to be pointed at the zenith without changing aim when you release the handle . All photo tripods that I have encoun- tered that meet the previous criteria for the tripod itself have the facility to enable the heads to be interchanged, so this need not be a concern. Indeed, for most of these the tripods and heads are sold separately. 82 Figure 6.10. With the video head the right way around, the zenith is inaccessible."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Even if the tripod and mount do meet all the criteria above, they can still be difficult to use, especially when you are observing near the zenith with binoculars with straight-through eyepieces (unless you are an accomplished limbo dancer). The neck-strain induced by using such a system for near-zenith observing from a standing position is extremely uncomfortable for most observers and very soon results in fatigue. The experience of keen kite flyers, who also spend long periods looking up into the sky, is that this posture can induce neck problems. Hence, it is unsurprising that many who use tripod-and-head arrangements soon seek a dif- ferent solution. This brings us into the realm of proprietary binocular mounts and observing chairs. Fork Mounts A solution to the cantilevering of heavy binoculars that are mounted on a photo- or video head is the fork mount. It is possible to fork-mount binoculars so that they rotate in altitude about their center of mass; indeed, several large binoculars have mounting bushes in the sides of the optical tubes for precisely this purpose. Holding and Mounting Binoculars 83 Figure 6.11. Reversing the video head makes the zenith accessible."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy The yoke needs to be offset so that the altitude fulcrum is not above the fork’s azimuth axis if it is to enable the binoculars to reach the zenith. However, this offset, and the consequent cantilevering, is constant, so it can be allowed for in the design. If necessary, it can be compensated for by the use of a counterweight system. A fork mount does not eliminate the need to raise and lower the mount for observing at different elevations. Mirror Mounts Over the past few decades there have been various designs of binocular mount that use a first-surface mirror arrangement to circumvent the problem of an uncom- fortable observing posture. These usually need to be placed on a table or tripod and the binocular is secured to the mount. Either the binocular and mirror, or only the mirror itself, can be rotated about a horizontal axis for altitude, and the entire mount may be provided with a lazy-susan type, or other rotatable, base for azimuth adjustment. Such an arrangement is the popular Sky Window 1 and is also amenable to do-it-yourself construction (Figure 6.12). These mounts are like Marmite—nobody seems to be ambivalent about them and observers seem to divide strongly into two diametrically opposed camps: those who extol their virtues and those who loathe them. In the interests of enabling you to assess my objectivity, I have to declare myself to be a member of the latter camp, although I have only briefly used a mirror mount and have never used Sky Window . The advantages of mirror mounts are obvious and simple: they permit observa- tion, particularly of higher altitudes, from a normal seated position and with the head at a range of angles for which the human body seems to be naturally designed (the “microscope position”), thus eliminating neck and back strain and the result- ing fatigue. The table, if one is used, also provides a rest for the elbows. There is no doubt that, from an ergonomic point of view, they are exceptionally comfortable 84 Figure 6.12. A homemade mirror mount (Photo: Florian Boyd)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"and are an ideal solution for those observers for whom this is a major considera- tion. They are also compact and relatively light, so they are relatively portable. If tables and chairs are not available at the observing location, it is no greater hard- ship to carry a portable/collapsible table and chair than it is to carry a tripod. The obvious disadvantages of mirror mounts are that they provide an inverted image of the sky and that, unless they have some sort of heater, they are prone to fogging. Some observers find them difficult to aim. I have not seen any that are suitable for use with binoculars bigger than about 80-mm aperture. There are also disadvantages of using an additional optical surface. There will be some light loss, although, as long as the mirror surface is of reasonably good quality, it will not be to the extent that it will be noticed in use by most observers. The mirror will also impose a limit to the amount of magnification used, due to the difficulties and con- comitant expense of making a large optically flat surface. This is not usually a problem with magnification of less than about × 15. Finally, there is the problem of cleaning. It is inevitable that such a large exposed surface will accumulate dust and debris; as with all first-surface mirrors, cleaning must be undertaken with extreme care so as not to damage the surface. Parallelogram Mounts Parallelogram mounts solve many of the problems inherent in the use of photo- graphic tripods and heads: • They move the observer away from the tripod so that its legs do not interfere with the observer’s body position, especially when observing at high elevations. • They offer easily changeable eyepiece height over a wide range and can thus accommodate different observing positions and observers of different heights. The eyepiece height can be changed without changing the aim of the binoculars, making them ideal for communal observing. • The mounting head can be designed so that binocular’s center of mass can be aligned with the altitude fulcrum, thus eliminating problems associated with a changing turning moment when objects of different altitudes are observed. • They are amenable to home construction by moderately competent wood or metal workers. Their disadvantages are that they are relatively bulky, they require counter- weights, and the long arms mean that vibrations take longer to damp down. The simplest incarnations of the parallelogram mount have only an altitude adjustment in the binocular mounting head, thus requiring that the observer moves in a circle around the tripod in order to change the azimuth. As more degrees of freedom of movement are introduced in the head, so more sky is observ- able from a single position. The epitome of this development is the Universal Astro- nomics 2 deluxe mounting head, which enables more than a quarter of the sky to be observed from a single position (Figure 6.13). A well-designed parallelogram mount, which has smooth motions and permits proper balancing of the weight of the binocular, almost confers the feeling that the binoculars are floating in the air in front of your eyes. Holding and Mounting Binoculars 85"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy If you decide upon a parallelogram mount, you should give careful considera- tion to the length of the parallelogram arms. Longer arms enable a wider variety of observing postures, so you can change from standing, through sitting, to reclin- ing without having to adjust the tripod height. Shorter arms have smaller damping times for vibrations, but require that the tripod height is adjusted for different observing postures. Parallelogram mounts, particularly those designed for big and giant binoculars, expose the limitations of photographic tripods, particularly those with center posts. The usual solution is to use a surveyor tripod. These usually do not have leg 86 a b Figure 6.13A,B.

This is ideal, and provides an exceptionally stable platform, if you observe on a surface where this is possible. On the other hand, if you observe on a surface that is unsuitable for this, you must acquire either spreaders or leg braces (which can be retrofitted to the tripod) or an expensive accident resulting from a slipping leg is all but inevitable. Do not be tempted to rely on being able to tighten the leg hinges sufficiently to prevent this. Spreaders can be obtained from most suppliers of survey tripods, and leg braces are available from Universal Astronomics. Observing Chairs Some form of observing chair can enhance the comfort of astronomical observ- ing with binoculars, as well as being extremely useful for naked-eye observation and enjoyment of the heavens. There is a variety of options, ranging from simple inexpensive garden chairs or reclining loungers, through a plethora of dedicated homemade designs, to commercially available devices that are motorized in azimuth and altitude. If you use binoculars because of their portability, an obvious choice is a col- lapsible recliner that is designed for portability. They are also suitable for use with a parallelogram mount. These come in their own carrying bag, usually with a shoulder sling. Features to look for include sturdy construction, good comfortable support for your head and legs, and a continuous range of reclining positions that are easy to change by pressure of legs or shoulders, but which do not change invol- untarily. It is not necessary for them to recline to a horizontal position; 30 degrees to the horizontal is adequate. Almost all of these chairs are thoughtfully provided with cylindrical mesh accessory holders in the arms; you can use these for lens caps, for eyepieces (if your binocular has interchangeable eyepieces), for spectacles (if you remove them to observe), for pencils for recording observations, for a red-light flashlight, or even for an insulated mug of warm drink or other refreshment. Some also have a pocket in the back of the seat that can act as convenient storage for observing charts or for this book. You may wish to add storage facilities to them. It is simple eno ugh to suspend a fabric po cket for notebooks from an arm of the chair and, if you are more comfortable with a cushion under your head, a fabric pocket for this can be attached in the appropri- ate place, or you can merely hold a cushion in place with bulldog clips. A relative shortcoming of these collapsible re cliners is that, unlike traditional garden loungers with wooden or rigid plastic arm rests, it is not simple to add extensions to raise the height of the arm rests to support your arms when you are hand- holding binoculars. However, a simple wooden frame could serve this purpose (Figure 6.14). If you are a competent wood or metal worker, you may be attracted by the idea of making your own observing chair. There is a multitude of designs of varying complexity on the Internet. Many of these are based on materials to which the con- structor has easy access, and many constructors are somewhat unobjective in their evaluation of their own designs, so you do need to exercise some thought and care Holding and Mounting Binoculars 87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy 88 a b Figure 6.14a,b,c.

Aiming becomes more difficult at higher magnifications and can be extremely difficult with angled eyepieces unless you are exceptionally familiar with the binocular view of the region of sky you are observing. Some form of finder is therefore extremely helpful in the latter cases. In order to avoid fogged optics, you should ensure that you mount the finder so that, when you use it, you are not breathing on the eyepieces of the binoculars. There are four distinct options: simple mechanical sight, reflex finders, finder scopes, and lasers. Simple Mechanical Sight A simple mechanical sight usually takes the form of either a sighting tube or a vee and blade sight. Both of these are amenable to do-it-yourself construction. They can be mounted to the binocular with hook-and-loop (e.g., Velcro) strip (loop on the binocular, hook on the sight) or rubber bands. Vee and blade sights were common on large naval binoculars up until the 1950s. Of all the options for binocular finders, these are probably the simplest sight to use. You can make a simple vee and blade sight with a strip of metal approximately Observing Accessories 93"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy 25 cm by 1 cm by 3 mm (10 by .5 by .125 inch). One end has a notch filed into it and the other is either filed to a point or, preferably, twisted 90 degrees about a longitudinal axis. About 5 cm (2 inches) of each end is bent at right angles in order to form a U shape. You mount the sight on the binoculars with the vee nearer the eyepiece end. You can align it with the optical axis of the binoculars merely by bending the metal strip. If you use a vee and blade you should ensure that there is no possibility of it coming into contact with your eye! A sighting tube is merely a straight tube of metal or plastic, about 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) long with a bore of about 1-cm (.5-inch) diameter. Such a tube will have a field of 2 or 3 degrees, depending on how far in front of your eye it is. It is therefore relatively trivial to position it so that its field is approximately the same as that of the binoculars. It may be more difficult to align it with the optical axis of the binocular, but this is usually possible with a little ingenuity through trial and error. The near end should not protrude beyond the eyepiece and, for added safety, should be edged with some soft material such as foam tape or something like a soft rubber tube pulled over it to form an eye cup. Compared to a vee and blade sight, the tube is simpler to store as it can usually be slipped into the binoc- ular case. Reflex Finders Reflex finders are unit power (i.e., no magnification) devices that use a simple optical system to project the illuminated image of either a dot or a reticle of con- centric circles onto the sky. The red dot finders tend to be more compact than the reticle type, and you may find that you can store it in the binocular case. Reticle finders are more bulky but are usually considered to be more useful, especially if the diameter of one of the circles is a close match to the field of view of your binoc- ulars. Regardless of whether the circles match the binocular field, you can use the circles for precise star hopping. Reflex finders usually include some form of aiming adjustment. In the red dot finders, this is usually achieved by ridged screws that move the finder relative to its base. In reticle finders, it is usually the orientation of the reflecting surface that is varied to change the aim. Most include a dimmer switch to alter the brightness of the dot or reticle so that it can both be seen against a bright sky and not “drown out” faint objects in a dark sky. The base of the finder slips into a mounting bracket that is attached to the binocular. Once I have established the optimum position for the finder, I fix the mounting bracket to the binocular with double-sided adhesive foam pads. Some manufacturers provide these pads with the finder but, if this is not the case, you may obtain either pads or double-sided adhesive foam tape from a good stationery or hardware store. These finders may be provided with two mounting brackets so that they can easily be swapped between instruments; alter- natively, spare mounting brackets can usually be obtained via the supplier. To avoid breathing on the eyepieces and fogging them when you use the finder, if you use your right hand eye with a finder, you should mount the finder on the left tube and vice versa. It is a common misconception that reflex finders are used only with one eye looking through it. Although this mode of use is possible with bright objects, if 94"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"you are looking through the reflecting surface all objects appear dimmer and most stars disappear entirely. The correct mode of use, as with all straight-through finders, is to begin with both eyes open. The eye that is not looking through the finder gets an unattenuated view of the sky and your brain merges the images received by both eyes, exactly as it does in “normal” use of a pair of Mark I eyeballs! My preferred reflex finder is the Rigel Quik-finder (Figure 7.1), which is rela- tively compact and whose aperture stands some 75 mm (3 inches) from the body of the binocular. This sighte also has the advantage of the ability to make the illu- mination blink on and off at an adjustable rate; this can be a great aid when tar- geting a faint object when its light is obliterated by the finder illumination. Finder Scopes Some people prefer finder scopes to unit power finders, and some large binoculars come equipped with them. The scope need not be of high power; the scope pro- vided with my 100-mm Miyauchi is a 3 × 12. If the finder is to be mounted between the optical tubes of the binocular, it should have a significant amount of eye relief if you are going to be able to avoid breathing on the eyepieces when you use the finder. The eye relief of the 3 × 12 (finder mentioned above) is 55 mm. This amount of eye relief is not to be found in finders intended for use with telescopes, conse- quently, these must be mounted to one side in the same manner as suggested above for reflex finders. On the other hand, telescopic sights designed for rifles do have adequate eye relief and have a magnification more in keeping with what is required for binoculars, although the field of view may be somewhat small. Although tele- scopic finders are useful in the daylight, I find them to be inferior to reflex sights for nighttime use with binoculars, but this is obviously a matter of personal pref- erence (Figure 7.2). Observing Accessories 95 Figure 7.1. Rigel Quik-finder ® reflex sight."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy Lasers In recent years the price of laser pointers has been decreasing and there is a growing trend of using them for astronomy, both as pointers and as finders. With the single exception of mirror mounts, for which they are the most practical type of finder, any advantage they offer over reflex finders is, in my opinion, more than offset by the combination of cost, potential danger of eye damage, and general nui- sance to other astronomers. If you do use a green laser in company, you should exercise extreme care and should ascertain that none of your fellow viewers objects to its use. Filters The most useful filters are the UHC and O-III filters. If you only purchase one, get the UHC. A standard 31.7-mm (1.25-inch) filter sold for telescope eyepieces can be used with most large binocular eyepieces by merely holding it over the eyepiece. It is not ideal in this position, as it is designed to be placed near the focal plane, but it is certainly effective. If you have a binoviewer or a binocular telescope, then you obviously use them as intended. There is no need to acquire two—a good method of using it is to “blink” between each eyepiece, when the sought after nebula often becomes obvious. An O-III filter is especially useful for identifying those planetary nebulae that appear to be stellar at the magnification of the binocular. Also useful, especially for solar eclipses and transits, are solar filters. These can be simply made from Baader Astro-Solar film to fit over the objective lenses. Solar- filtered binoculars are particularly useful for group viewing of solar phenomena (Figure 7.3). 96 Figure 7.2. 3 × 12 finder scope with 55- mm eye relief."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Dew Prevention and Removal In order to know how to combat dew, it is important to have some understanding of why it forms. Water vapor condenses out of the air onto any surface and simul- taneously evaporates from that surface. The potential rate of evaporation is lower at lower temperatures. Below a specific temperature, the dew point, the rate of evap- oration is lower than the rate of condensation and dew forms. The principles of dew reduction are then simple: reduce the amount of cooling of the optical sur- faces and reduce the amount of warm moist air (especially breath!) that comes into contact with them. Under a clear sky, objects, including optical surfaces, lose heat by radiative cooling. Outside our biosphere is space at a temperature of 2.7 K. Although the effective temperature of the sky is perhaps 100 K or so warmer than that, it is still a great deal colder than the surface of the earth. Hence, on clear nights (i.e., those good for astronomy) there will be a net loss of heat by radiation from the surface of the earth and things on it, like telescopes. As they cool, they become prone to dew (and frost) formation. Our simplest way of reducing dew formation is to reduce the amount of sky the optical components can “see.” Binocular objectives and reflex finders are among the most dew prone of all astronomical surfaces. Dew shields provide the simplest way of shielding binocular objectives from the cold sky but, of the binoculars that do have slide-out dew shields, very few are sufficiently long. To be fully effective, a dew shield should be about two and a half times as long as the aperture it is shield- ing. An extension of this length is unwieldy on small and medium binoculars, for which there are simpler methods for dew prevention and removal. Simple dew shields for larger binoculars can be made from stiff plastic (that from plastic folders is usually adequate) or 3-mm (.125-inch) thick polyethylene foam. These can be stored flat and can have their edges secured in use with hook-and eye (Velcro) strips. Observing Accessories 97 Figure 7.3. Group solar observing with filtered binoculars."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy For those who want a higher-tech solution, there are proprietary dew heaters, such as the Kendrick Dew Zapper, that are available commercially. These provide a low-level heat to the surrounding of the aperture. A do-it-yourself alternative, if you have the requisite skills, is to make a similar device using resistance wire or strings of resistors taped to the surround of the aperture. These need not impinge on the light path. Those readers with electronic capabilities will, no doubt, be able to see more sophisticated solutions. For small and medium binoculars, the solution I use nowadays is to hang the binocular inside my jacket as soon as there is any sign of dewing and, on cold nights, when I am not actually looking through them. If you do this, you will find that they immediately dew up even worse from the warm moist air under the jacket, but they soon clear and are ready for use again. Because hand-held binoculars are usually not held to the eyes for very long periods, their objectives tend to cool less quickly, and they are not as prone to dewing as are mounted binoculars. Eyepieces on larger binoculars offer a different problem. For obvious reasons, a long dew cap is not an option (and eye cups even make the matter worse!). The obvious thing is to avoid breathing on them, but there is another source of warm moist air: our eyes. It makes sense to dry a moist eye before putting it to an eye- piece, particularly if that eyepiece has an eye cup that will trap any moist air. On particularly cold nights, fold down or retract the eye cup. There are two obvious ways of warming eyepieces: an inside pocket or some form of electrical heating. I have never tried the latter (but there are commercially available eyepiece heaters), but I routinely swap eyepieces when I am observing in winter with my 100-mm binoculars. Reflex finders are particularly dew-prone. A solution specific to these is to use a piece of plastic folder to make a hemicylindrical shield that covers the entire length and possibly more of the finder. This should not be of a radius that it pre- cludes the use of both eyes with the finder. You can temporarily secure it with parcel or duct tape or tape or, once you are satisfied with it, you might use hook- and eye strips. 98 Figure 7.4. Twelve- volt hair drier and battery pack."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The practical alternative to dew prevention is dew removal. Several astronomi- cal suppliers provide “dew guns.” These are merely 12-volt portable hair driers that plug into the cigarette lighter socket of a car or battery pack (Figure 7.4). These are usually significantly less expensive if they are obtained from a camping store as “traveling” hair dryers. Compass A compass is invaluable when you are seeking twilight objects, be it Mercury at elongation or the evening objects during a Messier Marathon. A simple hiker’s compass with a bezel that can be adjusted to compensate for local magnetic dec- lination is ideal. If it has a tritium-lit luminous needle, north-point, and plate arrow, so much the better. Charts and Charting Software Our need, as binocular users, for sky charts, is no less than the need of telescopic astronomers, but is slightly different. Unless we are using giant binocular tele- scopes, we do not need charts that go as deep as those preferred by users of large telescopes. This means that our needs are usually completely met by the better “paper” charts and by most of the commonly available star-charting software. For example, the excellent Sky Atlas 2000 goes down to magnitude 8.5 and incorpo- rates galaxies and nebulae that are fainter than this. The choice of charts is there- fore a matter of preference and, often, familiarity. If our choice to use binoculars is based to some extent on their extreme porta- bility, we may wish to use charts or software that incorporate the same philosophy of choice. If this is the case, there is one paper chart that stands out: Collins Gem Stars (some older editions were called Collins Gem Night Sky). This little book is small enough to fit into a shirt pocket and contains sufficient information to keep the users of small and medium binoculars amused for many nights. If you prefer to use charting software, the “extremely portable” route suggests using a hand-held computer or personal digital assistant (PDA). There are a number of excellent software options for these, depending on the operating system used by the hand-held viewer. In general, there is more astronomical software written for PalmOS than for other operating systems. PalmOS Of the many examples of astronomical software available for PDAs, there are three planetarium programs that stand out: • 2Sky : This is commercial software and is not offered as an evaluation version, but has a 30-day refund policy if you find the software to be unsuitable. The “basic” version ($25) has stars to magnitude 7 and 500 deep sky objects (DSOs), Observing Accessories 99"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy the “total” version includes stars down to magnitude 9.5 and 13, 600 DSOs from the Messier/NGC/IC catalog, and the “mega” version has stars to magnitude 11.2 and the same DSOs as the “total” version. It also comes with 2Red, which changes the entire PDA to red-screen night mode. • Planetarium : This is “nagware,” that is, shareware that, until you register it, reminds you when you start and/or close the program that it is unregistered. It costs $24 to register. This is my most-used astronomical software. It has a “Compass View” that shows the lunar phase and, at a quick glance, the altitude and azimuth of the Sun, Moon, major planets, and one other object of your choice. It has instantly accessible rise and set tables and twilight tables. Among its most useful features is the ease with which catalogs of your choosing can be added to its database and with which objects can be imported into a “Personal” catalog that can be exchanged with other Planetarium users. It has stars to mag- nitude 6.5 as standard, but there are databases that go, by increments of one mag- nitude, down to 11.5 (i.e., the entire Tycho2/Hipparchos catalog). • PleiadAtlas : Like Planetarium, this is nagware ($10 to register). It goes down to magnitude 11.5 and incorporates the Messier, NGC, and IC catalogs. Windows CE There are two programs of significance for Windows CE: • TheSky Pocket Edition : This is commercial software with no evaluation version. The default stellar catalog goes to magnitude 6, and this can be expanded to mag- nitude 9 (the SAO database). It includes the NGC and IC catalogs of deep-sky objects and can include up to a hundred comets and asteroids, but the orbital elements for these must be updated using the PC version of the program. • Pocket Stars : There is no evaluation version, but there is a “no quibble” 30-day guarantee. Includes stars to just over magnitude 6 from the Bright Star catalog, and deep sky objects from the Messier and Caldwell catalogs. If you use a PalmOS system, there is one other piece of software that is invalu- able, not just for binocular astronomers: MoonDate. This piece of freeware calcu- lates the dates of the lunar phases and inserts them into the Palm calendar, thus acting as an aid to future planning of observations. There is one caveat to using a PDA: dark adaptation. Even if you do use a “red mode,” there is still sufficient light to destroy your eyes’ dark adaptation. The solu- tion is to cover the screen with either red or neutral density (better) translucent plastic sheet. Remove it if you have an emergency need for a flashlight. Torches (Flashlights) First, a note on terminology, born of several misunderstandings I have encoun- tered when communicating across the Atlantic. In U.K. English a “torch” is not the same as it is in American English. It does not mean a “flaming torch,” but what is, in American English, called a flashlight. A red-light torch is a useful piece of 100"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"observing kit, not only for reading charts, but also for examining equipment when this is necessary. Torches that use red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are more than adequate for most purposes. I find that they are much more useful if they can be head-mounted, thus leaving both hands free. There is an adjustable headband called a Nite Ize that is sold for precisely this purpose (Figure 7.5). There is, however, a potential problem with red illumination for reading charts. Red light focuses farther behind the retina than yellow light and, especially for those of us who eyes have become presbyopic with age, it can be difficult to focus the red-illuminated page. A solution, which is also applicable to people who prefer to observe without spectacles but who must use them for reading charts, is to use an illuminated magnifier. The light source can be covered with translucent red plastic or with red nail polish. The magnifier is also useful on a PDA screen. A white-light torch is useful when assembling and dismantling observing apparatus. Storage and Transport Container It makes sense to keep, with your binoculars, the various small items that you fre- quently use when observing. There are numerous options for containers and some binoculars come with very useful cases, although I have yet to find one that is ideal. A relatively inexpensive option is an aluminium camera case. If it comes with soft polyurethane foam, this should be replaced with a high-density polyethylene foam. This can easily be cut and shaped with a carving knife or a sharp chisel. Recesses in it can be made for flashlights, charts, finders, spare eyepieces, and so forth (Figure 7.6). Cases supplied with medium and small binoculars have very little capacity for extra storage. However, in my 10 × 50 case I do also keep the L-bracket for tripod mounting and the solar filters (which I store on the objectives). Observing Accessories 101 Figure 7.5. Small accessories.

Personal Comfort All other things being equal, the efficacy of visual observation is usually in direct proportion to the comfort of the observer. For the binocular observer, this means three things: physical comfort, thermal comfort, and nutritional comfort. Physical Comfort The plethora of homemade observing aids, ranging from simple recliners to com- puterized observing chairs, is an indication of the degree of comfort that binocu- lar observers seek to find. This should come as no surprise: the simple fact that one has chosen binoculars is often an indication that one has made a choice of optical comfort! For those of us who prefer to stand whilet observing (usually restricted to those of us whose binoculars are mounted and have angled eyepieces), our comfort is relatively easy to attain. On the other hand, those of us who prefer some sort of seating or reclining may well find it considerably more difficult, owing to the dif- Observing Techniques 103"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy ferences in our backs and necks. That which perfectly suits one person may well be an anathema to another. My best advice is to try out as many options as you can and, once you have found something that suits you, acquire or make it, and then treasure it. My Mac Sports recliner is such an item, and I treat it with almost as much care as I do my binoculars themselves. If you find something close to what is ideal for you, try to adapt it. This is usually achievable by judicious use of cush- ioning or padding, so that your back and neck are perfectly cradled and your arms are supported but not restricted. Thermal Comfort Almost by definition, astronomical observing takes place during the coldest part of the day. Each of us not only has a different sensitivity to and tolerance of cold, but this individual variation itself varies from day to day and even during the course of a night’s observing. Therefore, our personal insulation needs to be both adequate and adjustable; this implies layering. Furthermore, viewing through the eyepieces of the binocular is not a physically active task and, for this reason alone, we need to dress as though it were about five to ten degrees colder than it really is in order to compensate for the lack of physical activity. Those who are used to being in cold conditions will undoubtedly have their own “clothing solutions.” Those who are not may find some useful ideas in the following advice, whose prin- ciples have kept me comfortable for over a decade. • Undergarments : If you want to keep warm, avoid cotton; it is cold because it absorbs moisture (which is why we use it for towels) and uses our body heat to evaporate the water. If you wish to stick to natural fibres, change to wool (itchy) or silk (expensive), otherwise you need to use a synthetic “thermal” hydropho- bic fabric that wicks water away from the skin without absorbing it. • Insulting layer : The middle layer of clothing is the insulating layer, which needs to trap as much air as it can, because air is an excellent insulator. By far the most efficient insulating layer per unit weight, or per unit volume, is dry goose down, but the damper it gets the less effective it is. It takes ages to dry out, and it is extremely expensive. The moisture that has been wicked through the inner layer comes to the middle layer, which it will dampen unless it passes through. If you wish to stick to natural fibres, wool has the reputation for being a good insula- tor when it is wet, although it can be a bit heavy. Modern synthetics such as Hollofil, Thinsulate, and Polartec are excellent insulators and will wick moisture away from the body without absorbing it. It makes sense to have a zipped garment as this middle layer, so you can adjust your insulation to different con- ditions by opening and closing the zip. Also remember that this layer should not be too tight or be compressed by the outer layer, or its insulating properties (related to the amount of trapped air) are reduced. • Outer layer : While we tend not to observe in strong winds, even a 8 km/h (5 mph) breeze can make a great deal of difference to our thermal comfort if it can get into the insulating layer. The outer layer therefore needs to be windproof, but it must also pass the water vapor that has been wicked away from our bodies by the inner layers. A windproof Polartec fleece is ideal as a combination insulator/outer. 104"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"• Hats : It is said that we can lose up to 40 percent of our body’s heat through our heads. Even if this is as low as 25 percent, it indicates that we can regulate our body temperature by changing our headware, thereby reducing the need to deal with the insulating middle layer of clothing. “Extreme conditions” headware would follow the same pattern as our other clothing (i.e., silk or polypropylene balaclava, covered by a wool or polartec layer, covered by a windproof layer) but, for most of us, a simple fleecy hat, preferably with ear flaps, is adequate. • Gloves : There is no particularly elegant solution to the need to keep the fingers warm and also have them free and sufficiently sensitive to make fine adjust- ments. The best solution I have found is an insulated “hunter’s” glove that has a fold-back mitten over a fingerless glove as well as split thumbs. This keeps the fingers warm but enables the forefinger and thumb to easily slip out when necessary. • Footwear : On clear nights the ground cools faster than the air and we lose heat rapidly to the cold ground if we wear thin soles. Ordinary thick-soled shoes worn with two layers of socks (inner “wicking” sock, outer insulating “cushion loop” sock) are sufficiently warm for most temperate zone conditions, and for the more cold-footed among us, there are alternatives such as snow boots, which have thick soles and a removable inner sock of thick felt, often combined with a sandwiched reflective layer. Nutritional Comfort Adequate nutrition is essential as it combats fatigue and cold. It is difficult to observe comfortably after a heavy meal and is equally difficult when we are con- scious of hunger. If we are cold, we need to replace our lost energy with carbohy- drates. It is usually healthier to take these in the form of starches, which release their energy slowly, than as a sugar, although those who do not have contraindi- cating dietary requirements may find a warm glucose-based drink to be beneficial in some circumstances. It is also essential to keep a good fluid balance. Time can pass very rapidly when we are enjoying observation, and our steamy breath on cold nights is an indication of fluid loss. Over the past decade or so, people have become more conscious of the need for adequate hydration, but there is an additional benefit that is less well known: if we maintain good hydration, even by merely sipping cold water, our extremities tend to get less cold. Observing Sites Where possible, choose your observing site with care. Stray light is obviously to be avoided. Also avoid observing over buildings or other sources of heat. Altitude can be an advantage as it can take you above sources of stray light and you have less (polluted) atmosphere between you and your target objects. As little as 300 m (1,000 ft) can make a noticeable difference; transparency is usually considerably better from my home on the North Downs of Kent than it is a few miles away on Romney Marsh. Conversely, if you cannot get to high ground, you may be able to Observing Techniques 105"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy 106 observe over a sea horizon. The choice sites are those of very high altitude with a sea horizon, but few of us have access to such places. If you observe on your own property, you can, of course prepare it. Screens can be used to block intrusive lights if they cannot be blocked by buildings or vegeta- tion. Equally important is to prepare the ground. You cannot observe in a relaxed manner if you are in danger of tripping over objects on the ground! If you use a site away from home, do reconnoitre it in daylight and, where appro- priate, get the landowner’s permission. Take personal security into account. You cannot enjoy observing if you are concerned about the potential presence of domesticated or wild animals or of antisocial people. Observing Techniques Once our personal comfort is attended to, we can get down to the business of actual observation. There are various ways in which this can be enhanced: • Dark Adaptation : It takes at least twenty minutes to half an hour for our eyes to get properly dark-adapted, and the process of dark adaptation continues for over an hour. Some observers recommend closing your eyes for a few moments imme- diately before attempting a particularly difficult observation. • Av e r t e d Vi s i o n : Look down toward the tip of your nose so that light from the eye- piece appears to come from the “upper outside” of the eye. Use averted vision even for things that you can see well without it as this will very often allow more detail to be seen. • Perfect Focus : Ensure that your binoculars are perfectly focused. This will allow dimmer objects and more detail to be seen. Center-focus binoculars tend to get defocused more easily than those with independent eyepiece focus. • Keep the Binoculars Still : If something is difficult to observe, ensure that the binoculars are firmly mounted. Keep looking and sometimes the object just appears. • Jiggle the Binoculars : This seems contradictory to the advice above, but it some- times helps, when using mounted binoculars, to examine the appropriate region with averted vision and to tap the binocular. The slight movement sometimes makes a difficult object appear. • Breathe : It is a normal reaction for us to hold our breath when we are doing something critical, especially if that activity is assisted by stillness. Try to over- come this tendency if you have it: a well-oxygenated retina is more sensitive. In particular, carbon monoxide from smoke reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. • Patience and Persistence : These are probably the most important attributes of the successful observer. It can sometimes take several minutes to make a fleeting, difficult observation, and it may take several attempts over several nights before the various conditions are just right to allow the observation to be made. A patient, persistent observer can see more than a less patient one with better eye- sight!"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE The objects in this chapter are visible with medium-sized binoculars, although some are visible in much smaller instruments. Most of the objects to the far south, for example, are easily visible in 8 × 30 binoculars. With the exception of objects that fill the eyepiece in 10 × 50 binoculars, all of these objects are better viewed, in the sense that more detail can be seen, in larger instruments. Similarly, many objects in the list for 100-mm binoculars are visible—or at least detectable—in smaller instruments, but often no detail is visible. For example, under good con- ditions an experienced observer can see the Ring Nebula, M57, in 10 × 50 binocu- lars, but it is stellar in appearance. Any “best of ” selection is bound to be somewha t subjective, and I acknowledge that I am particularly fond of open clusters as objects for binocular and small tele- scope observation. I have tried to include representative objects of all classes, but the relative ease with which open clusters can be seen, especially in nonideal sky conditions, helps to account for their apparent overrepresentation. In addition to stars, the following classes of object are included: • Emission nebulae: These consist of gas that is ionized by the energy radiated by nearby stars. The light is emitted as electrons are recaptured. They appear red in photographs, but the brighter ones may have a greenish tinge when observed by eye. They are often the sites of star formation. • Planetary nebulae: So called by William Herschel because many of them appeared as discs (although only about 10 percent appear circular), that is, like planets, in his telescope. They are the debris ejected from a star as it passes through the red giant stage to become a white dwarf. 50 Deep Sky Objects for 50 mm Binoculars 107"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy 108 • Reflection nebulae: They are made visible by reflected starlight and are thus always less bright than the star that illuminates them (unless the star is attenu- ated by intervening dust). It is tiny dust particles, not the gas of the nebula, that reflects the light. They appear blue in photographs. • Galaxies: Huge island universes of hundreds of billions of stars held together by gravity. • Globular clusters: Very old dense balls of hundreds of thousands of stars, which form halos around galaxies. • Open clusters: Less densely packed groups of stars than open clusters; may contain from a few dozen to a few thousand stars that recently formed in the galactic disc.

The larger aperture enables greater magnification, and together these factors enable many more fainter objects to be seen. Particular beneficiaries of this are galaxies and planetary nebulae. I usually use my 100-mm binoculars with × 37 eyepieces. A finder of some description, particularly a reflex finder with circles, is invaluable for star-hopping to objects. For objects that I can identify in smaller binoculars, I tend to use my 10 × 42 binoculars to locate the object, and center the finder on that location in the sky. Because larger binoculars tend to be mounted, it is easier to use filters on them (Chapter seven), making otherwise difficult objects a little easier. The charts (listed in alphabetical order by constellation) in this chapter show a 2.5-degree field of view circle, and star-hopping information is based on this field unless otherwise stated.

Abbé prism :A roofprism. Aberration : An optical effect that degrades an image. Absolute magnitude : The apparent magnitude that an object would possess it if were placed at a distance of 10 parsecs from the observer. In this way, absolute magnitude provides a direct comparison of the brightness of stars. Accomodation : The ability of the eyes to focus on both near and distant objects. The normal range is from about 120 mm (4.5 inches) to infinity. Achromatic : Literally “no color.” A lens combination in which chromatic aberra- tion is corrected by bringing two colors to the same focus. Airy disc : The bright central part of the image of a star. It is surrounded by dif- fraction rings and its size is determined by the aperture of the telescope or binocular. About 85 percent of the light from the star should fall into the airy disc. You will not see the disc and rings unless you have a binocular telescope or binoculars that operate at unusually high magnifications. Altazimuth : A mounting in which the axes of rotation are horizontal and vertical. An altazimuth mount requires motion of both axes to follow an astronomical object, but is simpler to make than an equatorial mount and can, in some forms, be held together by gravity. Albedo : The proportion of incident light which a body reflects in all directions. The albedo of Earth is 0.36, that of the Moon is 0.07, and that of Uranus is 0.93. The true albedo may vary over the surface of the object so, for practical pur- poses, the mean albedo is used. Altitude : The angle of a body above or below the plane of the horizon—negative altitudes are below the horizon. APPENDIX G Glossary of Te r m s 273"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy Amici prism : A right angled prism whose hypotenuse face has been formed into a roof. It is used to erect images. Anastigmat : An optical system that is corrected for astigmatism in at least one off-axis zone and for which it has tolerable correction for the intended purpose over the rest of the field. Angle of incidence : The angle between the normal to an optical surface and the incident ray. Angle of reflection : The angle formed-between the normal to an optical surface and the reflected ray. Angle of refraction : The angle formed-between the normal to an optical surface and the refracted ray. Aperture : The diameter of the largest bundle of light that can enter an optical system. It is usually the diameter of objective lens or primary mirror. Aperture stop : A physical aperture that restricts the size of the bundle of light passing through an optical system. Aphelion : The position in a heliocentric orbit at which the orbiting object is at its greatest distance from the Sun. Apoapsis : The position in an orbit at which the orbiting object is at its greatest distance from the object about which it is orbiting. Apochromatic : A lens combination in which chromatic aberration is corrected by bringing three colors to the same focus. The term is used by some manufactur- ers to describe achromatic doublets whose false color is approximately equiva- lent to that of an apochromatic triplet lens. Apogee : The position in a geocentric orbit at which the orbiting object is at its greatest distance from Earth. Apparent field (of view) : The angular size of the entire image (see also true field (of view) ). Apparent magnitude : The brightness of a body, as it appears to the observer, mea- sured on a standard magnitude scale. It is a function of the luminosity and dis- tance of the object, and the transparency of the medium through which it is observed. Arcminute : One sixtieth of a degree of arc. Arcsecond : The second division of a degree of arc. One sixtieth of an arc minute (1/3600th of a degree). Astigmatism : An optical aberration resulting from unequal magnification across different diameters. Axial rays : Rays that originate from a distant object on the optical axis. Azimuth : The angular distance around the horizon, usually measured from north (although it is sometimes measured from south), of the great circle passing through the object. Back focus : The distance between the exit aperture of an optical tube and the posi- tion of the image plane. Binoviewers in particular require a significant amount of back focus. Baffle : An opaque barrier that is positioned so as to reduce or eliminate the effects of stray light in an optical system. In binoculars these often take the form of machined ridges or screw threads in the objective tubes. BaK4 : Barium crown glass. This is a glass of high optical density that is used for the prisms of good quality binoculars. 274"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Barlow lens : A diverging lens that has the effect of increasing (usually doubling) the effective focal length of the telescope. Binocular vision :See Stereopsis. Binoviewer : A device that splits equally the single light cone from a telescope into two light cones to enable the observer to use both eyes for observation. BK7 : Borosilicate glass. Cheaper and less dense than BaK4 , it is commonly found in cheaper binocular prisms. Blind spot : The position where the optic nerve enters the retina. It can become noticeable when using optical instruments, but its effect is ameliorated by the use of both eyes. Catadioptric : A telescope whose optics, not including the eyepiece, consists of both lenses and mirrors. The most common examples of these are the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, whose “lens” is an aspheric corrector plate, and the Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes, whose “lens” is a deeply curved meniscus. Cells : The part of an optical instrument that holds the lenses or mirrors. Chromatic aberration :An aberration of refractive optical systems in which light is dispersed into its component colors, resulting in false color in the image. There are two distinct manifestations of it: longitudinal chromatic aberration: Light of different wavelengths is brought to different foci, and lateral chromatic aberra- tion: Light of different wavelengths forms images of different sizes. Collimation : 1. The act of bringing of the optical components of a telescope into correct alignment with each other. 2. The act of making the optical axes of the optical tubes of the binocular parallel to each other and, where appropriate, to the central hinge. (See also conditional alignment ). Coma : 1. The matter surrounding the nucleus of a comet—it results from the evaporation of the nucleus. 2. An optical aberration in which stellar images are fan-shaped, similar to comets. Comes (pl. comites): The faint companion of a double star. Concave : Curving inward at the center. Convex : Curving outward at the center. Conditional alignment : An incomplete collimation of a binocular in which the optical axes are parallel to each other but not to the central hinge. The optical axes are therefore only parallel at a specific Interpupillary distance . Culmination : An object is at culmination when it reaches the observer’s meridian. It is then at its greatest altitude. Declination : The angle of an object above or below the celestial equator. It is part of the system of equatorial coordinates. Depth of field : The range of distances from the objective lens for which objects appear to be in focus when the binocular (or other optical system) is focused on an object within that range. Dialyte : A double lens in which the inner surfaces have different curvatures and which cannot therefore be cemented. Diffraction limited : A measure of optical quality in which the performance is limited only by the size of the theoretical diffracted image of a star for a tele- scope of that aperture. Distortion :An aberration in which the periphery of the field undergoes a differ- ent magnification to the center of the field. There are two major types: barrel Appendix G 275"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Binocular Astronomy distortion: the center is magnified more than the periphery, and pincushion distortion: the periphery is magnified more than the center. Dobsonian : Named after John Dobson, who originated the design. An altazimuth mount constructed usually of plywood or medium density fiberboard suited to home construction. Also refers to a telescope or binocular telescope so mounted. Elongation : The angular distance between the Sun and any other solar system body, or between a satellite and its parent planet. Equatorial mount : A mounting in which one of two mutually perpendicular axes is aligned with Earth’s axis of rotation, thus permitting an object to be tracked by rotating this axis so that it counteracts Earth’s rotation. Exit pupil : The position of the image of the aperture formed by the eyepiece. It is the smallest disc through which all the collected light passes and is therefore the best position for the eye’s pupil. Also known as an eye ring or a Ramsden disc. Eyepiece : The lens combination that is closest to the eye. Eye relief : The distance from the eye lens of the eyeglass to the exit pupil . Eyeglass wearers require sufficient eye relief to enable them to place the eye at the exit pupil. Eye ring : An alternative name for the exit pupil . Field of view : The maximum angle of view through an optical instrument. f-number, f-ratio : The ratio of the focal length to the aperture. Focal plane : The plane (usually this is actually the surface of a sphere of large radius) where the image is formed by the main optics of the telescope. The eye- piece examines this image. Focuser : The part of the telescope that varies the optical distance between the objective lens or primary mirror and the eyepiece. This is usually achieved by moving the eyepiece in a drawtube, but in some catadioptric telescopes it is the primary mirror that is moved. Fork mount : A mount where the telescope swings in declination or in altitude between two arms. It is suited only to short telescope tubes, such as Cassegrains, and variations thereof. It requires a wedge to be used equatorially. Galilean moons : The four Jovian moons first observed by Galileo (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). They are observable with small binoculars. German equatorial mount (GEM) :A common equatorial mount for small and medium-sized amateur telescopes, suited to both long and short telescope tubes. The telescope tube is connected to the counterweighted declination axis, which rotates in a housing that keeps it orthogonal to the polar axis. Tracking an object across the meridian requires that the telescope be moved from one side of the mount to the other, which in turn requires that both axes are rotated through 180 degrees, thus reversing the orientation of the image. This is not a problem for visual observation, but is a limitation for astrophotography. Granulation : The “grains of rice” appearance of the Sun’s surface, which results from convection cells within the Sun. Great circle : A circle formed on the surface of a sphere by the intersection of a plane that passes through the center of the sphere. A great circle path is the shortest distance between two points on a spherical surface. Image plane : A plane, perpendicular to the optical axis, where the image is formed. 276"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Inferior conjunction : The conjunction of Mercury or Venus when they lie between Earth and the Sun.

Occultation : An alignment of two bodies with the observer such that the nearer body prevents the light from the farther body from reaching the observer. The nearer body is said to occult the farther body. A solar eclipse is an example of an occultation. Off-axis : At an angle to the optical axis. Opposition : The position of a planet such that Earth lies between the planet and the Sun. Planets at opposition are closest to Earth at opposition, and thus oppo- sition offers the best opportunity for observation. Optical axis : The “line of optical centers” of the elements of an optical system. It is the line of the principal axes of these optical elements and, when they are curved, it is the line passing through their centers of curvatures. OTA : Abbreviation for optical tube assembly. It is normally considered to consist of the tube itself, the focuser and the optical train from the objective lens (refrac- tor), primary mirror (reflector), or corrector plate (catadioptrics) up to, but not including, the eyepiece. Paraxial rays : Rays that are close to and parallel to the optical axis. Parfocal eyepieces : Eyepieces sharing the same focal plane. They can be inter- changed without refocusing.

Reflector : A telescope whose optics, apart from the eyepiece, consist of mirrors. Refractive index : A measure of the relationship between the angles of incident and refracted rays. Refractor : A telescope whose optics consist entirely of lenses. Resolution : A measure of the degree of detail visible in an image. It is normally measured in arcseconds .

It is the angle of the cone of rays at the aperture that is transmitted as a usable image. Umbra : 1. The shadow that results when a bright object is completely occulted. A total eclipse of the Sun occurs when the observer is in the Moon’s umbra; 2. The dark inner region of a sunspot. Vignetting : The loss of light, usually around the periphery of an image, as a consequence of an incomplete bundle of rays p assing through the optical system. Visual axis : A line from the object, through the node of the eye’s lens, to the fovea. We d g e : The part that fits between the tripod or pillar and the fork of a fork- mounted telescope, which enables the fork to be equatorially aligned. Zenith : The point on the meridian directly above an observer.
