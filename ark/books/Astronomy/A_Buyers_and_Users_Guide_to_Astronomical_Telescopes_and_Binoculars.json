I would take that a step further and say that someone in every home should have one! For without these wondrous instruments, we are out of touch with the awesome universe in which we live. I have no doubt that Frost himself would have agreed with me, for he was an avid stargazer throughout his long life. The book you’re holding in your hands will make it possible for you to be that someone who has the vision and curiosity to own a telescope. It will help answer such questions as: “Should I buy a new or used telescope?” “Can I make one myself?”, “Which type is best?”, “What size should I get and how much should I spend?”, “How much power do I need?”, “What can I see with it once I get it?”, and “Do I really need a telescope or will binoculars suffi ce?” These are all impor- tant concerns – and ones that should be addressed before plunging into the pur- chase of any instrument intended for stargazing. This book contains two main themes. One deals with the different kinds of astronomical telescopes and binoculars, and recommended sources for them. The other tells you how to use them once you possess them and what to look at in the sky. Perhaps this is as good a place as any to explain what we mean when we describe an instrument as “astronomical.” This term relates to its optical quality. While just about any telescope will show the features of the Moon’s alien land- scape, the four bright jewel-like satellites of Jupiter, and perhaps even the majestic ice-rings of Saturn, there’s an amazing difference in the views seen of these and a host of other celestial wonders through a precision optical system compared with those in one of poor or mediocre quality. Most binoculars and low-end v"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"vi Preface “spotting grade” telescopes are designed with terrestrial use in mind rather than celestial. The optical precision needed to produce razor-sharp views of the Moon and planets and pinpoint images of stars is an order of magnitude above that required for ground-based observing. Since binoculars are normally used at very low magnifi cations (typically 10 × or less), optical aberrations are not nearly as critical an issue for them as they are for a telescope with its correspondingly greater magnifi cations (typically 50 × and higher). For many readers – particularly those who are already somewhat familiar with telescopes and binoculars, as well as with their use – the greatest value of this book may well prove to be the extensive compilations in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 that provide handy references to the principal manufacturers and sources for these instruments. Here you’ll fi nd standard mail and Internet web-site addresses, telephone numbers (in most cases), and an overview of types and models offered. Since new or upgraded instruments are constantly being added to many manu- facturers’ lines, you’ll be able to get information and specifi cations on the very latest available models, current prices, and delivery times through their catalogs and other literature (both on-line and printed copies). Distilled in this volume is the author’s more than 50 years of experience in making, designing, selecting, testing – and especially using – literally thousands of different sizes, types, and makes of telescopes. These have included refractors from 2- to 30-inch (!) in aperture, refl ectors from 3- to 60-inch, and compound catadioptric scopes from 3.5- to 22-inch in size, employed both for casual per- sonal observing and (in the case of the larger apertures) for research work as well. And after all those instruments and all those years, I’m as excited about tele- scopes and stargazing as ever! It should be mentioned here that this present book is not intended to be a comprehensive treatise on all the intricate technical aspects of telescope and binocular optics – nor is it intended to be an all-encompassing guidebook on their use in astronomy. (References are given throughout for those who do wish to dig deeper into these areas.) Its purpose, instead, is to offer readers a con- densed, trustworthy treatment of these topics that is suffi cient to make informed decisions on the selection and use of these instruments – but general enough to not overwhelm them. And although I discuss telescopes costing many thousands of dollars, I also cover ones priced at around a hundred dollars. Stargazing can indeed be a very affordable pastime! If you are new to the fi eld, it’s best to start with a basic instrument of good quality (especially optically) and then in time graduate to a larger and/or more sophisticated one if desired. Despite all the varied types and sizes of instruments I’ve used over the years, my most pleasur- able observing experiences still continue to be those with a 3-inch short-focus refractor at 30 × and a 5-inch catadioptric telescope at magnifi cations of 40 × to 100 × . Each of them, used on an interchangeable, lightweight but sturdy altazi- muth mounting with smooth slow-motion controls and wooden tripod, weighs in at less than a dozen pounds. Another long-time favorite instrument is a very portable 6-inch refl ector on a basic Dobsonian mounting. It’s my sincere wish that, whatever level your present familiarity and experi- ence with telescopes and binoculars may be, if you read this book carefully you will be able to select a quality optical instrument ideally suited to your particular needs and intended purposes.

But these devices should not be looked upon as yet more gadgets to add to our collection of modern technical posses- sions. Rightly viewed, they are truly magical instruments, for they are literally “spaceships of the mind,” “time machines,” and “windows on creation” that allow their users to roam the universe in what is surely the next best thing to actually being there! These lines from William Wordsworth convey something of the excitement that seeing a telescope aimed skyward typically evokes: What crowd is this? what have we here! we must not pass it by; A Telescope upon its frame, and pointed to the sky. As you work your way through the many specifi cations and recommendations contained in the following pages, keep foremost in your mind the wonder of what you’re ultimately dealing with in the selection and use of these wonderful devices.

New Versus Used Equipment While this volume focuses on the selection and use of commercially made and available telescopes and binoculars, something should be said about used equipment. Often, a telescope or pair of binoculars can be found on the second- hand used market for a fraction of its original cost new, making it possible to own an instrument that you might otherwise not be a ble to afford. But the down- side of this is that you have no guarantee of its optical or mechanical condition unless you can actually see and use it before making the purchase. For items bought online over the Internet or by mail, this is not normally possible. In such cases, a substantial deposit should be offered the seller, with the balance to be paid after receiving and inspecting the instrument (and with the clear under- standing that the deposit will be refunded and the instrument returned should any problems be found). The ideal situation is to purchase used equipment within easy driving distance – and preferably from a member of a local astron- omy club – where you can inspect and use it before buying. Aside from examin-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 Making Your Own As with purchasing used equipment, something also needs to be said about the alternative of making a telescope yourself. (Binoculars are not considered here, for their prices are typically so much lower than that of a telescope and their assembly from scratch so much more involved that it’s scarcely worth the time and effort to attempt doing this.) And here we need to differentiate between making a telescope and assembling one. The former involves the time- honored but equally time-consuming art of fabricating the optical components (typically the primary mirror for a refl ector and the objective lenses for a refractor). With quality optics mass-produced by machine widely available and reasonably priced today, most “telescope makers” opt for the latter, purchasing the optical components and building the rest of the instrument. This is espe- cially true in the case of the immensely popular, large-aperture Dobsonian refl ectors covered in Chapter 5. (A great resource here is Richard Berry’s Build Yo u r O w n Te l e s c o p e , Willmann-Bell, 2001.) But as a former telescope maker myself, I can attest that there is no thrill quite like viewing the heavens through an instrument that has optics m ade entirely with your own hands! If you want to go this route, there are many excellent books on grinding, polishing, and testing the mirror for a refl ecting telescope. An old standby is Making Your Own Telescope by Allyn Thompson, which was reissued by Dover Publications in 2003. ing the tube assembly and mounting for any mechanical damage, you must also carefully check the optical performance using a test like that described later in this chapter. Among the most sought-after used telescopes are: pre-1980 model Unitron refractors (especially the 2.4- and 3-inch) Criterion Dynascope refl ectors (especially the 6-inch) Cave Astrola refl ectors (all models) Optical Craftsmen refl ectors (especially the 8-inch) Fecker Celestar (4-inch refl ector) early models of Questar’s 3.5-inch Maksutov-Cassegrain Mention should also be made of the legendary classic “antique” refractors by such optical masters of the past as Alvan Clark, John Brashear, and Carl Zeiss. With the exception of Unitron and Questar, these fi rms have been out of the telescope manufacturing business for years, making their instruments true collector’s items. If you happen to own one of these gems already – or have an opportunity to purchase one used and in good condition – consider yourself extremely fortunate!"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 6 Optical Testing Whether you purchase a telescope new or used, or make one yourself, you simply must know how to test its optical performance! Many sophisticated methods of doing this have been developed over the years by both astronomers and telescope opticians – including Foucault, Ronchi, Hartmann, and interferometric laser testing. But there is one very simple, convenient, and sensitive test that’s easy to perform almost anywhere and at any time – even in broad daylight. Known as the extrafocal image or star test , it uses the image of a star as the test source. This can be either a real one in the night sky or an artifi cial one produced by shining light through a small pinhole. The latter is especially useful for testing optics in the daytime. (An alternative here is to use the specular refl ection of the Sun off the chrome bumper of a car in the distance, or off a glass insulator on a power line; this produces a bright beam of light that is essentially a point source.)

The out-of-focus (extrafocal) image of a star can reveal many things about a telescope’s optics (as well as about its thermal environment and the state of the atmosphere) – in this case, the alignment of the optical components. The image in the left-hand panel reveals gross misalignment. That in the middle panel shows moderate misalignment (still enough to degrade image quality), while the image in the right-hand panel indicates perfectly collimated optics. The test is simplicity itself. If you’re working with a real star, choose one that’s neither too bright nor too faint. An ideal choice is Polaris ( α Ursae Minoris), the Pole Star. Not only is it of an ideal brightness but it also offers the great advantage of not moving due to the diurnal rotation of the Earth during testing – a real plus if you’re using a telescope without a motor drive! Using a medium-magnifi cation eyepiece (one giving about 20 × per inch of aperture), fi rst place the star at the center of the eyepiece fi eld and bring it into sharp focus. Next defocus the star, by going either inside of focus or outside of it, and examine the image. You should see a circular disk within which are concentric rings of equal brightness. (If using a refl ector or compound telescope, you will also see the dark silhouette of the secondary mirror at the center of the disk.) Now move an equal distance on the other side of focus. Should you see an identical-looking disk and ring pattern in both positions, congratulations – your telescope has essentially perfect optics! (The technical term for this is diffraction limited , meaning that performance is limited solely by the wave nature of light itself rather than the quality of the optical system.) If optical defects are present, they will readily reveal themselves in the extra- focal image. For example, should the image be triangularly shaped on either side of focus, you have pinched optics. This usually means that either the primary mirror of a refl ector or the objective lens of a refractor is mounted too tightly in its cell. This can typically be remedied by loosening the mirror clips in the former case or backing off on the retaining ring in the latter one. If you see an elliptically shaped image that turns 90 degrees as you reverse focus, you have a serious con- dition known as astigmatism . However, before putting the blame on your primary optics, make sure that this isn’t in the eyepiece or your own eye! Simply turning the eyepiece in its focusing tube will show if it’s the former, while rotating your head will show if it’s the latter – in either case, as evidenced by the turning of the ellipse with it."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 8 There are other symptoms to look for. Concentric rings that have a jagged or shaggy appearance to them indicate that the optical surface is rough (typically resulting from rapid machine polishing) rather than smooth. Rings that vary in thickness and brightness rather than being uniform in appearance indicate zones (high ridges and low valleys) in the optical surface. Rings that are bunched together and skewed into a comma-shaped image indicate that the optics are misaligned. The extrafocal image can also tell you something about the state of the atmosphere (a rapid rippling across the disk being seen on turbulent nights), the cooling of the optical components (eerie, snake-like plumes moving across the image until the optics reach equilibrium with the night-time air temperature), and the thermal environment of your observing site (waves seen like those rising from a pavement on a warm day). You should perform this test not only when you buy an instrument but also frequently afterward, in particular to check the optical alignment, or collimation . This is especially critical in refl ectors and Schmidt-Cassegrains, which can often be thrown out of collimation simply by moving them from place to place. With the exception of well-made refractors and Maksutov-Cassegrain systems (both of which are essentially permanently aligned, owing to the way the optics are mounted in their cells), shipping a telescope is often enough to throw the collima- tion out. Once learned, the adjustments are relatively simple to perform (espe- cially for a Newtonian refl ector) and will make a signifi cant difference in the image quality that you see at the eyepiece. The fi nest reference ever written on the subject of extrafocal image testing is Harold Richard Suiter’s Star Testing Astronomical Telescopes (Willmann-Bell, 1994). It offers an exhaustive treatment of the subject and contains a wonderful array of extrafocal images showing various optical conditions that may be seen at the eyepiece of a telescope. (It should be mentioned here that once binoculars become out of collimation – as evidenced by seeing double images! – they require the services of a professional optician and special alignment jigs to correct, owing to the complex light paths through several trains of prisms.)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO It’s commonly recommended that, before you buy a telescope, you should fi rst get a pair of binoculars. And with very good reason! Not only are such glasses much less expensive, very portable, and always ready for immediate use, but they can also provide views of the heavens unmatched by any telescope. This results primarily from their incredibly wide fi elds of view – typically 5 or 6 degrees (or 10 to 12 full-Moon diameters) in extent compared with the 1-degree fi elds of most telescopes, even used at their lowest magnifi cations. There are also ultra-wide- fi eld models that take in a staggering 10 degrees of sky. Binoculars are ideal for learning your way around the heavens and for exploring what lurks beyond the naked-eye star patterns. But there’s another aspect of “seeing double” (as binocular observing is some- times referred to) that makes these optical gems unsurpassed for stargazing. And that’s the remarkable illusion of depth or three-dimensionality that results from viewing with both eyes. This is perhaps most striking when observing the Moon, which through binoculars looks like a huge globe suspended against the starry background – especially during an occultation, when it passes in front of a big, bright star cluster such as the Pleiades or Hyades. See also the discussion in Chapter 13 about apparent depth perception when viewing the Milky Way’s massed starclouds with binoculars (or with the unaided eye). Finally, aesthetics aside, it’s been repeatedly shown that using both eyes to view celestial objects improves image contrast, resolution, and sensitivity to low light levels by as much as 40%! Binoculars Seeing Double 9"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 10 A binocular consists essentially of two small refracting telescopes mounted side- by-side and in precise parallel optical alignment with each other. Between each of the objective lenses and eyepieces are internal prism assemblies that serve not only to fold and shorten the light path, but also to provide erect images. (Inex- pensive “imitation binoculars” such as opera and fi eld glasses use negative eye- piece lenses instead of prisms to give an erect image, resulting in very small fi elds of view and inferior image quality.) The spacing between the optical axes of the two halves of a binocular (known as the interpupilary distance ) can be adjusted for different observers’ eyes by rotating the tubes about the supporting connection between them. If this spacing isn’t properly set to match the separation between your eyes, you will see two overlapping images. In this same area is a central focusing knob that changes the eyepiece focus for both eyes simultaneously. An additional diopter focus is pro- vided on most binoculars (typically on the right-side eyepiece) to compensate for any differences in focus between the two eyes. Once this adjustment has been made, you need only use the main focus to get equally sharp images for both. Some lower-grade binoculars offer a rapid-focusing lever; although this allows for quick changes in focus, the adjustment is too coarse for the critical focusing required when viewing celestial objects. Two numbers are used for the specifi cation of a binocular. The fi rst is the magnifi cation or power ( × ), followed by the aperture or size of the objective lenses in millimeters (mm). Thus, a 7 × 50 glass magnifi es the image 7 times and has objectives 50 mm (or 2 inches) in diameter. Another important para- meter is the size of the exit pupil produced by a binocular, which is easily found by dividing the aperture by the magnifi cation. This means that 7 × 50 binoculars produce bundles of light exiting the eyepieces that are just over 7 mm across. (These bundles can be seen by holding a binocular against the daytime sky at arm’s length. You’ll fi nd two circles of light seemingly fl oating in the air before you.) The pupil of a fully dark-adapted human eye dilates or opens to about 7 mm, and so in theory all the light a 7 × 50 collects can fi t inside the eye. (This binocular is the famed Navy “night glass” developed long ago by the military for optimum night vision.) But in practice, not only does the eye’s ability to open fully decrease with age, but light pollution and/or any surrounding sources of illumination reduce dilation as well. Only under optimum conditions can the full light grasp of a 7 × 50 be utilized. Thus, a better choice for astronomical use is the 10 × 50, which gives a 5-mm exit pupil and slightly higher magnifi cation, improving the amount of detail you can see. A 7 × 35 or 6 × 30 binocular also provides a 5-mm pupil, but these smaller sizes have less light-gathering power and resolution than does a larger glass. Another feature of a binocular to look for is its eye relief . This is the distance you need to hold your eyes from the eyepieces to see a fully illuminated fi eld of view. It ranges from less than 12 mm for some models to over 24 mm for others. If the relief is too short, you’ll have to “hug” the eyepieces to get a full fi eld of view, and if too long you may have diffi culty centering the binoculars over your Specifi cations"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Binoculars 11 eyes. A good value is around 15 mm to 20 mm, especially if you wear glasses – if you do, longer eye reliefs are preferred over shorter ones. Note that if you wear glasses simply to correct for near- or far-sightedness (rather than for astigma- tism), you can remove them and adjust the focus to compensate. Most binoculars today have fold-down rubber eyecups to enable you to get closer to the eyepi eces if necessary; these also keep your eyes from touching the glass surfaces and (depending on style) help keep out stray light. While just about any size of binocular can be and has been used for stargazing, the 7 × 50 and 10 × 50 are the most popular choices among observers. (See also the section on giant binoculars later in the chapter.) Moreover, 10 × and 50 mm are about the highest magnifi cation and largest aperture that can be conveniently held by hand; more power and/or bigger sizes require mounting the binocular on a tripod in order to hold it steady. (It should be mentioned here that zoom binocu- lars are also widely available today. While offering a range of magnifi cations with the fl ick of a lever, these generally have inferior image quality and fi elds of view that change as the power changes.) Good stargazing binoculars in the size range above are available for under $100 from a number of companies, including Bushnell, Celestron, Eagle Optics, Nikon, Oberwerk, Orion, Pentax, and Swift. (See Chapter 8 for contact information on these and many other manufacturers.) Prices for premium astronomical glasses typically run between two and three times this amount. Roof prism binocular Porro prism binocular Figure 2.1. Optical light path through a roof prism binocular (left) and a Porro prism binocular (right). Although bulkier than the former, the latter is preferred for astronomical viewing because of its superior image quality."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 12 There are two basic types of prism assemblies used in quality binoculars today – the more modern and compact roof prism style, and the traditional Porro prism design. The latter yields images that are brighter and sharper and have better contrast than does the former, but at the expense of more bulk and weight. Porros give binoculars their well-known zigzag shape, while roofs have a straight- through, streamlined appearance. For a variety of optical imaging reasons, Porro prism binoculars are preferred for astronomical use. Another factor here is the type of glass used to make the prisms themselves. Better-quality binoculars use BaK-4 barium crown glass , while less expensive models use BK-7 borosilicate glass . BaK-4 prisms transmit more light, producing brighter and sharper images, while BK-7 prisms suffer from light fall-off, resulting in somewhat dimmer images. If the kind of glass used is not stated on the bin- ocular housing itself (where the size, magnifi cation, and fi eld of view are printed), it’s easy to fi nd out. Hold the binocular against the daytime sky at arm’s length and look at the circles of light (exit pupils) fl oating behind the eyepieces. BaK-4 prisms produce perfectly round disks, while BK-7 prisms give diamond-shaped ones (squares with rounded corners) having grayish shadows around the edges. While discussing prism types, mention should also be made of optical coat- ings. Untreated glass normally refl ects 4% of the light falling on it at each surface. Applying antirefl ection coatings (typically magnesium fl uoride) to the objective lenses, eyepieces, and prisms can increase light transmission through the binocu- Prism Types and Optical Coatings Figure 2.2.

Anyone who has looked through a typical binocular knows at fi rst hand how diffi cult it is to hold it steady. Even when you are reclining on a lawnchair and supporting both arms, breathing is enough to make the image dance around. (And imagine attempting to use bin- oculars on a rocking boat at sea!). In these “I-S”glasses, roof prism assemblies are essentially fl oating in sealed oil-fi lled housings. Microprocessors located within each barrel detect any movement of the observer and send a correcting signal to the prism assemblies to compensate, keeping the image stationary. Available apertures are currently relatively small (10 × 30 mm to 18 × 50 mm) and quite costly, with prices beginning around $500 (that of a decent telescope!). Fujinon has also introduced an image-stabilized binocular into its extensive line of high-end glasses. Called the Techno-Stabi, this 14 × 40 glass is priced at over $1,000. Bushnell and Zeiss are among the companies also now offering image- stabilized binoculars. Image-Stabilized lar signifi cantly. Less expensive binoculars state that they have “coated optics,” which normally means that only the outer surfaces of the objective and eyepiece lenses are coated; their inner surfaces and the prism assemblies are not. You can easily check this by looking into the objective end of a binocular and catching the refl ection of a bright light or the daytime sky on the glass surfaces. Coated optics typically have a bluish-purple cast to them (this may appear pink if the coating is too thin, and green if too thick), while untreated surfaces will give off white refl ections. Quality binoculars specify that they have “fully coated optics,” meaning that all glass surfaces have antirefl ection coatings on them. The term “fully multicoated optics” will be found on premium glasses, indicating that several different coating layers have been applied on all glass surfaces to reduce light loss even further. Note that the refl ections seen looking into the front of these binoculars typically have a greenish cast to them, mimicking those seen in overly thick coatings as mentioned above. Binoculars are available in an amazing range of sizes. At the small end are mini binoculars – miniature roof prism glasses compact enough to fi t in your shirt pocket. Obviously, apertures here are quite limited (typically 25 mm or less in size); although they will show the Moon’s surface features, they are not at all suitable for viewing fainter celestial wonders. At the other extreme are giant binoculars , with apertures ranging all the way up to 150 mm (6-inch) in size! A giant is generally taken to mean any glass 60 mm or larger in aperture. Among the most common and popular of these are 80-mm binoculars, having magnifi ca- tions ranging from 11 × to 30 × .

There’s also the important issue of weight, which for an 80-mm binocular is typically 5 pounds or more. This makes giant glasses all but impossible to hold by hand, requiring them to be mounted on a sturdy tripod. Virtually all bino- culars – not just giants – have a provision for adapting them to a tripod mounting. There’s typically a cap, located at the objective-end of the central pivot support, covering a standard 1 − 4 -20 screw receptacle. This takes an L-shaped or “fi nger” clamp (available from most binocular suppliers) that attaches the binocular directly to the tripod head for support. Before purchasing any binocular, you should carefully check the manufacturer’s specifi cations to see if it is tripod- adaptable. In recent years, sophisticated cantilevered or “parallelogram-style” binocular mounts have also become commercially available, but these can cost as much as a giant glass itself. Binocular Telescopes Perhaps the ultimate in giant glasses are binocular telescopes . These hybrids are essentially two full-sized telescopes mounted in parallel side by side, with special transfer optics to bring their individual images close enough together to view with both eyes as for a conventional binocular.

This is the most important of all a telescope’s parameters; for the larger its light-collecting area, the brighter, sharper, and better-contrasted are the images it forms of celestial objects. The primary driving force behind the construction of ever-bigger profes- sional research telescopes (and also that behind the amazing “Dobsonian revolu- tion” sweeping the amateur astronomy community, discussed in Chapter 5) is the need for more light – for collecting ever more photons. (See the discussion on light-gathering power later in this chapter, and also that about the amazing “photon connection” in Chapter 14.) Commercially available telescopes in use by backyard astronomers today range from small 2- and 3-inch aperture refractors up to 36-inch behemoth refl ectors, with the most common sizes being in the 4- to 14-inch size range. Telescope Basics Aperture 17 Focal Length/Ratio The distance from a telescope’s objective lens or primary mirror to the point where the light it collects comes to a focus is known as its focal length . In amateur-class instruments, this is generally stated in inches (and sometimes millimeters for small glasses), but for large observatory telescopes it’s often given"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 18 Figure 3.1a & b.

The focal ratio (or f/ratio) is simply the focal length divided by the aper- ture (both being measured either in inches or in millimeters). Thus a 5-inch (or 125-mm) telescope with a focal length of 50 inches (or 1250 mm) has a focal ratio of f/10. Similarly, a 6-inch having an f/8 focal ratio has a focal length of 48 inches. Telescopes of f/5 or less are said to be fast while slow ones are those of f/10 or more. The signifi cance of this will be seen in the section below on magnifi cation and in Chapter 7 when discussing eyepiece fi elds of view. In general, the faster an optical system is, the more compact it will be and the wider coverage of the sky it provides. On the other hand, the tolerances of its optical surfaces must be signifi cantly higher than for a slow system to form an image of equal quality. Magnifying Power While a telescope actually has three different kinds of “powers,” that most com- monly recognized is its magnifying power ( × ). This is found by dividing the focal length of its objective or primary mirror by that of whatever eyepiece is being used (again, both in inches or millimeters). Thus a 6-inch f/8, having a focal length of 48 inches, when used with an eyepiece with a focal length of 1 inch yields 48 × . Similarly, a 5-inch f/10, having a focal length of 1250 mm, when used with a 25-mm eyepiece gives 50 × . Decreasing the focal length of the eyepiece used increases the magnifi cation (because, for example, 1250 mm divided by 10 mm = 125 × ). Telescopes with longer focal lengths/higher focal ratios yield correspond- ingly higher magnifi cations for a given eyepiece over shorter ones. Assuming good optics and a steady sky, the practical upper limit for magnifi cation is around 50 × per inch of aperture. On rare occasions when the atmosphere is especially tranquil, as much as 100 × per inch may be used on bright objects such as the Moon, planets, and double stars. But it is lower magnifi cations (7 × to 10 × per inch of aperture) that typically give the most pleasing results at the eyepiece, owing to their crisp images and wide, bright fi elds of view. (See the discussion on eye- piece fi elds in Chapter 7.) Figure 3.2. As a telescope’s magnifi cation is increased, the actual amount of the sky seen decreases (making low powers preferred for many types of observing). Shown here are three views of the Moon at low, medium, and high magnifi cations. As the image gets bigger, less and less of it can be fi tted within the eyepiece fi eld."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 20 The ability of a telescope to show fi ne detail in the image it forms is known as its resolving power . This is usually expressed as an angular value in seconds of arc (denoted by ′′ ). There are 60 of these arc-seconds in a minute of arc, and 60 minutes in a degree of sky. At its average distance, the Moon subtends an angle of about half a degree, or 1,800 seconds of arc. So an arc-second is truly a very small angle! There are a number of empirical and theoretical criteria used to express the resolving power of a telescope, the best known being Dawes’ Limit . (See the reso- lution table in Appendix 1, which gives corresponding values for three of these criteria.) This states that to fi nd out how close in arc-seconds two equally bright points of light (such as those of a matched double star) can be and still be seen as just separated, divide the number 4.56 by the aperture of the telescope in inches. Thus, a 3-inch glass has a resolution of about 1.5 ′′ and a 6-inch 0.76 ′′ . This means that the latter telescope can reveal detail twice as fi ne as can the former one. Note that, unlike light-gathering power, resolving power is a linear relation: doubling the size of the telescope doubles the resolution. Thus, in theory, the larger the telescope, the more detail that will be seen in the image it produces. However, a big limiting factor here is the state of the atmosphere through which we must look. Atmospheric turbulence (or seeing , as it’s known) makes it diffi cult to achieve resolutions much under 0.5 ′′ on even the best of nights and more typi- cally less than 1 ′′ in average seeing – no matter how large a telescope you are using. (Professional astronomers today routinely use adaptive optics to cancel Light-Gathering Power As mentioned above, the most important parameter of a telescope is its aperture or size. This determines its light-gathering power – or how bright images will look through it. It’s quite important to note here that when the size of a telescope is doubled, it doesn’t collect twice as much light but rather four times as much, since the area of the optical surface goes up as the square of the aperture. Thus, an 8- inch telescope has four times the light-collecting ability of a 4-inch. This means that much fainter objects can be seen through the larger glass than in the smaller one. A 2-inch, for example, will typically show 10 th -magnitude stars, while a 16-inch can reveal ones close to 15 th magnitude – a factor of 100 times fainter. (See the limiting-magnitude table given in Appendix 1.) Most stargazers start out with a small telescope; but knowing that bigger instruments show more, they often develop what is known as “aperture fever.” This is the insatiable desire to own ever-larger telescopes. A limit, of course, must be drawn somewhere. And there’s an old maxim that (with the exception of permanently mounted instru- ments) the smaller the telescope, the more often you will use it. Those of us who have owned more than one telescope can attest to the fact that this is indeed true! Resolving Power"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Telescope Basics 21 out the effects of poor seeing, but this highly advanced technology lies far beyond the capabilities and budget of typical backyard astronomers.) It’s interesting to note that one arc-second at the Moon’s average distance roughly equals one mile on its surface (its 2,160-mile diameter subtends 1,800 arc-seconds). Thus a 4-inch telescope can see craters and other features a mile or more in size (and considerably smaller if it’s a linear feature such as a rill or cleft). Those interested in learning more about telescope resolution should consult the author’s book Double and Multiple Stars and How to Observe Them (Springer, 2005). Mountings There are two basic types of mountings used to support telescopes. Simplest and lightest is the altazimuth mounting , which provides a very natural up-down (altitude) and around (azimuth) motion that’s easy to use when aiming a tele- scope at the sky. Heavier and more complex is the equatorial mounting , which has one of its axes inclined parallel with the Earth’s rotational axis. This makes it possible to compensate for the diurnal movement of celestial objects in the eyepiece by moving the telescope about this axis, either by hand or with a motor drive. Its extra weight over that of an altazimuth largely results from the need to counterbalance the mass of the telescope itself in order to drive it properly. In the common German equatorial mounting, this is done by adding heavy coun- terweights, while in the fork-style equatorial the telescope is positioned within the fork arms so as to balance itself. The latter form is the one that’s most often used on the compact catadioptric telescopes that are so popular today. In the past, compensating for the Earth’s rotation couldn’t be done using an altazimuth mount, which must be moved in two directions at the same time to achieve this result. However, with the advent of microprocessors, it has become possible to do this very effectively. Indeed, the famed 200-inch Hale refl ector at Palomar was the last of the giant professional telescopes to be mounted equatori- ally. All the world’s great research instruments today – including the huge Keck 400-inch binocular telescope in Hawaii – are computerized altazimuths, greatly reducing the size, weight, and cost of their mountings, as well as of the observa- tories housing them. The commercial telescope market has quickly followed suit, offering observers the option of light-weight computer-driven altazimuths in place of traditional equatorial mountings. Whichever type of mounting is selected for the telescope you purchase, you should perform what is known as the “rap or tap test” to check its stability. Simply place a celestial object in the eyepiece and then gently hit the top of the telescope tube with your open palm, noting how long it takes for the image to settle down. A good, stable mounting will dampen its vibrations within a second or two, while a poorly-made, unstable one (such as is commonly found on inexpensive imported refractors) may take 10 seconds or longer!

And the slow drifting of objects in the eyepiece – espe- cially faint ones such as nebulae and galaxies – causes their images to move across varying parts of the retina, often revealing subtle details that might otherwise be missed. Whatever size and type instrument you may be thinking of purchasing, remember that the best telescope for you is the one you will use the most often . From the standpoints of light-gathering ability, resolution, magnifi cation, atmo- spheric turbulence, optical cool-down time, portability, and cost, I believe that a telescope somewhere in the 4- to 8-inch aperture range is perhaps optimum for general stargazing purposes. Many observers wisely opt for having a small por- table instrument (often their initial purchase) combined with a much larger but less portable one, giving them the best of both worlds. In this case, a rich-fi eld telescope (or RFT) such as those discussed in Chapters 4 and 5 is a good choice for the former. Finally, readers looking for a comprehensive all-purpose reference on tele- scopes and their accessories should consult Philip Harrington’s monumental work, Star Ware (John Wiley, 2002). The historical aspects of the telescopes covered in the current book have of necessity been kept to a minimum, but it certainly adds to the enjoyment of using them to know something about their fascinating history. Perhaps the ultimate authority here is Henry King’s classic The History of the Telescope , reissued by Dover Publications in 2003.

Initial versions used a single objective lens to collect and focus the image and a simple eyepiece to magnify it. Single lenses by their very nature have a number of optical shortcom- ings, chief among these being chromatic (or color) aberration . This results in light of different colors coming to focus at different points, producing image- degrading prismatic haloes appearing around the Moon, planets, and brighter stars. Another serious problem is that of spherical aberration – the inability of a single lens to bring all light rays to the same focus. However, as focal length increases, these aberrations tend to decrease. Attempting to take advantage of this, telescopes became ever longer, reaching unwieldy lengths of up to more than 200 feet in one case! (Galileo made his historic discoveries using small, primitive refractors. And while he did not invent the telescope itself, he’s credited with being the fi rst person to apply it to celestial observation – and to publish what he saw.) It was eventually discovered that color aberrations could be considerably mini- mized by combining two different kinds of glass in the objective, leading to the independent invention of the achromatic refractor by Chester Hall and John Dolland. This form is still in wide use to this very day; all the refractors in the world’s major observatories (the largest being the 40-inch Clark at Yerkes Obser- vatory) and most of the instruments in amateur hands are ba sic achromats. Most common in the latter category is the famed “two point four” or 2.4-inch (60-mm) refractor, with which so many stargazers over the years have begun their celestial explorations.

Even those with good optics often have subdiameter-size eyepieces of poor quality, along with useless fi nders and shaky mountings. But there are exceptions; the optically and mechanically superb Unitron refractors mentioned in Chapter 1 were and still are made in Japan. If the reader contemplating a fi rst telescope can fi nd a good 2.4-inch or 3-inch Unitron, it can’t be beaten for “quick and ready” stargazing at a minimal investment. Among others, Celestron, Edmund, Meade, and Orion offer entry-level 60-mm to 90-mm refractors in the $100 to $300 price range. And fortunately, most companies have at long last switched from the Japanese subdiameter eyepiece size typically found on these imported scopes to the larger and optically superior American standard size (see the section on eyepieces in Chapter 7). Premium-grade achromatic refractors in 4- to 7-inch apertures are offered by Apogee, Borg, D&G, Goto, Helios, Konus, Meade, Murnaghan, Orion, Pacifi c Telescope, Stellarvue, Unitron, Vixen, Zeiss, and others, with prices ranging from around $500 to more than $2,000. As is well known, refractors offer the highest resolution (sharpest image) and contrast per unit aperture of all the various types of telescopes. This is because light has an unobstructed path through the system (i.e., there is no image- degrading secondary mirror in the way, as is the case with refl ecting and com- pound systems). They also have very stable images, owing to their closed tube design (eliminating thermal currents within the light path) and rapid cool-down times resulting from their relatively thin objective-lens elements. This has long made them the ins trument of choice for high-defi nition study of the Sun, Moon, planets, and close double stars. It should be mentioned here that, whatever level of refractor you eventually select, be sure that it has internal glare stops . These are concentric fl at black rings with a graded series of openings in them, with the largest ones near the front end of the tube and progressively smaller ones toward the eyepiece end as they match the converging cone of light formed by the objective. Their purpose is to elimi- nate stray light from entering the telescope and reaching the eyepiece. Entry-level refractors generally have two or three glare stops, while premium ones may have fi ve or more. You can check this for yourself by looking into the telescope from the objective end, tilting the tube slightly so you can see down the optical path. Figure 4.1. The optical confi guration and light-path of the classical achromatic refracting telescope, which employs a double-lens objective.

There are also a number of semi-apochromatic doublets on the market; these hybrids make use of highly sophisticated rare-earth glasses and optical designs to achieve three-element performance. And while traditional achromats operate at focal ratios around f/11 to f/15 or more in order to control aberrations (making them rather unwieldy in large sizes), apochromats typically work at f/4 to f/6 (and some up to f/9). This results in very compact and highly portable systems. But this superior optical performance and portability come at a hefty price; apochromatic refractors typi- cally begin at around $500 for optical-tube assemblies alone and run into many thousands of dollars for a complete 4- to 7-inch telescope.

Rich-Field Te c h n ic a l l y, a rich-fi eld telescope (or RFT, as it’s referred to) is one that gives the widest possible view of the heavens for its aperture. This occurs at a magnifi cation of about 4 × per inch of aperture (so 16 × for a 4-inch scope). Because of the rela- tively long focal lengths of typical non-RFTs, their maximum fi elds of view are only a degree or so in extent (or two full-Moon diameters of sky) – even when used at their lowest possible powers. But RFTs, with their short focal ratios of typically f/4 to f/5, can easily reach a low magnifi cation, resulting in fi elds a whopping 3 to 4 degrees across. Sweeping the heavens – particularly the massed starclouds of the Milky Way – with one of these gems is truly an exhilarating experience! RFTs are also wonderful for viewing conjunctions of the planets, big naked-eye star clusters such as the Pleiades (M45), and eclipses of the Moon and (w it h proper fi lters!) the Sun. They provide truly amazing low-power views of the Moon itself – especially when it’s passing in front of (or occulting) objects behind it, at which times it seems suspended three-dimensionally in space. Short-focus achromatic refractors are available in apertures ranging from 3 to 6 inches from Apogee, Borg, Celestron, Helios, Konus, Meade, Orion (an espe- cially popular RFT being its little ShortTube 80-mm f/5, priced at $200 without mounting), Pacifi c Telescope, Stellarvue, and Vixen among others, at prices up to more than $2,000. Many of the shorter aprochromatic refractors offered by several of these same companies, as well as those by Astro-Physics, Takahashi, TBM, Tele Vue, and Williams, also make superb rich-fi eld telescopes – but at prices ranging from under $2,000 to well over $4,000. As with the ShortTube, many RFTs come without a mounting. The achromats are typically lightweight, and at least in the smaller sizes can be supported on a camera tripod, while the apochromats are usually much heavier and require an actual telescope mount.

In 1870, Samuel Pierpont Langley saw and drew detail in sunspots so fi ne that it could never be confi rmed until balloon-borne telescopes fl ying in the stratosphere photographed it nearly a century later!) Unfortunately, these views come with several disadvantages. Long focal lengths and high magnifi cations bring with them correspondingly limited fi elds of view – normally much less than a degree, even using wide-angle eyepieces. More of an issue is that these long instruments can become quite unwieldy, requiring very sturdy mountings (and larger structures, if being housed in some type of Figure 4.5.

Also, with the trend today towards shorter and more portable refractors, sources for such telescopes are relatively limited. A traditional one is Unitron, which offers a 4-inch f/15 achromatic refractor at prices beginning well over $1,000. Another is D&G Optical, which makes 5-inch to 10-inch f/15 scopes on order, with prices running into many thousands of dollars for the larger sizes. Yet-longer focal ratios (ideal for high-resolution lunar, planetary, and double- star observing) must be custom-made, typically at a much higher cost than for a production-line instrument. One solution to the great tube lengths of such refrac- tors is to compress the optical system into only a half or even a third of its origi- nal size. This is done by slightly tilting the objective and using one or more optically fl at mirrors to fold the light path. While many amateur telescope makers have constructed folded long-focus refractors, to date there have been no com- mercial versions – or at least ones that have remained on the market for very long! (The ultra-long-focus 24-inch planetary refractor of France’s famed Pic du Midi Observatory is an outstanding professional example of folding a telescope’s light path.) It should be mentioned here that, with the use of a 2 × or 3 × Barlow lens (essen- tially doubling or tripling the existing focal length – see Chapter 7), a telescope of normal or even short focal ratio can be converted into a much longer one. However, I have never found the image quality to be quite the same as in a true long-focus instrument (owing to a number of subtle optical factors). Solar While almost any telescope – but particularly a refractor – can be used for viewing the Sun once equipped with a safe, full- or partial-aperture solar fi lter placed over its objective ( never over its eyepiece! ), there is a type of refractor especially made for solar observation. Not only do these instruments properly fi lter the Sun, but they also have built-in narrow-bandpass fi lters tuned to the hydrogen-alpha wavelength. This makes it possible to look into the deeper levels of the Sun’s churning atmosphere and also to see graceful prominences dancing in real time off its limb. The premier source here is Coronado, which a few years ago introduced to much acclaim its PST (Personal Solar Telescope) line with apertures ranging from 40 mm to 140 mm in size. These superb instruments provide views of our nearest star that are nothing short of amazing. Prices for the 40 mm begin at about $500. A calcium-light model is now available too. (Coronado also offers its BinoMite 10 × 25 and 12 × 60 fi ltered binoculars for viewing the Sun in ordinary white light using both eyes.)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE The severe color aberrations of the early single-lens refractors soon led to the invention of the Newtonian refl ector by Sir Isaac Newton. This form uses a concave parabolic (or spherical) primary mirror to collect light and bring it to a focus. Since the light never passes through the glass mirror but only bounces off its refl ecting surface, the image has no spurious color. The converging light-cone refl ected from the primary mirror at the bottom of the telescope tube is turned 90 degrees by a small optical fl at (or diagonal mirror) before it exits the top and is refl ected through the side, where it comes to a focus. All the world’s great obser- vatory telescopes today are refl ectors of one form or another, including the legend- ary 200-inch Hale refl ector at Palomar and the twin Keck 400-inch refl ectors in Hawaii (and the famed Hubble Space Telescope). This is partly because their huge mirrors can be supported from behind (instead of around the edge, as with refrac- tors). It’s also due to the fact that the glass itself does not need to be of “optical” quality, since the light merely refl ects off its polished and coated surface rather than passing through the glass itself (again, as is the case with refractors). While refl ectors don’t suffer from color aberration, they do have a malady known as coma – a comet-like fl aring of images that is more noticeable further from the center of the fi eld of view. Focal ratios for Newtonians range from f/4 (and as low as f/1 for some professional instruments, to keep them as short as possible) to f/8 or even f/10 in amateur scopes. The shorter the focal ratio, the worse the coma. In the longer lengths, it’s hardly noticeable over a typical 1-degree eyepiece fi eld. Also, because of another optical defect known as spherical aberration (d is- cussed in Chapter 4 in connection with early refractors), the steeply curving surface of a short-focus primary mirror has to be parabolic in order to bring all Refl ecting Te l e s c op e s Newtonian 35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 36 the refl ected light rays to the same focus. But as focal length increases and the curvature of the mirror become fl atter, the difference between a paraboloid and a sphere is less distinguishable. Thus, at some point, the mirror may then be left spherical (a much easier optical surface to make) but give an optical performance essentially identical to a parabolic one. It’s often stated as a general rule that the focal ratio should be f/10 for this to happen. But the actual value depends on – and increases with – aperture, optical theory requiring less than f/8 for a 4.5-inch, around f/9 for an 8-inch, and just under f/10 itself for a 10-inch. There’s often much discussion about the surface accuracy of telescope mirrors. To satisfy the well-known Rayleigh Criterion for diffraction-limited performance (the point at which image quality is limited by the wave nature of light itself rather than by optical quality), the wavefront errors must be 1 − 4 of a wavelength of light or less. Since light fi rst enters and then leaves a mirror’s surface, surface errors are compounded – meaning that the optics themselves must be fi gured to at least 1 − 8 -wavelength to achieve 1 − 4 -wavelength at focus. (Wavelength accuracy in refractors is rarely mentioned. While in an achromat there are four surfaces – the front and back of each element – and six in a typical apochromat, the light trans- verses each surface only once. Surface errors averaged over the various elements tend to cancel each other out rather than being compounded. As a result, a lens with surfaces fi gured to 1 − 4 -wavelength will still meet the Rayleigh Criterion for total allowable wavefront error.) Entry-level refl ectors are available from a number of manufacturers in 3-, 4-, and 4.5-inch apertures at prices in the $100 to $300 range. Among these are Bushnell, Celestron, Konos, Orion, and Pacifi c Telescope. Some have parabolic primaries and others spherical ones, in both cases providing acceptable views of the Moon, planets, and brighter deep-sky objects. Unfortunately, they often have less than ideal mountings, which can be quite frustrating to the beginner. As with refractors, a simple, lightweight altazimuth is preferred over a heavier and often clumsy equatorial for casual stargazing. One noteworthy beginner’s refl ector that has received great reviews in the astronomy magazines is Orion’s StarBlast 4.5-inch, which currently sells for around $175. It has an easy-to-use tabletop Figure 5.1. The optical confi guration and light-path of the classical Newtonian refl ecting telescope.

Three very affordable beginner’s-level refl ectors from the 1950s and 1960s need special mention here. Despite the fact that they are no longer being made, they gave many stargazers their very fi rst views of the heavens, and are still occasionally to be found on the used market today.

Home-made versions typically use simple materials such as plywood for the stand and Tefl on strips for the bearings, as well as heavy card- board tubing for the telescope itself. But there’s more to Dobson’s brainchild than this. He pioneered the use of very thin mirrors – typically only an inch or two thick and made of plate glass (he originally used ship portholes!) – to make refl ectors with very large apertures ranging all the way up to 24 inches. This is a size unheard of in amateur hands until Dobson appeared on the scene. Another distinguishing feature of Dobsonians is their short focal ratios – typically f/4 to f/5, making them very compact for their huge apertures. (Technically, this also qualifi es them as rich-fi eld telescopes or RFTs, as discussed below.) Dobsonian refl ectors are now widely available commercially in sizes from as small as 4 inches all the way up to 36 inches!

Entry level “Dobs” are avail- able from many sources, including Bushnell, Celestron, Hardin, and Orion, in apertures up to 12 inches and with prices starting for under $300 for a 6-inch.

Moreover, their low powers are still enough to see the Moon’s surface features, the four bright Galilean satellites of Jupiter, and other Solar System wonders such as comets. Cassegrain Very soon after the refl ecting telescope was invented by Newton, Guillaume Cassegrain introduced a modifi cation now called the Cassegrain refl ector . Instead of a fl at diagonal mirror refl ecting the light to the side of the tube, this arrange- ment substitutes a convex secondary that directs the converging light-cone back down the tube through a hole in the parabolic primary, where it comes to focus. But the light is not just folded upon itself – the secondary’s hyperbolic shape changes the angle of the converging beam as if it were coming from much further away. This increases the effective focal ratio of the primary by as much as a factor of fi ve, resulting in an instrument with very long focal length but compressed into a very short tube. This results in high magnifi cations for viewing (or imaging) the Moon and planets, and for other applications where a large image-scale is desired. As with refractors, Cassegrains must be carefully light-baffl ed in order to prevent the fi eld of view from being fl ooded with light. The glare-stops here are actually carefully machined and fi tted fl at-black tubing, mounted in front of both the secondary mirror and the central hole in the primary mirror. Having used classical Cassegrains ranging from 6 to 30 inches in aperture, I have never been impressed with their image quality. Not only do they have limited fi elds of view because of their long effective focal lengths combined with strong fi eld curvature, but the images themselves often seem to have a “softness” about them – certainly not like the crisp, sharp, well-contrasted images of a refractor or a Newtonian refl ector. Many of the optical companies that traditionally offered Cassegrain refl ectors commercially to the amateur astronomy market have switched instead to the Ritchey–Chrétien form discussed below. Among the exceptions are Parks, which makes these systems in apertures of 6 to 12.5 inches with prices ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, and Vixen with an 8-inch for under $2,000. Optical Guidance, which is best-known for its Ritchey–Chrétien systems, offers a line of research- grade classical Cassegrains ranging from 10 to 32 inches in aperture with prices beginning around $8,000. Another source is Parallax, which offers a 10-inch at under $5,000, and 12.5-inch and 16-inch models with prices in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. In a bid to have the best of both worlds, a few manufacturers offer a combined Newtonian–Cassegrain system. An interchangeable or fl ip secondary mirror typically provides f/4 or f/5 wide-fi eld, low-power performance in the Newtonian mode and high-power viewing at f/10 to f/15 or more in the Cassegrain form. These dual instruments tend to be quite pricey, since you’re essentially getting two telescopes in one. An example is Takahashi’s CN-212 (for Cassegrain– Newtonian), which is an 8.3-inch (21-mm) f/12 Cassegrain with a replaceable secondary mirror that converts it into an f/4 Newtonian, and which goes for"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Refl ecting Telescopes 43 over $10,000. Another manufacturer is Parks Optical, which offers f/3.5–f/15 Newtonian–Cassegrains in apertures ranging from 6 to 16 inches at prices from $2,000 to over $16,000. Again, in all cases in which I have used such hybrid in - struments, the views at the Newtonian focus were far superior in terms of image sharpness and fi eld of view to the views at the Cassegrain one. As an aside here, you may wonder why I didn’t mention glare-stops and light- baffl ing when discussing Newtonian refl ectors. This is because in a Newtonian the observer is looking into the darkened tube wall across the optical axis rather than along it, as with refractors and Cassegrains. In other words, you are not looking skyward – which is where stray light enters the telescope. However, there’s an important point to be borne in mind in this regard when using a Newtonian. As you look into the eyepiece, you are also looking peripherally at the outer surface of the telescope tube as well, which typically has a glossy-white fi nish. Unfortunately, this makes it an excellent refl ector of stray light from around the telescope, thereby reducing the dark adaptation of the eye (see Chapter 10). A fl at-black screen made of poster board or other material placed around the focuser/eyepiece area is one solution. Another is to use a photographer’s cloth to cover the head and the viewing end of the telescope. Actually, the best color for a telescope tube is red (or no color, i.e. black), which preserves the eye’s dark adaptation just as reading star charts with a red light does. (I was a consultant in the development and marketing of Edmund’s Astroscan, often referred to as the “red bowling ball.” It has an all-red exterior for just this very reason!) Ritchey–Chrétien In an effort to improve the imaging quality of the classical Cassegrain refl ector for photographic work, George Ritchey and Henri Chrétien jointly developed a marvelous new system in the early 1900s known as the Ritchey–Chrétien . Typi- cally operating at effective focal ratios of f/8 or f/9, its hyperbolic primary and secondary mirrors give it both a larger and a fl atter fi eld than that of an ordinary Cassegrain, with total freedom from coma. And while it was originally developed for photographic (and more recently CCD) imaging, modernized versions allows for excellent visual observing as well. Initially used by only a few select profes- sional observatories, it has since become the system of choice for all major research telescopes built over the past several decades – including the giant twin 400-inch refl ectors at the Keck Observatory (currently the world’s largest optical telescopes) and the Hubble Space Telescope itself. Among the fi rst to offer Ritchey–Chrétien refl ectors commercially for the serious amateur astronomer and small-observatory market was Optical Guid- ance, with apertures from 10 to 32 inches, as for its classical Cassegrains. Focal ratios are around f/8 to f/9 and prices range from $10,000 to over $20,000. Its chief competitor is RC Optical, whose line runs from 10 to 20 inches in size in focal ratios of f/8 to f/10, with costs in the same range as those of Optical Guid- ance. Its popular 12.5-inch f/9, for example, sells for around $14,000. At the time of writing, Meade had just introduced its line of “optically-enhanced” f/8"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 44 Ritchey–Chrétien telescopes in apertures from 10 to 16 inches and prices ranging from $6,000 to over $16,000.* These premium telescopes are defi nitely for the affl uent stargazer desiring an observatory-class instrument! Many of the most spectacular photographic and CCD images gracing the pages of the various astronomy magazines such as Sky & Telescope over the past several years – some of which rival those taken with large research telescopes – were taken by amateur astronomers using Ritchey–Chrétien systems. And visually, image quality is noticeably improved over that of a classical Cassegrain. Dall–Kirkham Another variation on the classical Cassegrain refl ector is the Dall–Kirkham, invented by the optician Horace Dall in 1928 and subsequently promoted by the amateur astronomer Allan Kirkham. This form uses an elliptical primary and a spherical secondary mirror, which are easier to fi gure than those in a standard Cassegrain, thus accounting for its popularity among amateur telescope makers. Its long effective focal ratios (typically f/12 or more) are great for lunar and plan- etary observing, but the system suffers from coma and noticeable curvature of fi eld. Dall–Kirkhams are not widely available on the commercial telescope market, but one source is Takahashi. Its Mewlon series offers 7-inch, 8-inch, and 10-inch models at hefty prices running between $5,000 and $10,000. Modifi ed Cassegrain Several variations on the Cassegrain arrangement have appeared over the years. One is the coudé system, widely used by professional observatories in conjunction with both Cassegrain and Ritchey–Chrétien refl ectors. Here, a small fl at tertiary (third) mirror located above the primary intercepts the converging light-cone from the convex secondary and directs it down the telescope’s polar axis. This makes it possible to keep the focal position fi xed no matter where the scope is pointed in the sky, and to feed the light into spectrographs and other instrumen- tation too large and heavy to be supported by the telescope itself. Also, extremely long effective focal lengths (ratios of f/30 or more) can be achieved while keeping the size of the telescope itself manageable. Another variation is the modifi ed Cassegrain form itself. Here, the third fl at mirror directs the light out to the side of the tube near the bottom (with a fork mounting, this is usually located right above the balance point where the tube joins the axes). Both the coudé and modifi ed Cassegrain modes eliminate the need to perforate the primary unless desired. This is the system used on the famed 100-inch Hooker refl ector at Mt Wilson Observatory, which has no central opening in its huge mirror. By positioning the tertiary mirror in a fork-mounted telescope so that it sends light through and just outside one of the axes them- selves, it’s possible to keep the eyepiece at a fi xed elevation no matter where the instrument is pointed. Invented by James Nasmyth for use on his altazimuth-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Refl ecting Telescopes 45 mounted, speculum-metal-mirrored, 20-inch Newtonian-Cassegrain, this form is referred to as the Nasmyth focus . It’s being extensively used today on many huge altazimuth, fork-mounted observatory telescopes, including the two 400- inch Kecks, where light is fed into heavy instrumentation located just outs ide the fork arms. While a number of amateur telescope makers have built such systems in order to have a telescope at which they can remain seated comfortably while observing, currently no commercial coudé or modifi ed Cassegrain telescopes are available other than custom-made ones. The modifi ed Cassegrain form has been employed on catadioptric telescopes (see Chapter 6) as well as on refl ectors. Fecker’s superb 6-inch f/15 Celestar Maksutov–Cassegrain from the late 1950s was one such instrument, which sold for around $500. Off-Axis All early refl ectors used mirrors made of speculum metal rather than having refl ective coatings on glass, which came much later. In order to reduce light loss from the diagonal mirror in his refl ectors, Sir William Herschel tilted their primary mirrors to direct the focus off to the side of the optical path at the top of the tube, where the eyepiece was positioned. This form of unobstructed or off-axis refl ector is known as the Herschelian . Several other designs using tilted primaries and additional fl at mirrors to bring the light to a focus without having a secondary in the way have been devised by modern-day amateur telescope makers, one of the more unusual-looking of them being the so-called Schiefspie- gler . All off-axis instruments must of necessity have long focal ratios (typically at least f/10) in order to tilt their primary mirrors suffi ciently for this purpose. In 2004, Orion introduced a 3.6-inch, f/13.6, modifi ed version of the Hersche- lian. Instead of having an image that is viewed directly with an eyepiece at the top of the tube, as Sir William did (here quite impractical because of the small aperture), a fl at mirror outside the incoming optical path refl ects the light across the tube and outside it to a standard focuser. The complete telescope goes for about $1,000 and the optical-tube assembly by itself is available for under $700. Another source is DGM, which offers models ranging from 4- to 9-inch in aper- ture, with focal ratios averaging around f/10. Their optical arrangement is similar to Orion’s, but with the secondary mirror mounted off-axis right under the focuser itself rather than across the tube from it. Prices here range from below $1,000 to over $3,000. Off-axis, unobstructed telescopes offer observers refractor- like performance with the color fi delity of a refl ector – but at a signifi cantly higher cost than for a basic Newtonian of similar aperture. * Since the optical enhancement is achieved using a full-aperture corrector plate, technically these systems can be considered catadioptrics."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX While the inventions of the refractor and refl ector occurred within a scant 60 years of each other, no new form of astronomical telescope appeared on the scene for nearly another three centuries. The idea then dawned on telescope designers of combining the attributes of both the refractor and the refl ector into a single system, which became known as the catadioptric (or compound) telescope . In 1930 Bernhard Schmidt used a thin, aspheric corrector plate on a fast Newtonian refl ector to fl atten and sharpen the fi eld for wide-angle photography, giving birth to the Schmidt camera. A decade later, Dimitri Maksutov combined a thick meniscus lens with a Cassegrain refl ector to greatly improve both its visual and its photographic performance, resulting in the Maksutov–Cassegrain . In this system, light entering through the meniscus lens is corrected for the inherent errors resulting from the steep spherical primary mirror. The converg- ing light cone from the primary is then refl ected up the tube to a secondary mirror mounted to the back side of the meniscus. In a modifi cation of t his scheme known as the Gregory–Maksutov and invented by John Gregory in 1957, the sec- ondary mirror is actually an aluminized central spot on the back surface of the meniscus itself. Many instruments marketed today as Maksutov–Cassegrains actually use this system and are, therefore, technically Gregory–Maksutovs. Introduced by Lawrence Braymer in 1954 after more than a decade of develop- ment and testing, the Questar 3.5-inch f/14 Maksutov–Cassegrain became the world’s fi rst commercially available catadioptric telescope.

Originally priced at about $900, the basic 3.5-inch Questar today goes for over $4,000, making it a telescope mainly for the affl uent stargazer and collector. (It can also be found from time to time on the used market for about half this amount.) A 7-inch version and a 12-inch custom-made observatory model are also available at signifi cantly higher prices. In the 1990s, Meade introduced what is essentially an affordable version of the Questar with its ETX-90 3.5-inch f/13.8 Maksutov–Cassegrain for around $500! This was soon followed by 4-inch f/14 and 5-inch f/15 models. A 7-inch f/15 was eventually added to the line in their LX200 series. The three smaller scopes are all priced under $1,000, while the 7-inch goes for around $3,000. Such economy of pricing for what had traditionally been very costly instruments is a result of Meade’s pioneering mass-production of precision-quality optics.

Among other companies offering these highly popular compact instruments (in apertures all the way up to 16 inches and with prices in excess of $4,000) are Astro-Physics, Orion UK, TEC (Telescope Engineering Company), LOMO (Lenigrad Optical and Mechanical Enterprise), Intes, and Intes Micro. The last three are Russian manufacturers, which seems most appropriate since the Maksutov was originally invented there! Schmidt–Cassegrain The most popular and best-known catadioptric system is the Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope (or SCT, as it’s often referred to). It combines a thin, aspheric Schmidt corrector plate to compensate for the aberrations of a fast, spherical primary mirror in a Cassegrain-style instrument, with the secondary mirror mounted on the back side of the plate itself. Celestron’s founder Tom Johnson introduced the fi rst commercial version to the market in 1970. This was the Classic C8 fork- mounted 8-inch f/10 on a sturdy but lightweight fi eld tripod, which eventually replaced the 2.4-inch (60-mm) refractor as the best-selling type of telescope in the world. (There were earlier versions of the Celestron SCT in 10-inch and 16- inch apertures, but these were soon replaced by the C8. They are occasionally still found offered on the used-telescope market today.) Besides the C8 itself, 5-inch, 9.25-inch, 11-inch, and 14-inch apertures (known as the C5, C9.25, C11, and C14, respectively) were added to the line. (Celestron also made a limited number of 22-inch SCTs for private observatories. The author once spent several nights at a mountaintop observatory stargazing with one of these gems – the views of deep-sky objects through it were nothing short of astounding!) A variety of unique computer-driven, altazimuth, single-arm fork and traditional German equatorial mountings are offered, from basic Go-To systems known as “NexStar” to state-of-the-art GPS systems. Prices today begin under $1,000 for the basic 5-inch, while the 8-inch computerized NexStar goes for around $1,400. The advanced 8-inch GPS model is priced at $2,000 and the 11-inch at under $3,000. Prices for both the 11-inch and 14-inch SCTs mounted on hefty German equatorials begin at well over $3,000, with the top-of-the-line C14 going for nearly $6,000. In 1980, Meade introduced its own extensive line of Schmidt–Cassegrain tele- scopes, beginning with an 8-inch and eventually followed by 10-, 12-, 14-, and 16-inch models. As with Celestron, these LX200-series instruments are offered with Go-To and GPS capability on computer-driven altazimuth fork mounts. Their Autostar system was actually the very fi rst computerized Go-To system for commercial telescopes. Prices run around $2,300 for the 8-inch, $2,900 for the 10-inch, $3,800 for the 12-inch, and $5,300 for the 14-inch. The 16-inch observa- tory model is offered on either an altazimuth or a German equatorial fork mount and starts at over $15,000. Following on the immense popularity of Celestron’s 8-inch SCT, Criterion introduced its own 8-inch version called the Dynamax, at a lower price than the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 52 C8. Bausch and Lomb/Bushnell continued producing this instrument, along with 4- and 6-inch models, when they took over Criterion. Unfortunately, the Dynamax series never gave quite the optical and mechanical performance levels achieved by Celestron (and later Meade) and it was eventually discontinued. These scopes are still to be found today on the used-telescope market, typically at prices far below used Celestron and Meade SCTs. An excellent reference for those consider- ing the purchase of any SCT is Choosing and Using a Schmidt–Cassegrain Tele- scope by Rod Mollise (Springer, 2004). Figure 6.5.

A Schmidt corrector plate is located at the top of the tube, providing essentially round images right to the edge of the eyepiece fi eld. This plate also seals the telescope tube against dust and thermal currents, and eliminates the need for a secondary mirror support, the mirror being attached to the back side of the corrector itself. These fast systems (f/4 to f/5) give wide, nearly coma-free fi elds for both visual observing and astroimaging, with prices around $700 for the 6-inch and $1,000 for the 10-inch. A few Newtonians that have also appeared on the market over the years employ an optical window to seal the tube and support the secondary, but these have fl at (plane-parallel) sur- faces and do not provide the optical correction of a Schmidt plate. With the exception of Edmund’s Astroscan rich-fi eld telescope (discussed in Chapter 5), there is currently no refl ector with an optical window commercially available. Schmidt–Newtonian Maksutov–Newtonian This form of Maksutov combines a steeply curved meniscus, instead of a Schmidt corrector plate, with a fast (typically f/4 to f/6) Newtonian refl ector to give superb image quality across a wide fi eld. And unlike the Schmidt–Newtonian, these instruments can also prov ide detailed views of the Moon and planets. While not nearly as well known as a standard Maksutov–Cassegrain, this form of catadiop- tric is offered by several companies – three of them from Russia. One of these is LOMO, whose line runs from a 4-inch f/4.5 to an 8-inch f/4.6, with prices ranging from $1,000 to nearly $4,000. Another is Intes, which offers a 6-inch f/6 and a 7- inch f/6 at prices of over $1,000 and more than $2,000, respectively. Intes Micro has a 5-inch f/6 for under $1,000 and a 6-inch f/6 for less than $2,000. Larger models are available in 8-, 10-, 12-, and 16-inch apertures, with prices for the larger sizes running well in excess of $4,000. A fourth, domestic, source of Maksu- tov–Newtonians is TEC, which offers a 7-inch f/6 and an 8-inch f/3.5 in the $2,000 to $4,000 price range. (In the 1980s, the Canadian fi rm Ceravolo Optics briefl y offered a superb, essentially custom-made, 8.5-inch Maksutov–Newtonian, but did not stay in business for long. These fi ne instruments had exquisite optics and are much sought after today by observers and collectors.) Note that many of the prices quoted here are for optical-tube assemblies (OTAs) only , with the mountings themselves costing extra. You may opt to purchase just the OTA and place it on an existing mount – or perhaps make one, or buy one from another source at a more affordable price (particularly in the case of the three overseas manufacturers).

It also happens to be the element in the optical train that is most often overlooked as the source of good or bad performance of the overall system. An eyepiece can literally make or break even the best of telescopes. Small imported refractors from the Far East are espe- cially notorious for having poor-quality oculars. And since a telescope would not be able to function without an eyepiece (at least for visual observing), an eyepiece can really be considered a necessity, rather than an accessory as listed here. There’s a multitude of eyepi eces on the market today, ranging from inexpen- sive, basic two-element oculars to sophisticated multi-element designs contain- ing seven or eight individual lenses and costing as much as do some telescopes themselves! A good eyepiece should be well-corrected for chromatic and other aberrations, have as wide and fl at (curvature-free) a fi eld as possible, and provide good eye relief. It is especially important that all glass surfaces have antirefl ective coatings to reduce internal refl ections. (Some lower-grade eyepieces have so many “ghost” images that they are said to be “haunted”!) In premium eyepieces, the edges of all lens elements are ground and coated fl at black in order to elimi- nate any possible scattering of light. And fi nally, rubber eyeguards to help posi- tion the eye at the correct distance from the eyepiece and also keep out stray light are supplied on most oculars today; if not, they are available separately from many dealers for a variety of ocular sizes, types, and styles.

The 0.965-inch subdiameter size (sometimes referred to as the Japanese size ) ocular is often Accessories Eyepieces 55"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 56 found on inexpensive telescopes – especially the ubiquitous 2.4-inch (60-mm) refractor sold everywhere, imported from Japan and other countries in the Far East. They typically have very limited fi elds of view, poor eye relief, and inferior optical quality. The 1.25-inch American standard size is the one most widely used on telescopes, including on many imported scopes in recent years. The larger barrel diameter allows for big multi-element lenses that provide excellent eye relief, roomy fi elds of view, and good optical corrections. And fi nally, there’s the huge giant size 2.0-inch-diameter barrel employed for some of today’s most sophisticated, ultra-wide-angle eyepiece designs. They are so big and contain so much glass that they are sometimes referred to as “glass grenades”. They also cost as much as do some telescopes! Of the many types of eyepiece that have been developed over the years, the Kellner and the Erfl e are two of the most common traditionally used by observers. Among the more popular forms today are the orthoscopic and the Plössl , which not only provide good optical performance and relatively wide fi elds of view, but are also very reasonably priced. And of the many modern, ultra-wide-fi eld designs now available to stargazers, the Nagler series leads the pack with their incredible “space-walk” views (offering up to a whopping 82 degrees of apparent fi eld – see below) and exquisite state-of-the-art optical corrections. Figure 7.1. A fi ne example of a comprehensive set of quality 1.25” eyepieces – in this case, Orion’s Sirius Plössl collection, having focal lengths ranging from 40 mm to 6.3 mm. For all practical purposes, three eyepieces (providing low, medium, and high magnifi cations) will suffi ce for most viewing applications (at least initially!). Courtesy of Orion Telescopes & Binoculars."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Accessories 57 Two basic parameters describe the fi eld of view of an eyepiece. One is its appar- ent fi eld – the angular extent in degrees seen when looking through it at a bright surface such as the daytime sky. This can range from as little as 40 degrees up to as much as the 82 degrees mentioned above, depending on type, design, and brand. Most eyepieces in use today typically have pleasing apparent fi elds of 50 to 55 degrees. The other parameter is its actual fi eld – the amount of sky it encom- passes when used on a given telescope. It’s quite easy to fi nd what this is: simply divide the apparent fi eld (which is a stated design value for the eyepiece type being used) by the magnifi cation it produces (see below). Thus, an eyepiece having an apparent fi eld of 50 degrees and magnifying 50 times (or 50 × ) on a particular telescope results in an actual fi eld of 1 degree (or two full-Moon diam- eters in extent). At 100 × , the fi eld becomes 1 − 2 degree, and at 200 × it shrinks to only 1 − 4 degree. Thus, the higher the power, the smaller the amount of sky a given eyepiece will show . It should be mentioned here that 1 degree (1°) equals 60 minutes (60 ′ ) of arc and that 1 ′ contains 60 seconds (60 ′′ ) of arc. The Moon at its average dis- tance has an apparent angular size in the sky of 1 − 2 degree or 30 ′ , providing a con- venient yardstick for judging eyepiece fi elds of view. Determining the magnifi cation an eyepiece gives on a telescope is equally straightforward. The power ( × ) is found by simply dividing the focal length of the telescope by the focal length of the eyepiece. As already discussed in Chapter Figure 7.2.

Courtesy of Tele Vue Optics."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 58 3, the focal length is the distance from a lens or mirror to its focal point, specifi ed in either inches or millimeters. A telescope having a focal length of 50 inches (or 1250 mm) used with a 1-inch (or 25-mm) eyepiece yields a magnifi cation of 50 × . Changing the eyepiece to one with a 1 − 2 -inch (12.5-mm) focal length increases the power to 100 × , while a 1 − 4 -inch (6-mm) eyepiece gives 200 × . Therefore, the shorter the eyepiece’s focal length, the higher the magnifi cation it provides – and along with it, correspondingly smaller actual fi elds of view. Thus, it is important to use eyepieces with the largest possible apparent fi elds. While most telescopes today are typically supplied with one or two basic eyepieces of good quality and reasonable apparent fi elds of view, you may want to consider eventually upgrad- ing to a premium wide-angle, low-power ocular – one having a focal length, say, between 26 mm and 32 mm. Most of the major telescope manufacturers and suppliers have extensive lines of eyepiece sizes, types, and designs, ranging from basic oculars priced at under $50 to premium ones going for as much as $300 each! Among others, Orion offers a quality selection of sizes and types at affordable prices, while Meade and (espe- cially) Tele Vue provide premium, multi-element designs in a variety of focal lengths and apparent fi eld sizes at correspondingly higher costs. Zoom eyepieces make possible a continuous range of magnifi cations using just a single ocular. These have traditionally been considered much inferior to single eyepieces of a given focal length, owing to the changes in fi eld of view and focus with changes in power. Improved models have recently appeared on the market in an attempt to rectify this. Tele Vue’s 8–24-mm Click-Stop Zoom priced at $210 is a defi nite step up optically over traditional zooms (although the apparent fi eld still varies from 55 degrees to 40 degrees). Its 3–6-mm Nagler Zoom (obviously intended for high-power viewing) has a constant 50-degree apparent fi eld through its short range and sells for around $380. Orion offers a 7–21-mm zoom whose apparent fi eld varies from 43 degrees to 30 degrees; it costs about $60. But for those of us who enjoy wide, expansive eyepiece views, despite their convenience even these improved zooms still fall far short of the performance a high-quality single ocular can provide.

This is a small auxiliary telescope or other sighting device mounted on the main instrument itself to aid in pointing it at celestial targets so they will appear in the fi eld of a low-power eyepiece. Such an eyepiece typically provides an actual fi eld of only a degree or so; optical fi nders, on the other hand, have fi elds of 5 or 6 degrees (similar to those of binoculars), making it easy to locate objects in the sky. Once the fi nder has been aligned with the main telescope using the provided adjusting screws, so that they’re pointing at the same piece of sky, any target placed on the fi nder’s crosshairs will then be in the scope’s eyepiece. Magnifi cations generally range from 6 × or 7 × for small fi nders to 10 × or 12 × for large ones."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Accessories 59 An old rule of thumb states that a fi nder should have an aperture one-quarter that of the telescope itself. Thus, a 4-inch glass should have a 1-inch fi nder, an 8- inch a 2-inch one, and a 12-inch a 4-inch one. But this guideline is often ignored by manufacturers in larger-size scopes. And although the guideline may be fol- lowed for scopes in the 2–4-inch range, the optical quality is often very poor. A 1-inch (or 25-mm – fi nder sizes are typically given in millimeters) fi nder on a 4- inch telescope is hardly adequate. An ideal size for 4–8-inch telescopes is one with a 2-inch (50-mm) aperture and a magnifi cation of 7 times (essentially half of a 7 × 50 binocular!), with correspondingly larger values for bigger scopes. Even a 2-inch glass can benefi t from having a fi nder this size. While tiny fi nders may be adequate for sighting bright targets such as the Moon and planets, they are nearly useless for locating fainter targets such as nebulae and galaxies. Having a good fi nder often requires upgrading the one supplied with the tele- scope as original equipment – either at the time the scope is ordered from the manufacturer, or as a later purchase from another source. Many of the telescope companies listed in Chapter 9 offer a selection of fi nders, with prices ranging from as low as $30 to well over $100, depending on aperture. Note that some of these may be equipped with right-angle star diagonals (see below) built into them, seemingly to make aiming easier. However, not only do you still have to sight along the tube for initial pointing, but the diagonal produces a mirror-reversed image of the sky that can be confusing to beginners. It should also be mentioned that many of the latest Go-To systems supplied with telescopes today (as dis- cussed in Chapter 3) are so accurate that a fi nder is not needed. But for quick and ready aiming at bright naked-eye objects, one is still quite useful even so. In recent years, a new type of fi nder has been increasingly supplied on tele- scopes in place of a traditional optical one. Known as the zero - or unit-power fi nder (it is actually 1-power – that of the human eye!), this is a sighting device that projects a red dot on the sky as you look through it – typically centered on a bull’s-eye pattern. This makes going from a star atlas directly to the sky when aiming a telescope quick, easy, and surprisingly accurate. The original and still one of the best of many such devices now on the market is the famed Telrad, invented by the late Steve Kufeld. If not already included with the instrument you Figure 7.3.

Prices range from under $50 to over $100. It turns out that many observers prefer to have both a unit-power and an optical fi nder on their telescopes – the former being used for rapid pointing to the position of a desired target, and the latter for positive identifi cation and precision centering in the eyepiece. Figure 7.4. A unit-power (non-magnifying), refl ex-sight fi nder like that now widely used on telescopes in place of (or in conjunction with) conventional optical fi nders. It works simply by superimposing a tiny LED red dot focused at infi nity on a 10-degree view of the sky, showing exactly where the telescope is pointed. Courtesy of Orion Telescopes & Binoculars. Star Diagonals Stargazers are typically pictured in cartoons and other media as peering at the heavens straight through a long refracting telescope. This image is quite mislead- ing. For objects on the ground or low over the horizon, this set-up works satis- factorily; but most celestial objects are positioned high in the sky – even at the zenith (or overhead point) – and it’s virtually impossible to bend the neck to view them straight through a refractor. This is also true with Cassegrain refl ectors and catadioptric systems, where observing is done at the back end of the instrument, as in the case of refractors. (This isn’t a concern with a Newtonian refl ector, since the observer looks into the side of the tube.) To overcome this problem, a star diagonal is used."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Accessories 61 This device consists of two tubes joined at right angles to each other in a housing containing either a precision right-angled prism or a front-surface fl at mirror, with one tube fi tting into the focuser and the other accepting the eyepiece.

These are supplied as standard Figure 7.5. Shown here is a conventional prism-type star diagonal as commonly used on refractors, Cassegrain refl ectors, and catadioptric telescopes.

Prism star diagonals can be had for under $40, while mirror diagonals start as low as $60 and run up into the hundreds of dollars. It should be mentioned that a star diagonal produces a mirror image of what is being viewed, so objects appear right-side-up but reversed left-to-right. This makes deciding which way to move the eyepiece somewhat confusing until you get used to it. To fi nd your bearings, let the image drift through the eyepiece fi eld (turning off the telescope’s motor drive if it has one). Stars will enter the fi eld from the east and leave it to the west. Nudging the scope toward Polaris, the North Star, will indicate which direction is north. There is another type of diagonal, supplied on some telescopes intended mainly for terrestrial viewing, known as an erecting prism diagonal . These diag- onals turn the image 45 degrees instead of 90 degrees and provide fully correct images. But not only are they awkward to use for sky viewing because of the angle the light is turned, but the roof prism that erects the image produces an obvious luminous line radiating through bright objects such as planets and fi rst- magnitude stars. As a result, they are defi nitely not recommended for stargazing purposes! Barlow Lenses There exists a marvelous little optical device that effectively doubles or triples the focal length of any telescope, yet measures only a few inches long! Called a Barlow lens after the inventor of its optics, it consists of a negatively-curved achromatic lens (sometimes three elements are used instead of two) fi tted into a short tube, one end of which accepts the eyepiece while the other goes into the telescope’s focuser. With the proliferation of short-focus refractors and fast Dob- sonian refl ectors in such wide use today, these focal extenders are enjoying renewed popularity among observers. F i g u r e 7. 7. This 2 × Barlow lens is just 3 inches long and effectively doubles the magnifi cation of any eyepiece used with it. Other models provide amplifi cations of 2.5 × and 3 × (or even more, using extender tubes, as mentioned in the text). Courtesy of Orion Telescopes & Binoculars."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Accessories 63 The Barlow’s negative-lens element decreases the angle of convergence of the light being brought to focus by a telescope’s objective lens or primary mirror – causing the latter to appear to be at a much greater distance from the focus than it actually is. This effectively increases the original focal ratio/focal length of the system. Barlows are typically made to amplify between two and three times (2 × to 3 × ). The actual stated power is based upon the eyepiece being placed into the drawtube at a set distance from the negative lens; the further the eyepiece is pulled back from this lens, the greater the amplifi cation factor. (Some adjustable Barlows use this very principle to provide a range of powers.) By adding extender tubes, many observers have pushed their 2 × - or 3 × -rated Barlows to 6 × and more! Also note here that the eyepiece–Barlow combination is normally placed into a star diagonal as a unit. But if instead the eyepiece itself is placed into the diagonal and the Barlow inserted ahead of it in the telescope, the extra optical-path length though the diagonal to the eyepiece will also greatly increase its effective amplifi cation. Solar, lunar, planetary, and double-star observers have long used Barlow lenses to increase the image scale and magnifi cation of the objects they are viewing. The great advantage of these devices to the casual stargazer is that they make it pos- sible to achieve high powers using eyepieces of longer focal length than would normally be required to do so. Such oculars have bigger lenses, wider apparent fi elds of view, and more comfortable eye relief than do ones of shorter focal length. Thus, an eyepiece having a 25-mm (1-inch) focal length and combined with a 3 × Barlow used on a telescope having a 1250-mm (50-inch) focal length would result in a magnifi cation of 150 × (3 t i mes 50 × ). To achieve the same power with an eyepiece alone would require one with a focal length of about 8 mm. Barlow lenses are not normally supplied as standard equipment on commer- cially available telescopes (except for imported 2.4-inch/60-mm refractors, which are notoriously already way overpowered without using one!). But they are widely available from many of the companies listed in Chapter 9, at prices from under $50 up to more than $200 for premium units. Here’s a great way to effectively double or triple the number of eyepieces in your collection for a very modest investment! Dew Caps/Light Shields Refl ectors have their own built-in versions of dew caps/light shields , since their primary mirrors are located at the bottom ends of their tubes. But refractors and catadioptric telescopes need to have extensions added to their tubes to prevent dew from forming on their front optical elements, and also to help prevent stray light from entering the system. Although refractors are generally provided with a dew cap/light shield, these are typically much too short to offer any real protec- tion. And, surprisingly, virtually every catadioptric telescope sold on the market today comes without one at all! In any case, the observer can (and defi nitely should) either fashion one out of some black, opaque, fl exible material such as common posterboard, or purchase one from the manufacturer at the time the telescope is ordered. They are very affordable (well under $100, depending on size)"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 64 and are an absolute “must” for anyone using a refracting or catadioptric telescope. (A useful rule of thumb is that a dew cap/light shield should be at least 1.5 times as long as the aperture of the telescope, and to be fully effective 2.5 times as long. The main concern here is that it does not extend out so far as to reduce the effec- tive aperture itself. This can readily be checked by looking up through the instru- ment without the eyepiece in place at the daytime sky.) Miscellaneous Items The following additional accessory items are mentioned here for the sake of completeness. Few are ever supplied as standard equipment with a telescope purchase, and in many cases they have relatively limited utility (especially for beginning observers). In addition to the primary resource listing in Chapter 9, the advertisements in Sky & Telescope , Astronomy and other magazines provide sources for most of these items. Binocular viewers make it possible to use both eyes at the telescope instead of one. While some light-loss is involved in splitting the incoming light into two separate beams, as with binoculars image contrast, resolution, color percep- tion, and sensitivity to low light levels are all increased over viewing with one eye only. And there’s also the wonderful illusion of depth perception in looking at objects such as, for example, the Moon, where the observer feels suspended in orbit above its vast globe! A downside is the matter of cost. Not only are these devices quite expensive in themselves (ranging anywhere from $300 to $1,600), but two precisely matched eyepieces are needed for each magnifi cation that’s used. In other words, a double set of eyepieces is required for the tele- scope! The binocular viewer fi ts directly into the drawtube of a Newtonian refl ector (it’s vital here to make sure the telescope has enough “back-focus” to accommodate the light path through the viewer to the eyepieces; if not, a Barlow lens inserted ahead of the viewer itself can be used to extend the focus), and into the star diagonal of a refractor or catadioptric (which typically have ample back-focus). Rotary eyepiece holders offer the convenience of having anywhere from three to six eyepieces (depending on model) at your fi ngertips ready to rotate into posi- tion for rapid changes in power. The holder itself is a prism star diagonal and fi ts directly into the telescope drawtube just as a standard one does. Unitron, with their Unihex rotary eyepiece selector, was the fi rst to market such a device and is still among the few companies offering one. Prices begin around $125. Note that those eyepieces not actually in use often tend to dew up (see below). Dew heating strips (sometimes called “dew zappers”) avoid the annoying for- mation of moisture on the eye-lens of oculars left exposed to the night air, as well as on objective lenses, corrector plates, and even secondary mirrors. The heating element is typically encased in an elastic nylon strip with Velcro for attaching it around the various optical surfaces and is operated from a 12-volt DC source such as a car battery or power supply. Prices average under $100. While the dew caps discussed above generally provide adequate protection for objective lenses and corrector plates themselves without recourse to heating strips, eyepieces are"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Accessories 65 particularly vulnerable to dewing up. (So too are the lenses on fi nders.) They should never be left exposed to the night air in an open eyepiece box, for example. Except for the ocular that’s in use on the scope at the time, they should be kept covered. Note that rotary eyepiece holders do leave their eyepieces exposed to the air, often requiring that they be capped until positioned into place for viewing. (Many observers today also employ ordinary hairdryers to remove dew from the various optical surfaces of their telescopes, but care must be taken not to overheat them! In this case, dew is dealt with after it forms on the optics – heating strips prevent it from forming in the fi rst place.) Image erectors are typically supplied with small imported refractors for use in terrestrial viewing. Their long tubes make them awkward to use on a telescope and their optics often leave much to be desired. An image-erecting star diagonal (mentioned above) offers a much more convenient and optically superior way to achieve a fully corrected image for land-gazing. Focal reducers can be thought of as “reverse Barlows” in that they reduce the effective focal length of a telescope rather than extend it. Originally developed for use on catadioptric systems with their long focal ratios (typically f/10 to f/14), they’re intended primarily for increasing the photographic speed of these slow telescopes for astroimaging purposes by reducing their effective ratios by as much as half the original values. This correspondingly both reduces the lowest achievable magnifi cation and increases the maximum actual fi eld of view that can be obtained with a given telescope. However, focal reducers have seemingly found only limited use for visual work among stargazers. Figure 7.8. A binocular eyepiece holder, allowing use of both eyes at the telescope. Note that two oculars of identical focal lengths are required by these units. Some observers actually have a complete double set of eyepieces for use with their bino-viewers! Courtesy of Tele Vue Optics."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 66 Aperture masks are used to reduce the effective aperture of a telescope, which many observers feel improves the visual image quality and reduces image motion under conditions of less than ideal atmospheric seeing. This goes along with the claim that small apertures are less affected by poor seeing – supposedly because the turbulence “cells” average around 4–6 inches in width, so that only one or two are over a small telescope at any given instant, whereas many may be over the light-collecting area of a large telescope. Although reducing the aperture can indeed often improve image quality on the Sun, Moon, planets, and double stars in poor seeing, it reduces the resolution and light-gathering power of the tele- scope as well. The masks can be made from a piece of cardboard simply by cutting a hole smaller than the original aperture itself. Note that the opening should be on-axis in the case of refractors, and off-axis for refl ectors or catadioptrics in order to avoid their central obstructions (which limit the mask’s clear aperture to less than the radius of the primary mirror). They are placed over the front of the telescope itself. Coma correctors do just what the name implies – reduce the amount of coma in fast (f/3 to f/6) short-focus Newtonian telescopes. This is especially useful for the immensely popular large Dobsonian refl ectors in use today, most of whose parabolic mirrors operate at f/4.5 and exhibit noticeable fl aring of images a short distance from the center of the eyepiece fi eld. Few of these devices are found commercially at present – Tele Vue’s Paracorr corrector is one of them and prob- ably the best ever made. As with some of this company ’s famed wide-angle Nagler series of eyepieces discussed above, its coma corrector costs as much as a small introductory telescope itself! But the improvement in image quality and useable fi eld of view are well worth the price for those who can afford this accessory. Photographer’s cloths are simply dark, opaque pieces of fabric that are thrown over the observer’s head and the eyepiece area of the telescope to eliminate stay light and preserve dark adaptation (see Chapter 10). They are available commer- cially from camera stores and some telescope dealers, and are also easily made. In practice, these can prove a bit suffocating, especially on warm muggy nights, and are sure to raise the eyebrows of any neighbor who happens to see you lurking in the dark! Telescope covers are used to protect a telescope’s sensitive optics (and its mount- ing) from dust, pollen, moisture, and other airborne contaminants at all times when the telescope is not in use. While they may simply consist of plastic sheeting thrown over the entire ins trument, more typically they consist of a fi tted plastic cap supplied with the telescope for covering both ends of the tube, in the case of a refl ector, or the objective lens or correcting plate for refractors and catadi- optrics, as well as eyepieces and fi nders. The best way to keep a telescope clean is not to let it get dirty! If a cover is not already supplied as standard equip- ment, a plastic-bowl cover or a heavy-duty shower cap can also be used for this purpose. Filters of many different types and intended purposes are offered commer- cially for use on telescopes today. Among these are solar, lunar, planetary, nebula, and light-pollution fi lters. With the exception of solar fi lters, which are placed over the front of the tele- scope ( never over an eyepiece, as implied with those supplied on many small imported refractors), the other types screw into the front end of standard eye-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Accessories 67 piece barrels – virtually all of which today are specifi cally threaded to take them. I have never been a big fan of fi lters (except, of course, ones for viewing the Sun!), but they do serve a purpose. Planetary observers have long used them to enhance surface or atmospheric features, and an entire set of them can be purchased for as little as $50. Many deep-sky observers today routinely use nebula and light- pollution fi lters to increase the visibility of faint objects. These are much more specialized and diffi cult to manufacture than are planetary fi lters, with single units beginning at $50 and up. It’s perhaps best to use your new telescope for a while to see where your interests lie before investing in them. Full-aperture optical-glass solar fi lters run from about $60 to nearly $150, depending on aper- ture, and are an absolute must for observing the Sun. Less expensive but still safe Mylar® versions are also widely used. Micrometers are devices for measuring the angular size or separation of celes- tial objects (usually in arc-seconds) and their relative positions (or position angle) on the compass heading in degrees with a telescope. Of the many different types in use, the fi lar micrometer is the traditional such device. The few available com- mercial models run from around $600 to several thousand dollars, depending on features (such as digital readouts). Another form that’s becoming more popular today and is much more affordable is the reticle eyepiece micrometer, which costs about the same as a good eyepiece. Micrometers are most often used in measuring the separations and position angles of double stars (especially binary systems), an activity ideally suited to amateurs looking for a useful observing program to pursue. For more information about microm eters and their application to double stars, see Observing and Measuring Visual Double Stars by Bob Argyle (2004) and my own Double and Multiple Stars and How to Observe Them (2005), both pub- lished by Springer. Photometers measure the apparent brightness or magnitude of celestial objects (particularly stars) in visual or other wavelengths, generally employing sensitive photocells and electronic circuitry. For the amateur astronomer, they fi nd most application in following the changes in brightness of variable stars. Commercial units are few and far between, and as a result many observers have built their own devices. Spectroscopes use one or more prisms or a fi nely ruled diffraction grating to separate the light from celestial objects into its component colors or wavelengths. This makes it possible to glean such amazing physical information about them as their temperatures, compositions, sizes, and rotational and space velocities. For amateur use, the fun is seeing the absorption lines and bands in the various spectral classes of stars. In years past, Edmund marketed an imported eyepiece spectroscope that became very popular and is still to be found on the used market. Today, Rainbow Optics among a few others offers a visual star spectro- scope that fi ts over a standard eyepiece – one capable of showing not only the absorption lines and bands in the brighter stars but also emission lines if present. The visual model sells for $200 while one that includes photographic and CCD imaging capability as well goes for $250. Readers interested in learning more about visual spectroscopes and stellar spectroscopy should consult Mike Inglis’ excellent book Observer’s Guide to Stellar Evolution (Springer, 20 03). Astrocameras come in many different types and varieties, ranging from basic 35-mm fi lm cameras riding piggyback on telescopes for wide-angle shots of the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 68 sky to special cameras designed for prime-focus or eyepiece-projection photog- raphy through the telescope itself. (Unitron in its early days offered a superb astrocamera for these latter forms, which can still occasionally be found on the used market.) This is a vast and complex fi eld – yet one that can be very reward- ing, given lots of patience and practice. Amateur astronomers today are routinely taking spectacular color images of celestial wonders that rival those from the large professional observatories themselves. Even common digital cameras are now being widely used to do astro-imaging through telescopes. But fi lm photog- raphy itself is a fi eld that’s rapidly declining in favor of CCD and video imaging (see below). A plethora of practical guides covering both conventional and elec- tronic astroimaging are available today for the amateur astronomer. An excellent source for many of these is Sky Publishing Corporation’s catalog, available by mail or on-line at www.skyandtelescope.com. Pricing for cameras intended for sky-shooting is about the same as for those used in conventional ground-based photography, since they are essentially the same equipment. But here I should like to offer a word of advice. If you are new to astronomy, before plunging into astroimaging of whatever type, spend the better part of a year seeing the real sky – that of all four seasons – with your own eyes rather than that of a camera! (And in this regard, see the discussion concerning the “photon connection” in Chapter 14.) CCD and video imagers use charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and either eyepiece video cameras or common webcams, respectively, to photograph the heavens through telescopes. CCD imaging in particular has virtually replaced conven- tional fi lm photography at most of the world’s major research observatories today owing to its immensely faster speed (or “quantum effi ciency”) and dynamic range, and the fact that the images collected can be immediately viewed and pro- cessed electronically using sophisticated computer software. Exposure times of minutes or even seconds now show what previously took hours employing the fastest fi lms. And these devices have now become widely available to amateurs as well. Basic units are surprisingly affordable; Orion offers a black and white Elec- tronic Imaging Eyepiece camera t hat displays pictures from t he telescope direct ly onto a TV screen, VCR, or camcorder for $65 and a color version for $120. Meade pioneered affordable CCD imaging systems for their telescopes, includ- ing the very popular and easy-to-use Deep Sky Imager with Autostar Suite processing software that sells for just $300 and promises successful images the fi rst night out! But here again, see the advice given in the section above on astrocameras. Computers have become important tools in observational astronomy, as in almost every other area of modern life. While they can hardly be considered an “accessory” for the telescope in the normal sense of the word, they are used for such tasks as helping to fi nd and track celestial objects, and in making, process- ing, and displaying observations by electronic imaging – all typically done remotely from the observer’s living room, den, or offi ce. While all this certainly has its place, such “robotic” remote observing, however satisfying and comfort- able (especially in muggy or frigid weather), is not seeing the real sky – and is often not even being out under the real sky! Once more, to gain a perspective on this issue, please see the discussion concerning the “photon connection” in Chapter 14."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Accessories 69 Figure 7.9.

Some are included on certain telescopes as standard equipment, while in other cases they are add-ons to be ordered along with the telescope itself. As already mentioned in Chapter 3, the traditional use of mechanical setting circles (and subsequently digital ones) on equatorial mountings displaying Right Ascension and Declination to fi nd celestial targets is rapidly disappearing in favor of these state-of-the-art computerized systems. These make it possible (after initial setting on two or three bright alignment stars) to locate thousands of objects essentially at the touch of a few buttons while at the same time providing excellent tracking capabilities. In the case of Push-Pull-To systems (as offered by Orion on its Intel- liScope series of Dobsonian refl ectors), after the target name or designation is entered on the keypad, the observer moves the telescope by hand (instead of with drive motors) until a “null” or zero reading is displayed on the LCD display. The object will then be in the eyepiece’s fi eld of view. These devices make fi nding things relatively easy and are especially helpful under light-polluted skies or when there’s little time available to search for elusive targets. They certainly do serve a purpose and are fi rmly entrenched in modern-day amateur astronomy. Again, however, for us purists, automated acquisition takes much of the fun out of celestial exploration and typically leaves the observer not knowing the sky.

An inexperienced observer may look at the planet Jupiter and perhaps detect its two major dark equatorial bands, while an experienced one will typi- cally see more than a dozen belts and bands using the very same telescope at the same magnifi cation. Again, a novice may glimpse a nebula as a barely visible ghostly glow in the eyepiece, while a seasoned observer will see intricate details and even in some cases various hues. It’s all a matter of training the eye – and along with it the brain that processes the images formed by it from the telescope itself. Sir William Herschel – the greatest visual observer who ever lived – long ago advised: “You must not expect to see at sight . Seeing is in some respects an art which must be learned.” He also pointed out that “When an object is once dis- covered by a superior power, an inferior one will suffi ce to see it afterwards.” (In other words, the eye–brain combination has been alerted to its presence.) And another great observer from the past, William Henry Smyth, stated that “Many things, deemed invisible to secondary instruments, are plain enough to one who ‘knows how to see them’.” There are four distinct areas in which an observer’s eye can be trained to see more at the eyepiece (whether of a telescope or of a pair of binoculars). Let’s start with visual acuity – the ability to see or resolve fi ne detail in an image. There’s no question that the more time you spend at the eyepiece, the more such detail you will eventually see! Even without any purposeful training plan in mind, the Observing Techniques Training the Eye 93"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 94 eye–brain combination will learn to search for and see ever-fi ner detail in what it is viewing. But this process can be considerably speeded up by a simple exercise repeated daily for a period of at least several weeks. On a piece of white paper, draw a circle about 3 inches in diameter. Then, using a soft pencil, randomly draw various markings within the circle, ranging from broad patchy shadings to fi ne lines and points. Now place the paper at the opposite side of a room at a distance of at least 20 feet or so, and begin drawing what you see using the unaided eye. Initially, only the larger markings will be visible to you – but as you repeat this process over a period of time, you’ll be able to see more and more of them! Taking this a step further, cut out that white disk and attach it onto a black background. Next, darken the room and illuminate the image with a broad-beam, low-intensity fl ashlight aimed at it. Doing this more closely simulates the view of a planetary disk seen against the night sky through a telescope. Tests have shown improvements in overall visual acuity by a factor of as much as 10 using these procedures! Not only will you see more detail on the Sun, Moon, and planets as a result of this practice, but you will also be able to resolve much closer double stars than you were previously able to. A second area of training the eye–brain combination involves the technique of using averted ( or side ) vision in viewing faint celestial objects. This makes use of the well-known fact that the outer portion of the retina of the eye contains recep- tors called rods , and that these are much more sensitive to low levels of illumina- tion than is the center of the eye, which contains receptors known as cones . (See the discussion below involving color perception by the cones.) This explains the common experience of driving at night and seeing objects out of the corner of the eye appearing brighter than they actually are if you turn and look directly at them. Applied to astronomical observing, averted vision is used in detecting faint companions to double stars, and dim stars in open and globular clusters. But it’s especially useful (and most obvious) in viewing low-surface-brightness targets such as nebulae and galaxies, where increases in apparent brightness of from two to two-and-a-half times (or an entire magnitude) have been reported! Once having centered such an object in the fi eld of view, look to one side of it (above or below also works), and you’ll see it magically increase in visibility. (Be aware that there is a small dark void or “dead spot” in the fovea between the eye and ear that you may encounter in going that direction.) One of the most dramatic examples of the affect of averted vision involves the so-called “Blinking Planetary” – a name I coined many years ago in a Sky & Telescope magazine article about it. Also known as NGC 6826, it’s located in the constellation Cygnus and is easily visible in a 3- or 4-inch glass. Here we fi nd an obvious bluish-green tenth-magnitude nebulosity some 27 seconds of arc in size surrounding a ninth-magnitude star. Staring directly at the star, there’s no sign of the nebulosity itself. On switching to averted vision, the nebulosity instantly appears and is so bright that it drowns out the central star. Alternating back and forth between direct and averted vision results in an amazing apparent blinking- on-and-off effect! A third important area involving the eye–brain combination is that of color perception . At fi rst glance, all stars look white to the eye. But upon closer inspec- tion, differences in tint among the brighter ones reveal themselves. The lovely"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Observing Techniques 95 contrasting hues of ruddy-orange Betelgeuse and blue-white Rigel in the constel- lation Orion is one striking example in the winter sky. Another can be found in the spring and summer sky by comparing blue-white Vega in Lyra and orange Arcturus in Bootes. Indeed, the sky is alive with color once the eye has been trained to see it! Star color, by the way, is primarily a visual indication of surface temperature: ruddy ones are relatively cool while bluish ones are quite hot. Yellow and orange suns fall in between. While the rods in the edge of the eye are light-sensitive, they are essentially colorblind. Thus, for viewing the tints of stars (whether single, double, or multi- ple) and other celestial wonders, direct vision is employed – making use of the color-sensitive cones at the center of the eye. Stare directly at an object to perceive its color and off to the side to see it become brighter (unless it’s already a bright target such as a planet or naked-eye star). It should be mentioned here that there’s a peculiar phenomenon known as the Purkinje Effect that results from staring at red stars – they appear to increase in brightness the longer you watch them! One fi nal area involving preparing the eye to see better is that of dark adapta- tion . It’s an obvious fact that the eyes needs time to adjust to the dark after coming out of a brightly lit room. Two factors are at play here. One is the dilation of the pupils themselves, which begins immediately upon entering the dark and Figure 10.1. Dark-adaptation times for both the color-sensitive cones (open circles) at the center of the eye and the light-sensitive rods (black dots) around the outer part of the eye. At the “rod–cone break” some 10 minutes after being in the dark, the sensitivity of the cones levels off and remains unchanged. The rods, however, continue to increase their sensitivity to low light levels, with complete dark adaptation taking at least four hours! For all practical purposes, the eye is essentially dark-adapted in about 30 to 40 minutes."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 96 continues for several minutes. The other involves the actual chemistry of the eye, as the hormone rhodopsin (often called “visual purple”) stimulates the sensitivity of the rods to low levels of illumination. The combined result is that night vision improves noticeably for perhaps half an hour or so (and then continues to do so very slowly for many hours following this initial period). This is why the sky looks black on fi rst going outside, but later looks gray as you fully adjust to the dark. In the fi rst instance, it’s a contrast effect; and in the second, the eye has become sensitive to stray light, light pollution, and the natural airglow of the night sky itself that were not seen initially. Stargazers typically begin their observing sessions by viewing bright objects such as the Moon and planets fi rst and moving to fainter ones afterward, giving the eye time to dark-adapt gradually and naturally. This is mainly of value in observing the dimmer deep-sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies. Stars them- selves are generally bright enough to be seen to advantage almost immediately upon looking into the telescope. Exceptions are faint pairs of stars and dim com- panions to brighter stars (where the radiance of the primary often destroys the effect of dark-adaptation). White light causes the eye to lose its dark-adaptation but red light preserves it, making it standard practice to use red illumination to read star charts and write notes at the eyepiece. Another helpful procedure is to wear sunglasses (preferably polarized) when venturing outside on a sunny day if you plan to look for “faint fuzzies” that evening. It’s been shown that bright sunlight – especially that encountered on an ocean beach or near other refl ecting bodies of water and on snow – can retard the eye’s dark adaptation for as long as several days! Sky Conditions A number of atmospheric and related factors affect the visibility of celestial objects at the telescope. In the case of the Moon, planets, and double stars, the most important of these is atmospheric turbulence or seeing , which is an indica- tion of the steadiness of the image. On some nights, the air is so unsteady (or “boiling”, as it’s sometimes referred to) that star images appear as big puffy, shimmering balls, and detail on the Moon and planets is all but non-existent. This typically happens on nights of high atmospheric transparency – those having crystal-clear skies, with the air overhead in a state of rapid motion and agitation. On other nights, star images are nearly pinpoints with virtually no motion, and fi ne detail stands out on the Moon and planets like an artist’s etching. Such nights are often hazy and/or muggy, indicating that stagnant, tranquil air lies over the observer’s head and that seeing is superb. One of the most dramatic and revealing accounts of the changing effects of seeing-conditions upon celestial objects comes from the great double-star observer S.W. Burnham, in the following account of the famed binary system Sirius ( α Canis Majoris): “An object glass of 6-inch one night will show the companion to Sirius perfectly: on the next night, just as good in every respect, so far as one can tell with the unaided eye, the largest telescope in the world will show no more trace of the small star than if it had been blotted out of existence.”"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Observing Techniques 97 Va r iou s seeing scales are employed by observers to quantify the state of atmo- spheric steadiness. One of the most common of these uses a 1-to-5 numerical scale, with 1 indicating hopelessly turbulent blurred images and 5 stationary razor-sharp ones. The number 3 denotes average conditions. Others prefer a 1- to-10 system, with 1 again representing very poor and 10 virtually perfect seeing, respectively. (In some schemes, the numerical sequence is reversed, with lower numbers indicating better and higher numbers poorer seeing.) While casual stargazing can often be done even in less than average-quality seeing, many types of observing such as sketching or imaging fi ne lunar and planetary detail, or splitting close double stars, requires good to excellent conditions. Another factor affecting telescopic image quality is that known as “local seeing” – or the thermal conditions in and around the telescope itself. Heat radi- ating from driveways, walks and streets, houses and other structures (especially on nights following hot days) plays a signifi cant role in destroying image quality that’s totally unrelated to the state of the atmosphere itself. For this reason, observing from fi elds or grassy areas away from buildings and highways gives the best chance of minimizing local seeing. Figure 10.2. On nights of good “seeing” or atmospheric steadiness, the air above the observer is tranquil and lies in relatively smooth layers, often resulting in somewhat hazy skies. This allows starlight to pass through undisturbed and produces sharp images at the eyepiece. In poor seeing, the atmosphere is very turbulent, typically bringing with it crystal-clear skies and an ideal time to view faint objects. But the resulting star images are often blurry, shimmering balls of light, making such nights largely useless for seeing fi ne detail on the Moon and planets or for splitting close double stars."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 98 The cooling of the telescope optics and tube assembly is especially critical for achieving sharp images. Depending on the season of the year, it may take up to an hour or more for the optics (especially the primary mirror in larger refl ectors) to reach equilibrium with the cooling night air. During this cool-down process, air currents within the telescope tube itself can play absolute havoc with image quality, no matter how good the atmospheric seeing is – even in closed-tube systems such as the popular Schmidt–Cassegrain catadioptric. Refl ecting tele- scopes should have tubes at least several inches larger than the primary mirror itself to allow room for thermal currents to rise along the inside of the tube rather than across the light path itself. Surprisingly, even the heat radiating from the observer’s body can be a concern here, particularly with Dobsonian refl ectors having open-tubed truss designs. No discussion of sky conditions and their impact on observing would be com- plete without mentioning the hindering effects of bright lights – both natural and man-made. Especially around the time of full Moon, bright moonlight not only destroys the observer’s dark adaptation (discussed above) but also wipes out many of the sky’s faint wonders such as nebulae and galaxies. A modern accom- paniment is the menace of light pollution – illumination from ever-more homes, offi ce buildings, shopping malls, and cars lots, directed skyward instead of down- ward where it’s actually needed. This has much the same result as bright moon- light, as it illuminates the atmosphere through which the observer must look. But additionally in the case of artifi cial lighting, haze and passing clouds intensify its impact by bouncing it back down into telescopes, binoculars, and observers’ eyes. Fortunately, the planets and brighter stars (including variables and doubles), as well as the Moon itself, are largely immune to all this, and therefore bright nights are not necessarily a total loss for observing. Readers interested in learning more about the subject of light-pollution and ways to combat it should contact the US-based International Dark-Sky Association (IDSA) at www.darksky.org or by e-mail at ida@darksky.org. Record Keeping The annals of both amateur and professional astronomy attest to the personal as well as scientifi c value of keeping records of our nightly vigils beneath the stars. From the former perspective, an account of what has been seen each night can bring pleasant memories as we look back over the years at our fi rst views of this or that celestial wonder – or when we shared their very fi rst look at the Moon or Jupiter or Saturn with loved ones, friends, and even total strangers. Our eyepiece impressions written and/or sketched on paper, or perhaps recorded on audio tape and/or electronically imaged, can provide many hours of nostalgic enjoyment in months and years to come. From a scientifi c perspective, you may become involved in searching for comets or patrolling the sky for novae, or monitoring the brighter spiral galaxies for possible supernova outbursts. Even negative observations may be of value to professional astronomers. Often has the call gone out to the astronomical com- munity in the various magazines, journals, and electronic media asking if anyone"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Observing Techniques 99 happened to be looking at a certain object or part of the sky on a given date and at a particular time. If you happened to be at “the right place at the right time” indicated but noted nothing unusual in your observing log, that is still a fact of real importance to researchers. (This frequently happens in attempting to deter- mine when a nova in our galaxy or a supernova in a neighboring galaxy fi rst erupted.) And, of course, there’s always the possibility that you will be the fi rst to see and report something new in the sky yourself! The information in your logbook should include the following: the date, and beginning and end times of your observing session (preferably given in Universal Time/Date); telescope size, type, and make used; magnifi cation/s employed; sky conditions (seeing and transparency on a 1-to-5 or 1-to-10 scale, along with notes on passing clouds, haze, moonlight, and other sources of light-pollution); and fi nally a notation of each object seen (accompanied, if you’re so inclined, by sketches, photographs, and/or electronic images). And here, an important point Figure 10.3. A busy night’s entry from the author’s personal observing logbook. The date and times are given in Universal Time (U.T.) – that of the Greenwich, England, time zone. A 5-inch Celestron Schmidt– Cassegrain catadioptric telescope (C5 SCT) was used under conditions of average seeing (S) and good transparency (T), and the sky was brightened by the light of a fi rst-quarter Moon. All the targets viewed on this particular night are celestial showpieces! Normally, more time should be given to viewing fewer objects than shown here, in order to fully enjoy and appreciate the cosmic pageantry."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 100 should be borne in mind regarding record-keeping at the telescope: limit to an absolute minimum the amount of time you spend logging your observations (using a red light to preserve your dark adaptation when you do). Some observers spend far more time writing about what they see at the eyepiece than they actu- ally do viewing it! Observing Sites and Observatories Where you use your telescope (and less so your binoculars) is a very important consideration. Some observers have no choice in this matter, being confi ned for various reasons to viewing from a balcony or a driveway or a rooftop, or even through an opened upstairs bedroom window – all of which are considered “taboo”! We’ve already mentioned that images can be badly affected by heat rising from paved surfaces and radiating from buildings. Probably worst of all is observing from a rooftop, as some observers living in apartments in large cities do to get above the lights and surrounding buildings. After a warm day, a tarred roof surface will radiate heat long into the night, engulfi ng both observer and telescope in a sea of unstable air. And while looking through open windows – especially during the winter months when it’s cold outside and warm inside – has always been considered useless because of the temperature gradient, some observers (typically those using long-focus refractors) have been able to get rea- sonably sharp images by sticking the telescope tube as far outside the window as possible. Needless to say, sky visibility in any case is quite limited! And as for balconies, any movement on or anywhere around it (even someone walking inside the house or apartment) will typically result in annoying gyrations of the images seen in the telescope. With light pollution ever on the increase, more and more stargazers are travel- ing with their telescopes to fi nd dark skies. In some cases, their destinations are sites designated for astronomy clubs; in others they are city, county, state, or national parks. While this has its advantages – particularly for observers whose main interest is viewing faint deep-sky wonders – the inconvenience of packing up the telescope, accessories, and necessities such as water and proper clothing, and then driving there and back, limit the number of observing sessions com- pared with simply stepping out into a backyard. And for those who believe that only the Moon and planets can be observed from urban areas, I have on many occasions viewed – and also shown to others – some of the brighter galaxies such as that in Andromeda (M31) from the heart of several major cities. Two helpful references here are Visual Astronomy in the Suburbs by Anthony Cooke (Springer, 2003) and Urban Astronomy by Denis Berthier and Klaus Brasch (Cambridge University Press, 2003). Fortunate indeed is the observer who has a proper shelter for his or her tele- scope – one where the ins trument can be left safely o utdoors, protected from the elements, and be ready to use almost immediately upon demand. The domed observatory is the best-known and most aesthetic-looking of such structures, and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Observing Techniques 101 offers the maximum protection from wind and stray lights. But of the various types, it’s also the most costly, requires the longest cool-down time (for the tem- perature inside the dome to reach equilibrium with that outside), and provides only a limited vista of the sky through its narrow slit. An alternative to the dome is the roll-off roof observatory , in which the entire top of the structure rolls back on tracks to reveal the whole visible heavens. Depending on the height of its walls, it may offer only limited protection from wind and lights. A delightful compromise between these two types is the fl ip-top roof observatory . Here, a structure with low walls and hinged peak roof splits into two sections – one half typically swinging to the east, the other to the west. Chains or ropes control how high or low the halves extend, the observer adjusting them to reveal whatever part of the sky is being viewed, while at the same time using them as a shield against wind and lights. Mention should also be made of a unique telescope shelter fi rst built by famed stargazer Leslie Peltier to house his short-focus 6-inch refractor. Referred to as the merry-go-round observatory , the observer rides sitting in cushioned comfort in a chair with both the instrument and the structure housing it as they circle in Figure 10.4. A charming example of the classical domed observatory. The most aesthetic-looking of the various types of telescope shelters, it offers the greatest protection from wind and stray light. However, it also has the most limited view of the sky (owing to its narrow slit) and is the most costly of all the types of housing.

The telescope itself points skyward through a kind of trap door on the fl at roof of the box-shaped observatory, and is mounted within in such a way that very little head motion is required to look into the eyepiece, no matter where it’s pointed. A number of other observers have constructed their own versions of Peltier’s design, and they all consider this the ultimate in a personal telescope shelter. For more about the merry-go-round observatory, see Peltier’s delightful autobiography Starlight Nights (Sky Publishing, 2000). It should be pointed out here that many of the classic observers of the past – including the greatest observational astronomer of them all, Sir William Herschel – worked in the open night air unprotected by any kind of structure. So, too, do a majority of stargazers today, including the author, who has exten- sively used all three types of observator ies (and on one occasion Peltier’s merry- go-round creation itself!) over the years as both an amateur and professional astronomer. Personal Matters There are a number of little-recognized factors that impact the overall success of an observing session at the telescope. One concerns proper dress. This is of par- ticular importance in the cold winter months of the year, when observers often experience sub-zero temperatures at night. It’s impossible to be effective at the eyepiece – or even just to enjoy the views – when you’re numb and half-frozen to death! Proper protection of the head, hands, and feet are especially critical during such times, and for thermal insulation of the body in general several layers of clothing are recommended as opposed to one heavy one. During the summer months, the opposite problem arises, as observers attempt to stay cool. In addi- tion to having very short nights at this time of the year, there’s the added annoy- ance of fl ying insects together with optics-fogging humidity and dew. (See the discussion on dew caps and heated eyepieces in Chapter 7.) Another concern is proper posture at the telescope. It’s been repeatedly shown that observers see more from a comfortably seated position than when standing, twisting, or bending at the eyepiece! If you must stand, be sure that the eyepiece/ focuser is at a position where you don’t have to turn and strain your neck, head, or back to look into it. This is especia lly important in using large refl ectors, which often require a ladder just to reach the eyepiece! And, while not as critical, the same goes for positioning fi nder scopes where they can be used without undue contortions. Proper rest and diet both play a role in producing a pleasurable observing se s sion . At tempt i ng to st a rga z e w hen you’re phy sic a l ly a nd /or ment a l ly e x hau ste d is guaranteed to leave you not only frustrated, but also looking for a buyer for your prized telescope! Even a brief cat-nap before going out to observe after a hectic day is a big help here. Heavy dinners can leave you feeling sluggish and unable to function alertly at the telescope. It’s much better to eat after you’re done stargazing – especially so since most observers fi nd themselves famished then (particularly on cold nights!). Various liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, and hot chocolate can provide a needed energy boost (and warmth when desired)."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 104 And while alcoholic drinks such as wine do dilate the pupils, technically letting in more light, they also adversely affect the chemistry of the eye. This reduces its ability to see fi ne detail on the Moon and planets or resolve close double stars, and especially its sensitivity in viewing “faint fuzzies” such as dim nebulae and galaxies! Finally, there’s the very important matter of preparation . This is not just being aware of what objects are visible on a given night at a particular time of year, or of which of them can be seen from your site and with your ins trument, or decid- ing on those you plan to observe this time out. It goes beyond this to understand- ing something about the physical nature of the wonder you’re looking at – facts such as its type, distance, physical size, luminosity, mass, temperature, velocity towards or away from you, speed of rotation, composition, age, and place in the grand cosmic scheme of things. In other words, as stargazers we must “see” with our minds as well as our sight. (To better grasp the importance and purpose of preparation before going to the eyepiece, see the beautiful mandate found in the opening lines of Chapter 12, as set forth by the classic observer Charles Edward Barns.)"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN In this chapter we review various aspects of observing objects within our Solar System using telescopes and binoculars – both for pleasure and also for making useful observations. So vast is this fi eld that numerous entire books have been written about each and every one of the various objects discussed. Because of space limitations, the coverage given here, of necessity, provides only an overview of this subject. References for further study and contact information for various organizations in this fi eld are also given. Solar System Observing Sun 105 We begin with our dazzlingly bright daytime star , the Sun, which lies at an average distance from us of 93,000,000 miles (or 8 light-minutes). Now here’s one celestial object that supplies far too much light rather than not enough (which is the usual complaint of stargazers!) – so much so that it’s actually a very danger- ous object to observe without proper precautions. Serious eye damage or even permanent blindness can result from attempting to look at our star directly, or from using inadequate fi ltering techniques. While solar fi lters were briefl y dis- cussed in Chapter 7, it needs to be emphasized here that the fi nders of telescopes must also be capped whenever you are viewing the Sun, as they too can do damage to your eye, hair, skin, and even clothing. And binoculars, of course, must have proper solar fi lters secured over both of their objective lenses (again, as with telescopes, not over their eyepieces!) for safe viewing."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 106 The most obvious visual features of the Sun even in a 2- or 3-inch glass at 25 × to 30 × are the sunspots , with their dark inner umbra and lighter outer penumbra . (A few of the very largest ones are visible to the unaided eye on occasion and many are visible in binoculars.) Not only do they steadily change in size and shape, but they continually parade across the face of the Sun from day to day as it rotates. Near the limb, they become obviously foreshortened and some even show an apparent depression in the photosphere (the visible surface) at their centers. As is well known, sunspots come and go in a period that averages 11 years – the so-called sunspot cycle . Near maximum, the Sun’s face may be littered with them, often in large groups, while at minimum it may be diffi cult to fi nd any at all. On rare occasions, a brilliant white-light fl are will suddenly make its appear- ance within a sunspot, cutting across it in minutes as it rises up into the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Other things to look for are the limb darkening towards the edge of the Sun, giving it a very striking three-dimensional shape and looking like the vast sphere it actually is. There are also the minute granulations – tiny thermal convective cells in the photosphere that are continually churning, appearing and disappearing, and that are most conspicuous in the areas of limb darkening.

Somewhat similar are the faculae , which are hotter and therefore brighter patches in the photosphere that are typically seen near sun- spots and, as with granulation, are most obvious near the darkened limb. All of the above are features of the Sun as seen in visible or “white” light. With the advent of affordable hydrogen-alpha fi lters (and even designated solar tele- scopes with such fi lters built into them – see Chapter 4), it’s become possible for amateur astronomers to look deeper into our star’s seething layers and also to view its huge arching prominences . The latter can not only be seen rising majesti- cally from the edge of the Sun, but also moving across its face as giant, snake-like, dark ribbons. If you’re looking for a celestial object that “does something” while you watch it, there’s none more dynamic or spectacular than the Sun viewed in hydrogen-alpha light! On rare occasions, transits of the Sun by the inner planets Mercury and Venus can be seen. Of the two, those of Mercury are the more common; the last one was on May 7, 2003, while the next will occur on November 8, 2006. At such times, the tiny planet appears as a black dot about 10 seconds of arc in size (requiring high-powered binoculars or a small telescope to be seen) slowly moving across the Sun over a period of several hours. Transits of Venus are incredibly rare, and when they do happen they take place in pairs eight years apart. The last set occurred in 1874 and 1882, while the fi rst of the current pair was widely observed on June 8, 2004. At that time, Venus looked like a huge round black sunspot and was easily visible even in binoculars. The second transit of this set is scheduled Figure 11.2. A highly-detailed, stylized sunspot sketch based on a famous classical observation by Samuel Pierpont Langley in 1870 using a 13-inch refractor at very high magnifi cation under superb seeing conditions.

This also serves to block direct sunlight from falling on the observer. Photo by Sharon Mullaney."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Solar System Observing 109 for June 5, 2012. It should also be mentioned here that transits of dark objects other than Mercury and Venus themselves across the face of the Sun have been reported ever since the invention of the telescope (and there are even some pre- telescopic naked-eye accounts). Although more than 600 have appeared in the a s t r onom ic a l l it e r at u re ove r t he p a s t t h re e c e nt u r ie s , t he i r n at u re i s s t i l l a my s t e r y. So observers should always be on the lookout for such anomalous sightings. Note that balloons and artifi cial satellites drift quickly over the face of the Sun, while the dark objects that have been seen move slowly, much like the planets them- selves. And here again, of course, a proper solar fi lter is required when observing transits, whatever their source! One last area of interest concerning the Sun is that of solar eclipses , in which the Earth passes through the Moon’s narrow shadow-cone. These may be partial, total, or annular (with a ring of light still surrounding the Moon at totality ) in nature. It’s the total solar eclipse that’s without question nature’s grandest spec- tacle, and which brings with it so many exciting events, all happening within the precious few minutes of totality. These include the sudden visibility of the Sun’s delicate but magnifi cent corona , scarlet prominences dancing along its limb, and the well-known “diamond-ring” effect. There’s also the dramatic turning of day- light into darkness, the planets and brighter stars making their appearance, and a sudden drop in air temperature as the Sun’s light is extinguished. Except within the narrow interval of totality itself, solar fi lters are absolutely essential for safely viewing an eclipse – whether with the unaided eye, with binoculars (which typi- cally provide the best view), or through a telescope itself. Moon At an average distance from us of 239,000 miles, our lovely satellite is the nearest of all celestial bodies (with the exception of “Earth-grazing” asteroids!). And as such, it offers so many varied, fantastic things to see – even in a pair of binocu- lars. Aside from the obvious dark lunar “seas” (or maria ) and bright lunar high- land areas, there are majestic mountain ranges, vast walled plains, craters, craterlets, pits, domes, rilles, clefts, faults, and rays. As the Moon advances through its monthly phases , the interplay of light and shadow across this alien landscape is ever-changing, not only from hour to hour but from minute to minute. Many observers assume that when a given phase, such as fi rst quarter (or half-full), repeats itself each month, its features will look exactly the same. Yet, owing to the subtleties of orbital dynamics, the Moon does not present the exact same appearance for another seven years! With the exception of the bright lunar rays, which are most prominent when the Moon is full, surface features are best seen along the ever-advancing terminator – the dividing line between night and day. Here, sunlight coming in at a very low, glancing angle casts long, dra- matic shadows across the landscape, greatly exaggerating vertical relief. The Moon is perhaps most striking when around fi rst or last quarter. One of the most fascinating – and controversial – aspects of viewing the Moon is the subject of transient lunar phenomena or TLPs. Ever since the invention of"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 110 the telescope, both amateur and professional astronomers have reported seeing fl ashes, obscurations, colorations – and even moving lights on its surface! These have been attributed to everything from an over-active imagination to atmo- spheric refraction, outgassing of sub-surface water, volcanic activity, and mete- orite impacts. A classic example (which I have witnessed myself) involving the crater Plato is the slow disappearance of craterlets from one end of its dark fl oor across to the other side, and then their equally slow reappearance in reverse order – all over a period of just a few hours. Another apparently active area is the crater Aristarchus, where reddish glows have frequently been seen – by everyone from Sir William Herschel to orbiting Apollo astronauts. The key word here is “watchfulness” whenever you’re observing the Moon! As our satellite moves continuously eastward around the sky in its orbit (by roughly its own diameter each hour), it occasionally passes in front of planets, asteroids, stars, and various deep-sky objects such as star clusters, resulting in Figure 11.5. The Moon seen near its half-full phase, imaged through an 11-inch Schmidt–Cassegrain catadioptric. A few days on either side of the quarters is the best time to view surface features such as craters, mountains, and valleys. It’s then that sunlight comes in at a glancing angle, casting long dramatic shadows that exaggerate vertical relief (especially along the terminator, or dividing line between day and night on the Moon). Here’s a fascinating alien world right up close, to explore with binoculars and telescopes of all sizes!

The disappearance and reappearance of these objects can be quite dramatic – especially for the planets, where the rings of Saturn or the satellites of Jupiter can be seen being gobbled up and swallowed by this huge orb. In the case of stars, they instantly snap off and then later back on, like someone fl ipping a light switch. (For some close double stars, this will happen in steps, with fi rst one star being occulted and then the other.) One of the most spectacular sights here is the Moon passing in front of a bright star cluster such as the Pleiades or Hyades; at such times you can not only watch it ponderously moving through space (especially when its dark part is faintly illuminated by earthshine ), but also see it seemingly suspended three-dimensionally against a backdrop of more distant stars! Precise timing of occultations provides valuable information on such topics as the profi le of the lunar limb, the Moon’s orbital position and motions and, in the case of asteroids, their sizes and shapes. Especially dramatic are grazing occulta- tions , where objects are seen going in and out of valleys and behind mountains at the edge of the Moon. Adding to the fun is a slow “rocking” or “nodding” of the Moon in both longitude and latitude known as libration (which allows us to see some of its back side, or a total of 59% of the entire Moon). As a result, features on its edge are constantly changing their aspect to us. Among others, the US- based International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA) collects and analyses observations of lunar occultations. It can be reached at www.occultations.org. Among other important organizations that collect all types of observations of the Moon (as well as those of the planets and other Solar System objects) by amateur astronomers are the historic British Astronomical Association (BAA) and the US-based Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO). They can be contacted at www.britastro.org (or by e-mail at offi ce@britastro.com) and www. lpl.arizona.edu/alpo, respectively. Two other areas of lunar observing deserve mention, each having aesthetic rather than scientifi c value. One is that of lunar eclipses , in which the Moon passes through the inner and/or outer parts of the Earth’s long cone-shaped shadow – turning pink, copper, orange, rose, or even dull- or blood-red due to light being refracted by the Earth’s atmosphere into the shadow. Here again, the slow con- tinuous motion of the Moon eastward through the shadow is strikingly obvious even in binoculars. Note also that the shadow of the Earth projected onto the Moon is curved during all phases of the eclipse – vivid proof (known even to the ancients) that our planet is round! The other area is that of conjunctions – or the close coming together in the sky – of the Moon with the brighter stars and, especially, brilliant planets such as Venus or Jupiter. A typical sight is the lovely crescent Moon hovering over the western horizon at dusk (or over the eastern horizon at dawn), its dark portion beautifully illuminated by earthshine and accompanied by one or more brilliant planets and/or stars. Such gatherings are very striking, especially viewed in binoculars and rich-fi eld telescopes (RFTs). On occasion, both the Moon itself and a planet or bright star can be encompassed within the same low-power eyepiece fi eld of standard telescopes, offering a stun- ning contrast between different kinds of celestial objects. There’s no greater pleasure than embarking on a nightly telescopic “sightseeing tour” of the Moon’s surface features through a small telescope, using a good lunar map to guide you. Wide-angle, low-power views make our satellite seem"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 112 suspended in space, while high-power ones give the strong impression of hanging in lunar orbit! Being an extended object and so bright, the Moon takes high magnifi cation well, given good seeing conditions. Dividing the distance of the Moon by the power used will tell you how far away it appears in the eyepiece. Thus, a magnifi cation of 240 × will seemingly bring it to within 1,000 miles at its average distance from us. The lunar detail visible in a good 6-inch aperture tele- scope (of any type) at this power is simply staggering! Sky Publishing offers several excellent lunar maps that are ideal for such a sightseeing tour. Note here that if you are using a star diagonal (which is nearly always the case) on a refrac- tor, Cassegrain-style refl ector, or catadioptric telescope, a traditional inverted lunar map will be all but impossible to compare with the real Moon, because of the mirror image produced by the diagonal. Sky Publishing also offers lunar maps that compensate for this. On-line and printed copies of their latest catalog (which contains many other valuable observing guides and references) can be obtained at www.skyandtelescope.com. Two other excellent lunar works are Atlas of the Moon by Antonin Rukl and The Modern Moon: A Personal View by Charles Wood. The latter author is also originator of the popular Lunar 100 Card , which lists the top lunar sights in order of increasing diffi culty on one side and has an identifying map of the Moon on the other. All three of these observing aides are by Sky Publishing (2004). Planets We begin with the elusive planet Mercury , closest of them all to the Sun. Like the Moon, this tiny orb goes through phases , never appearing larger than about 7 arc-seconds in apparent size when best placed for viewing. This occurs at its greatest elongations east (in the evening sky) or west (in the morning sky) of the Sun, at which time it appears half-illuminated. A 3-inch scope at 100 × will show the phases and its tiny pinkish disk, while 200 × or more in 6-inch and larger apertures reveals hints of subtle surface markings. Unfortunately Mercury never strays far from the Sun and so is always fairly low above the horizon, where its image is often degraded by the atmospheric turbulence and haze typically found there. For this reason, it is best observed in broad daylight when it’s much higher in the sky. But fi nding it then can present something of a problem without the use of precision setting circles – especially with the dazzling Sun so dangerously close by. Go-To or GPS-equipped scopes that have been previously aligned on stars at night and not moved should be able to fi nd it readily and safely using their databases. Next in order of distance from the Sun is Ve nu s , the radiant “Evening/Morning Star” and brightest of all the planets – and indeed of all celestial objects aside from the Sun and Moon. Like Mercury, it goes through phases , from full when on the opposite side of the Sun from us to a big crescent when passing between it and us. At such times, its minimum distance from us is some 25,000,000 miles – signifi cantly closer than Mars or any other planet ever approaches. Its crescent then spans over 60 arc-seconds in apparent size and can be seen in"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Solar System Observing 113 10 × 50 binoculars. Atmospheric extensions of the cusps of the crescent into the nighttime side can also sometimes be seen around this time. At its greatest elon- gations east and west of the Sun when half-illuminated, it averages 24 arc-seconds across. Although Venus is perpetually shrouded in dense clouds, subtle shadings (including an elusive atmospheric radial “s poke system ” that’s sometimes glimpsed) and terminator irregularities can be seen on occasion in telescopes as small as a 4-inch glass. Especially fascinating are the ashen light and the phase anomaly . The former is an occasional apparent illumination of the dark side seen when Venus is in the crescent phase, which has been attributed to possible intense auroral activity. The latter is the strange fact that when Venus reaches its pre- dicted half-full phase (or dichotomy ) as seen from Earth, the terminator is not straight, as it should be. Instead, this occurs several weeks earlier than predicted for evening elongations and several weeks later for morning ones. Sometimes referred to as the Schröter effect after its discoverer, its exact cause is unknown. As with Mercury, observations are best made in daylight, when not only is the planet higher above the horizon, but also the sky background reduces the intense glare of the planet as normally seen at night. Another useful technique here is to observe Venus in the evening or morning twilight, when contrast with the illu- minated sky also helps reduce glare and improve image quality. Continuing to move outward from the Sun we fi nd Mars , the famed “Red Planet” (it’s actually orange!) of mythology, fi ction, and science, once believed to be an abode of intelligent life. At its oppositions every 26 months, it can come as close to us as 34,000,000 miles and appear as large as 25 seconds of arc in appar- ent size. At such times, a magnifi cation of about 75 × makes it look as big in tele- scopes as does the Moon to the unaided eye! Other than at opposition the planet can be a disappointing sight, as it shrinks to well under 10 arc-seconds in size. But during its close approaches, many fascinating features can be seen – espe- cially in 8-inch and larger telescopes. 14.7” MAX. DIA. MIN.

Mars has two well- known but very tiny satellites , Phobos and Deimos. Shining dimly at about 11 th magnitude and rapidly orbiting close to the planet, they require a 10-inch tele- scope to be seen, in addition to excellent seeing and transparency, owing to the glare from Mars itself. (Some observers place the planet behind an occulting bar to hide it while looking for the moons.) The “Giant Planet” Jupiter is the most dynamic and exciting object in the Solar System for most observers. At its favorable oppositions, it comes to within 365,000,000 miles of us and its disk grows to as large as 50 arc-seconds in size, making the planet obviously non-stellar even in 7 × or 10 × binoculars. Among the features to be seen here with just a 3-inch telescope at 75 × to 100 × are its polar fl attening or elliptical shape (due to its rapid rotation of less than 10 hours, which is obvious at the eyepiece as features transit the planet’s central meridian), colorful dark belts or bands and bright zones , the limb and polar darkening , snake-like festoons and cell-like ovals , the famed Great Red Spot (which currently Figure 11.7.

These jewel-like moons are visible in steadily held binoculars (there are even a number of naked-eye sightings in the literature!) and can be seen changing position from night to night as they dance about the planet. Even a 4-inch tele- scope at 100 × on nights of steady seeing will show that the moons are “non- stellar” in appearance, having tiny disks (on which markings have been glimpsed with large amateur scopes). And here we truly have a “three-ring circus” – or actually a four-ring, since there are four satellites! Perhaps most spectacular are the eclipse disappearances and reappearances, as the orbiting moons move into or leave Jupiter’s huge invisible shadow. Io, being the innermost and fastest- moving of them, requires only a minute or so to fade and then to brighten again an hour or two later, while the slower-moving outermost two moons take a good fi ve minutes to do so. It’s an indescribable thrill to see one of these satellites dis- appear or reappear right at the time predicted! There are also the occultation disappearances and reappearances, as the moons pass behind and then exit the planet’s disk. Another set of phenomena are the transits both of the moons them- selves across the face of Jupiter and of their ink-black shadows cast on the cloud- tops. And as if that’s not enough action, every six years as the Earth passes through the plane of Jupiter’s orbit, the moons themselves can eclipse and occult each other in a thrilling series of mutual satellite phenomena ! Times for all of the foregoing events are given monthly in Sky & Telescope magazine and also on its web site.

At its oppositions, this stunning object passes to within about 750,000,000 miles of us and subtends an apparent size across the rings of some 50 arc-seconds (about the same apparent size as Jupiter at opposition), while the ball of the planet appears about 20 arc-seconds in size. Just 25 × on a 2-inch glass shows the disk and rings, looking like some exquisite piece of cosmic jewelry, while the view in 12- to 14- inch apertures at 200 × or more leaves one gasping for breath in astonishment! (The planet looks egg-shaped in 10 × 50 and larger binoculars.) These razor-sharp rings are made up of billions of chunks of ice and rock orbiting Saturn. There are actually many rings, the most obvious being the broad middle B ring and – sepa- rated from it by the black Cassini Division – the narrower outer A ring. There’s also the dusky inner C ring, most obvious as a shading where it crosses the ball of the planet. The rings cast their shadows on the planet’s cloud-tops and the planet casts its shadow on the rings behind it. Other features to note are the polar and limb darkening and the obvious polar fl attening of the planet due to its rapid rotation of just over 10 hours at t he equator. Tra nsient white spots are occasionally seen in the atmosphere. On rare occasions occultations of stars by the rings and planet have been observed, one of the most spectacular of recent times being that of 5 th -magnitude 28 Sagittarii in July of 1989. At the time of writing, Saturn is known to have some 50 satellites , at least four or fi ve of which can be seen in a 6- inch glass. Titan, the largest, is visible in large binoculars and several others can be glimpsed in a 4-inch. From one year to another, Saturn’s rings noticeably change their inclination or tilt towards us. Every 15 years, the Earth passes across the ring plane, at which time the rings disappear from our view for several weeks in amateur scopes – and for several hours in observatory instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope. (The rings are estimated to be less than 100 feet thick!) For a year or so before and after these edgewise events (the next of which will occur in September of 2009), the moons can be seen “threading the rings” like beads on a string! It’s also near these times of ring crossings that Saturn’s moons go through phenomena similar to those of the satellites of Jupiter, as dis- cussed above.

Reaching magnitude 5.5 when at opposition, it’s just visible to the unaided eye; you can see it easily in binoculars and follow its slow orbital motion among the stars. Its tiny greenish disk (only 4 arc-seconds in size) is obvious in a 4- or 5-inch glass at 100 × on a steady night but is virtually featureless in amateur telescopes. Its retinue of more than 20 dim moons (including its two largest ones, Titania and Oberon) require large telescopes to glimpse visually, although several of the brighter ones have been imaged in apertures as small as 8 inches. Uranus’ extremely faint and narrow ring system has only been imaged by spacecraft. Neptune at 8 th magnitude is visible in binoculars as a star-like object, while 5- inch and larger telescopes at 150 × will show its tiny bluish disk just 2.4 arc- seconds in apparent size. Its largest moon, Triton, has been glimpsed visually in large amateur instruments, but the remaining dozen or so currently known, as well as its ultra-faint ring system, all lie beyond backyard telescopes.

Its largest moon Charon lies less than an arc-second from the planet and has never been seen visually in any telescope. The real thrill in observing the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto with your telescope is simply being able to look upon these remote and mysterious worlds lurking in the outer Solar System from across billions of miles of interplanetary space. Comets Another traditional fi eld of observational astronomy in which amateurs have done outstanding work in the past is searching for and monitoring comets – using everything from the unaided eye and binoculars to large backyard telescopes. The real lure here, of course, is the chance to achieve astronomical fame by dis- covering a new comet and having your name attached to it! Some noted observers such as Leslie Peltier, David Levy, and William Bradford have discovered dozens of them, while others have found only one – but perhaps one so spectacular that it and its discoverer became world-famous. These typi- cally have been the result of purposeful and methodical sweeping of the sky with binoculars and wide-fi eld telescopes. But there have also been totally accidental discoveries, as well as several by the same observer within a night or two of each other! Today, however, sophisticated professional, wide-angle survey telescopes equipped with CCD “eyes” (designed for patrolling the sky for Near-Earth Aster- oids – see below) are making most of the fi nds as a byproduct of their main program. Even so, it’s believed that many comets are still missed as they enter the inner Solar System, so opportunities do present themselves for their visual discovery by amateurs. Should you believe you may have found a new comet, you must do the following. First, using a detailed star atlas (see Chapter 13) carefully check the starfi eld it lies in for deep-sky objects posing as comets. Second, using the Sky & Telescope web site, make sure that it’s not an already known new or returning comet. Third, wait at least 15 to 30 minutes to make sure that the object is actually moving – something comets must do! If your suspected comet passes these tests, note its position on the atlas, the direction it’s moving, and its apparent brightness (using surrounding stars of known magnitude defocused to match its appearance). Then immediately report your discovery to the International Astronomical Union’s Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, located in the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138. Most discoveries of comets and other transient astronomical objects/events today are usually communicated by e-mail to cbat@cfa.harvard.edu rather than by tele- gram. (The IAU itself is headquartered in Paris; its offi cial web site can be found at www.iau.org.) A good primer for would-be comet hunters, as well as a compre- hensive text covering all aspects of comets (including photographic and electronic imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and even orbit calculation using computers) is Observing Comets by Gerald North and Nick James (Springer, 2003)."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 122 It’s estimated that there may be more than a million minor planets or asteroids larger than a mile across orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were the fi rst four to be discovered (which was done visually with telescopes). Of these, only Vesta becomes bright enough (magnitude 5.5) to be visible with the unaided eye. But hundreds can be seen in binoculars and literally thousands in backyard telescopes. Following their slow movement across the background starfi eld from night to night constitutes their chief attraction to casual observers. However, most are not round and they change in brightness as they spin, so their rotational periods can be determined by making continuous magnitude estimates (or measurements if done electronically). And as mentioned above when discussing occultations by the Moon, an indication of their shapes can also be obtained by recording the precise times of their disappearances and reappearances from the edge of our satellite. There are even some amateurs who have joined the search by professional planetary astronomers for threatening Near-Earth Asteroids (or NEAs), more than a thousand of which are known to cross the Earth’s orbit. This includes several that have actually passed between the Earth and the Moon in near misses! The clearing house for asteroid discover- ies and observations is the IAU’s Minor Planet Center, also located at the Harvard– Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Asteroids “Shooting stars” may not seem to be a class of object that would come under the topic of using telescopes and binoculars. But, in fact, meteors are often seen unexpectedly fl ashing through the eyepiece fi elds of such glasses – typically sending a rush of surprise and excitement (especially in the case of bright ones!) through the unsuspecting observer. Traditionally, naked-eye studies of meteors have focused on counting hourly rates, and this applies equally to those seen through optical instruments. Keeping track of their numbers o ver a given inter- val of time is normally a very casual program that can be done while conducting other observations. But during one of the major annual showers such as the Perseids or the Geminids, the eyepiece fi eld may be fl ooded with faint streaks of light – especially in large-aperture, wide-fi eld telescopes like Dobsonian refl ec- tors. Most of these typically lie near the limit of vision, but on occasion a bright naked-eye meteor (and its train) may actually pass across your view. Talk about being surprised and thrilled! There are two main organizations collecting meteor observations by amateur astronomers. One is the American Meteor Society (AMS), whose web site address is www.amsmeteors.org. The other is the Interna- tional Meteor Organization (IMO), which can be reached at www.imo.net. Before moving on, it should be mentioned here that one of the standard classic references to observing all of the various objects discussed above is Observational Astronomy for Amateurs by J.B. Sidgwick. Together with his companion volume, Meteors"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Solar System Observing 123 the Amateur Astronomer’s Handbook , they provide an authoritative and compre- hensive guide to visual Solar System (as well as stellar) astronomy for serious amateurs that, while somewhat dated, remains very valuable. Both were reprinted by Dover Publications in 1980 from the 1971 Faber & Faber third edition. And while they have since been updated and reissued several times under revised titles, the original editions of Sir Patrick Moore’s two classics, Guide to the Moon and Guide to the Planets from the early 1950s, provide charming and nostalgic overviews of their subjects. Dating from a time when the Moon and planets were still magical and mysterious places for amateur astronomers to explore in their telescopic spaceships, they are simply “must” reading for cloudy nights – if only you can manage to fi nd copies! Artifi cial Satellites Just as meteors seem unlikely telescopic targets, so too do artifi cial satellites . The wide fi elds of view and rapid pointing capability of binoculars have long been used to follow satellites across the sky. Their frequent variation in brightness due to spinning (especially in the case of the solar panels on the Iridium satellites, which can catch the sunlight and cause them to fl ash brighter than Venus for a few seconds!) and their slow fading as they pass into the Earth’s shadow-cone are things to watch for using both binoculars and the unaided eye itself. But there are so many of these objects that there’s rarely a night when at least several satel- lites don’t also pass through the eyepiece fi eld of a telescope during an observing session (sometimes several in rapid succession!), no matter where it’s pointed in the sky. Undoubtedly the most spectacular of them all is the International Space Station (or ISS) – especially when the Space Shuttle is docked alongside it. If they happen to pass through the eyepiece, their characteristic shapes are quite obvious even though the view lasts only a second or so. The two craft have even been seen silhouetted against the Moon (and the Sun)! And they have also been imaged by amateurs, both together and apart, using telescopes on special tracking mount- ings designed to follow their rapid orbital motions. I am continually amazed at how often a satellite will pass directly over prominent deep-sky objects such as the Ring Nebula, the Hercules Cluster, or the Andromeda Galaxy. While such passes are defi nitely an unwelcome annoyance to astroimagers, they are thrilling sights to visual observers. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) offers a number of Internet sites that provide satellite predictions for those interested in viewing these hurtling man-made moons.

However, here we reserve that category for such remote denizens of space as star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, which are covered as a separate class in Chapter 13. Data to help in observing many of the objects mentioned in both chapters will be found in the Showpiece Roster in Appendix 3, and also in the various star atlases and references mentioned in the text itself. Before proceeding, I should like to share with you a quote from Charles Edward Barns’ long-out-of-print classic, 1001 Celestial Wonders . Its poetic mandate is appropriate for all classes of objects viewed by stargazers, but especially so for the wonders discussed in this and the following chapter: Let me learn all that is known of them, Love them for the joy of loving, For, as a traveler in far countries Brings back only what he takes, So shall the scope of my foreknowledge Measure the depth of their profi t and charm to me. We begin with single suns, and in particular the very brightest stars – those having an apparent visual magnitude of + 1.5 or brighter. They are members of the so-called “First-Magnitude Club,” and there are 23 such luminaries in this exclusive group scattered over the entire sky. They range from dazzling Sirius ( α Canis Majoris) at − 1.4 (the brightest of all stars after the Sun itself) to Adhara Stellar System Observing First-Magnitude and Highly Tinted Single Stars 125"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 126 ( ε Canis Majoris) at + 1.5. Of these, 16 are visible from mid-northern latitudes – or 17 if we count Canopus ( α Carinae), which is the second-brightest star at magni- tude − 0.6 and is visible from Florida and Texas. Aside from a very few of the fi rst-magnitude stars that happen also to be attrac- tive visual double or multiple systems, their principal charm lies in their lovely heavenly hues. As a class, these stellar jewels are bright enough for their colors to be perceived directly even with the unaided eye, while binoculars or small telescopes focus more than enough photons onto the retina to make their hues unmistakable even to beginning observers. If you think all stars are simply white, just compare the color of ruddy Betelgeuse ( α Orionis) with that of bluish Rigel ( β Orionis) in the well-known winter constellation of Orion – or the blue-white hue of Vega ( α Lyrae) with that of golden Arcturus ( α Bootis) in the summer sky! As J.D. Steele pointed out over a century ago, “Every tint that blooms in the fl owers of Summer, fl ames out in the stars at night.” For me, one of the great joys of leisurely stargazing is to go outdoors after sunset on a clear night, with binoculars in hand, and watch these colorful lumi- naries slowly make their appearance as the sky darkens. It was surely this simple activity that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (himself a stargazer) had in mind when he penned: Silently one by one, in the infi nite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels. Another aspect of observing the brightest stars that’s directly related to their perceived colors concerns their spectral types (both characteristics being deter- mined by the temperature of the star’s atmosphere). Using an eyepiece star spectroscope (see Chapter 7) on a telescope of 4-inch or more in aperture, it’s possible to view the dark absorption lines and bands (and in some cases, emission lines if present) clearly enough to distinguish the various spectral classes. The familiar spectral sequence runs from types O, B, and A at the hot end, through warm F and G types, to K, M, R, N, and S cool ones – all relatively speaking, of course!). The cooler a star is, generally the more absorption lines that will be visible, and in the very coolest stars entire bands will be seen. (Readers interested in learning more about spectroscopes and stellar spectroscopy should consult Mike Inglis’ excellent Observer’s Guide to Stellar Evolution , Springer-Verlag, 2003.) It turns out that some of the most highly tinted stars in the sky are not among the brightest ones but rather lie near or below naked-eye visibility because of their distances. Among the more famous of these are Herschel’s Garnet Star ( μ Cephei), La Superba (Y Canum Venaticorum), and Hind’s Crimson Star (R Leporis). These are all pulsating red supergiant suns, slowly changing in bright- ness over time, like colossal cosmic beating hearts! (See the section on variable stars later in this chapter.) While some of these ruby gems can be seen in binocu- lars, a 3- to 6-inch telescope shows many more of them scattered about the sky. One of the reddest stars to be found is T Lyrae, located near Vega in Lyra and set against the rich backdrop of the summer Milky Way.

In her classic work of a century ago, The Friendly Stars , Martha Evans Martin tells us that “The stars we love best are the ones into whose faces we can look for an hour at a time, if our fancy so leads us.” As a class, the stars we’ve discussed in this section provide perfect opportunities for doing just that. Some of the most attractive of these stellar gems are listed in the Showpiece Roster in Appendix 3. Double and Multiple Stars We begin here by defi ning exactly what double and multiple stars are: two or more suns placed in close proximity to each other in the sky as seen with the unaided eye, binoculars, and/or especially telescopes. With the exception of stars that just happen to lie along the same line of sight but are actually far apart in space (known as optical doubles ), these objects are physically (gravitationally) bound together as a system. In some cases, they are separated suffi ciently to be simply drifting through space together as common-proper-motion pairs, while in others they are orbiting around the common center of gravity of the system as a true binary . There are many types of binaries, the actual classifi cation depending on how close together the components are and what type of instrumentation is required to see them. Of primary interest to amateur astronomers are the visual binaries , those resolvable in backyard telescopes. These have orbital periods ranging from a few decades to many centuries, and angular separations of anywhere from around half an arc-second to several minutes of arc. (Of the various other types, spectroscopic and interferometric binaries typically have much shorter orbital periods – in some cases, just hours !) Throughout this section, the term “double star” is taken to mean both visual double and multiple systems. Double stars are the tinted jewels and waltzing couples of the night sky. Their truly amazing profusion and seemingly infi nite variety of colors, brightness, separations, and component confi gurations make them ever-fascinating as both objects of study and targets for leisurely exploration with the telescope. Astrono- mers estimate that at least 80 percent of the stellar population exists as pairs and multiple groupings. Abounding among the naked-eye stars, they are available to even the smallest of instruments for viewing on all but the worst of nights – even in bright moonlight, and through haze and heavy light pollution. Literally thou- sands of them lie within reach of even a 2- or 3-inch glass! After the Moon and planets, double stars are typically the next target for the beginning stargazer before jumping into the fainter and more distant realm of star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. And indeed they should be, for not only are they bright and easily found, but these are truly exciting objects in themselves. The vivid hues of bright, contrasting pairs are sights never to be forgotten. There’s the magnifi cent topaz and sapphire Albireo ( β Cygni), the vivid orange and aqua- marine-blue of Almach ( γ Andromedae), and the red and green of Rasalgethi ( α Herculis).

And there are stunning multiple systems such as the Double-Double ( ε Lyrae), the Trapezium ( θ 1 Orionis), and Herschel’s Wonder Star ( β Monocerotis). As in other areas of amateur astronomy, part of the joy of observing double stars is in sharing views of these lovely objects with others. Their unsuspected beauty typically brings gasps of astonishment and delight from Figure 12.1.

Many double-star afi cionados can trace their lifelong love affair with these stellar combos to just such an encounter. Seeing sights such as those listed above often draws the observer into deeper study of double stars. Some people, desiring to see as many of them as possible, will embark on a “sightseeing tour” of the night sky using lists like those given in Appendix 3, in the references below, and at the end of this chapter. Others, wanting to capture these sights permanently, may do so by drawing what they see at the eyepiece – or by attempting to image it photographically or elec- tronically using CCD or video cameras. Given time and patience, the orbital motions of bright pairs such as Porrima ( γ Virginis), ξ Ursae Majoris, and Castor itself become evident over a period of years. The sight of two distant suns slowly dancing about each other in the depths of interstellar space is a thrill quite beyond words! This may lead the observer to begin regular measurements of binary stars with a micrometer or other such device to follow their movements.

One is Double and Multiple Stars and How to Observe Them (Springer, 2005), which lists 500 pairs for explora- tion. The second is Celestial Harvest: 300-Plus Showpieces of the Heavens for Telescope Viewing & Contemplation (Dover, 2002). Nearly half of the objects described in it are striking double and multiple stars suitable for observing with telescopes in the 2- to 14-inch aperture range. Many spectacular pairs will also be found in the listing appearing in Appendix 3 of this book. For those seriously interested in measuring double stars (and thereby joining ranks with the few professionals working in this fi eld), Observing and Measuring Visual Double Stars (Springer, 2004) – edited by the Webb Society’s Bob Argyle – details everything an observer needs to know. Variable Stars, Novae, and Supernovae Variable stars are those whose light output varies with time, in periods that range from just minutes to several years. Most of these restless suns are red giants or supergiants, which pulsate not only in brightness but also in physical size. Some, like Betelgeuse, are found among the bright naked-eye stars, while others are at the limits of the largest amateur telescopes. It’s conservatively estimated by astronomers that at least 10% of all stars are variable in nature. Of the several dozen types that have been classifi ed, some of the more interest- ing variable stars for amateur observers are the following. Long-period variables are those whose light output changes over a period of months or years with amplitudes of at least several magnitudes. The prototype of this class is the red giant Mira ( ο Ceti). Called “The Wonderful” or the “Wonder Star” by the ancients who saw its obvious variability, it reaches nearly 2 nd magnitude at maximum and fades to well below 9 th magnitude (sometimes even as faint as 11 th ) at minimum over a period of about 330 days. Another well-known member of this class is R Leonis, or “Peltier’s Star” as some call it. This object varies between 4 th and 10 th magnitude over a period of 331 days, with its ruddy hue being obvious in binoculars in its brighter stages and remaining a lovely sight in a 6-inch telescope even at minimum light. (Many of the long- period variables display unmistakable and often striking red hues throughout their cycles.) The semi-regular variables somewhat resemble the Mira stars but have smaller ranges in brightness and irregular periods. Certainly the brightest example is the star Betelgeuse mentioned above (which is the only marked variable of any type among the 1 st -magnitude stars). It slowly and unpredictably varies in apparent luster from magnitude 0.4 to 1.3 in an approximate period of 5.7 years. Another specimen is the primary of the beautiful double star Rasalgethi ( α Herculis), which varies between 3 rd and 4 th magnitude in no defi nite or repeat- able cycle."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Stellar System Observing 133 There are also the really maverick irregular variables , which have small mag- nitude ranges and completely erratic periods; no such variable is obvious to the unaided eye. A class of major importance to astronomy and cosmology is that of the Cepheid variables , named after the prototype δ Cephei (itself a lovely double star). This sun varies in brightness from magnitude 3.5 to 4.4 in a precise period of 5.4 days, the change being obvious in binoculars and even to the unaided eye. These stars are sometimes referred to as regular variables because their light cycles are so constant and repeatable. It’s long been known that the greater the period of a Cepheid, the brighter it is in terms of intrinsic or true luminosity (using that of the Sun as a standard). Not only are Cepheids found within the general stellar population and star clusters, but they can also be seen (in large professional telescopes only!) in the nearer spiral galaxies. Comparing their intrinsic magni- tudes with their apparent magnitudes provides a valuable yardstick for determin- ing the distances to these objects. The eruptive variables are those that normally shine at a constant brightness and then suddenly without warning brighten up by many magnitudes. One of the best-known examples lies in the constellation Corona Borealis, or the Northern Crown. T Coronae Borealis (also known as the “Blaze Star”) usually hovers ETA AQUILAE –.4 DIFFERENCE OF MAGNITUDE 0 +.4 DAYS –2 0 2 4 6 Figure 12.5.

But in 1866, and again in 1946, it suddenly brightened to 2 nd magnitude, becoming an obvious naked-eye star at the edge of the Crown asterism. (Interestingly, at the other extreme is the star R Coronae Borealis, located close to T itself. It normally shines just above naked-eye visibility at magnitude 5.7. But in 1962, in 1972, and again in 1977 it disappeared from sight, dropping to nearly 15 th magnitude, leading to its popular name as the “Fade-Out Star” or “Reverse Nova.”) Three related groups of highly unstable suns are the cataclysmic variables , the fl are stars , and the dwarf novae . These objects hover at very faint magnitudes (t y pica l ly 14 th and below) most of the time, but then suddenly and unpredictably increase in brightness a hundredfold or more. One well-known, spectacular example is the star U Geminorum, which is usually found slumbering between 14 th and 15 th magnitude but frequently fl ares to as bright as 8 th in little more than 24 hours. Actual novae behave similarly but are much more violent, having mag- nitude increases of thousands of times when they “blow.” Some of these have rivaled the brightest stars in apparent brightness at maximum and remained visible to the eye for many months. Over the years, amateur astronomers have played a major role in the discovery of such stellar outbursts. Most sightings of these apparently “new” stars have been made with no equipment other than the unaided eye or binoculars – and an intimate familiarity with the star patterns of the various constellations. (Some of the fainter, more distant novae have also been discovered telescopically by alert visual observers.) The ultimate in cataclysmic stars are the supernovae . Here, if one occurs in our own Galaxy, a previously invisible sun suddenly within hours rises into the negative magnitudes, outshining every object in the sky except for the Sun and Moon (and in at least one case being bright enough to be seen in broad daylight!). Only fi ve have been seen in our Galaxy within recorded history (but they appear frequently in other galaxies, as discussed in the next chapter). The three most famous are Tycho’s Star of 1572, Kepler’s Star of 1604, and before them the Chinese “Guest Star” of 1054 that produced the Crab Nebula supernova remnant in Taurus. It’s now been over four centuries since the last supernova and most astronomers agree that we are long overdue for another one. An amateur astrono- mer like yourself, scanning the skies nightly, could well be the fi rst to see and report it to the world, thereby achieving – along with Tycho and Kepler – immor- tal fame. If you think you’ve spotted a nova (or even better, the next supernova!) on the rise, contact the International Astronomical Union’s alert hotline imme- diately to report it, using the information given in Chapter 11 on discovering comets. There’s also a fascinating class of variable stars that are not really variable at all! These are the eclipsing variables – also known as eclipsing binaries . As the latter name implies, the variations in brightness of these objects are due to eclipses caused by orbiting companions, rather than to pulsations of size and brightness within the stars themselves. The best-known example in the sky is Algol ( β Persei), the “Demon Star” (so named by the ancients, who saw it “winking” at them!). Every 2.9 days – as regular as clockwork – its brightness drops from magnitude 2.1 to 3.4. There are actually two minima. The primary drop that’s obvious to the naked eye occurs when a large, dim star in the system passes in front of and partially eclipses a smaller but brighter one; there’s also a much less"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Stellar System Observing 135 noticeable secondary eclipse half an orbit later as the bright star passes in front of the dim one, reducing its light slightly. The primary eclipse itself last 10 hours. As with other variable stars, Algol’s change in brightness can easily be followed by comparing its light to that of a nearby star of constant brightness – in this case 2 nd -magnitude Mirfark ( α Persei). Another naked-eye eclipser is β Lyrae, near the famed Ring Nebula in Lyra. Here the light varies continuously from magnitude 3.3 to 4.3 over 13 days because the huge, egg-shaped twin suns continually eclipse one another and are so tightly embraced that their outer atmospheres are nearly in contact. It’s truly amazing to think that when we look at stars like Algol or β Lyrae we’re actually witnessing the mutual revolution of two suns about each other from across the depths of interstellar space, using no instrument other than the human eye itself! And while these two are bright, naked-eye examples, many other fainter eclipsing systems lie within reach of binoculars and small telescopes. Variable stars can be viewed for pleasure, and/or observed more seriously with the hope of advancing our knowledge of them by making and submitting magnitude estimates of selected targets. This has traditionally been done by eye with binoculars or telescopes, estimating a star’s visual magnitude on a given date by comparing its brightness to that of surrounding stars of known and constant magnitude – typically to an accuracy of a few tenths of a magnitude. Professional astronomers, along with some advanced amateurs, use photoelectric photometers – precision instruments capable of measuring the brightness of stars to within a few hundredths or even thousandths of a magnitude. The US- based International Amateur–Professional Photoelectric Photometry Association (IAPPP) coordinates such cooperative work between the two levels of astro nomers and may be reached by contacting its director at douglas.s.hall@iapp.vanderbilt. edu. A recent development along these lines is the increasing use of CCD or video imaging to record the magnitudes of variable stars, as well as those of other celestial objects. (See Chapter 7 for more about these electronic devices.) Making magnitude estimates of variable stars is of no value to our science unless they are reported to a recognized agency for collection and analysis. One of the world’s premier organizations for such work is the American Association of Variable Star Observers (or AAVSO), based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1911 by William Tyler Olcott, author of Field Book of the Skies and other observing classics, it’s an international clearing house for the submission of variable-star observations by amateur astronomers. The Association provides its members with carefully prepared star charts of objects currently needing observation. Its database contains millions of magnitude estimates, and light curves of countless numbers of variables of all types, which are frequently con- sulted by professional astronomers working in this fi eld. It also coordinates the monitoring of unpredictable and unstable stars such as the cataclysmic vari- ables and dwarf novae for possible fl are-ups. The Association can be contacted at www.aavso.org or by e-mail to aavso@aavso.org. As mentioned above, positive sightings of outbursts should also be reported immediately to the International Astronomical Union’s discovery clearing house, since time is critical if transient events like these are to be studied by the professional observatories. An even older organization that also collects magnitude estimates for variable stars is the well-known British Astronomical Association (founded in 1890), already"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 136 mentioned in Chapter 11 in connection with reporting observations of Solar System objects. In addition to Norton’s Star Atlas and Sky Atlas 2000.0 , mentioned in the earlier discussion about double stars, there’s also The AAVSO Variable Star Atlas by C.E. Scovil (AAVSO, 1990), explicitly designed for fi nding and making magnitude estimates of variables. The standard professional compilation of variable stars is the General Catalogue of Variable Stars by P.N. Kholopov and B.V. Kukarkin. Published and regularly updated by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, this work is diffi cult to obtain other than in the research libraries of professional observatories. Norton’s has lists of over 500 variable stars accompanying its star maps, while Sky Catalogue 2000.0 Volume 2 contains data on more than 2,400 of them (those having maxima brighter than magnitude 9.5) plotted on the Atlas itself.

Though generally unre- lated, they both require very wide fi elds of view to be seen to advantage, giving binoculars and RFTs a defi nite edge over normal telescopes. Stellar associations are physical systems loosely bound by their mutual gravitation, much like star clusters themselves (see below) but covering many degrees of sky rather than many minutes of arc, and much less concentrated. One of the brightest, best- known, and most spectacular of these is the Alpha Persei Association – a radiant splash of stellar gems surrounding the 2 nd -magnitude star Mirfak in the constel- lation Perseus, visible in the skies of fall and winter. The view here in binoculars on a dark night is truly spectacular! The other type of loose gathering is known as an asterism . Asterisms are very distinctive patterns of stars that in most cases are physically unrelated – simply chance alignments similar to optical doubles. But what is probably the most famous asterism of them all turns out to be an actual association or moving cluster of stars as well. We’re speaking about none other than the Big Dipper. (Novice stargazers – and a few veteran ones as well! – often refer to the Dipper as a constellation. But in reality, it’s only part of a constellation – that of Ursa Major, the Great Bear of the sky. Appendix 2 gives a complete listing of the 88 offi cially recognized constellations.) Another huge and distinctive asterism is the Summer Triangle. It’s formed by the three brilliant blue-white luminaries Vega in Lyra, Deneb in Cygnus, and Altair in Aquila. (Cygnus itself contains the well- known Northern Cross asterism.)

Readily visible to the unaided eye on a dark moonless night, it’s a binocular wonder and a glorious sight in any and all telescopes. Star Clusters More compressed in size and richer in membership than associations are the open clusters , containing anywhere from a few dozen to many hundreds of stars – all gravitationally bound and moving through space together as a commune. Over a thousand are known, most of them lying near the plane of our Milky Way and therefore found mainly in the summer and winter skies, when our Galaxy rides high across the heavens. Some of the brightest of these so-called “galactic clusters” will be found in the famed list compiled by Charles Messier in the late 1700s known as the Messier Catalogue , containing 109 entries carrying the prefi x “M.” Many others are included in the monumental New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (NGC) published in 1888 by J.L.E. Dreyer – and also in its two subsequent Index Catalogue (IC) extensions. Together, these works list over 12,000 objects!

As with the Messier list, it contains 109 objects – but unlike it, the Caldwell list covers the entire visible sky all the way from the North to the South Celestial Pole. As with double stars, no two star clusters look exactly alike in appearance. They range from big, glittering stellar jewelboxes spanning several degrees, such as the famed Pleiades and Hyades star clusters in the constellation Taurus (best seen in binoculars and wide-fi eld telescopes because of their large apparent angular sizes), to magnifi cent sights well under a degree across such as the Wild Duck Cluster (M11) in Scutum and Lassell’s Delight (M35) in Gemini (which are at their radiant best in medium-aperture amateur telescopes).

Much larger concentrations of stars are found in the globular clusters . These glittering stellar beehives contain as many as a million individual suns. Of the 150 or so that are known, most reside in the vast galactic halo in the outer regions of our Galaxy, the center of which is located in the direction of the summer con- stellation Sagittarius.

For observing globulars of any size or brightness, nights having both good transparency and steady seeing give the best results in resolving these close-knit star-balls. (It should be pointed out here, however, that nights which are useless for looking at faint nebulae and dim galaxies because of haze, moonlight, or light pollution can still allow both open and globular clusters to come “punching through” owing to their stellar natures.) When gazing into the heart of a great cluster like one of the above, the mind is forcibly drawn to the possibility of other beings inhabiting the myriad planets that must surely exist there. The appearance of their night sky must be nothing short of astounding.

As another author, astronomer Chet Raymo, puts it, observing celestial objects is “50 percent vision and 50 percent imagination” – good advice for viewing wonders such as these. Just picture yourself “out there” among all those stars! Nebulae There are fi ve distinct types of nebulous clouds of gas and dust that the observer fi nds within our Galaxy – four of them luminous or shining, and one non- luminous or dark. First we examine the diffuse nebulae (also known as emission nebulae ), which are the actual birthplaces of the stars. These gossamer, glowing clouds of hydrogen gas line the spiral arms of our Galaxy, lying in or near the galactic plane. Of the hundreds that have been catalogued, the best-known and most striking for stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere is the magnifi cent Orion Nebula (M42/M43) of the winter sky. This huge, glowing, greenish mass spans more than a degree in size and is visible to the unaided eye as a misty-looking 4 th -magnitude star in Orion’s sword. Fascinating even in binoculars, it becomes ever-more entrancing as optical aperture increases. At its core lies the famed Trapezium multiple star, resolvable even in a 2-inch glass at 25 × and the brightest members of what is actually a star cluster in formation. Three other prominent objects of this class are the Lagoon Nebula (M8) with its embedded star cluster NGC 6530, the Trifi d Nebula (M20), and the Horseshoe/Omega/Swan Nebula (M17) – all lying near each other in the constellation Sagittarius. Southern Hemi- sphere observers have the awesome Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070), located within the Large Magellanic Cloud in the constellation Dorado. Even though it’s in another galaxy and lies at a distance of 170,000 light-years from us, it’s clearly visible to the unaided eye and is an impressive sight in binoculars. The view in even a small telescope is breathtaking. If this nebula were as close to us as is the Orion Nebula, it would span more than 30 degrees of the sky and shine with a total brightness three times that of Venus! A second and quite different-looking type of nebulosity is that of the planetary nebulae . While most of the 1,500 examples known lie in or near the Milky Way’s misty band, they can also be found scattered all over the sky. Representing the opposite end of stellar evolution from the diffuse nebulae, these fascinating and often eerie-looking balls and rings and shells of gas have been ejected by dying stars in the late stages of their lives. The name was coined by Sir William Herschel after fi nding a number of these objects during his famous surveys (or “sweeps”) of the sky that looked like the planet Uranus, which he had just recently dis- covered – a small, round, greenish-blue disk of high surface brightness as seen in the eyepiece of his various home-made, metal-mirrored refl ecting telescopes. (It’s the high surface brightness of planetaries compared with other nebulae that makes it possible to view them through light pollution, muggy skies, and bright moonlight.)

Some other favorites are Jupiter’s Ghost (NGC 3242) in Hydra, the Eight-Burst Nebula (NGC 3132) in Vela, the Eskimo/Clownface Nebula (NGC 2392) in Gemini, and the Cat’s Eye/Snail Nebula (NGC 6543) in Draco.

One of the more famous of these is Temple’s Nebula (NGC 1435), a tear-shaped feeble glow surrounding the star Merope in the Pleiades star cluster in Taurus. Although it was discovered with a 4-inch refractor, it’s not an easy object to glimpse. Part of the problem is that this is a winter object, and condensation from the observer’s breath onto the cold glass surfaces of eyepieces of ten tends to put haloes around all stars! In the typical high humidity of summer, eyepieces also tend to fog up when the eye is placed near them, resulting in the same effect. This is why many observers (myself included) fi nd the fall with its low humidity and moderate temperatures the best stargazing time of the year. Another noted refl ection nebula is the Witch’s Head Nebula (IC 2118) in Eridanus, just west of the brilliant star Rigel – itself in Orion and the source of illumination for the nebula’s faint glow. More than two degrees across in its longest dimension, it requires a very wide fi eld and a highly transparent night to be seen with certainty. As a class, these objects are visually disappointing and are not apt to be found on anyone’s list of personal deep-sky favorites! A fourth class of visible nebulosity is that of the supernova remnants . These are the remains of supernova outbursts within our Galaxy, which are very rare and only a few of which are visible in backyard telescopes. Without question the Figure 13.9.

This huge planetary is the death throes of an aged star shedding its outer layers into a celestial smoke-ring. Unlike its famed counterpart, the Ring Nebula in Lyra (M57 – perhaps the best-known of all planetaries), this is not an easy object to see visually. Although it has the highest total apparent brightness of its class (magnitude 6.5), its huge angular size (half that of the Moon) results in an extremely low “surface brightness.” Best viewed in low-power, wide- fi eld telescopes (RFTs), it can be glimpsed in binoculars on dark, transparent nights.

Originally classifi ed as a planetary, this is the expanding cloud of debris ejected by Supernova 1054 AD. Just detectable in 10 × 50 binoculars, a 2-inch glass shows its ghostly glow, and the view becomes ever more fascinating as aperture increases. In large Dobsonian refl ectors, the tattered edges of the expanding cloud can be glimpsed, as well as the neutron star/pulsar rapidly spinning (33 times a second!) at its heart. As every deep-sky observer is aware, this was the object that moti- vated comet-hunter Charles Messier to compile his famed catalogue of “comet impostors.” Few today remember his comets, but he has been immortalized through his listing of “nuisances”, as he referred to them. Another supernova remnant that is readily available to the stargazer is the huge Veil/Filamentary/Cirrus/Lacework Nebula (NGC 6960/6992–5) in Cygnus.

This is a good opportunity to mention light-pollution and nebula fi lters , which are being increasingly used by observers to combat bright skies and enhance the visibility of nebulosities. By isolating certain spectral lines at which these clouds glow, the sky background is suppressed and the nebula appears brighter than in the unfi ltered view. The Veil is an excellent target on which to try one of these devices, transforming it from a marginal wonder to a real showpiece of the deep sky. (Note here that nebula fi lters actually dim stars themselves, which do not shine at nebular wavelengths; so objects containing lots of stars – such as star clusters and galaxies –appear fainter as seen through such fi lters.) In viewing the remnants of exploding stars such as the Crab or Veil, keep in mind that you are seeing, as one writer so well expressed it, “The shards of a supernova; the spawn of minds to come.”!

These are the dark nebulae . Of the thousands that have been cataloged, the most prominent were found long ago by the legendary observer Edward Emerson Barnard and carry the designation “B.” The largest and most obvious of these are the huge dark clouds of dust lying between the spiral arms of our Galaxy. These can be seen along many parts of the Milky Way as obvious dark swaths largely vacant of stars on clear moonless nights – one of them is the amazing Great Rift that splits the Galaxy in two in the constellation Cygnus. There are smaller dark clouds such as the 7-degree-long Pipe Nebula (B 59, 65, 66, 67, and 78) and the 30-arc-minute-wide Barnard’s S-Nebula (B 72), both in the “dusty” constellation Ophiuchus. These big objects obviously require wide fi elds of view, being best seen in binoculars and RFTs. But dark nebulae scale all the way down in size to the tiny, speck-like Bok globules (which are really con- densing, non-luminous proto-stars) found silhouetted against many bright nebu- losities and requiring observatory-class telescopes to be seen visually. Figure 13.12. The famed, often-pictured Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33/IC 434) in Orion. Although striking photographically (as in this image made with a 108-mm apochromatic refractor), it’s among the most diffi cult of all deep-sky objects to see visually, requiring a dark transparent sky, a well-dark-adapted eye, and averted vision just to glimpse. Experienced observers have detected it with apertures as small as 5- or 6-inch, and report that a nebula fi lter enhances visibility of the tiny dark Horsehead silhouetted against the background nebulosity.

Measuring 7- by 5-degree across, this great black “hole in the heavens” (a term fi rst coined by Sir William Herschel for a void he found near the globular cluster M80 in Scorpius) is unmistakable. Ironically, it happens to lie right next to one of the brightest and most spectacular star group- ings in the entire sky – the glittering Jewel Box Cluster (NGC 4755). But the best- known and most-photographed dark nebula of them all is one that’s defi nitely not a naked-eye object! It’s the infamous Horsehead Nebula (B 33) in Orion – a tiny, dark protrusion 5-arc-minutes long that’s silhouetted against the faint glow of the emission nebula IC 434, which extends south of the star Alnitak ( ζ Orionis) in the Hunter’s belt. Visually, this is one of the most challenging objects of its kind in the entire heavens. Although it has been glimpsed with apertures as small as 5- inch (and reportedly even in 10 × 70 binoculars), if you hope to see it you will typically need at least an 8-inch telescope, a nebula fi lter (to enhance the emission nebulosity, thereby increasing contrast with the Horsehead), a dark transparent night, and a completely dark-adapted eye. While this appears to be everyone’s favorite dark nebula (solely from its photographic appearance), it – like the refl ec- tion nebulae – is unlikely to be found on many observers’ “hit lists.” Indeed, few of the showpiece rosters which the author has collected from around the world and from all time periods have ever included either of these types of non-lumi- nous denizens of the deep sky. And with good reason! Galaxies and Quasars We now come to the remote galaxies themselves. These colossal, spinning star- cities containing perhaps half a trillion suns range from large, bright, naked-eye objects to ultra-faint smudges of light at the limits of the world’s largest tele- scopes. Hundreds of billions of them exist within the observable universe, and tens of thousands lie within range of large backyard telescopes. And while rela- tively few are to be seen near the plane of the Milky Way because they are obscured by its clouds of stars and dust, great swarms of them are found all over the sky away from the Galaxy – especially near the galactic poles, where we’re looking out unobscured into deep space. Among the galaxies visible without optical aid (besides our own Milky Way, discussed below), the Great Spiral in Andromeda – or offi cially, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) – surely stands without equal for Northern Hemisphere observers. Clearly visible as an elongated glow on a dark night just northwest of the star ν Andromedae, it’s easily found by imagining a line from the star in the bottom right-hand corner of the Great Square of Pegasus (another asterism!) to the upper left-hand one and extending it by its own length. It’s been traced to more than 5 degrees (or 10 full-Moon diameters!) in extent using binoculars, and its star-like nucleus, nuclear bulge and disk, dust lanes and spiral arms are all visible through amateur telescopes, seen from across a distance of some 2,400,000 light-years.

Southern Hemisphere observers have two marvelous and obvious naked-eye galaxies gracing their sky. These are the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spanning the Dorado–Mensa border and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in Tucana. Lying within 20 degrees of the South Celestial Pole and just 22 degrees from each other, they appear like large, detached portions of the Milky Way and are quite bright – so much so that the LMC itself can be seen even in full moonlight! Visu- ally, the LMC spans some 6 degrees in extent and the SMC 3.5 degrees. Both are classifi ed as dwarf irregular galaxies and are satellites of our own Milky Way. As such, they are the very closest of all galaxies to us, the LMC being 170,000 and the SMC 200,000 light-years distant. Along with the Milky Way itself, as well as M31 and M33, they are members of the Local Group of galaxies containing some three dozen systems. Even a pair of binoculars will resolve the two Clouds into their individual stars, and telescopes reveal an amazing wonderland of deep-sky objects within them – many having their own individual NGC numbers.

Like double stars, galaxies often occur in pairs (and larger groupings), some of the more spectacular being M81/M82 in Ursa Major, and M65/M66 and M95/M96 in Leo. And just as stars form clusters, so too do galaxies. We’ve already mentioned the Local Group, but it is only part of a much larger assemblage known as the Virgo Cluster (sometimes referred to as the Coma–Virgo Cluster) containing thousands of galaxies. This exciting region of the sky is popularly known as the “Realm of the Nebulae” – a name dating back to a time before the galactic nature of these nebulous-looking objects was known.

There are places within the cluster where a wide fi eld of view will contain half-a-dozen or more of these remote star-cities – all softly glowing from across some 55,000,000 light-years of intergalactic space. Amazingly, the Virgo Cluster is itself part of a much larger structure known as the Local Supercluster containing tens of thousands of individual galaxies! Other huge clusters of galaxies are to be found around the sky; three visible in large amateur scopes (14-inch aperture and up) are the Coma, Hercules, and Perseus Galaxy Clusters, lying at distances of 350 to 500 million light-years from us. But the remotest denizens of deepest space are the famed quasars (or qu a si- stellar objects). Now believed to be caused by galactic mergers feeding an immense central black hole, resulting in the release of an incredible amount of energy, these bizarre objects give off as much light as hundreds of galaxies combined, making them visible from across vast distances. The “closest” and brightest of them all – and the fi rst one to be recognized – is known as 3C273 (its designa- tion in the third Cambridge catalogue of radio sources). Appearing like a dim 13 th -magnitude bluish star in the constellation Virgo, this object lies nearly 2 billion light-years from us – yet it is visible in 4- to 6-inch backyard telescopes!

One is the visual dis- covery of supernova outbursts in the brighter nearby spirals by amateur astrono- mers, some using telescopes as small as a 4-inch glass. And here the world’s record holder is Reverend Robert Evans of Australia, who has found some two dozen of them to date using his 10- and 16-inch refl ectors. Becoming intimately familiar with the appearance of a selected list of targets, and then checking them night after night, is sure to yield yet more discoveries by those who love staring at galaxies. If you believe you’ve found a supernova – a “star” that wasn’t there before, appearing in or near a galaxy – then, as for comets and ordinary novae, you should report it immediately to the International Astronomical Union’s Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 – or prefer- ably by e-mail to cbat@cfa.harvard.edu. A second important aspect of viewing galaxies is recognition of the fact that you are seeing the most distant objects in creation by means of light millions or even billions of years old. Your telescope is focusing archaic photons onto the retina of your eye that left these regions eons ago! (See the quotations and discus- sion about the “photon connection” in the next chapter.) Milky Way We have yet to mention the largest, brightest, and most magnifi cent galaxy in the sky – we’re speaking, of course, about our very own Milky Way galaxy! Indeed, this is surely the fi nest “deep-sky” object of any type. Since we are embedded in one of its spiral arms and since this colossal starry pinwheel circles the entire visible heavens, the instrument of choice here is the unaided human eye itself, followed by wide-angle binoculars and then telescopes (especially RFTs). Using any of these to survey its massed star-clouds – particularly in regions such as Cygnus, Scutum, and Sagittarius – on dark, transparent nights is truly an exhila- rating experience. With the eye alone, you get the defi nite feeling of being submersed within the Galaxy’s stars as it encompasses you. The brightest parts of the Milky Way are found in the summer sky, where we’re looking inward toward its core (whereas in winter we are looking out through a thinner stratum of stars to its edge). Two such areas stand out as superb binocular and telescopic sights. One is the Scutum Star Cloud in the constellation of the same name. Also referred to as the “Gem of the Milky Way” and “Downtown Milky Way,” this 12- by 9-degree expanse of the heavens is a binocular and telescopic wonderland. The other area is the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, a 2- by 1-degree piece of sky near the galactic center in Sagittarius that seemingly holds infi nite numbers of starry pinpoints. Slowly sweeping across either of these amazing star-clouds on dark nights with a 4- or 6-inch RFT at 15 × to 25 × is truly an experience never to be forgotten. Also available for exploration is the much bigger Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, which looks to the unaided eye like steam escaping from the spout of the well- known Teapot asterism of Sagittarius."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Deep-Sky Observing 155 But there’s more excitement to share about the Milky Way, and it involves the very striking and surprising illusion of perceiving depth in its structure! In viewing the great billowy star-clouds of rich regions such as Sagittarius, Scutum, and Cygnus with the unaided eye and binoculars, be alert for an amazing 3-D effect that can occur without warning. As the eye–brain combination makes the association that the fainter stars you’re seeing lie further away from you than do the brighter ones – that you’re actually looking at layer upon layer of stars – the Milky Way can suddenly jump right out of the sky at you as the three- dimensional starry pinwheel it really is! Figure 13.16. Milky Way star-clouds in Cygnus, as photographed with a 300-mm f/2.8 camera centered on the North America Nebula (NGC 7000).

Navigating the Great Beyond The fact that this is one of the longest chapters in this book indicates both the extent of the fi eld of deep-sky observing and its wide popularity with today’s amateur astronomer. And so it is that the recommended references to this activity"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 156 in what follows are much more extensive than those given in any previous chapter. An immediate and useful one is the Showpiece Roster that appears in Appendix 3. It offers outstanding specimens of some of the fi nest fi rst-magnitude and highly tinted stars, double and multiple systems, stellar associations and asterisms, open and globular star clusters, diffuse and planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and galaxies for viewing with backyard telescopes in the 2- to 14-inch aperture range. But here already there arises the crucial matter of fi nding your way around the sky to locate these wonders. Even if you are using mechanical or digital setting circles – or the more modern Go-To or GPS technology – to “navigate” your tele- scope, you will need to know at least where the brighter stars are, if for no other reason than when providing initial alignment for your telescope’s computer. And as I have previously indicated, the real fun of leisurely stargazing (at least for many of us purists) is traditional “star-hopping” to targets – which means using a good star atlas. While standbys such as Norton’s Star Atlas , The Cambridge Star Atlas , and the Bright Star Atlas are fi ne for general navigation of the heavens, successful star-hopping to the sky’s fain ter denizens requires a more detailed celestial roadmap – one showing stars to at least as faint as 8 th magnitude, or about the limit of most fi nders and binoculars. While there are several highly detailed, multi-volume atlases readily available today (such as Uranometria 2000.0 , which plots over 280,000 stars to magnitude 9.75 and shows more than 30,000 non-stellar objects), an ideal one for deep-sky observers is Sky Atlas 2000.0 , already referenced in Chapter 12. Its more than 81,000 stars to magnitude 8.5 (plus some 2,700 non-stellar wonders) provide an ideal number of signposts for effective star-hopping to targets when using typical fi nders or binoculars, without resulting in overkill. Even if the telescope you alre ady own or plan to buy offers automated fi nding, I urge you to still spend at least some time star-hopping your way around the majestic highways and byways of the night sky. You’ll be delighted you did! Next come several true classics, found today as reprints of early works and/or original editions from various astronomy publishers, in stores selling new and used books, and in many libraries. Two charming nineteenth-century guides to the deep sky for amateurs are A Cycle of Celestial Objects , Volume Two, by W.H. Smyth, which is known as The Bedford Catalogue (Willman-Bell, 1986), and Volume Two of Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes by T.W. Webb (Dover Publications, 1962). Both contain extensive detailed lists and descriptions of deep-sky wonders (over 800 of them in the fi rst case and some 3,000 in the second). Two more recent works are 1001 Celestial Wonders by C.E. Barns (Pacifi c Science Press, 1929) and William Tyler Olcott’s Field Book of the Skies (G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1929 – with additional printings up through the mid-1950s). The latter guide’s marvelous system of dual sky maps – one for the naked eye and binoculars (or “fi eld glasses” as Olcott referred to them), the other for tele- scopes – cover nearly 500 easily found deep-sky wonders, including variable and double stars, visible in its author’s 3-inch refractor. So revered was this work that it was often referred to as “the astronomer’s Bible .” An even more recent classic reference is the truly monumental Burnham’s Celestial Handbook by Robert Burnham, Jr. (Dover Publications, 1978).

Another highlight is the collected works (edited by O’Meara) of famed observer and Sky & Telescope columnist Walter Scott Houston.

I must tell you, too, about a most wonderful book entitled New Handbook of the Heavens by H.J. Bernhard, D.A Bennett, and H.S.

While it is not a deep-sky guide as such, its three chapters on observing double and multiple stars, variable stars, and star clusters and nebulae are without question the fi nest and most thrilling ever written on these objects. Sadly, it can only be found today on the used-book market – and then only if you’re lucky. Finally, as a reminder, references for observing fi rst-magnitude, highly tinted, variable, double, and multiple stars (which, again, are themselves deep-sky objects!) were given in Chapter 12. Perhaps the ultimate test of an observer’s ability to navigate the deep sky is that provided by the many Messier Marathons that have become so popular with certain observers in recent years. Each spring, it’s possible to view all 109 M-objects in a single observing session spanning the night from dusk to dawn! While this may be an interesting challenge to some, it’s decidedly not the way to enjoy celestial pageantry, for it results in sensory saturation – an overloading of the eye–brain system. As one observer wisely pointed out, all deep-sky objects deserve to be stared at for a full 15 minutes in order to really see what you’re looking at. Jumping rapidly from one object to another is like reading only the Cliff’s Notes to the world’s great novels. (While I was comparing fi nal showpiece selections for my Sky & Telescope series reprint, “The Finest Deep-Sky Objects”, fi rst published in 1966, I admit to having viewed as many as 600 objects in a single night using a 13-inch refractor – all found by star-hopping!

Just watch the astonishment on their face as they stare at the Moon’s alien landscape or the magnifi cent ice-rings of Saturn or the heavenly hues of a double star like Albireo.

Going even further, you may wish to submit observing notes or even entire articles to the various astronomy magazines such as Sky & Telescope (www.skyandtelescope.com), Astronomy (www.astronomy. com), and Astronomy Now (www.astronomynow.com/magazine.html) for possi- ble publication. There are also the journals of various active amateur groups, including the Webb Society, the British Astronomical Association, the Astro- nomical League, or the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.

A number of the better- known and most active of these are mentioned in those same chapters, along with information for contacting them. Figure 14.1.

Pleasure Versus Serious Observing There is rampant in the fi eld of amateur astronomy today a real belief that you must be doing “serious work” of value to science – preferably with sophisticated (and, therefore, expensive) telescopes and accessories – in order to call yourself"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Conclusion 161 an observer. This is truly unfortunate, for it has undoubtedly discouraged many budding stargazers from pursuing astronomy as a pastime. The root of the word “amateur” is the Latin word amare – which means “to love” – or more precisely, from amator , which means “one who loves.” An amateur astronomer is one who loves the stars – loves them for the sheer joy of knowing them. He or she may in time come to love them so much that there will be a desire to contribute some- thing to our knowledge of them. But this rarely happens initially. First comes a period of time (for some, a lifetime!) getting to know the sky, and enjoying its treasures and wonders as a celestial sightseer. Certainly one of the best examples of this is the legendary American observer Leslie Peltier, who developed an early love of the stars. He went on to discover or co-discover 12 comets and six novae, and contributed over 100,000 visual mag- nitude estimates of variable stars to the American Association of Variable Star Observers. Born on a farm in Ohio where he made his early observations as a boy and young man, he stayed in his rural community and close to nature the remain- der of his life – this, despite offers to join the staffs of several major professional observatories! If there is any reader of this book who has not already done so, I Figure 14.2. A serious (really serious!) observing setup typical of that used by some advanced amateur astronomers today.

Yet, he wisely advises his readers to “. . . also never forget that astronomy loses half its meaning for the observer who never lets his telescope range across the remote glories of the sky ‘with an uncovered head and humble heart’.” He goes on to lament that “The study of the heavens from a purely aesthetic point of view is scorned in this technological age.” How very sad!

And here as in no other fi eld of science we have an opportunity not only to see and experience the universe at its grandest, but to come into actual physical contact with it through the amazing “photon connection.” This is a term that I coined in the June, 1994, issue of Sky & Telescope magazine. It involves the fact that the light by which we see celestial objects such as stars and nebulae and galaxies consists of photons, which have a strange, dualistic nature. They behave as if they are both particles and waves – or particles moving in waves, if you like. Something that was once inside that object has traveled across the vastness of space and time, and ended its long journey on the retina of your eye. You are in direct physical contact with the object you are viewing ! Little wonder the poet Sarah Teasdale in looking at the stars said, “I know that I am honored to be witness of so much majesty.” Stargazers themselves have been variously referred to over the years as “Natu- ralists of the Night,” “Harvesters of Starlight,” “Time Travelers,” “Star Pilgrims,” and “Citizens of Heaven.” And here we conclude this book by sharing the thoughts of such as these – from observers of the sky past and present, both amateur and professional – for your contemplation. As you let these words penetrate your mind and heart, you’ll come to fi nd that path to the heavens that’s ideally suited for you in your ongoing cosmic adventure as “one who loves” the stars! “A telescope is a machine that can change your life.” – Richard Berry “Stargazing is that vehicle of the mind which enables us all to roam the uni- verse in what is surely the next best thing to being there.” – William Dodson “But let’s forget the astrophysics and simply enjoy the spectacle.” – Walter Scott Houston “I became an astronomer not to learn the facts about the sky but to feel its majesty.” – David Levy “I am because I observe.” – Thaddeus Banachiewicz “Even if there were no practical application for the serene art of visual observ- ing, it would always be a sublime way to spend a starry night.” – Lee Cain “To me, astronomy means learning about the universe by looking at it.” – Daniel Weedman “Astronomy is a typically monastic activity; it provides food for meditation and strengthens spirituality.” – Paul Couteau “Astronomy has an almost mystical appeal. . . . We should do astronomy because it is beautiful and because it is fun.” – John Bahcall “The great object of all knowledge is to enlarge and purify the soul, to fi ll the mind with noble contemplations, and to furnish a refi ned pleasure.” – Edward Everett “The true value of a telescope is how many people have viewed the heavens through it.” – John Dobson “The appeal of stargazing is both intellectual and aesthetic; it combines the thrill of exploration and discovery, the fun of sight-seeing, and the sheer joy of fi rsthand acquaintance with incredibly wonderful and beautiful things.” – Robert Burnham, Jr. “Whatever happened to what amateur astronomers really care about – simply enjoying the beauty of the night sky?” – Mark Hladik"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Astronomical Telescopes and Binoculars 164 “I would rather freeze and fi ght off mosquitoes than play astronomy on a computer.” – Ben Funk “Were I to write out one prescription to help alleviate at least some of the self- made miseries of mankind, it would read like this: ‘One gentle dose of starlight to be taken each clear night just before retiring’.” – Leslie Peltier “The high-tech devices pervading the market are ruining the spirit of the real meaning of recreational astronomy – feeling a close, personal encounter with the universe.” – Jorge Cerritos “The sky belongs to all of us.

(The 2.4-inch entry is the ubiquitous 60 mm refractor, of which there are perhaps more than any other telescope in the world!) Values for the minimum visual magnitude ( MAG .) listed here are for single stars and are only very approximate, since experienced keen-eyed observers may see as much as a full magnitude fainter under excellent sky conditions. Compan- ions to visual double stars – especially those in close proximity to a bright primary – are typically much more diffi cult to see than is a star of the same magnitude placed alone in the eyepiece fi eld. Among the many variables involved are light pollution, sky conditions, optical quality, mirror and lens coatings, eyepiece design, obstructed or unobstructed optical system, color (spectral type) of the star, and even the age of the observer. Only a few representative limiting magnitudes are given here (in increments of increasing aperture), as an indica- tion of what an observer might typically expect to see in various sizes of telescope. Three different values in arc-seconds are listed for resolution, which are for two stars of equal brightness and of about the sixth magnitude. These fi gures differ signifi cantly for brighter, fainter and, especially, unequal pairs. DAW E S is the value based on Dawes’ Limit (R = 4.56/A), RAYLEIGH on the Rayleigh Criterion (R = 5.5/D), and MARKOWITZ on Markowitz’s Limit (R = 6.0/D).

One of the contributors to Carl Sagan’s award-winning Cosmos PBS television series, he has received recognition for his work from such notables (and fellow stargazers) as Sir Arthur Clarke, Johnny Carson, Ray Bradbury, Dr Wernher von Braun, and his former student, NASA scientist/astronaut Dr Jay Abt. His 50-year mission as a “celestial evangelist” has been to “Celebrate the Uni- verse!” – to get others to look up at the majesty of the night sky and to experience personally the joys of stargazing. In February, 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Astronomical Society (London). The author shown with his 5-inch Celestron Schmidt–Cassegrain optical-tube assembly mounted on an exquisite old Unitron altazimuth mounting with slow-motion controls. With excellent optics and a total weight of just 12 pounds, this highly portable instrument can go anywhere and is a joy to use.
