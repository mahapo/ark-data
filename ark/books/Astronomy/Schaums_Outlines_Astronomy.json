Much of the material here is abbreviated, and students should use this book as a guide to the key concepts in modern astronomy, but not as an all-inclusive resource. Topics covered range from planetary astronomy to cosmology, in the modern context. The first chapter covers most of the phsyics required to obtain a basic understanding of astronomical phenomena. The student will most likely come back to this chapter again and again as they progress through the book. The order of the topics has been set by the most common order of these topics in textbooks (near objects to far objects), but many of the chapters are quite inde- pendent, with few references to previous chapters, and may be studied out of order. Thetextincludesmanyworkedmathematicalproblemstosupporttheeffortsof students who struggle particularly in this area. These detailed problems will help even mathematically adept students to see how to solve astronomical problems involving several steps. I wish to thank the many people who were instrumental to this work, including the unknown reviewer who gave me so many useful comments, and especially the editors, Glenn Mott of McGraw-Hill and Alan Hunt of Keyword Publishing Services Ltd., who guided a novice author with tremendous patience.

About Masses MASS Mass is an intrinsic property of an object which indicates how many protons, neutrons, and electrons it has. The weight of an object is a force and depends on what gravitational influences are acting (whether the object is on the Earth or on the Moon, for example), but the mass stays the same. Mass is usually denoted by either m or M , and is measured in kilograms (kg). VOLUME The volume of a body is the amount of space it fills, and it is measured in meters cubed (m 3 ). The surface of a sphere is S ¼ 4 \u0001 r 2 and its volume V ¼ 4 = 3 \u0001 r 3 , where r is the radius and \u0001 is 3.1416. Copyright 2002 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Gravity is always an attractive force, acting to pull bodies together. The force of gravity between two homogeneous spherical objects depends upon their masses and the distance between them. The further apart two objects are, the smaller the force of gravity between them. The gravity equation is called Newton’s law of gravitation: F ¼ G \u0002 M \u0002 m d 2 where M and m are the masses of the two objects, d is the distance between their centers, and G is the gravitational constant: 6 : 67 \u0003 10 \u0004 11 m 3 = kg = s 2 . The unit of force is the newton (N), which is equal to 1kg \u0002 m = s 2 . If the sizes of the two objects are much smaller than their distance d , then the above equation is valid for arbitrary shapes and arbitrary mass distributions. THE ELLIPSE The planets orbit the Sun in nearly circular elliptical orbits. An ellipse is described by its major axis (length ¼ 2 a ) and its minor axis (length ¼ 2 b ), as shown in Fig. 1-1. For each point A on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to the foci AF and AF 0 is constant. More specifically: AF þ AF 0 ¼ 2 a The eccentricity of the ellipse is given by e ¼ FF 0 = 2 a .

Assume that the Sun occupies the focus F. When the planet is on the major axis and at the point nearest F, then the planet is at perihelion. On the far point on the major axis, the planet is at aphelion. By definition, d p þ d a ¼ 2 a where d p is the planet–Sun distance at perihelion and d a is the distance at aphelion.

The product of the distance from the focus and the trans- verse velocity is a constant. The transverse velocity is the velocity perpendicular to a line drawn from the object to the focus (see Fig. 1-1). As a hint for working problems, consider that when a planet is at aphelion or perihelion (farthest and closest to the Sun), all of the velocity is transverse. An alternative statement is that the line from the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time. Kepler’s Third Law. The ratio of the square of the period, P (the amount of time to compete one full orbit), and the cube of the semi-major axis, a , of the orbit is the same for all planets in our solar system. When P is measured in years, and a in astronomical units, A U(1 A Uis the average distance from the Earth to the Sun), then Kepler’s Third Law is expressed as P 2 ¼ a 3 Using Newtonian mechanics, Kepler’s Third Law can be expressed as P 2 ¼ 4 \u0001 2 a 3 G ð m þ M Þ where m and M are the masses of the two bodies. This Newtonian version is very useful for determining the masses of objects outside of our solar system. CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 3 Fig. 1-1. An ellipse.

When the orbit is elliptical, rather than circular, this equation is still useful—it gives the average velocity of the orbiting body. Provided that d is given in meters, the units of circular velocity are m/s (with G ¼ 6 : 67 \u0003 10 \u0004 11 m 3 = kg = s 2 ). ESCAPE VELOCITY An object of mass m will remain in orbit if its speed at distance d does not exceed the value v e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 GM d r the so-called escape velocity. Again, M is the mass of the larger object. The escape velocity is independent of the mass of the smaller object, m . ANGULAR MOMENTUM All orbiting objects have a property called angular momentum . Angular momen- tum is a conserved quantity. Changing the angular momentum of a system requires external action (a net torque). The angular momentum depends on the mass, m , the distance from the object it is orbiting, r , and the transverse velocity, v , of the orbiting object, L ¼ m \u0002 v \u0002 r The mass of planets is constant, so conservation of angular momentum requires that the product v \u0002 r remains constant. This is Kepler’s Second Law. KINETIC ENERGY Moving objects have more energy than stationary ones (at the same potential energy, for example, at the same height off the ground). The energy of the motion is called the kinetic energy, and depends on both the mass of the object, m , and its velocity, v . The kinetic energy is given by KE ¼ 1 2 mv 2 CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 4"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Kinetic energy (and energy in general) is measured in joules (J): 1 joule ¼ 1kg \u0002 m 2 = s 2 .

Use Newton’s law of gravitation, F ¼ GmM d 2 The mass of the Earth is given in Appendix 2, 5 : 97 \u0002 10 24 kg, and the radius of the Earth is 6,378 km (i.e., 6,378,000 m or 6 : 378 \u0002 10 6 m).

This is also the gravita- tional force that you exert on the Earth. (Try the calculation the other way if you don’t believe this is true.) 1.2. What is the maximum value of the force of gravity exerted on you by Jupiter? The maximum value of this force will occur when the planets are closest together. This will happen when they are on the same side of the Sun, in a line, so that the distance between them becomes d ¼ð d SuntoJupiter Þ\u0003ð d SuntoEarth Þ d ¼ 5 : 2AU \u0003 1AU d ¼ 4 : 2AU CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 5"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Convert A Uto meters by multiplying by 1 : 5 \u0002 10 11 m/AU, so that the distance from the Earth to Jupiter is 6 : 3 \u0002 10 11 m.

Therefore, the force of gravity between you and Jupiter is F ¼ GmM d 2 F ¼ 6 : 67 \u0002 10 \u0003 11 m 3 = kg = s 2 \u0004 65kg \u0004 2 \u0002 10 27 kg ð 6 : 3 \u0002 10 11 m Þ 2 F ¼ 2 : 2 \u0002 10 \u0003 5 kg \u0004 m 2 = s 2 F ¼ 2 : 2 \u0002 10 \u0003 5 N The gravitational force between you and Jupiter is 2 : 2 \u0002 10 \u0003 5 newtons. 1.3. What is the gravitational force between you and a person sitting 1/3m away? Assume each of you has a mass of 65 kg. (For simplicity, assume all objects are spherical.)

Despite Jupiter’s large size, it would take only 7 people in your vicinity to have a larger gravitational effect on you. 1.4. If someone weighs (has a gravitational force acting on them) 150 pounds on Earth, how much do they weigh on Mars? The most obvious way to work out this problem is to calculate the person’s mass from their weight on Earth, then calculate their weight on Mars. However, many of the terms in the gravity equation are the same in both cases ( G and the mass of the person, for example). If you set up the ratio immediately, by dividing the two equations, the calcula- tion is simplified. It is important in this method to put subscripts on all the variables, so that you can keep track of which mass is the mass of Mars, and which radius is the radius of the Earth. Dividing the equations for the weight on Mars and the weight on Earth gives F Mars F Earth ¼ GmM Mars r 2 Mars GmM Earth r 2 Earth The factors of G and m cancel out, so that the equation simplifies to CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 6"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"F Mars F Earth ¼ M Mars r 2 Mars M Earth r 2 Earth F Mars F Earth ¼ M Mars \u0004 r 2 Earth M Earth \u0004 r 2 Mars F Mars F Earth ¼ 6 : 39 \u0002 10 23 kg \u0004ð 6,378km Þ 2 5 : 07 \u0002 10 24 kg \u0004 3,394km ðÞ 2 F Mars F Earth ¼ 2 : 6 \u0002 10 31 5 : 8 \u0002 10 31 ¼ 0 : 45 The weight of a person on Mars is about 0.45 times their weight on the Earth. For a person weighing 150 pounds on Earth, their weight on Mars would decrease to 0 : 45 \u0002 F Earth ¼ 0 : 45 \u0002 150 ¼ 67pounds. Working the problem in this way enables you to skip steps. You do not need to find the mass of the person on the Earth first, and you do not need to plug in all the constants, since they cancel out. 1.5. What is the circular velocity of the space shuttle in lower Earth orbit (300km above the surface)? In the circular velocity equation, M is the mass of the object being orbited—in this case, the Earth—and d is the distance between the centers of the objects. Since G is in meters, and our distance is in kilometers, convert the distance between the space shuttle and the center of the Earth to meters: d ¼ R Earth þ h Orbit d ¼ 6,378 þ 300km d ¼ 6,678km \u0004 1 ; 000m km d ¼ 6,678 ; 000m d ¼ 6 : 678 \u0002 10 6 m Now use the circular velocity equation: v c ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi GM Earth d r v c ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 6 : 67 \u0002 10 \u0003 11 m 3 = kg = s 2 \u0004 5 : 97 \u0002 10 24 kg ð 6 : 678 \u0002 10 6 m Þ s v c ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 5 : 96 \u0002 10 7 m 3 \u0004 kg m \u0004 kg \u0004 s 2 s v c ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 5 : 96 \u0002 10 7 m 2 s 2 s v c ¼ 7 : 72 \u0002 10 3 m = s v c ¼ 7 : 72km = s So the circular velocity of the space shuttle is 7.72 km/s.

What is the density of the Earth? How does this compare to the density of rocks (between 2,000 and 3,500 kg/m 3 )? What does this mean? The density is the mass divided by the volume. If we assume the Earth is spherical, the calculation is simplified. \u0004 ¼ M V \u0004 ¼ M Earth 4 3 \u0005 \u0004 r 3 Earth \u0004 ¼ 5 : 97 \u0002 10 24 kg 4 3 \u0005 \u0004ð 6 : 378 \u0002 10 6 m Þ 3 \u0004 ¼ 5,500kg = m 3 The average density of the Earth is higher than the density of rock. Since the surface of the Earth is mostly rock, or water, which is even less dense, this means that the core must be made of material that is denser than the surface. 1.8. There are about 7,000 asteroids in our solar system. Assume each one has a mass of 10 17 kg. What is the total mass of all the asteroids? If these asteroids are all rocky, and so have a density of about 3,000 kg/m 3 , how large a planet could be formed from them? The total mass of all the asteroids is just the product of the number of asteroids and their individual mass: M ¼ n \u0004 m M ¼ 7 ; 000 \u0004 10 17 kg M ¼ 7 \u0002 10 20 kg The volume of the planet that could be formed is CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 8"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"V ¼ M =\u0004 V ¼ 7 \u0002 10 20 kg 3,000kg = m 3 V ¼ 2 : 33 \u0002 10 17 m 3 If we assume the planet is spherical, then we can find the radius R ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 3 V 4 \u0005 3 r R ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 3 \u0004 2 : 33 \u0002 10 17 m 3 4 \u0005 3 r R ¼ 380km This is a factor of about 20 less than the radius of the Earth, and about a factor of 10 less than the radius of Mars. 1.9. An asteroid’s closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is 2 AU, and farthest distance from the Sun (aphelion) is 4 AU. What is the semi-major axis of its orbit? What is the period of the asteroid? What is the eccentricity? Figure 1-1 shows that the major axis of an orbit is the aphelion distance plus the perihelion distance. So the major axis is 6AU, and the semi-major axis is 3 AU.

How would the gravitational force between two bodies change if the product of their masses increased by a factor of four? The easiest way to do this problem is to begin by setting up a ratio. Since the radii stay constant, lots of terms will cancel out (see Problem 1.4): F 2 F 1 ¼ G ð mM Þ 2 r 2 G ð mM Þ 1 r 2 F 2 F 1 ¼ ð mM Þ 2 ð mM Þ 1 F 2 F 1 ¼ 4 ð mM Þ 1 ð mM Þ 1 F 2 F 1 ¼ 4 The force between the two objects increases by a factor of four when the product of the masses increases by a factor of four. 1.12. How would the gravitational force between two bodies change if the distance between them increased by a factor of two? Again, set up a ratio so that all the unchanged quantities cancel out (as in Problem 1.4): CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 10"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"F 2 F 1 ¼ GmM r 2 2 GmM r 2 1 F 2 F 1 ¼ r 2 1 r 2 2 F 2 F 1 ¼ r 2 1 ð 2 r 1 Þ 2 F 2 F 1 ¼ r 2 1 4 r 2 1 F 2 F 1 ¼ 1 4 The force between the two objects would decrease by a factor of four when the distance between them decreases by a factor of two. 1.13. How would the gravitational force between two bodies change if their masses increase by a factor of four, and the distance between them increased by a factor of two? Since increasing the masses by a factor of four increases the force by a factor of four (Problem 1.11), and increasing the distance between them by a factor of two decreases the force by a factor of four (Problem 1.12), the two effects cancel out, and there is no change in the force. 1.14. What is the mass of the Sun? Since we know the orbital period of the Earth (1year ¼ 3 : 16 \u0002 10 7 seconds), and we know the orbital radius of the Earth (1AU ¼ 1 : 5 \u0002 10 11 m), we have enough information to calculate the mass of the Sun: P 2 ¼ 4 \u0005 2 a 3 G ð m þ M Þ ð m þ M Þ¼ 4 \u0005 2 a 3 GP 2 Assume the mass of the Earth is small compared with the mass of the Sun ( m þ M M ): M ¼ 4 \u0005 2 ð 1 : 5 \u0002 10 11 m Þ 3 ð 6 : 67 \u0002 10 \u0003 11 m 3 = kg = s 2 Þð 3 : 16 \u0002 10 7 s Þ 2 M ¼ 2 : 0 \u0002 10 30 kg This is strikingly close to the accepted value for the mass of the Sun, 1 : 9891 \u0002 10 30 kg. It is so close that any differences might be caused by a round-off error in our calculators plus the assumption that the mass of the Earth is negligible. 1.15.

This is not very much less than the escape velocity of a space- craft from the Earth (11km/s). Even though the orbit of Neptune is so far away, the mass of the Sun is so large that objects are bound quite tightly to the solar system, and must be moving very quickly to escape. 1.16. The Moon orbits the Earth once every 27.3 days (on average). How far away is the Moon from the Earth? We cannot use the simple relation between P and a for this problem, since the Sun is not at the focus of the orbit. However, we can assume that the Moon is much less massive than the Earth.

When the atoms and molecules are ionized, so that there are electrons and ions (positively charged particles) roaming freely, the gas is called plasma . Plasmas have special properties, because they interact with the magnetic field. Neutral gases will not, in general, interact with the magnetic field. THE IDEAL GAS LAW Gases that obey the ideal gas law are called ideal gases. The ideal gas law states: PV ¼ NkT where P is the pressure, V is the volume, N is the number of particles, T is the absolute temperature, and k is Boltzmann’s constant (1 : 38 \u0003 10 \u0004 23 J/K). Sometimes both sides of this equation are divided by V , to give P ¼ nkT where n is the number density (number of particles per m 3 ). The absolute tem- perature T is obtained by adding 273 to the temperature in the Celsius scale, and is measured in degrees kelvin, K. For example, 25 8 C is equal to 298K. The ideal gas law provides a simple qualitative description of real gases. For example, it shows that when the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature increases the pressure. The ideal gas law is a good description of the behavior of normal stars, but fails completely for objects such as neutron stars where the gas is degenerate, and the pressure and the temperature are no longer related to each other in this way. AVERAGE SPEED OF PARTICLES IN A GAS The particles in a gas are moving in random directions, with speeds that depend on the temperature. Hotter gases have faster particles, and cooler gases have slower particles, on average. The average speed depends on the mass, m, of the particles: v ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 kT \u0001 m r This equation gives the average speed of the particles in a gas. There will be some particles moving faster than this speed, and some moving slower. If this average speed is greater than 1/6 the escape velocity of a planet, the gas will eventually escape, and the planet will no longer have an atmosphere. This equation only holds for an ideal gas under equilibrium conditions, where it is neither expanding nor contracting, for example.

What is a plasma? Why does this only happen at high temperatures? Plasmas are ionized gases, where the electrons have enough energy to be separated from the nuclei of the atoms or molecules. This happens only at high temperatures, because at lower temperatures the electrons do not have enough energy to separate themselves from the nuclei. 1.22.

To convert to something (slightly) more familiar, multiply by 0.0006 to convert meters to miles, and by 3,600 to convert the seconds to hours. The hydrogen atoms are traveling nearly 24,000 miles per hour. It would take about 1 hour for one of these atoms to travel all the way around the Earth. About Light Light exhibits both particle behavior, giving momentum to objects it strikes, and wave behavior, bending as it crosses a boundary into a lens or a prism. Light can be described in terms of electromagnetic waves, or as particles, called ‘‘photons.’’ WAVELENGTH, FREQUENCY, AND SPEED The wavelength of a wave of any kind is the distance between two successive peaks (see Fig. 1-2). The frequency is the number of waves per second that pass a given point. If you are standing on the shore, you can count up the number of waves that come in over 10 seconds, and divide that number by 10 to obtain the frequency. Mathematically, the frequency, f , the speed, v , and the wavelength, \u0005 , are all related to one another by the following equation: v ¼ \u0005 \u0002 f CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 15"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In a vacuum, such as interstellar space, the speed of light is 3 \u0003 10 8 m/s for all wavelengths. This is the speed of light, and is always designated by c . Rearranging the above equation (and substituting c for the speed), we see that in a vacuum, \u0005 ¼ c f Since the speed of light, c , is a constant, we can see that \u0005 and f are inversely proportional to each other, so that if one gets larger, the other gets smaller. Therefore, long-wavelength waves have low frequencies, and short-wavelength waves have high frequencies. VISIBLE LIGHT AND COLOR The visible part of the whole range of wavelengths is only a small part of the entire range of light (see Fig. 1-3). The color of visible light is related to its wavelength. Long-wavelength light is redder, and short-wavelength light is bluer. Longer than red is infrared, microwave and radio, and shorter than blue is ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The energy of a photon is given by E ¼ hf or in terms of wavelength, E ¼ hc =\u0005 CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 16 Fig. 1-3. The entire spectrum of light. Fig. 1-2. A wave.

Photons can collide with and give their energy to other particles, such as electrons. In contrast to elec- trons and other particles, the photon has zero rest mass and in vacuum always travels at the same speed, c . There are only two wavelength bands where light can come through the atmosphere unobstructed: the visible and the radio. In most other wavelengths, the sky is opaque. For example, the atmosphere keeps out most of the gamma rays (high-energy light). Each of the wavelength bands (radio, visible, gamma ray, UV, etc.) has a special kind of telescope for observing. The most familiar kinds are optical (visible) and radio telescopes. These are usually ground-based. The atmosphere is mostly opaque in the other bands such as X-ray, and telescopes observing at these wavelengths must be placed outside of the atmosphere. SPECTRA The emission spectrum is a graph of energy emitted by an object at each wave- length (Fig. 1-4). If you do this for multiple objects, then you have many spectra. Similarly, the amount of light absorbed would be an absorption spec- trum. BLACKBODY EMISSION The spectrum of blackbody emission has a very special shape, as shown in Fig. 1-5. This kind of emission is also called ‘‘continuous emission,’’ because emission occurs at all wavelengths, contrary to line emission (see below). Both the height of the curve and the wavelength of the peak change with the temperature of the object. The three curves in the figure show what happens to the blackbody emission of an object as it is heated. When the object is cool, the CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 17 Fig. 1-4. A stellar spectrum."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"strongest emission is in the red, and as it gets hotter, the strongest part of the spectrum moves towards the blue. We can find the temperature, T (in kelvin), of an object by looking at its blackbody emission, and finding the wavelength of the peak, \u0005 max (in meters). Wien’s Law relates these two quantities: \u0005 max ¼ 0 : 0029m \u0002 kelvin T The height of the curve also changes with temperature, which tells you that the energy emitted must change (because you have more light coming from the object, and light is a form of energy). The Stefan-Boltzmann Law relates the energy emitted per second per unit area of the surface of an object, to the temperature of the object: =¼ \u0006 \u0002 T 4 where \u0006 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, equal to 5 : 6705 \u0003 10 \u0004 8 W = m 2 K 4 . The light coming from stars has the general shape of a blackbody. So does the infrared light coming from your body. Everything emits light with a spectrum of this shape, with intensity and color depending on its temperature. Most objects, including stars, also have other things going on as well, so that the spectrum is almost never a pure blackbody. For example, the object may not be evenly heated, or there may be line emission contributing (see below). We know of only one perfect blackbody, and that is the Universe itself, which has the black- CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 18 Fig. 1-5.

LINE EMISSION Line emission is produced by gases. The spectrum consists of bright lines at particular frequencies characteristic of the emitting atoms or molecules. Atoms consist of a nucleus (positively charged), surrounded by a cloud of electrons (negatively charged). When light strikes the electrons, it gives them extra energy. Because they have more energy, they move farther from the nucleus (out through the ‘‘valence levels’’ or ‘‘energy levels’’ or ‘‘shells’’). But it is a rule in the Universe that objects prefer to be in their lowest energy states (this is why balls roll downhill, for example). So the electrons give up energy in the form of light in order to move to the lowest energy level, also known as the ‘‘ground state.’’ It is important to note that these levels are discrete, not continuous. It’s like the difference between climbing steps and climbing a ramp. There are only certain heights in a flight of steps, and similarly there are only certain amounts of energy that an electron can take or give up at any given time (Fig. 1-6). When light has been taken out of a spectrum, it is called an absorption line (see Fig. 1-7). The energy emitted when an electron makes a transition from an energy level E h to a lower energy level E l is E h \u0004 E l and is emitted in the form of a photon of frequency CHAPTER 1 Physics Facts 19 Fig. 1-6.

The reverse process, moving from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, requires the same amount of energy, and is accomplished by absorbing a photon of the same frequency, f . Thus, the absorp- tion lines for a given gas occur at the same frequencies as the emission lines. Furthermore, as the values of the energy levels, E h , E l , etc., are different for each atom, the absorption/emission lines will occur at frequencies that are character- istic of each kind of atom. The absorption/emission spectrum can be used to identify various atoms. THE DOPPLER EFFECT When an object is approaching or moving away, the wavelength of the light it emits (or reflects) is changed. The shift of the wavelength, \u0001 \u0005 , is directly related to the velocity, v , of the object: \u0001 \u0005 ¼ \u0005 0 v c Here \u0005 0 is the wavelength emitted if the object is at rest and v is the component of the velocity along the ‘‘line of sight’’ or the ‘‘radial velocity.’’ Motion per- pendicular to the line of sight does not contribute to the shift in wavelength. This equation holds when the velocity of the object is much less than the speed of light. For approaching objects, \u0001 \u0005 is negative, and the emitted wavelength appears shorter (‘‘blue-shifted’’). For receding objects, \u0001 \u0005 is positive, and the emitted wavelength appears longer (‘‘red-shifted’’). This is roughly analogous to the waves produced by a boat in the water.

Why don’t atoms emit a continuous spectrum? Emission from atoms is produced when the electrons drop from an initial energy level E i to a final energy level E f . The difference in energy, E f \u0003 E i , is given up as a photon of wavelength \u0006 ¼ hc E f \u0003 E i Because these levels are quantized (step-like), the electrons can give up only certain amounts of energy each time they move from one energy level to another. Since energy is related to frequency, this means that the photons can only have certain frequencies, and therefore certain wavelengths. This is exactly what we mean when we say the emission is ‘‘line emission’’—it only exists at certain wavelengths. 1.25.

Which is hotter? Why are satellites usually made of (or covered with) reflective material? The satellite with the higher albedo reflects more light, and therefore is cooler than the satellite with the lower albedo. Satellites have reflective material on the outside to keep the electronics cool on the inside. 1.27. Your body is about 300K.

Because the energies are directly proportional to the frequencies, E ¼ h \u0004 f if the energy (on the left-hand side) is reduced by half, the right-hand side must also be reduced by half: h is a constant, so one photon must have half the frequency of the other. 1.32.

There are four different ways that the electron can go from state 4 to state 1. From the diagram of all the different paths (Fig. 1-8), you can see that there are six distinct steps that can be taken.

What information can you find out from an object’s spectrum? The temperature of an object can be determined from the peak wavelength of the spec- trum. The composition of the object can be determined from the presence or absence of emission lines of particular elements, the speed at which the object is approaching or receding can be determined from the Doppler shift, and if there are absorption lines present, you know that there is cool gas between you and the object you are observing.

THE DAY The Earth rotates on its axis once per day, giving us day and night. Astronomers define three different kinds of ‘‘day,’’ depending upon the frame of reference: 1. Sidereal day . The length of time that it takes for the Earth to come around to the same position relative to the distant stars. The sidereal day is 23 hours and 56 minutes long. Specifically, it is measured as the time between successive meridian crossings of the vernal equinox. 2. Solar day . The length of time that it takes for the Earth to come around to the same position relative to the Sun. It is measured as the time between successive meridian crossings of the Sun. The solar day is 24 hours long. The ‘‘extra’’ four minutes come from the fact that the Earth travels about 1 degree around the Sun per day, so that the Earth has to turn a little bit further to present the same face to the Sun.

The length of time that it takes for the Earth to come around to the same position relative to the Moon. Since the Moon revolves around the Earth, this day is even longer than the solar day—about 24 hours and 48 minutes. This is why the tides do not occur at the same time every day, becausetheMoonistheprimarycontributortothetides,anditisnotinthe same location in the sky each day. TIDES The Earth experiences one full set of tides each day (two highs and two lows), everywhere on the planet. Tides are caused by gravity. The Sun and the Moon both contribute to tides on Earth. When the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are all in a straight line, the tides are largest. This is called a spring tide (spring for jumping, not spring for the season). When the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are at right angles, the tides are smallest. This is called a neap tide. Tides are slowing the Earth’s rotation. The rotation is slowed by about 0.0015 seconds every century. Eventually, the Moon and the Earth will become ‘‘tidally locked,’’ so that the same face of the Earth always faces the same face of the Moon. An Earth day will slow to be about 47 of our current days long. As the Earth is slowing down, its angular momentum decreases. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the Moon’s angular momentum should increase. Indeed, the Moon increases its angular momentum by receding from the Earth (about 3 cm per year). As it gets further away, its angular size decreases, and it lookssmaller relative to the Sun. It will take several centuries for this to add up to a noticeable effect. THE MOON ORBITS THE EARTH The Moon goes through one cycle of phases in about 29 days. This is not the same as the length of a calendar month. This is why the moon is not always new on the first day of the calendar month. The Moon is in ‘‘synchronous rotation.’’ The length of time that it takes to rotateonitsaxisis equaltothelengthof timeittakesto revolvearoundtheEarth. As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. As the moon orbits, it exhibits phases. Figure 2-2 shows the Moon at various points in its orbit around the Earth. The lighter shading indicates the illuminated portion of the Moon. This diagram is drawn from the point of view of looking down from north.

Because the Earth is traveling around the Sun, the constellations (made up of stars that are much further away than the Sun) that are visible at night vary during the course of the year.

Because of this, the Earth has four seasons each year. When the North Pole is tipped in the direction of the Sun, it is summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, but wintertime in the Southern Hemisphere.Conversely,whentheSouthPoleistiltedtowardstheSun,itis summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and winter in the North. The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect at two points, called the equinoxes . When the Sun has reached those points on the ecliptic, it is directly over the Earth’s equator, and the whole planet gets 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness.

The Earthcompletesanorbitconsiderablyfasterthanmostoftheouterplanets, sothattheytendtobevisibleatnearlythesametimeofyearformanyyears in a row. ECLIPSES In a solar eclipse , the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, and casts its shadow on the Earth. In a lunar eclipse , the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, and the Earth’s shadow is cast on the Moon. Lunar eclipses are quite common,butsolareclipsesarerelativelyrareatanygivenlocation.Agiveneclipse is visible from particular geographic locations, and may not produce any effect elsewhere. Eclipses do not occur every month because the Moon’s orbit around the Earth is not aligned with the Earth’s orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic). The two orbits are inclined about 5 degrees with respect to each other. PRECESSION Precession is the change in the direction of the Earth’s spin axis. Precession is easily observed in tops. A spinning top not only rotates around on its own axis, but also the axis wobbles, and points in different directions due to gravity. The axis of the Earth behaves in a similar manner due to the Sun’s gravitational force, sothattheNorthPolepointsatdifferentstarsatdifferenttimes.Therefore,Polaris has not always been the North Star. About 3,000 years ago, Thuban (a star in the constellation Draco) was the North Star; about 12,000 years from now, Vega (a star in the constellation Lyra) will be the North Star. It takes 26,000 years for the pole to completely precess. As the axis points in different directions, the plane of the celestial equator moves, so that the equinoxes also move. This is often called ‘‘precession of the equinoxes.’’ Every 50 years or so, astronomers have to recalculate the positions of all of the stars in the sky, since the origin of the declination–right ascension coordinate system (the vernal equinox) moves.

From the geometry of Fig. 2-6, stars that have declinations greater than those equal to the observer’s latitude will never set. These are called circumpolar stars. Stars with declinations less than the negative of the observer’s latitude will never rise. Stars in between these two declinations rise and set. 2.9.

How many degrees ( 8 ), arc minutes ( 0 ), and arcseconds ( 00 ) does the Moon move across the sky in 1 hour? How long does it take the Moon to move across the sky a distance equal to its own diameter? The lunar day is 24 hours and 48 minutes long.

This problem is similar to Problem 2.14, but the motion being considered is somewhat different. On an hour-by-hour scale, the motion of the Earth around its own axis dominates your observations of the motion of the Moon.

Instrumentation TELESCOPES The primary function of a telescope is to gather more light than the unaided human eye can gather. The amount of light that can be collected by a telescope is determined by the collecting area (the area of the telescope’s lens or mirror that is open to the sky), F ¼ constant \u0002 A Alternatively,theamountoftimeittakestocollectacertainamountoflightscales liketheinverseofthearea—thebiggerthetelescope,thelesstimeittakestocollect a certain amount of light, t ¼ constant A In theory, this means that more astronomers can use a larger telescope, since it takes less time to accomplish a task. Of course, this is not true in practice. Astronomers observe fainter, more distant objects with larger telescopes, and so take about the same amount of time as on a smaller telescope, where they would restrict themselves to brighter objects. There are two kinds of optical telescopes: refractors and reflectors. Refracting telescopesuselensestobendthelighttoafocus.Reflectorsusecurvedmirrorsthat reflect the light to the focus (Fig. 2-8). Reflectingtelescopesarepreferredoverrefractingtelescopesforseveralreasons: 1. A large mirror can be as thin as a small mirror, but a large lens must be thicker (thus heavier). For large diameters, lenses get much heavier than mirrors. 2. A lens has two surfaces that must be polished and cleaned; a mirror has only one. 3. Glass absorbs light. The thicker the glass, the more light gets absorbed. 4. Lenses can be supported only around the outside, but mirrors need sup- porting all across the back. 5. For large lenses, the glass deforms under its own weight and the image slides out of focus. 6. In a lens, different colors are refracted by different amounts. The blue light gets bent further than the red light. This phenomenon is called chromatic aberration , and in some cases is a positive quality: prisms can spread out CHAPTER 2 The Sky and Telescopes 42"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"light into a rainbow. However, in the case of a telescope, the light coming throughalenswillbefocusedatdifferentlocations,dependingonthecolor. Only one color will be focused, and the others will be out of focus. This can be fixed by combining lenses made out of a number of different materials, which compensate each other. These combination lenses are heavier and prohibitively expensive, especially in larger sizes. Of course, reflectors are not perfect either. The worst problem is that the outer edges of the image are blurred. This effect is called coma . Some of the incoming lightraysenterthetelescopeatanangle,ratherthanparalleltotheaxis,andsoare imperfectly focused by the mirror. This problem can be fixed with a special lens, but then a special camera with curved photographic plates is necessary to ‘‘see’’ the picture. You can’t just look through the telescope with your eye. The angular resolution of a telescope indicates how close together two points can be before they can’t be distinguished. This number should be as small as possible. The angular resolution is measured in arcseconds (an arcsecond is 1/3,600 8 ). The angular resolution is given by AR ¼ 250,000 \u0002 \u0005 d where \u0005 is thewavelengthat whichyou areobserving and d is thediameter of your telescope(these mustbein thesameunits).If thediameterof thetelescope islarge, the angular resolution is small. If the wavelength is large, the angular resolution is large. Fortunately, it is easy to build large telescopes for observing at large wave- lengths.Unfortunately,atsmallwavelengths,suchasultraviolet,X-ray,orgamma ray, it is very difficult to build telescopes with even modest diameters. The atmo- sphere is opaque at these wavelengths, so telescopes must be placed in orbit to be useful. This places strong constraints on the possible size of these telescopes. Even at relatively long wavelengths, such as in the visible or radio region of the spectrum, orbiting telescopes are preferable to ground-based telescopes. This is because the temperature of the atmosphere is not the same throughout, which causes changes in the density and flow of air. As light travels through air currents or pocketsofhigh- andlow-densityair,it isrefracted,or bent.As thesepatterns in CHAPTER 2 The Sky and Telescopes 43 Fig. 2-8.

The phenomenon of the moving light paths is called atmospheric scintillation, and limits the angular resolution of even large telescopes.

Interferometry has been used primarily in the radio and millimeter wavelengths, and links many smaller telescopes together to simulate a much larger telescope. Optical interfe- rometers have been built but, because of the higher frequencies, are much more difficult to construct on the same scale as radio and millimeter interferometers. New projects are under way to build optical interferometers in space, which may be able to detect Earth-sized planets around other stars. These projects are still very much in the early planning stages, and rely on unproven technologies, but over the next decade or so the feasibility of such telescopes should be determined. Adaptive optics is used in the optical and infrared to correct for the motion of the atmosphere while the observation is taking place. The correction makes use of a bright star close to the target as a reference. The Gemini North telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii (a large telescope with an adaptive optics imaging system) has produced images with less than one-tenth of 1 arcsecond angular resolution. (Recall that 1 arcsecond is the angular diameter of a tennis ball 8 miles away.) MAGNIFICATION Telescopes gather more light, and this is the primary reason that they are useful. They can also be used to magnify an image. This is done in practice by changing the eyepiece. However, because the same amount of light is used to make a magnified image as was used to make the original image, the magnified image is fainter. Also, the field of view (the area of sky that can be seen through the telescope) is reduced as the image is magnified. In practice, astronomers rarely magnify an image using their telescope. Instead, they take a picture, using either photographic film or a digital camera, and then use an image-processing program to make the image larger. As a practical rule, the useful magnification of an amateur telescope does not exceed 10 times the diameter of the objective in cen- timeters. For example, a 4-inch reflector (diameter 10 cm) will magnify 10 \u0003 10 ¼ 100 at most. At larger magnifications, the image deteriorates. DETECTORS The human eye is unparalleled in its range of color sensitivity, sensitivity to dim light, and adaptability. We can’t manufacture anything that comes close to the human eye in overall usefulness. When used in connection with the brain, the eye is far and away the most sophisticated imaging system around. Observation of faint objects, which requires collection of light over extended periods of time, as well as image storage, can be achieved by various devices: CHAPTER 2 The Sky and Telescopes 44"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"1. Analog camera . A 35-mm camera on the end of a telescope can take great pictures of the night sky. The shutter can be left open for a long time to image faint objects. The disadvantage of an analog camera is that it is awkward to get the pictures into a computer for analysis. Analog cameras have the advantage of being able to take ‘‘true-color’’ pictures. 2. Digital cameras . In astronomy, these are usually called CCDs (short for charge-coupled devices). These cameras provide the best link between a computer and the light coming from the sky. The information is digitized while it is taken, so that developing film or scanning photographs is not necessary. In general, digital cameras do not record in color, so that special filters are required to record only one color at a time. These filtered images can be recombined to form color images. 3. Photometer . A photometer adds up the light in an area of an image. All of the spatial information is lost. This is useful when observing objects which change in brightness over time, or when looking at sources whose light cannot be turned into an image (gamma-ray sources, for example). 4. Spectrometer . A spectrometer works like a prism, and records a spectrum of an object, in a particular set of wavelengths, with a particular frequency resolution. You will see why this detector is so important if you recall from Chapter 1 all the things we can find out from a spectrum. Solved Problems 2.17.

What is the difference between a photometer and a camera? A photometer collects all the light as though it came from the same place. There is no spatial information included. A camera, however,includes information about thedistribution of the light emitted by the object being observed. 2.19. What is the difference between a spectrometer and a camera? A spectrometer spreads out the light according to wavelength or frequency, producing a spectrum. A camera spreads out the light according to its position on the sky, producing an image. 2.20.

Formation of Terrestrial Planets Planetary systems form from the accretion disks around young stars (see Chapter 6 for more on the formation of stars and disks). The gas near the central star remains at a higher temperature than the gas far from the central star. Since different substances condense at different temperatures (see Table 3-2), we would expect to see some substances only in regions far from the central star, such as ices composed of frozen ammonia or methane. In the case of our solar system, this is certainly true. The terrestrial planets in the inner solar system are composed of silicate/iron particles, with very little ice, while solid bodies which orbit the Jovian planets in the outer solar system are composed mainly of ice- shrouded particles. Once some of these tiny particles have condensed, they begin to accrete ; i.e., they begin to stick together, and form larger particles. The difference between condensation and accretion is that condensation is a change of state—water vapor condenses on a cold glass in the summer. Accretion is not a change of state, but rather a change in the distribution of particles in space—dust accretes onto furniture. When the particles achieve sizes between a few millimeters and a few kilometers, they are called planetesimals . The larger objects accumulate mass quickly, because they have more area, as well as more mass (therefore more gravity). Calculationsof the earlysolarsystem show that onceplanetesimals reach about 1 km in size, they grow through interaction with other planetesimals—sometimes the collisions pulverize both objects, turning them back into many smaller par- ticles, and sometimes the planetesimals combine to form a new, much larger CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 50 Table 3-2.

These interactions form objects of 1,000km or more in size. These objects are primarily held together by their own gravity, and are massive enough that gravity regularizes their shapes, making them spherical, rather than potato- shaped like asteroids. Once the planetesimals reach this size, it is difficult to break them up again, and they simply sweep up the rest of the small planetesimals nearby. Many of the intercepted planetesimals form craters on the surface of the forming planet. Some of these types of craters are still visible on the surfaces oftheMoonandMercury.Theperiodoftimeduringwhichthesecratersformedis called the ‘‘bombardment era,’’ because small objects were constantly impacting the young planets. When the solar wind began (Chapter 6), it swept out the remaining gas from around the planets, in essence evacuating the area to the current density. This effectively ended planet formation, since there is very little material left to accu- mulate into planets. The entire process, from accretion disk to planet formation occurred in only a few hundred thousand years. Solved Problems 3.1. Why are the terrestrial planets spherical in shape? The terrestrial planets are spherical because of gravity. Gravity pulls towards the center of the object, and once the force is strong enough, it can force even rock to distribute itself spherically. 3.2. Why is there so little ice in the terrestrial planets (compared to the satellites of Jovian planets)? Different elements have different condensation temperatures. The inner solar system was too hotforicestocondense,andsotheydidnotformhere.Icescouldnotformuntiltheparticles were in a much cooler part of the disk, and therefore much further from the Sun. 3.3. Why were impacts so much more common in the past than they are today? In the early solar system, there was still much debris, and many planetesimals. Since that time, most of these particles have accreted onto the larger planets and moons, so that the probability of intercepting one has become very low. 3.4. How many 100-km diameter planetesimals are needed to form an Earth-size pla- net? (Assume the planetesimals are spherical, and rocky, so that their density is 3,500 kg/m 3 .) The mass of an object is given by: CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 51"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"M ¼ \u0004 \u0004 V where \u0004 is the density and V is the volume.

Imagine a large planetesimal, about 100 km in diameter, orbiting the early Sun at a distance of 1 AU. How fast is this planetesimal traveling? Using Kepler’s third law, which states that P ð years Þ 2 ¼ a ð AU Þ 3 We find that the period of the planetesimal is 1 year, during which period it travels once around the Sun, or a total distance of 2 \u0005 \u0004 r . Since the radius of the orbit is 1 AU (1 : 5 \u0002 10 11 m), the total distance covered in 1 year is 9 : 4 \u0002 10 11 m.

So hot, in fact, that they were completely molten. During this time, the planets differentiated . That is, the material separated, with the denser, heavier materials (such as iron) sinking to the center, and the lighter materials (such as rock) floating on top. This led to a layering of materials into three distinct bands: the core , mostly iron and nickel; the mantle , denser rocks; and the crust , lighter rocks. The top of the mantle and the crust form a layer called the lithosphere . This layer is formed of relatively rigid rock. Beneath the lithosphere, the rock deforms easily although, strictly speaking, it is not molten. Only on the Earth is this litho- sphere broken into plates, which slide on the soft mantle rock below, leading to plate tectonics . The strength and thickness of the lithosphere determine which geological pro- cesses operate on the surface. A thick lithosphere suppresses volcanic activity and tectonics. The size and temperature of the interior of the planet governs the thickness of the lithosphere. Hot interiors keep the mantle fluid quite far from the core, so the lithosphere is thin. Planets with cool interiors have thick litho- spheres. CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 53 Fig. 3-1. Sequence of terrestrial planet formation and evolution."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"All planets are gradually releasing heat into space (see Fig. 3-1). Most of the heat created during the formation of the planets, as planetesimals smashed into each other, has already been lost. Planets currently releasing heat to space are generating it in their cores, as radioactive materials decay. This heat is then either conducted or convected to the surface, where it is subsequently radiated away. Conductionoccurswhenmoleculesexchangeenergy,sothattheinteriormolecules do not directly carry the energy to the surface, but rather pass it along to other molecules. Convection occurs when the molecules themselves migrate; warm material rises, and cools, and then falls. PLANETARY SURFACES Four processes shape and change planetary surfaces: impact cratering, volcanism, tectonics, and erosion. Impact cratering occurs on all planets, when objects crash into the planet and leave bowl-shaped depressions (craters) in the surface. Volcanism occurs on planets with thin lithospheres, and is the release of molten rock onto the surface of the planet (through volcanoes). Tectonics is also more common on planets with thin lithospheres, and is the deformation of the planet by internal stresses. Mountains such as the Appalachian Mountains on Earth, or valleys and cliffs such as the Guinevere Plains on Venus are examples of structures formed by tectonics. (Plate tectonics, the motion of continental plates, is a special case of tectonics, and has only been observed on the Earth so far.) Erosion is a gradual alteration of the geological features by water, wind, or ice. PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES The terrestrial planets are too small to have captured their atmospheres directly from the accretion disk. These atmospheres were formed during episodes of vol- canic activity, which released gases from the molten interior. This is called out- gassing . Infalling comets or icy planetesimals may have added to these atmospheres, although this contribution is probably small. The composition of a planet’s atmosphere has a dramatic effect on the evolu- tion of that atmosphere. The composition governs the ability to hold heat, and the ability to lose heat. Lighter planets can retain atmospheres made of heavier mole- cules (see Chapter 1 on escape velocity and the average speed of particles in a gas). CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 54"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Solved Problems 3.7. What determines the thickness of the lithosphere of a planet? Why is the thickness of the lithosphere important to the geologic evolution of the planet? The internal temperature plays a major role in determining the thickness of the lithosphere. Hot planets have thin lithospheres, and cool ones have thick lithospheres. The thickness of the lithosphere determines how geologically active the surface is. If the lithosphere is very thick, volcanoes will never occur, for example. 3.8. The bombardment era completely covered the surfaces of all the solid planets with craters. This era ended about 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, the impact rate has been relatively constant. But some places on the Moon are relatively smooth, with only a few impact craters. Explain how we can determine the age of the ‘‘smooth’’ surface from this information. Since the surfaces are smooth, they must have been laid down after the bombardment era, otherwise they would be as cratered as the rest of the Moon’s surface. By counting the number of craters per square meter, and dividing by the flux of impactors (the number per square meter per time), we find the time it has taken to make that many craters on the surface. This must be the age of the ‘‘smooth’’ surface. 3.9. Explain why Mars has no currently active volcanoes. Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and therefore cooled much more rapidly, decreasing both thetemperature and thepressure in the core,which remained at thesame volume.Mars no longer has a molten core, and therefore has no internal heat to keep the internal pressure high and drive volcanic activity. 3.10. Why is the Moon heavily cratered, but not the Earth? Since both of these objects have been around since before the end of the bombardment era, we would expect that they would have been impacted with an equal flux of impactors, and therefore should have comparable crater densities. However, the Earth has an atmosphere, and large amounts of liquid water on the surface, which have erased the craters through erosion. 3.11. If water did not condense out in the inner solar system, where did Earth’s oceans come from? There are two possibilities: first, the water may be the result of small amounts of water that were trapped in the condensing rock as the system formed; the second possibility is that the water has been carried in from the outer solar system by other bodies, comets perhaps, that impacted the Earth. CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 55"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Mercury Mercury is the smallest of the terrestrial planets, more comparable in size to the Moon than to the Earth. It is also the closest planet to the Sun, with an orbital radius of only 0.39 AU. Mercury is so close to the Sun that ordinary Newtonian gravity is not sufficient to describe its orbit. The perihelion of Mercury’s orbit advances by 574 arcseconds each century. This precession of Mercury’s orbit was one of the first successful tests of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity (a more complete theory of gravity). The rotation period (sidereal day) of Mercury is 58.65 days, exactly 2/3 of the orbital period (87.97 days). When the period and the orbit can be related to each other by a simple ratio of integers in this way, it is called a resonance , and is extremely stable. Resonances are the result of gravitational interactions. In this case, Mercury bulges to one side, and when the planet is closest to the Sun, the bulge tries to align itself with the Sun. Over time, internal friction has slowed the rotation of Mercury, so that each time it reaches perihelion, the bulge axis points to the Sun. The same tidal forces that altered the rotation are also making the orbit less elliptical. Eventually, Mercury will be tidally locked to the Sun, so that one side is always in sunlight, and the opposite side is always in darkness. Mercury is heavily cratered, like the Moon, but also contains large patches of craterless terrain. This implies that the surface of Mercury is younger than the surface of the Moon. Perhaps Mercury remained geologically active longer because it is larger than the Moon and closer to the Sun. Cooling of the interior has caused the crust to crack and shift vertically, producing ‘‘scarps,’’ which are cliffs several kilometers high and hundreds of kilometers long. A particularly spectacular impact left the Caloris Basin, a large impact crater about 1,300 kilo- meters in diameter, surrounded by circular ripples. On the opposite side of Mercury from theCaloris Basin, thesurface topographyis dramatically disturbed, apparently by the shock waves of the impact. This region is called the weird terrain. The density of Mercury is greater than the density of the Moon ( \u0003 Mercury ¼ 5,420kg = m 3 , \u0003 Moon ¼ 3,340kg = m 3 ), so it must have more heavy ele- ments than the Moon. One explanation is that during a collision with a large planetesimal, part of the mantle was blown away. Very little of Mercury’s primordial atmosphere remains. The current atmo- sphere is very thin (less than 10 6 particles/cm 3 ), and mainly formed from solar wind particles trapped by Mercury’s magnetic field, and from recently released atoms from the surface. Where did the magnetic field come from? Mercury’s core issolid,soitcannothaveamagneticfieldforthesamereasonthattheEarthorthe Sun do.

Solved Problems 3.12. Why does Mercury have no significant atmosphere? Mercury is both small (low mass), and close to the Sun, so the thermal speed of the particles in the atmosphere is high. Recall the escape velocity equation from Chapter 1, v e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 GM d r Since the mass of the planet, M , is low, the escape velocity is low, and it is relatively easy for molecules to be going fast enough to escape the gravity of Mercury. 3.13. Your friend claims to see Mercury in the sky at midnight. How do you know he’s wrong? Inorder to seean object in the skyat midnight, it must make anangle of at least 90 8 with the Sun (see Fig. 3-2). Mercury is very close to the Sun, 0.39 AU. Even when it is farthest from the Sun, the angle between Mercury and the Sun is 28 8 , quite a bit less than 90 8 . So your friend could never see Mercury (or Venus!) in the sky at midnight. 3.14. How long did astronomers have to wait for the pulse to return? (assume the Earth and Mercury were at closest approach). At closest approach, the distance between Earth and Mercury is 1 \u0003 0 : 39 ¼ 0 : 61AU.

But the astronomers also had to wait for the pulse to come back, so they had to wait a total of 10.2 minutes. 3.15. The rotation period of Mercury was first determined by bouncing a radar pulse off the surface, and measuring the Doppler shift. Draw a diagram showing how this works (Fig. 3-3). 3.16. Why do astronomers think that Mercury must have a metallic core? Mercury’s density is high compared with the Moon: it is more comparable to the density of the Earth. Therefore, it cannot be rock all the way to the center. In addition, there is a magnetic field around Mercury, which is probably a remnant of a time when it had a molten metallic core. This core might no longer be molten, but it is still metallic. 3.17. How many of Mercury’s sidereal days are there in a Mercury year? Since the rotation period of Mercury is two-thirds the orbital period, the day is two-thirds of the year. There are 1.5 Mercury days in the Mercury year. It helps to draw a diagram (Fig. 3-4).

Venus is about 0.82 Earth masses, and 95% the radius of the Earth. Here, however, the resem- blance stops.

Venus’s rotation is retrograde (oppo- site, i.e., clockwise rather than counterclockwise) to its orbit, and to the orbits and rotations of the vast majority of the rest of the solar system bodies. The rotation is also very slow; Venus’s day is about 243 Earth days. One possible explanation is thattheyoungVenuswasstruckbyalargeplanetesimal,whichturneditover,and sloweditsrotation.Thereisnodirectevidencetosupportorrefutethishypothesis. The atmosphere rotates in the same direction as the surface of the planet. Near the surface of Venus, there is very little wind. However, the upper atmosphere is a super-rotator. The upper atmosphere reaches speeds of 100 m/s near the equator, orbiting the planet in only 4 Earth days. On Earth, thin streams of atmosphere (the jet streams) reach comparable speeds, but the bulk of the atmosphere moves much more slowly. The atmosphere on Venus consists of carbon dioxide (96%) and nitrogen (3%). The atmosphere is so thick that the pressure at the surface of Venus is 90 times the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth. This is roughly equivalent to the pressure 0.5 mile under the surface of an ocean on Earth. The high pressure (plus CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 59 Fig. 3-4.

Higher up in the atmo- sphere, clouds of sulfuric acid are common. CO 2 is a greenhouse gas. It reflects infrared radiation in the atmosphere toward the surface, where it becomes trapped. This keeps heat in the atmosphere, rather thanreleasingittospace.TheCO 2 atmosphereonVenusistheresultofarunaway greenhouse effect. Early in its history, Venus probably had about the same pro- portion of water and CO 2 that the Earth did at that time. But because Venus is closer to the Sun, and therefore warmer, the water never condensed out into oceans. The oceans on Earth regulate the amount of CO 2 in the air by trapping carbon deep in the ocean, which gets recycled back into rocks. Without these oceans, the CO 2 on Venus remained in the atmosphere. As volcanoes added CO 2 to the atmosphere, there was nowhere for it to go—it just remained in the atmosphere, further increasing the temperature. As the CO 2 concentration increased, the temperature increased. With no way to remove CO 2 from the atmo- sphere, the temperature continued to increase as volcanic activity progressed, until the atmosphere reached the hot, dense state it is in now.

There are nearly 1,000 volcanoes on the surface of Venus, many of which may still be active, but dor- mant. No currently active volcanoes have yet been detected. Solved Problems 3.18. Why is Venus sometimes called the morning (or evening) star? Venusisneverfar fromtheSunin thesky, andsowhenitis visible,itappearsin themorning or evening, quite close to the Sun. Also, it is one of the brightest objects in the sky, because it is so close to both the Earth and the Sun and has a high albedo (about 0.7). Even when it is farthest from the Sun, the angle between Venus and the Sun is less than 45 8 . 3.19. Why is Venus’s atmosphere so different than Earth’s? Explain why this might be considered a ‘‘warning’’ by some scientists. Originally, these atmospheres were probably similar. But, because Venus was too warm for large liquid oceans, there was no way to scrub CO 2 from the atmosphere. When volcanoes began adding CO 2 to the atmosphere, the lack of a mechanism for recycling CO 2 on Venus made the atmospheric compositions vastly different. Whentheatmosphereof Venusbeganto accumulatehighlevels ofCO 2 ,infrared radiation (heat) was trapped in the atmosphere, increasing the temperature.

If levels of greenhouse gases continue to rise, they may trigger a runaway green- house effect of the type that produced Venus’s lethal atmosphere. 3.20. How might Venus be different if it were located at 1 A Ufrom the Sun? If Venus were located 1 A Ufrom the Sun, it would probably be more Earth-like. There would have been large quantities of liquid water on the surface, which would have recycled the CO 2 , preventing the runaway greenhouse effect. 3.21. Howmuchmoreflux(energyperm 2 )fromtheSundoesVenusreceiveeverysecond compared with Earth? Is this difference significant? Use the inverse square law (Chapter 1). Since we want to compare the flux at Venus and the Earth, we know we want to use a ratio, F Venus F Earth ¼ E Sun 4 \u0005 d 2 Sun \u0003 Venus E Sun 4 \u0005 d 2 Sun \u0003 Earth F Venus F Earth ¼ d 2 Sun \u0003 Earth d 2 Sun \u0003 Venus F Venus F Earth ¼ 1 2 0 : 72 2 ¼ 1 0 : 52 ¼ 1 : 9 So the flux at Venus is about twice the flux at the Earth. While this is a significant difference, it is not enough to explain the extreme difference in surface temperature all by itself. 3.22. What is Venus’s angular diameter when it is closest? Could you see Venus at this point in its orbit? Use the small angle formula. The distance between the Earth and Venus when they are closest is d ¼ð 1 \u0003 0 : 72 Þ AU ¼ 0 : 28AU ¼ 4 : 2 \u0002 10 10 m. From Appendix 2, the diameter of Venus is 12 \u0002 10 6 m. \b ¼ 206,265 \u0004 D d \b ¼ 206,265 \u0004 12 \u0002 10 6 4 : 2 \u0002 10 10 \b ¼ 58 : 9arcseconds This is very near the limit of the eye’s resolution (about 1 arcminute). But that’s completely irrelevant, because when Venus is closest, it is in its ‘‘new’’ phase, and just like the new Moon, it is unobservable unless it is actually in front of the Sun (and then you need a special filter to be able to observe it and not be blinded by the Sun). 3.23. How do we know that Venus has been recently resurfaced? There are few craters on the surface of Venus. Therefore, the surface must have been formed since the age of bombardment. Closer comparisons of the number of craters on Venus to the number of craters in the maria on the Moon, for example, give a better estimate of the age of the surface. 3.24.

Assuming that Venus originated from the same disk as the rest of the solar system, conservation of angular momentum suggests that the ‘‘retrograde’’ spin of Venus must be the result of a later circumstance that is unique to Venus. Earth The Earth is the largest of the terrestrial planets. It is the only one with liquid water on its surface, and the only one that is certain to support life. The Earth’s core is actually two parts: an inner solid core and an outer molten core. The inner core is composed of iron and nickel, while the outer core also contains sulfur. These two cores do not rotate at the same speed. The inner core rotates slightly faster than the outer. As the Earth gradually cools, the inner core grows (Fig. 3-5). CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 62 Fig. 3-5. The structure of the Earth."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The temperature of the core of the Earth is about 6,500K (for comparison, the Sun’s surface is ‘‘only’’ 5,800K). This core is kept hot by radioactive decay. Convection carries this heat from the deep core through the liquid core, and on through the mantle. These convective motions are very slow in the dense interior of the Earth, but have distinctly observable results: earthquakes, volcanoes, and plate tectonics all result from convection in the Earth’s interior. The rotating, metallic core also creates a magnetic field around the Earth. The overall shape of the field is something like that produced by a bar magnet (Fig. 3-6). The magnetic field traps charged particles from the solar wind. The regions where these particles are trapped are called the Van Allen belts (named after their discoverer). Sometimes these particles escape the Van Allen belts and enter the Earth’s atmosphere near the North or South Pole. The entry of these high-velocity particles into the atmosphere causes the aurorae . The lower regions of the Van Allen belts are about 4,000 km above the Earth, and are primarily populated by protons. The upper regions are populated by electrons, and are located about 16,000 km above the Earth. The magnetic field of the Earth changes with time. It weakens, reverses its North–South polarity, and strengthens again on time scales of about 10 5 years. Currently, the magnetic field is weakening. The interior of the Earth has been probed by studying earthquakes. Seismologists observe waves traveling through the Earth from the epicenter of the earthquake to other locations. This is much like a medical ultrasound, or sonogram. There are two kinds of waves that travel through the Earth. S waves aretransverse: theymove materialfromside to side, perpendicular to thedirection they are traveling. P waves are compressional, or longitudinal, like sound: they CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 63 Fig. 3-6.

S waves do not travel through the bulk of a liquid. They travel only on the surface of a liquid. Ocean waves are a good example of S waves. If the core of the Earth is liquid, we will observe no S waves from an earthquake when we observe from the far side of the Earth. Indeed, this is what is observed, so the core of the Earth is liquid. More detailed analysis has enabled us to map the entire density structure of the Earth, yielding clues about its composition. In particular, the quantity of heavy and radioactive elements can be determined from these data. The Earth’s crust is made of a series of plates that float on the mantle. As convection cells rise through the mantle, they push against the plates, moving them across the mantle. When plates split apart, or diverge , they leave a gap (or rift ),suchasthemidoceantrenchesintheAtlantic.Whentwoplatesapproachone another, or collide, one plate slides beneath another into the mantle (this is called subduction ). New material is added to the crust at the midocean ridges, and at volcanic sites, where the mantle wells up to the surface. Sometimes, as plates try to slide past one another, friction holds them still. Pressure builds, until suddenly the platesslip, andan earthquake occurs.Geologistsareableto measureplatetectonic motion using the global positioning system (GPS), and astronomers are able to measure it using arrays of radio telescopes.

The hydrogen escapes into space, the water vapor condenses and falls into the oceans. The CO 2 is dissolved in the oceans as carbonic acid, whichthenreactswithsilicaterockstoproducecarbonaterocks.OntheEarth,the atmosphere today is mainly composed of nitrogen (78%), with a significant frac- tion of oxygen (21%) added by photosynthetic processes in plants. The remaining 1% is mainly argon, an inert (noble) gas. Water, CO 2 , and various trace gases and pollutants add up to approximately 0.07% of the atmosphere. Some oxygen molecules are torn apart by ultraviolet (UV) radiation high in the atmosphere. The oxygen atoms recombine with remaining oxygen molecules to form ozone (O 3 ), which prevents UV solar radiation from reaching the surface. The ozone layer is quite sensitive to destruction by interaction with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)—molecules used by humans in refrigeration applications and in propel- lants, such as in aerosol hairspray or ‘‘air fresheners.’’ The greenhouse effect is caused by absorptive molecules in the atmosphere, which keep infrared radiation from escaping the Earth. Most light that falls on the Earth’s surface is absorbed, and re-emitted by the Earth as infrared radiation (heat). Molecules such as CO 2 and water trap this infrared radiation. If there are many of these molecules, they can cause a ‘‘runaway’’ greenhouse effect, in which the planet is heated faster than heat can be lost to space. In the case of the Earth, this process would cause the surface to heat up and the water to evaporate, adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, in turn trapping more infrared radia- tion and evaporating more water, and so on. The feedback loop is predicted to be disastrous. But this scenario considers only one small part of the entire atmo- sphere–planet interaction. Scientists remain uncertain about other feedback loops. For example, a warmer climate means more trees, which remove CO 2 from the atmosphere, cooling the planet, and perhaps stabilizing the situation. The situa- tion is extremely complicated, and few scientists claim to understand it fully. Solved Problems 3.25. Compare the Earth’s average density with the density of water (1,000kg/m 3 )and rock (3,500kg/m 3 ). What can you say about the density of the mantle and the core? The Earth’s average density is about 5,500kg/m 3 . This is much higher than the density of rock, the primary substance in the crust, and water, the primary substance on the Earth’s surface (the hydrosphere). Therefore, the densities of the mantle and the core must be higher than 3,500kg/m 3 in order for the densities to average 5,500kg/m 3 .

What fraction of the mass of the Earth is contained in the core? At first glance, these seem like the same question, but they are not, because the density of the core is different than the density of the rest of the planet. The fraction by volume is simply calculated by taking the ratio of the volume of the core to the volume of the whole planet: f volume ¼ 4 3 \u0005 \u0004 R 3 core 4 3 \u0005 \u0004 R 3 Earth f volume ¼ R 3 core R 3 Earth Using R core ¼ 1,200km and R Earth ¼ 6,378km, f volume ¼ ð 1,200km Þ 3 ð 6,378km Þ 3 f volume ¼ 0 : 007 The core of the Earth is 0.007 or about 0.7% of the entire planet, by volume.

Ozone depletion is caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and allows more ultraviolet light into the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases such as CO 2 and water vapor, and keeps infrared light from escaping the Earth’s atmosphere. While the effect of depleting the ozone layer might contribute to the infrared radiation coming from the ground (because the ultraviolet gets absorbed by the ground and re-emitted in the infrared), they are not the same physical process, and have quite different origins. 3.28.

Compare the ages of surface rocks on the Earth with the accepted age of the Earth (4.5billionyears).Theoldest surface rocksareabout3.8billion yearsold,and90% of the surface rocks are less than 600 million years old. How can you reconcile this information? The age of surface rocks seems to disagree with the accepted age of the Earth, but it is important to remember that thesurface of theEarth hasbeen recycled several times since the Earth was formed. The rocks on the surface are ‘‘new’’ rocks. They have been formed only recently by volcanoes or other tectonic processes, and so can not be used to find the age of the Earth, just the age of the surface, which varies with location. Moon TheMoon isprimarily composedof basalticrock.Becauseit lacksanatmosphere, or water on the surface, erosion (except erosion by impact of micrometeorites) is an insignificant process on the Moon. The entire history of the surface is pre- served. The interior of the Moon is solid. It has no molten core, and therefore is geologically dead. Quite sensitive seismology equipment, carried to the Moon by Apollo astronauts, detected vibrations caused by tidal interaction with the Earth, and vibrations caused by impact from meteors, but no significant moon- quakes, which would indicate a geologically active core and allow the interior to be probed. The core was active in the past, and lava flowed on the surface when giant impacts cracked the crust. This flowing lava filled in the lowlands and many craters, and created dark, smooth pools of rock, called maria (Fig. 3-8). We know that this occurred after the bulk of the craters were formed, because there are far fewer craters in the maria than elsewhere on the Moon. The highlands, also known as terrae, have a lighter appearance, are richer in calcium and aluminum, and are more heavily cratered (hence older) than the maria. The maria are richer in iron and magnesium and appear darker. The other common volcanic features on the Moon are rilles or rima : long thin structures resembling dry riverbeds. One explanation for these features is that lava tubes left by prior activity have collapsed, leaving these long, thin indentations (Fig. 3-9). Other than the maria, the most conspicuous features on the Moon are craters. There are dozens of craters on the near side of the Moon that can be distinguished even with binoculars. Bright rays often surround these craters. The rays are formed of ejected material from the crater, that is lighter in color than the sur- rounding region. Astronomers still debate the origin of the Moon. The current best explanation is that the Earth was impacted by a Mars-sized object about 4.6 billion years ago, and was partially pulverized. A large amount of ejecta was produced, which then CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 67"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 68 Fig. 3-9. Plato Rille (or Rima).

Other theories include simultaneous formation, in whichtheMoon and theEarthformedat thesametime out ofthe sameportionof the disk; gravitational capture, in which the Moon was just passing by, and was captured by the Earth’s gravitational field; and a fission theory in which the Moon split off from the Earth. The Moon rotates on its own axis with a period equal to the orbital period aroundtheEarth.ThismeansthatthesamesideoftheMoonfacestheEarthatall times. This is called synchronous rotation , and explains why the features of the Moon always look the same from Earth. The near side of the Moon has a thinner crustthanthefarside.EarlyintheMoon’shistory,impactingbodiespenetratedto the molten mantle on the near side, allowing lava to pool on the surface, and form the maria. The cooled lava is heavier than the crust material. As a result of the Earth’s gravitational attraction, the Moon has shifted its mass distribution so that it is actually heavier on the near side; therefore, that side is always falling towards the Earth. A secondary result is that the crust is thicker on the far side of the Moon. The surface of the Moon is covered with a thick layer of a fine, powdery dust called regolith . This dust layer was caused by impacts from micrometeorites, and averages many meters in depth. It is far deeper in the floors of valleys than on the slopes or ridges surrounding them. The famous photograph in Fig. 3-10 shows an astronaut’s footprint imbedded in regolith. The average density of the Moon is about 3,300kg/m 3 , implying that it is primarily composed of rock and does not have an iron core of significant size. Otherwise, the interior of the Moon has not been deeply probed. CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 69 Fig. 3-10. An astronaut’s footprint in the lunar regolith.

The maria are younger than the highlands; rocks from the maria formed about 3.8 billion years ago, and highland rocks formed 4.3 billion years ago. Solved Problems 3.30. Explain the importance of determining the ages of Moon rocks. The Moon is the closest ‘‘pristine’’ environment in the solar system. Rocks have not been cycled and recycled on the Moon (except in the maria), so the surface rocks have remained unchanged since the Moon was formed, and are the same age as the Moon. Rocks in the maria are more recent, and knowing the age of these rocks gives the age of the maria themselves. Bringing back rocks from the Moon allowed us to date them using radioactive tracers (this is similar to carbon-dating, but uses different elements), and find out how old these surfaces are. In turn, we can compare these regions on the Moon with similar regions on other planets and their moons to figure out how long ago features on other planets formed. 3.31. Does the Moon rotate on its own axis (relative to the stars)? Yes. This is best explained with a diagram (Fig. 3-11). CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 70 Fig. 3-11. The moon rotates on its axis."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"3.32. How do we know the Moon does not have a large metallic core? The primary evidence is that the density of the Moon ( \u0004 Moon ¼ 3,340kg/m 3 ) is very close to the density of rock. Therefore, the Moon is likely to be mostly made of rock. The second piece of evidence is that the Moon has no magnetic field, as usually results from amolten ironcore. We knowthe corewas molten at somepoint (because of themaria), but it probably was not made of iron; otherwise, the Moon would probably have a magnetic field like that of Mercury. 3.33. What is the difference between rilles and rays? Rilles are the result of tectonic activity—probably collapsed lava tubes. Rays, on the other hand, are the result of impacts from incoming bodies. While rilles often meander across the lunar landscape, rays are always relatively straight and always radiate away from a crater. 3.34. What is the difference between maria and the highlands? Maria are cooled basaltic lava, and are much denser (therefore heavier) than the rock which forms the highlands. Maria have fewer craters and so are presumed younger than the lunar highlands. 3.35. Why has the Moon’s interior cooled nearly completely, while the Earth’s interior remains hot? The Moon is much smaller than the Earth, and so has more surface area relative to its volume. This meant more area to radiate away heat, so the Moon cooled faster than the Earth. In addition, the Moon has much less mass, and is of lower density. Therefore, the Moon had less radioactive material to keep the core hot through radioactive decay.

The orbitalperiodofMarsis1.88years,andsotheseasonsonMarsarenearlytwiceas long as the seasons on Earth. These seasons are qualitatively similar to Earth’s, since the tilt of Mars’s rotation axis is quite similar (25 8 , compared with the Earth’s 23.5 8 ). Models of the evolution of Mars’s orbit and tilt show that in the past the tilt has varied erratically between 11 8 and 49 8 , which may have had dramatic effects on prior climatic conditions. Like the Earth, Mars has polar caps; unlike the Earth, one of these is mostly CO 2 ice. Temperatures on Mars range from 133K to 293K ( \u0004 220 8 Fto70 8 F), and the atmospheric pressure at the surface is very low, about 1/100 the pressure at the surface of the Earth. The atmosphere on Mars is 95% CO 2 , similar to the atmosphere of Venus. Because the atmosphere is so much thinner, however, there has been no runaway greenhouse effect on Mars. The atmosphere is thick enough to support tenuous water ice clouds, and enormous dust storms, some of which are over a mile high. Although Mars has no plate tectonic activity, the surface of Mars has been shapedbygeologicactivity.TheTharsisPlateaucontainsastringofvolcanoes,the CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 71"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"largest of which is Olympus Mons. This volcano is over 27,000 meters high (about three times as high as Mt. Everest), with a base 600km in diameter (an area the size of Utah). Olympus Mons grew to such enormous size because the hole in the crust that brought magma to the surface stayed stationary over geologic time scales. Also spectacular is Valles Marineris, a gigantic rift 3,000km long and up to 600km wide. In places this rift is 8km deep. This feature is not the result of plate tectonics, as it would be on the Earth. Instead, Valles Marineris is the result of the cooling and shrinking crust splitting open at the equator, much like the surface of drying clay. The red color on the surface of Mars is caused by rust—surface iron has been oxidized.Oddly,thoughthesurfaceisiron-rich,theinteriorseemstobeiron-poor. Mars has a much lower density than the other terrestrial planets (about 3,900kg/ m 3 ), and so we suspect it has little iron in its core.

Recently, Mars Global Surveyor found strong evidence for recent water flows onMars.Recentwateronthesurfaceimpliestheremaybewaterlockedjustunder the surface as permafrost. The presence of water on Mars might suggest that there has been life on Mars in the past, or that Mars may become capable of supporting life in the future. Moons of Mars Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. Both of these moons are quite small, and irregularly shaped, and are probably captured asteroids. Phobos’ longest axis is about 28km long, and Deimos’ longest axis is about 16km long. Both moons are in synchronous rotation about Mars (the same side always faces the planet). Phobos has many craters and deep cracks, while Deimos appears smoother. The orbital radii are 9.38 \u0003 10 3 km and 23.5 \u0003 10 3 km and the orbital periods are 7.7 hours and 30.2 hours for Phobos and Deimos, respectively. As the rotational period of Mars is 24.6 hours, an observer on Mars would see Phobos rising in the west and setting in the east. CHAPTER 3 Terrestrial Planets 72"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Solved Problems 3.36. What might be a result of a sudden melting of the CO 2 ice caps on Mars? (Hint: melting these caps would release large amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere.) The sudden addition of a large amount of CO 2 to the atmosphere of Mars would signifi- cantly warm the planet. With no water oceans to cycle the carbon back into rocks, it might seem that there is the potential for a runaway greenhouse effect. However, there is not nearly enough CO 2 to actually cause a runaway greenhouse effect. Mars is much less massive than Venus, and so the atmosphere might not remain on the planet, particularly if it becomes very warm (whether or not the atmosphere would ‘‘stick’’ depends on how warm it becomes). At least temporarily, the temperature would rise. 3.37. How might you measure the mass of Mars from the orbits of one of its moons? From Chapter 1, the period, the masses of the orbiting bodies, and the distance between them are all related: P 2 ¼ 4 \u0005 2 a 3 G ð m þ M Þ The distance of the moon from Mars ( a ) can be measured from pictures of the orbit over time. Converting to a linear distance (instead of an angular one) requires knowing the distance to Mars, but the period of Mars is observable, and so we could determine the distance from Mars to the Sun from Kepler’s third law. If we make our measurements when Mars is opposite the Earth from the Sun, the Earth–Mars distance is easily determined by subtracting the Earth–Sun distance from the Mars–Sun distance. From the same images of the Moon over time, we can determine the period of the Moon ( P ). If we assume that the mass of the Moon is small compared to Mars (a good assumption since the moons are so much smaller), we know all the factors in the equation, and can solve for M , the mass of Mars. 3.38. Why are there no volcanoes the size of Olympus Mons on Earth? There are three contributing factors. First, the continental plates move across the top of the mantle. This means that the holes through the mantle, which allow the very hot magma to cometothesurface,arenotalwaysinthesamelocationontheplates.OnEarth,wearemore likelytoobservemanysmallervolcanoesthanonehugevolcanolikeOlympusMons.Indeed, the Hawaiian islands are just such a chain, which develops as the plate slides over the mantle ‘‘hot spot.’’ Secondly, the surface gravity on Mars is significantly lower than on Earth, so that taller structures are more stable (less likely to collapse under their own weight) on Mars than on Earth. Thirdly, erosion is much more effective on the Earth than on the surface of Mars. Volcanoes that develop on Earth are worn down again by the action of wind and water. 3.39. Why do astronomers think Phobos and Deimos are captured asteroids? First, Phobos and Deimos are very asteroid-like. They are rocky, and potato-shaped.

These are all gas giant planets, with much higher masses and lower densities than the terrestrial planets. None of these planets has a solid surface. All of these planets have a large number of moons and also ring systems. The majority of the planetary mass in the solar system (99.5%) is in the Jovian planets, but they are still only 0.2% of the mass of the Sun. The physical and orbital properties of the Jovian planets are listed in Table 4-1. AlloftheJovianplanetsareflattened(oblate),sothatthediameterfrompoleto pole is less than the diameter at the equator. This is caused by their size and rapid rotation. Table 4-1 shows that the Jovian planets complete a full revolution in less than 1 Earth day, despite their tremendous size. Remarkable weather patterns are characteristic of Jovian atmospheres and the composition creates colorful effects. The Jovian atmospheres also exhibit enormous storms. This vigorous atmospheric activityiscausedbytherapidrotationof theplanetsandis drivenbyheatreleased from their interiors (see discussion below). AlloftheJovianplanetsformedintheouterpartofthesolaraccretiondisk(see Chapters 3 and 6 for more about the disk), and they are considerably richer in light elements than the terrestrial planets. The compositions of the Jovian planets are roughly comparable to that of the Sun. For example, the atomic composition of Jupiter is 90% hydrogen, 10% helium, and less than 1% trace elements. The Sun is 86% hydrogen, 14% helium, and less than 1% trace elements. Uranus and Neptune have higher portions of heavy elements than Jupiter or Saturn, but still they are a small fraction of the total mass. The similarity in composition between the Jovian planets and the Sun supports the idea that the entire solar system formed from the same well-mixed cloud. Most of our knowledge of the Jovian planets and their satellites comes from the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, and addi- tional information about Jupiter and its moons was obtained during the Galileo and Cassini missions.

Belts are low, warm, dark-colored regions that are falling through the atmosphere. Zones are high, cool, light-colored regions that are rising through the atmosphere. Jupiter has ammonia, sulfur, phosphorus, and other trace ele- ments in its atmosphere that contribute variously to the banded structures and the multicolored clouds. The Great Red Spot on Jupiter (Fig. 4-1) is one such storm, which has persisted since Galileo first observed it nearly 400 years ago. This storm changes in size, but on average is about 1 Earth diameter high, and 2 Earth diameters across. The atmospheric activity is driven by energy produced by the release of gravitational potential energy, as material falls towards the center of the planet. Most of the energywasproducedlongago,intheinitialcontractionoftheplanetmaterial,and is just now finding its way to the surface. In fact, Jupiter emits twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Jupiter has a dense core of magnesium, iron, silicon, and various ices. Jupiter’s core isabout 15 timesthemassof theEarth. Thecore has beendetectedbygravity experiments on fly-by missions such as Voyager. Scientists believe that a thick layer of metallic hydrogen surrounds Jupiter’s core. Metallic hydrogen is hydrogen that is so dense that the electrons are free to move through it freely. This is similar to the way electrons behave in metals: hence the name. The liquid metallic hydro- gen and the rapid rotation of the planet generate the strong magnetic field that surrounds Jupiter. CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 78 Table 4-1.

The core is about 13 Earth masses. Saturn also has a layer of metallic hydrogen surrounding its core, producing a large magnetic field ( metallic hydro- gen : see section on Jupiter, above). The composition of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, probably with more hydrogen, to account for the lower density. Saturn’s zones and belts are not as pronounced as Jupiter’s. The smeared appearance is due to light scattering from ammonia crystals that form the rela- tively cold upper atmosphere of the planet. Saturn’s atmosphere, like Jupiter’s, is heated by energy released from the interior of the planet. The source appears to be gravitational potential energy of helium droplets sinking to the interior. Uranus At first, Uranus was thought to be a relatively featureless planet. Voyager images showed a quite plain disk. More recently, astronomers have discovered that this was an accident of the observing season. Voyager passed near to Uranus during a CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 79 Fig. 4-1.

Uranus’srotationaxis istilted nearly 90 8 , so that it is almost in the plane of the ecliptic. Consequently, one pole faces the Sun for half the orbit, then the other. The sunward side of Uranus absorbs a lot of radiation, which should heat the planet and then drive convection toward the opposite pole. This is not observed at the surface, however, and the heat transport must take place in the deeper layers. Perhaps this mechanism is somehow responsible for keeping the surface of Uranus featureless during certain portions of its orbit. Uranus’s atmosphere contains relatively high amounts of methane, which absorbs strongly in the red, causing the reflected sunlight from the planet to appear blue. Studies of the density and flattening of Uranus indicate that the interior might consist of hydrogen, water, and a small (Earth-sized) core of rock and iron. Neptune The atmospheric composition of Neptune is similar to that of Uranus. Compared to Uranus, Neptune appears more blue, presumably due to a higher concentration of methane (2–3%) in the atmosphere. Neptune’s Great Dark Spot was first observed by Voyager 2 in the Southern Hemisphere in 1989. This storm disap- peared by the time the Hubble Space Telescope observed Neptune in 1994, but a new one had formed in the north by 1995. Neptune releases internal energy, driving supersonic winds to speeds of over 2,000 km/hr. It does not appear that the energy released is a remnant from the formation of the planet, because Neptune is much smaller than Jupiter. The exact source of the released energy is unclear. Neptune’s internal structure might be similar to that of Uranus. The interior consists of hydrogen, water, and a small (Earth-sized) core of rock and iron. Solved Problems 4.1. How does Jupiter generate its internal heat? How does the Earth generate its internal heat? Why are the two different? Jupiter generated its internal heat by giving up gravitational potential energy as material fell onto the core. The energy currently being emitted from Jupiter is energy produced in the initial rapid contraction. The Earth generates its internal heat from radioactive elements which decay in the core. The Earth is much smaller than Jupiter, and radiated away all of its gravitational potential energy long ago. CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 80"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"4.2. Why are the Jovian planets different colors? The color of a Jovian planet is a function of the composition. For example, Uranus and Neptune contain methane, and are blue. These compositions differ for each planet, depend- ing on where they condensed out of the planetary disk in the early solar system. Jupiter has quantities of other molecules, such as ammonia, and is red-orange in color. 4.3. Why is Jupiter brighter than Mars in our night sky, even though it is farther away? Jupiter has a much larger angular size than Mars: \b ¼ 206,265 \u0004 D d For Jupiter, we find that the angular size is 38 00 , while for Mars, the angular size is 6 00 .In addition, Jupiter’s albedo is higher than that of Mars, so that it reflects more of the sunlight towards the Earth. 4.4. What would happen to the temperature of the Earth’s surface if the Sun stopped shining? How about Saturn? IftheSunstopped shining,thetemperatureof theEarthwoulddropdramatically.TheEarth does not produce significant radiation from the surface. Saturn, however, produces about half of the energy emitted, and most of that is in the infrared, so the temperature would not drop as fast. 4.5. Which of the outer planets have seasons? Why? Seasons are a result of an axial tilt. Uranus certainly has extreme seasons! Saturn and Neptune, with axial tilts of 27 8 and 30 8 , respectively, also have seasons. Jupiter, however, does not, because Jupiter’s axis is tilted only 3 8 with respect to its orbital plane. Moons All of the Jovian planets have moons. Some of these are so large that if they orbited the Sun, instead of a planet, they would be considered planets themselves. It is not uncommon for astronomers to discover previously unknown moons of these planets even today. Usually, these newly discovered moons are quite small. Jupiter has 28 known moons, Saturn has 30, Uranus has 21, and Neptune has 8. We will not talk individually about each of these 87 moons. Instead, we will point out some general properties, summarize the moons in Table 4-2, and then discuss only the most interesting few. Most of the moons of the outer planets have quite low densities, less than 2,000 kg/m 3 , implying that they have large fractions of ice, probably water ice. Individual moons formed in place, are captured asteroids, or are remnants of other moons, destroyed in collisions. Triton is the only moon of a Jovian planet that does not fit one of these categories. Many of these moons are geologically active. Moons can be heated by gravita- tional contraction (like Jupiter) or by radioactive heating (like the Earth). Moons can also be heated by tidal stresses, exerted by their parent planets. As the moon CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 81"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"rotates while it is stretched out of shape by the gravitational force of its parent body, friction develops and heats the interior. The Galilean moons are the four largest of the Jupiter system, and are named after their discoverer, Galileo. The physical and orbital properties of the largest moons of the Jovian planets are listed in Table 4-2 and other information is given in Table 4-3. JUPITER’S MOONS Io. Of the four Galilean moons, Io is the closest to Jupiter. Io is geologically active. There are many active volcanoes on Io, and Fig. 4-2 shows the eruption of one of these, Prometheus.

Suppose one-third of the mass of a satellite was rock ( \u0004 ¼ 3,500kg = m 3 ), and the rest was ice ( \u0004 ¼ 900kg = m 3 ). What is the average density? To find the average density, simply add up the components of the satellite, weighted by what fraction they make up: \u0004 avg ¼ 1 3 rock þ 2 3 ice \u0004 avg ¼ 1 3 ð 3,500 Þþ 2 3 ð 900 Þ \u0004 avg ¼ 1,770kg = m 3 The average density of the satellite is 1,770 kg/m 3 . 4.7. Titan and the Moon have similar escape velocities. Why does Titan have an atmo- sphere, but the Moon does not? Titan is farther from the Sun, so its surface temperature is much lower, about 100 K. With a temperature this low, an object of this size can retain its atmosphere. A secondary consideration is that Titan is geologically active, due to tidal heating. Out- gassing geysers, which add more N 2 to the atmosphere, are constantly renewing the atmo- sphere on Titan. The Moon, on the other hand, is geologically dead. The primordial atmosphere has been lost to space, and it has no means to replenish it. 4.8. Assume one of the newly discovered moons of Jupiter has a density of about 1,800 kg/m 3 . What is its approximate composition? By comparing this density to the density of rock (3,500kg/m 3 ), we know that the moon has very little heavy metals inside. But still, the density is higher than water, by about 50%, so the object is not completely water ice. Probably, it is about half water ice and half rock. This compares well with the composition of Titan, which has a density of 1,880kg/m 3 . 4.9. A volcano on Io can throw material about 1,000 times higher than a similar volcano on Earth. Why? There are two reasons for this. First, the gravity on Io is lower, so the material is not pulled down to the surface as strongly. Secondly, there is very little atmosphere on Io, so the air resistance is less. 4.10. Why is the Earth’s Moon not kept geologically active by tidal heating? In order for a satellite to experience tidal heating, it must change its orientation relative to the planet. Since the Moon is always in the same orientation relative to the Earth, there is no friction generating heat in the interior. 4.11. Why are old, large craters on Ganymede and Callisto much shallower than those on the Moon? CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 86"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Ganymede and Callisto have shallower craters because they are icy worlds instead of rocky ones. The icy surface is less dense, and disperses more of the impact energy than the rocky surface does. Rings In addition to moons, the outer planets are also surrounded by ring systems. The most well known of these are the rings of Saturn, but Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus also have ring systems. Rings occur inside the Roche limit of a planet. TheRochelimitindicateshowclosetoaplanetanobjectcanbebeforetidalforces overcometheobject’sowngravity.Inotherwords,whenanobjectcomestooclose toa planet,the differenceinforcebetweenthe nearside andthefarside isstronger thantheforceofgravityholdingtheobjecttogether,soitdisintegrates.TheRoche limit is generally about 2.5 times the planet’s radius. Rings are transitory objects. They form when a moon, asteroid, or other solid body is demolished by tidal forces, and the particles travel in an orbit around the planet. Some of these particles travel faster than others, and they move farther fromtheplanet.Theslowonesmovecloser,andtheringspreadsout.Theparticles collide with each other, transferring energy back and forth, so that some fall inward, and some travel outward. Eventually, the whole system dissipates, with some particles added to the planet’s mass, and some escaping the system entirely. This takes a few hundred million years, an astronomically short period of time. The rings of the outer planets are very thin. When viewed edge-on, they dis- appear all together. Collisions play the major role in flattening the rings, and in keeping them flat. When a ‘‘south-bound’’ particle collides with a ‘‘north-bound’’ particle, the vertical parts of the velocities cancel out, and both particles wind up in a more ‘‘east–west’’ trajectory. Over time, the vertical motions of most particles are eliminated, and the rings become quite flat. The rings of Saturn, however, show evidence that the rings are not completely flat. In some portions of the rings, spokes appear. These spokes form very quickly, and appear as dark features across the rings. The spokes are probably the result of the collision of a small meteoroid with the rings, which vaporizes, producing charged dust. This charged dust is levitated by the magnetic field of Saturn, and casts a shadow on the rings, which appears as a spoke. All of the rings of the outer planets are made of many much thinner ringlets. A few of these ringlets are kept in place by shepherding satellites : small moons that push and pull the even smaller ring particles so that they stay in the ring. Many of the ringlets appear brighter when backlit. This means that they are made of very small particles, which prefer to scatter light forward rather than backward. Larger dust particles prefer to scatter light backward, and so are brighter when viewed from the directly illuminated side. The rings of Uranus were discovered in 1977 during an occultation of a star. As a star passed behind the rings, its light was dimmed repeatedly. Then it passed behind the planet. As the star emerged on the opposite side of the planet, and passed behind the rings again, the light was dimmed again, in a reverse of the CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"patternontheoppositeside.Voyager2observedtheringsdirectly,andfoundthey contain a great deal of fine dust. This means they must have formed quite recently (within the last 1,000 years or so), because small dust particles have easily dis- turbed orbits. Perhaps these rings are replenished by meteoroid impacts on tiny satellites. Solved Problems 4.12. If a comet came close enough to pass through the Roche limit, but was traveling fast enough to escape again, what would happen to it? The comet would break up into smaller fragments due to tidal forces. Fragments would continue to orbit the Sun but in a new orbit. 4.13. The space shuttle orbits within the Roche limit of the Earth, yet is not pulled apart by tidal forces. Why not? The Roche limit is the radius within which tidal forces overcome an object’s gravity. But the space shuttle is not held together by gravity, it is held together by bolts and welding (it has ‘‘mechanical strength’’), which are much stronger than gravity. 4.14. Why are rings thin? Are any other systems that you have learned about similar to the rings? Collisions dominate ring processes. In this case, the collisions between particles which move in and out of the rings cancel out the velocities in those directions, and the particles are left with velocity only in the plane of the ring. During the formation of the solar system, a thin disk formed. This disk was similar to the rings, because it orbited a larger body, was composed of bodies which were tiny in compar- ison, and was thin compared with its radius. 4.15. Why are some rings bright from one side, but dark from the other? The brightness of a ring, and how it scatters light, depends on the size of the particles. When the particles are small, they scatter light (reflect it in all directions). The rings will appear brightest when backlit. When the particles are large, the light will generally be reflected back in the direction from which it came, as from a mirror. These rings appear brightest when ‘‘front-lit.’’ 4.16. We see rings around planets, but theory says they don’t live very long. What does that tell you about the rings we see today? The rings that we see today must either have formed very recently, perhaps by collisions of small satellites, or they must be constantly replenished. It is likely that Saturn’s rings, which CHAPTER 4 Jovian Planets and Their Satellites 88"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"are composed of larger (meteor-sized) particles, are recently formed, since the particles haven’t collided enough times to be pulverized. Other ring systems, however, probably are replenished occasionally, since the particles tend to be quite small. 4.17. Explain an occultation and how it could be used to map the density of rings. When might this method fail to detect a ring that is actually present? An occultation occurs when a distant star passes behind an object, and the starlight gets ‘‘occluded,’’ or dimmed. This can be used to map out the density structure of rings because the pattern of dimming and brightening will indicate where the rings are dense and where they are thin. This method will fail to detect rings made of very small dust particles, which will scatter the light forward, so that it is not substantially dimmed. Supplementary Problems 4.18.

While both tails point away from the Sun, the dust tail curves ‘‘back’’ along the orbit, while the plasma tail is swept straight away from the Sun by the solar wind. These tails can be as long as 1 AU, making comets the largest objects in the solar system. However, comet tails are extremely diffuse; comet tails are more perfect vacuums than any we can make on Earth. The entire mass of a comet is less than 1 billionth the mass of the Earth. The nucleus of a comet is a few kilometers across, and contains lots of water ice and carbon dioxide ice. This nucleus is surrounded by the coma —this is the ‘‘head’’ of the comet. The coma can be over 1 millionkm across. The coma shines bothbyreflectedsunlight,andbythetransitionsofexcitedatomsandmoleculesin the gas (Fig. 5-1). Comets can be divided into two types—long-period and short-period comets. This distinction is not quite as arbitrary as it sounds, since there are two different reservoirs for comets in the solar system. The long-period comets come from the Oort cloud , a swarm of comets 50,000–100,000 A Ufrom the Sun. These comets have been in the Oort cloud since the solar system formed, and contain material that has remained the same since before the Sun formed. The Oort cloud is approximately spherical in shape, although there is probably a denser region near the plane of the solar system. An ice ball leaves the Oort cloud to become a comet when a star passes nearby (within 3 light years), and changes the ice ball’s orbit. The passage of a star slows the ice ball, so that it no longer has enough energytomaintainits orbit.Theseobjects fallintolongellipticalorbitsaroundthe Sun.

Solved Problems 5.1. How could you find out how much of a comet’s light is reflected, and how much is emitted? The reflected sunlight will have the same spectrum as the Sun. It will be a blackbody, with Sun-like emission and absorption lines. Other emission lines may be present, and all of these will be from excited molecules and atoms in the comet itself.

Just after the comet passes the perihelion of its orbit (closest approach to the Sun), the plasma tail will swing around because it always points away from the Sun. It is in this part of the orbit that the plasma tail can lead (Fig. 5-2). 5.3. Given that short-period comets come from just outside the orbit of Neptune, (a) how long is the period of a short-period comet? (b) Halley’s comet has a period of 76 years. Is it a long- or short-period comet? (a) If the comet comes from just outside the orbit of Neptune, at 30 A Ufrom the Sun, and comes to within about 1 A Uof the Sun, then the semi-major axis is approximately 15.5 AU.

If the orbit is highly inclined to the ecliptic, so that the comet cannot come from theKuiper belt, thenit is probably along-period cometfrom the Oortcloud. However, if the orbit is on the ecliptic, it could have come from either source, and further observations are necessary (of the speed, for example, or the shape of the orbit) to determine the source of the comet. 5.5 Why do the plasma and dust tails usually point in different directions? The plasma tail extends almost directly away from the Sun, while the dust tail is curved. Usually, the comet is not moving on a path which points directly toward the Sun. This is the only time that the two tails will point in exactly the same direction (Fig. 5-3). 5.6. Which would hit the Earth at higher velocity: a prograde comet (one that orbits the Sun in the same direction as the Earth) or a retrograde comet (one that orbits oppositely)? A retrograde comet would impact at higher velocity because the Earth and the comet would be heading towards each other. The prograde comet would be traveling in the same direc- tion, so the relative velocity would be lower than the actual velocity. As an analogy, imagine two cars traveling at 60 mph and at 62 mph. In a head-on collision, the impact velocity is 60 þ 62 ¼ 122mph. If the faster car hits from behind, then the impact velocity is only 62 \u0003 60 mph or 2 mph. CHAPTER 5 Debris 94 Fig. 5-3.

As it falls through the atmosphere of the Earth, it produces a bright streak of light, and is called a meteor . When it actually makes it to the surface of a planet or moon, we call the rock a meteorite . The brightest meteors are called fireballs . Sometimes these are as bright as the full moon. Micrometeorites are meteorites that are as small as sand grains. These are so small that the atmosphere slows them without heating them, and they drift to the surface of the planet. About 100 tons of micrometeorites accumulate on Earth every day. On the Moon, however, there is no atmosphere, and the micrometeorites are not slowed before they hit the surface. This is the main erosion process on the Moon, and the major contributor to the regolith. There are three basic types of meteorites: iron, stony, and stony-iron. Iron meteorites are the easiest to recognize. They are overly heavy for their size, because they have a high proportion of iron. The so-called Widmansta ̈ tten pat- terns (Fig. 5-4) are observed in polished and etched slices of these meteorites and provide evidence that these meteorites come from planetesimal-sized chunks of rock. The size of the crystals indicates how slowly the rock cooled. If the meteorite was formed at its current size, it would have cooled quickly, and these crystals wouldnothaveformed.Ifthemeteoritehad formedinalarge( 100km)object,it would have been under higher pressures, and cooled much more slowly. These patterns imply that the meteorite cooled over millions of years, which is consistent with an object the size of a planetesimal. CHAPTER 5 Debris 95 Fig. 5-4.

Consequently, stony meteorites are much less likely to be found, even though they are much more common than iron meteorites (95% of the meteorites that fall to Earth are stony meteorites). Stony meteorites have about the same density as ordinary rock, and hence are more difficult to find. Most of these stony meteorites are found in places like Antarctica, or the Sahara desert, where there are few ordinary rocks on the sur- face. Most stony meteorites contain rounded particles imbedded in the rest of the rock (Fig. 5-5). These lumps are called chondrules and the entire stony meteorite is then called a chondrite . Carbonaceous chondrites are a special kind of chondrite that contain high levels of carbon and often contain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Stony-iron meteorites , a hybrid in which pieces of metal are embedded in ordin- ary silicate rock, are less than 1% of the total number of meteorites that fall to Earth. The majority of meteorites probably come from the asteroid belt. Asteroids are large enough to have held the heat of the early solar system for millions of years. Thisallowedthemtodifferentiate,sothattheironfelltothecenter,surroundedby a thin stony-iron layer, and enveloped in a thick stone ‘‘crust.’’ When two such objects collide, the fragments consist of lots of stony meteoroids, fewer iron meteoroids, and a very small number of stony-iron meteoroids. These fragments spray away from the collision site, and a few of them eventually find their way to planets. Other sources of meteorites are comets, the Moon, and Mars. Meteor showers are caused by a different phenomenon. As comets disintegrate, they leave behind in their orbits dust and larger debris ranging in size from milli- meters to centimeters. Some of the comet orbits intersect the Earth’s orbit, so that the Earth passes through them once each year. The infall of the larger debris causes meteor showers, when the dust particles stream through the atmosphere more often than normal. These particles are not large enough, in general, to result CHAPTER 5 Debris 96 Fig. 5-5. A meterorite with chondrules.

This point is called the radiant (because the meteors radiate away from it). The location of the radiant gives the meteor shower its name. For example, the radiant of the Leonids is in the constellation Leo. The radial pattern of the meteors is a product of perspective, because the Earth is passing through the meteoroid swarm. Figure 5-6 shows a time-lapse picture of a meteor shower. Solved Problems 5.7. Why do meteorite hunters search for fireballs, but ignore meteor showers? Meteors in meteor showers are usually produced by small particles that generally burn up in theatmosphereataltitudesof30–100km.(Thesmallestonesproducenobrightstreakatall.) Fireballs are caused by larger objects, which may not completely burn up in the atmosphere. CHAPTER 5 Debris 97 Fig. 5-6. A time-lapse photograph of a meteor shower.

Why are carbonaceous chondrites fundamentally important to the question of the existence of extraterrestrial life? Carbonaceous chondrites contain amino acids, commonly known as the building blocks of life. Iftheseaminoacidsareextraterrestrialin origin,theyindicate thatthereareaminoacids in space. This means that life does not need to originate from scratch on every planet or moon independently, but could be assisted from the impact of these meteoroids. 5.9.

Express your answer in megatons of TNT (the usual unit of measure for nuclear war- heads—1 megaton of TNT ¼ 4 \u0002 10 9 joules). Convert the velocity from 30km/s to 30,000 m/s.

Why are meteor showers predictable? Meteor showers are caused when the Earth intercepts the dust left behind in the orbit of a comet. Since the Earth is at the same place in its orbit on the same day every year, it intercepts the orbit of a comet on the same day every year. 5.11.

When observations are skewed in favor of objects which are easily observed, this is called a ‘‘selection effect.’’ Explain how the distribution of known meteorites is biased by a selection effect. On Earth, the easiest meteorites to find are the iron meteorites, because they are easily distinguished by their weight. Stony meteorites are more common, but difficult to find because they closely resemble ordinary rocks. Only in places where terrestrial rocks are scarce (Antarctica, the Sahara desert), are stony meteorites easily distinguished from terres- trial rocks. This makes it far more likely that any identified meteorite is an iron meteorite, independent of the actual numbers of iron versus stony meteorites that land on the planet. 5.13. Suppose an iron meteorite has no Widmansta ̈ tten patterns. What does this indicate about the formation of the meteoroid’s parent body? ThepresenceofWidmansta ̈ ttenpatternsindicatesthattheparentbodycooledveryslowly.If there are no Widmansta ̈ tten patterns, the parent body of this rock must have cooled quite rapidly—too rapidly for these patterns to form. This in turn implies that the parent body must have been small, so that it gave up its heat quickly. 5.14. TheLeonidmeteorshowerlastsabout2days.TheEarthmoves2.5millionkmeach day. How thick is the belt of meteoroids that causes the Leonids? The Earth moves 5 million km in 2 days, so the belt of meteoroids must be 5 million km thick. Asteroids There are about 1 million asteroids larger than 1km in the solar system. The vast majority of these orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Over 8,000 of these have been individually cataloged and named, and have well-determined orbits. Although it is common to depict the asteroid belt as a dense region, asteroids are actually quite well separated, rarely approaching within 1 million km of one another. (A few asteroids have moons of their own: these are certainly the excep- tion to the rule.) All together, the asteroid belt contains about 0.1% of the mass of the Earth. The asteroids are not uniformly distributed throughout the asteroid belt. The so-called Kirkwood gaps are regions avoided by asteroid orbits. If an asteroid orbits at a radius such that its period is 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc., of Jupiter’s period, then after 2, 3, 4, etc., orbits, respectively, the asteroid will meet Jupiter in the same place, and get a gravitational tug towards the same direction in space. Because these tugs are not random, but occur over and over at the same location, the effect adds up, and the asteroid is pulled out of that orbit. This leaves gaps, where few asteroidsexist. Theasteroidsin thesegapsaregenerallyin transit, either inwardor outward. CHAPTER 5 Debris 99"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"In addition to the asteroids in the belt, some asteroids share Jupiter’s orbit. Asteroids in this special group are called Trojan asteroids, and they orbit about 60 8 ahead or behind Jupiter. Their orbits are stabilized by the combined gravity of Jupiter and the Sun. Over 150 of these are known; the largest is about 300km in size. Finally,someasteroidsare‘‘Earth-crossing’’andarepotentialimpactors.These asteroids come from three different groups—the Apollo, Aten, and Amor aster- oids. Most of these are small, less than 40km across, and so they are difficult to find in the sky. About 500 are known. Most of these will strike the Earth some time over the next 20–30 million years. Near-misses are common, and are often unpredicted. In 1990, an asteroid came closer to the Earth than the Moon. The asteroid was previously undiscovered, and was not noticed until after it had safely passed the Earth. Asteroids do not emit visible light, they only reflect it. Astronomers determine the compositions of asteroids by comparing the spectrum of the light reflected by the asteroid and the spectrum of the Sun. Absorption lines that are present in the asteroid’s spectrum, but not in the solar spectrum, must be due to elements or minerals in the asteroid. Asteroids are classified in three major groups: carbona- ceous (C), silicate (S), and metallic (M). Most asteroids are C-type asteroids, with very low albedo and no strong absorption lines. The rest are mainly S type, with an absorption feature due to a silicate mineral, olivine. TheamountoflightreflectedfromanasteroidtowardstheEarthchangesasthe asteroid tumbles through space. We can use this information to determine how quickly the asteroidsrotate. About 500 asteroids have been studied well enough to determine their rotation periods, which are generally between 3 and 30 hours. Smaller asteroids have irregular shapes. The shape of small asteroids can be determined from analysis of the amount of radiation received over time (light curve), which fluctuates with a period equal to the period of the asteroid. More radiation is received when the asteroid is viewed perpendicular to the longest axis than when viewed perpendicular to the shorter axes. Solved Problems 5.15. Why are comets icy, but asteroids are rocky? Comets formed in the outer solar system. From the section on solar system formation (Chapter 3), condensation temperatures were lower there, so that ices could form. Asteroids, however, formed in the inner solar system, where condensation temperatures were higher, keeping ices from forming. CHAPTER 5 Debris 100"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"5.16.

Explain how the inclination of Pluto’s orbit makes it impossible for Pluto to collide with Neptune, even though the orbits cross. There are two reasons for this. First, the plots of orbits as usually shown are only two- dimensional. The statement that they intersect, or cross, is misleading. The orbits cross at a location when Pluto is far above the plane of the solar system. This makes it impossible for Pluto and Neptune to ever collide. In addition, Pluto and Neptune are in resonance, much like the Trojan asteroids, so that they remain always separated by the same amount at the same points in their orbits. They will always repeat the same pattern while orbiting the Sun, which does not include a collision. 5.21. What is Pluto’s orbital period? Pluto’s major axis is 50 þ 30 ¼ 80AU.

The inter- stellar medium is seen as the dark dust lanes in the Milky Way (or in other galaxies),or byits effectsonstarlight: reddening andextinction. Itis also observed more directly as reflection or emission nebulae. Approximately 20% of the Galaxy’s mass is ISM. The ISM absorbs visible light, but at the same time emits radio waves or infrared radiation. So, while we can’t make an accurate map of the distant Galaxy in visible light, we can see distant pockets of interstellar dust and gas quite easily. Ninety-nine percent of the ISM is gas, and only 1% of the mass is dust. Even in the nebulae, which have fairly high densities (Table 6-1), the density is lower than in the best vacuums that we can achieve in a laboratory. GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS Much of the mass in the interstellar medium is grouped into clumps called giant molecular clouds. These clumps are denser than the surrounding medium, and cool enough that they can contain molecular hydrogen (and trace amounts of other molecules). A typical giant molecular cloud is about 10 pc across, and contains about 1 \u0003 10 6 solar masses. There are thousands of giant molecular clouds in the Milky Way Galaxy.

These are usually parts of giant molecular clouds: specifically, the parts surrounding hot, young stars, such as O or B types (see Chapter 7). O and B stars emit UV light, which ionizes the hydrogen in the nebula. When the electrons recombine with the protons to form hydrogen, they emit photons at wavelengths characteristic of the hydrogen spectrum. The red color of HII regions is due to the 656 nm spectral line of hydrogen. HII regions can be enormous, particularly if there is more than one O star producing UV radiation in the neighborhood. The O stars are massive, but have very short lifetimes. Consequently, the HII regions only exist for about 10 million years; when the O star exhausts its fuel, the HII region no longer has a source of ionizing photons and fades away.

The diffuse interstellar gas occupies the regions between the nebulae. It is extremely low density (therefore ‘‘diffuse’’). Diffuse interstellar gas was discovered by observing the spectra of a binary star system. Astronomer J. Hartmann observed that there were really two sets of spectral lines from the binary (one from each star, see Problem 6.8), which shifted back and forth as the stars orbited each other. In addition to the shifting lines, there were spectral lines that did not shift. The fixed lines were narrow and were identified as lines of calcium in the intervening medium. Many other atoms have been found in the interstellar medium since the discovery of calcium. In particular, neutral hydrogen has been identified by observing the 21 cm line. The 21 cm line results from a spin transition of the electron in the hydrogen atom. The electron and the proton each have a property known as the spin. When the spins of the two particles are parallel, they have more energy than when the spins are anti-parallel. The energy difference is very small, so that the photon emitted when the electron flips its spin is very low energy. That means that it has a long wavelength, 21 cm, and is observable as a radio wave. Molecules have also been detected in the diffuse interstellar gas. The first mole- cules discovered were CH, CN, and CN þ , followed by H 2 O (water) and NH 3 (ammonia). Currently, there are more than 80 known molecules in the diffuse interstellar gas, making up 0.002% of the interstellar gas. Some of these molecules are very complex, and contain as many as 16 atoms. Even amino acids have been found. Molecules are fragile, and are easily destroyed by UV radiation. For the most part, molecules only survive inside clouds, where they are protected by dust particles. INTERSTELLAR DUST There are three ways to detect the interstellar dust: infrared radiation from the warmed particles, extinction of visible light (dark patches), or reflection nebulae. 1. Dust is warmed by UV radiation, and therefore emits a blackbody spec- trum that peaks in the infrared. Figure 6-2 shows the Milky Way Galaxy in the optical and the infrared.

As in many other applications, astronomers determine the presence of atoms and mole- cules in dust clouds from their emission and absorption lines. Most of the molecular lines that it is possible to observe occur in the infrared, millimeter, or radio wavelengths. Astronomers observe dust clouds with these types of telescopes, and compare the lines observed with lines formed in laboratory experiments. 6.3. What limits the age of an HII region? HII emission is produced by gas which has been excited by UV photons. For this gas to be excited, there must be stars in the vicinity which are also producing lots of UV photons. These stars are in general of the O and B type, and so are massive and have short lifetimes. Once these stars end their lives (in about 10 million years), the HII region fades, and becomes non-luminous. 6.4. Describe the difference between reddening and extinction.

There are two ways to determine the difference between an emission and a reflection nebula. The first method is to simply look at the color of the nebula. Since nebulae are made primarily of hydrogen, which has red emission lines, emission nebulae tend to be red. Reflection nebulae, however, shine by scattering starlight, and will be the color of the stars nearest them, usually much bluer than the emission nebulae. The second method is to look more closely at the spectra of the objects. A few sharp emission lines will dominate spectra of emission nebulae, while, in general, spectra of reflection nebulae look like the spectra of the stars whose light they are scattering. 6.7.

CHAPTER 6 The Interstellar Medium 116"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Star Formation Clumps in giant molecular clouds are often sources of intense infrared radiation, the product of heated dust. If the cloud is collapsing, the dust heats up because as the dust falls in towards the center, the potential energy is released as heat. This idea of big, warm, collapsing clouds is at the center of star formation theory. The mechanism that triggers the collapse into clumps is not well understood. Two mechanisms are commonly proposed. The first is that the cloud is simply turbulent to begin with, with some clumps and some thin parts, and then grav- itational attraction and collisions make the clumps grow. The second is that winds from a supernova in the vicinity sweep up dust and gas, causing denser regions to form. Again, gravity does the majority of the work in making these clumps collapse. For a clump to collapse, it must be large enough and dense enough so that the average velocity of a particle is less than the escape velocity. Under the influence of gravity alone, clumps should take approximately 100,000 years to collapse. But we know from star counts that it must take much longer for stars to form; otherwise, there would be many more of them. The galactic magnetic field, which threads the cloud, slows the collapse. Charged par- ticles, such as protons, have a very hard time crossing magnetic field lines. When a charged particle interacts with a magnetic field line, it begins to orbit the line, and can travel easily along the field line, but not across it (Fig. 6-5). Neutral particles (like neutrons) do not have this problem, and can cross the field lines to gather in thecenteroftheclump.Afterafewmillionyears,thegravitationalforceduetothe neutral particles in the center overwhelms the magnetic field’s resistance, and mass accumulates rapidly in the core. From this point to the formation of an actual star is only 100,000 years. A protostar is a clump of a giant molecular cloud that is collapsing rapidly, but has not yet formed a star. Protostar is the stage from shortly before the gravity overcomes the magnetic field to the time that the star ignites. Recently, astron- omers have been able to acquire direct images of some of these objects with the Hubble Space Telescope (Fig. 6-6). Several things happen during the protostar stage. 1. Material falls onto the protostar . As the material falls onto the star, it becomes denser and therefore more opaque. As objects become denser and more opaque, energy/photons require longer time to escape. As a result, the temperature of the protostar begins to rise rapidly. 2. A disk forms . Rotation causes the cloud to flatten as it collapses. Also, because of conservation of angular momentum, the rotational speed of the disk increases as the material spirals inward. These disks are made of warm dust that emits in the infrared. Friction in the disk causes the material of the inner part of the disk to spiral in and the material in the outer part of the disk to spiral out. These disks will eventually disappear because of: CHAPTER 6 The Interstellar Medium 117"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"(a) evaporation by a nearby object—if a bright star is nearby, it can eva- porate the materials of the disk, and disperse it back to the interstellar medium; (b)wind dispersal—once the wind from the central star begins, it can transfer momentum to the disk particles, and disperse them back to the interstellar medium (see point 4 below); and (c) planet formation—planets may form from the disk; see Chapter 3 for more details on planet formation. 3. Temperature and pressure increase . Once the protostar becomes opaque, it can no longer radiate away the energy produced by the infalling material. This energy is trapped inside the protostar, and causes the temperature to rise. As the mass falls inward, the density increases. From the ideal gas law (Chapter 1), the result is an increase in the pressure. The pressure increase in the interior slows, but does not quite stop the collapse. 4. A wind develops . Astronomers are not quite sure why, but at this stage in the evolution, the protostar begins pushing mass away. This stops the infall of more mass. The winds produced are very massive, about 10 \u0004 7 solar masses per year, and carry with them not only energy and mass but also angular momentum.

How do astronomers know that stars are formed in giant molecular clouds? There are three key pieces of evidence that stars are formed in giant molecular clouds. First, these clouds are often the source of significant infrared radiation, implying that there are hot, bright stars shrouded by dust deep within the cloud. Secondly, astronomers often observe young stars very near to giant molecular clouds (i.e., in the center of HII regions). Since the stars are young, they have not yet had time to move far from where they formed, and so probably formed in the molecular cloud. Thirdly, the Hubble Space Telescope pictures of giant molecular clouds yield direct evidence for the presence of protostars, collapsing clouds, and evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs), which are dense star-forming pockets being excavated by brisk winds from hot young stars. 6.15. When is evaporation an important phenomenon in disk evolution? Was this mechanism important in the formation of the solar system? Evaporation is important only when there is a nearby hot, young star to evaporate the disk material. This was probably not important in the formation of our solar system because the Sun has no nearby neighbors. This is not conclusive, however, since the Sun is older than the entire lifetime of some massive stars. 6.16. What is the significance of the development of a stellar wind? The onset of the stellar wind effectively stops the infall of more mass onto the protostar. The stellar wind is also responsible for sweeping out the last of the gas remaining in the disk (see Chapters 3 and 7 for more on the topic of stellar winds). 6.17. What happens to turn a protostar into a star? A protostar is simply a clump of dense hydrogen gas and dust. It does not become a star until it begins to fuse hydrogen in the core, and thus to produce energy. 6.18. Use what you have learned about single star formation to explain how binary stars and clusters of stars might be formed? These are actually two different processes. Binary stars might be formed from the same clump, in much the same way that Jupiter and the Sun formed from the same cloud. Alternatively, if the cloud had two smaller clumps within it, they might form a binary system. Clusters of stars, on the other hand, are formed by groups of many clumps in giant molecular clouds, with single or binary stars forming from each clump. All of the clumps are bound together by gravity, however, and so are all the stars that are formed. 6.19. Suppose a clump of a giant molecular cloud rotates once every million years, and has a radius of about 0.05 light years. What is the rotation period of this clump when it has collapsed to the size of the solar system (radius ¼ 40 AU)? (Assume that the mass remains constant.) How does this compare to the orbital periods of Neptune and Pluto? (This method is an estimation, using a simplified model. The situation can be more correctly handled using the moment of inertia of the clump.)

This is very close to the orbital period of Neptune (165 years), but much less than the orbital period of Pluto (249 years). 6.20. Why does a collapsing cloud begin to heat up more rapidly as it becomes opaque? For the gravitational energy released in the collapse to escape the cloud, the photons carrying that energy must be able to escape. As the cloud becomes opaque, the photons become trapped inside the cloud. Thus the energy remains in the cloud and the tempera- ture increases. 6.21. Suppose a cool clump of a giant molecular cloud is exceptionally large, about r ¼ 10 pc across, and has a mass, M ,of1 \u0002 10 3 solar masses. Will this clump collapse to form stars? For a cloud to collapse, the average velocity must be less than 1/6 the escape velocity.

Otherwise the star’s temperature would not be stable. At the high temperatures of the stellar core, hydrogen atoms are completely stripped of their electrons and the material becomes a plasma .

Therefore, stars with larger mass have higher internal pressures and higher fusion rates and surface tempera- tures. The ideal gas law (see Chapter 1) describes the behavior of main-sequence stars.

Stars brighter than Vega have negative magnitudes. Each increase in magnitude corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of 100 1 = 5 \u000b 2 : 5 (so that an increase of five magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness of 100). The magnitudes can be used to compare the apparent brightnesses of two stars. For two stars of magnitudes m 1 and m 2 and apparent brightnesses b 1 and b 2 , respectively, we have b 1 b 2 ¼ 2 : 5 m 2 \u0004 m 1 ¼ 100 ð m 2 \u0004 m 1 Þ = 5 An intrinsicallybright star may appearfainter thananintrinsically dim starif it is much farther away. The intrinsic brightness of a star is called the luminosity , L . From the inverse square law (Chapter 1), we have b / L d 2 where b is the apparent brightness and d is the distance to the star. We define absolute magnitude as the apparent magnitude of a star at a distance of 10 pc. Again, an increase of one magnitude corresponds to a decrease in bright- ness of 2.5. The relationship between apparent magnitude, m , absolute magnitude, M , and distance, d , in parsecs, is given by m ¼ M þ 5log d 10 \u0002\u0003 This equation can be inverted to give the distance in parsecs, provided that both the absolute and the apparent magnitudes are known, CHAPTER 7 Main-Sequence Stars and the Sun 127 Fig. 7-1.

THE MOTION OF STARS Proper motion refers to the slow motion of stars with respect to other, presumably moredistant, stars.The starwith thelargest propermotionin our skyis Barnard’s star, which moves only 10.25 00 per year (1 degree per 350 years). Most stars move much less than Barnard’s star. The velocity of a star has two components: the radial velocity, v r , and the tangential velocity, v t . The radial velocity of a star is measured from the Doppler shift of the emission or absorption lines, as described in Chapter 1. The tangential velocity is obtained by multiplying the proper motion times the distance of the star.

The spectral classification led, as our understanding has increased, to a scheme in which stars are ordered by their surface temperature. The spectral classes, from hottest to coolest are: OBAFGKM. O stars are the hottest stars and M stars are the coolest stars. Each spectral class is divided into 10 subclasses, 0–9. An O0 star is the hottest, followed by an O1, O2, etc. O9 is just a little bit hotter than a B0, and so on. Most stars can be classified in this way. Table 7-1 gives spectral characteristics. The dominant color of the star is related to the temperature of the photosphere (the light-emitting layer) by Wien’s law (see Chapter 1) and provides a method to determine the star’s surface temperature. The spectral features in the classification scheme arise from absorption of the blackbody (continuous emission spectrum) from the star’s photosphere by atoms and molecules in the outer layer (the chro- mosphere ) of the star. The lines of interest in this classification scheme belong to the visible part of the spectrum (380–750 nm). A key element in understandingthe spectral behavioris that the electrons in the atom can absorb energy and move to a higher energy level. The amount of energy required to move an electron from the ground state to the first excited state is muchlargerthantheenergyrequiredtomovefromthe1stexcitedlevel tothe2nd, CHAPTER 7 Main-Sequence Stars and the Sun 128"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"and as a rule the energy steps decrease very rapidly for higher excitations. For example, in the hydrogen atom, the transition from ground state to 1st excited levelrequiresanultraviolet(UV)photon,fromthe1stto2ndavisiblephoton,and from 2nd to 3rd an infrared (IR) photon. In our classification scheme, only the 1st to 2nd transition in hydrogen will be relevant. The variation of the prominent absorption lines in the visible part of the spectrum with spectral class, and their relation to the surface temperature of the star is as follows. Hydrogen Balmer lines. Absorption lines caused by hydrogen atoms that are initially in the first excited state (see Chapter 1) are referred to as Balmer lines. At low surface temperatures, most of the hydrogen atoms are in the ground state, thereforethe Balmer lines areweak. As the temperature increases from M through A spectral classes, more and more hydrogen atoms exist in the first excited state, and the strength of the Balmer lines increases. As the temperature further increases, from B to O, more and more hydrogen atoms are excited to the second, third, etc., excited states, and the atoms in the first excited state become fewer. ThisleadstotheprogressiveweakeningoftheBalmerlines. Above12,000K, most hydrogen atoms become ionized, and have no electron to absorb light. Helium lines. The energy required to excite a helium atom from the ground state to the first excited state is very large, and requires UV photons, rather than visible photons. At temperatures above 10,000 K, the thermal energy can excite helium atoms to the first excited state. Excited helium atoms can absorb visible photons and move to a higher excitation state. At higher temperatures, more helium atoms exist at higher excitation states, and the energy required for further excitations is low,requiringIRphotons.Thus,theneutralheliumlinesweakenfromclassesBto O.

O stars often exhibit ionized-helium absorption lines. Lines from other ions and neutral atoms. In atoms with three or more electrons, each electron experiences attraction by the positive nucleus, and repulsion from the other electrons. When the atom becomes ionized, the remaining electrons are held more tightly, and the energy required for the excitation step is higher, com- pared with the corresponding steps in the neutral atom. Most elements will readily ionizeatthehighendofthetemperaturerangeofGstars;therefore,absorptionby neutral atoms is absent in types G through O. In ions, such as CaII, the transition from the ground state to the first excited state will require UV photons. However, as in the case of helium, thermal energy could excite the outer electron to a higher energy level, from which successive transitions to higher levels may be accom- plished by absorption of visible photons. At higher temperatures, the CaII lines, for example, disappearbecause the thermal collisions excite the electrons to higher energy states, and the amount of energy required for subsequent excitations is small. This happens to CaII as the temperature increases from F through A types. At even higher temperatures, the thermal energy can cause multiple ionizations, and the pattern repeats.

THE SIZE (RADIUS) OF STARS Two properties of a star contribute to its luminosity: the temperature and the size. Hot stars are brighter than cool stars of the same size. Large stars are brighter than small stars of the same temperature. Sometimes a large cool star is brighter than a small hot one. The luminosity class is a way of talking about the radius. There are five luminosity classes, labeled by Roman numerals: I. Supergiants II. Bright giants III. Giants IV. Subgiants V. Main-sequence dwarfs The vast majority of stars are dwarf stars. Our Sun is a dwarf star, and if we wanted to describe it in astronomical nomenclature, we would call it a G2V star. Its spectral class is G2, and its luminosity class is V. Be careful not to confuse type V main-sequence stars with white dwarfs, which are much smaller. White dwarfs will be discussed in Chapter 9. CHAPTER 7 Main-Sequence Stars and the Sun 130"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE MASS OF STARS There is a wide variation in the mass of stars. The smallest stars have masses of about 0 : 08 M Sun . Objects less massive than this never begin hydrogen fusion, and so are never technically considered stars. Objects just below the cutoff often emit energy produced by gravitational collapse, and are called brown dwarfs . These objects are brightest in the infrared. The most massive stars known (for example, Eta Carinae) are as large as 150 M Sun . In general, more massive main-sequence stars are larger (this rule does not necessarily apply to stars that are not main-sequence stars). Also, more massive stars have higher gravity, causing higher temperature and pressure in the core, which speeds the hydrogen fusion reaction. More massive stars produce more energy and are hotter. Since the radius is related to the luminosity, and the mass of the star governs the rate of energy production, there is a mass–luminosity relationship for main-sequence stars: L L sun ¼ M M sun \u0002\u0003 3 : 5 where L is the luminosity of the main-sequence star, L Sun is the luminosity of the Sun, M is the mass of the main-sequence star, and M Sun is the mass of the Sun. THE MAIN-SEQUENCE LIFETIME OF STARS Once hydrogen burning begins in the core of a protostar, it becomes a main- sequence star. The main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) phase is by far the largest fraction of a star’s lifetime, and therefore most stars observed in the sky are main- sequence stars. During this time, stars burn quietly, and change slowly. The length of time a star remains on the main-sequence depends on the mass. High-mass stars burn hot and die young. This is because when the mass is higher, there is more gravity, and the pressures and temperatures inside the star are higher, which enhances the rate of hydrogen fusion. The relationship between main-sequence lifetime, t , and mass, M , of a star can be expressed mathematically as t t Sun ¼ M M Sun \u0002\u0003 \u0004 2 : 5 where t Sun is the main-sequence lifetime of the Sun and M Sun is the mass of the Sun.TheSun’smain-sequencelifetimeisestimatedtobe10billionyears.Astar10 times as massive as the Sun has a main-sequence lifetime of only 30 million years. A star 0.1 times as massive as the Sun has a main-sequence lifetime of 3 trillion years. As stars begin to use up their hydrogen, they increase in size; however, the surface temperature does not change nearly as much. As the radius increases, the luminosity increases as the square of the radius. For example, during the next 5 billion years, the Sun will increase in luminosity by about 60%.

All stars are primarily composed of hydrogen, with helium the next most abundant element.

Indicate which star is Barnard’s star. 7.4. Parallax is observed as a change in the location of a star relative to the background stars. So is proper motion. Describe how to make an observation of proper motion which includes no parallax, and how to correct for proper motion in a determina- tion of parallactic distance. To determine the proper motion of a star with no parallactic complications, simply observe the star at the same time of year every year. Since the Earth is always on the same side of the Sun at the same time of year, there is no parallax. To correct for proper motion when determining the parallactic distance, first find the proper motion by the method above, then subtract this from the parallax that you have determined. 7.5. Suppose a star has a proper motion of 4 00 /year, a distance of 2.4 pc, and a radial velocity of 80 km/s. How fast is this star actually traveling through space? Is this fast or slow, compared with the motion of objects on the Earth? First, convert the proper motion to an angular velocity in 00 /s. CHAPTER 7 Main-Sequence Stars and the Sun 133 Fig. 7-2.

Stars move, but the Earth also moves. It rotates on its axis and orbits the Sun. Do these motions contribute to determinations of the radial motion of a star? If so, how might you correct for them? Yes, thesemotions do contribute to the determination of theradial motion of stars.One way to correct for this is to always measure the radial motion when the star is close to the meridian. When this is true, all the motion due to the rotation of the Earth is perpendicular to theradial motion of thestar.The velocity of the EartharoundtheSun is verywell known, and easily calculated from the size of the orbit and the length of a year. 7.7. What is the difference between absolute and apparent magnitude? The absolute magnitude sets all the stars at the same distance and so is a measure of the intrinsic brightness. The apparent magnitude is a measure of how bright it appears to be, given that it may be closer or farther than 10 pc from the Sun. 7.8.

Which has the hotter core, a 10 M Sun star or a 1 M Sun star? Why? The 10 M Sun star has the hotter core. Because there is more mass, the gravitational pressure on the core is higher. This means that the temperature must be higher, which means that hydrogen fuses to helium faster, which means more energy is produced. This increased energy production also contributes to the increase in temperature inside the Sun. 7.11.

THE PHOTOSPHERE The photosphere is the apparent surface of the Sun. At the bottom of the photo- sphere, the gas is very dense—so dense that light cannot escape. Outside of this, the density falls off by 50% every 100km. In a very short distance, the gas is so diffuse that it no longer produces enough light to be seen. All of the light comes from a layer about 200 km thick, which is about 0.03% of the Sun’s total radius. When all the visible light from the photosphere is observed at once, it looks grainy, like the surface of a basketball. This is called granulation (Fig. 7-6). This grainy appearance is caused by convection from deeper layers of the Sun. The hot bright material wells up to the surface, and spreads out, then cools and darkens, and falls back to the interior of the Sun. Each of these granules is about 1,000 km across, and lives for only about 15 minutes. Most granules simply fade, but some seem to explode, and push all the other granules about. On a larger scale is a pattern called supergranulation . Each supergranule is about 30,000 km across, and contains hundreds of granules. These are the top of convective regions that probably extend all the way to the bottom of the convective zone. These supergranules typically last about 1 day.

Around this is the penumbra . The region surround- ing a cluster of sunspots is called an active region . ObservationsofsunspotscanbeusedtofindtherotationperiodoftheSun.The Sun does not have a single rotation period, but instead rotates at different speeds depending on the solar latitude. Near the equator, the rotation period is about 25 days. Near the poles, it is longer—about 36 days. Sunspots are dark because the umbra is about 2,000 K cooler than the rest of the photosphere. Sunspots are not actually dim, however. A sunspot against the night sky would appear about 10 times as bright as the full moon. Sunspots only seem dim because the rest of the Sun is so bright. Sunspots are regions of strong magnetic fields. These magnetic fields trap the particles that have bubbled up to the surface by convection. These particles can’t cross the magnetic field lines, and so they can’t move out of the way to allow new hotmaterial to bubbleup. Theparticles cool off, andtherefore darken,but remain in place. The magnetic field comes out of the Sun at one location, and goes back into the Sunat another. This means thatsunspotsalwayscomein pairs.

Figure 7-7 shows the number of sunspots over time. The number of sunspots rises and falls quite regularly, with a cycle of about 11 years. The low numbers of sunspots found around 1800 and 1900 imply that there might be another cycle about 100 years long. CHAPTER 7 Main-Sequence Stars and the Sun 139 Fig. 7-7. The solar cycle.

Sunspotsappearabout30NorSofthesolarequatoratthebeginningofthecycle, and gradually migrate toward the equator near the end of the cycle. This pattern yields the famous ‘‘butterfly diagram,’’ shown in Fig. 7-8. The differential rotation of the Sun causes the magnetic field lines to become twisted tightly around the Sun. Eventually, the lines become so tightly twisted that they poke through the surface. The pairs of sunspots migrate—each sunspot in opposite directions—and eventually flip the magnetic field of the Sun. This causes the polarity of the sunspots to reverse in each cycle. PROMINENCES AND FLARES During most total solar eclipses, bright clouds of gas can be seen rising 50,000 km or more from the photosphere (Fig. 7-9). These are called prominences, and some- times last for 2–3 months. When prominences are seen against the surface of the Sun, they are called filaments, because they appear in projection as long thin strands. Prominences are cooler than the photosphere. Usually, prominences rise up through the outermost layers of the Sun until they burst open, and fling mass out into space. These blasts can be traveling as fast as 1,000 km/s. This is called a coronal mass ejection, and there are one or two of these each day on average. Solar flares are much more energetic and massive thanprominences.

The transition between the cool chromosphere (5,000K) and the superheated corona is abrupt; only a few thousand kilometers separate the two regions. One explanation for the high temperature of the corona is that the magnetic field interactions heat the particles. Another possibility is that only the electrons that have enough energy to get out of the chromosphere produce the corona.

HELIOSEISMOLOGY Helioseismology is the study of the oscillations of the Sun through Doppler shifts in the photosphere. This is just like studying earthquakes on the Earth (see Chapter 3). Observations of seismic waves on Earth have told us about the Earth’s interior, and observations of seismic waves on the Sun are telling us about the Sun’s interior. As on the Earth, short-wavelength vibrations sample the surface, and long-wavelength vibrations sample the depths. Carefully analyz- ing the periods of these vibrations reveals the temperature and composition of the inner layers of the Sun. Solved Problems 7.15. The total luminosity of the Sun is 4 \u0002 10 26 watts. Calculate the total number of watts that fall on a 1 m 2 sheet of paper on the Earth’s surface. (Recall the inverse square law.) Compare this number to the power output of a standard light bulb. The total luminosity of the Sun is the amount of light emitted by the entire surface area of the Sun. This means that the flux here at Earth is the total power of the Sun, divided by the surface area of a sphere the size of the Earth’s orbit: f ¼ 3 : 80 \u0002 10 26 W 4 \u0005 ð 1AU Þ 2 f ¼ 3 : 80 \u0002 10 26 W 4 \u0005 ð 1 : 50 \u0002 10 11 m Þ 2 f ¼ 1,350W = m 2 CHAPTER 7 Main-Sequence Stars and the Sun 143"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The total amount of power incident on a 1m 2 piece of paper is 1,350W.

When is the next solar maximum? When is the next solar minimum? The period of sunspot activity is 11 years. The last solar maximum was in the year 2000, and so the next solar maximum will be in 2011. The next solar minimum is in 2005. 7.17. Why does the Sun appear to have a sharp edge? The Sunappearsto haveasharpedge becauseitgoesfrom beingopaquetobeingcompletely transparent in only a few hundred kilometers. This is such a small fraction of the size of the Sun that it appears to be instantaneous. 7.18. What causes sunspots? Magnetic field lines trap material which has been convected to the surface. This trapped material cools, and becomes darker than the surrounding material, causing a ‘‘spot,’’ that persists for many days. 7.19. How hot (approximately) is the penumbra of a sunspot? The umbra of a sunspot is about 3,000K. The photosphere is about 5,000K. The penumbra is about halfway between the two in brightness, and so is probably about 4,000K. 7.20.

Why Do Stars Evolve? Stars produce energy by nuclear fusion, which converts lighter elements to heavier elements (e.g., hydrogen to helium). This changes the chemical composition in the core of the star, which changes the energy production rate, the energy escape rate, and the internal pressure. All of these changes make the star look different from the outside. We will now look in more detail at each of these changes. ENERGY PRODUCTION Therearethreekindsofenergyproductionthatcantakeplaceinthecoreofastar: hydrogen fusion, fusion of heavier elements, and gravitational collapse. HYDROGEN FUSION Hydrogen fusion occurs at temperatures of 10 million degrees kelvin (K). At thesetemperatures,theprotonsthatarethenucleiofhydrogenatomshaveenough energy to overcome the mutual repulsion due to charge. (Recall that two particles with the same charge repel each other, but particles with opposite charges attract each other.) These protons can enter the proton–proton (p–p) chain (Fig. 8-1).

Positrons are exactly like electrons except that they have a positive charge. A positron and an electron can annihilate, and produce energy in the form of gamma rays. Neutrinos are particles that have no charge, travel very near the speed of light, and have a very small amount of masswhen at rest. Neutrinos barely interact with ordinary matter at all. There are 10 million neutrinos passing through each cen- timeter of your skin each second. Most neutrinos pass through the entire Earth without interacting at all. We observe theseneutrinos with special detectorsburied deep in the Earth, which are essentially big chambers filled with a chlorine- containing fluid. Occasionally (about twice per day), a neutrino will interact with a chlorine atom, and turn it into radioactive argon. These argon atoms are collected and counted to estimate the number of neutrinos passing through the fluid. Typical protons in the center of the Sun travel at 1 million km/h at tempera- tures of 10 million K. For two protons to interact, and begin the p–p chain, they must pass within 10 \u0004 15 m of one another. Therefore, the probability of interaction is very low. If you observe an individual proton, it will take 5 billion years for that proton to become involved in the p–p chain. However, there are so many protons in the Sun that even though it takes 5 billion years for an individual proton to interact, there are still 10 34 protons interacting every second. EINSTEIN’S MASS–ENERGY RELATION The energy released from fusion comes from the transformation of mass into energy. The six hydrogen nuclei (protons) entering the proton–proton chain have more mass than the helium nucleus and two hydrogen nuclei that leave the p–p chain.

This is a very small amount of energy. But, if we multiply by 10 34 per second, we get a large energy output, equal to the energy output of the Sun. The mass of the positron is very small and was ignored in the calculation. InstarsmoremassivethantheSun,anotherprocessoperateswhichusescarbon as a catalyst to assist the fusion of hydrogen into helium. This process is called the CNO cycle, because carbon is turned into nitrogen, then into oxygen, then back into carbon plus helium. The carbon repeats the cycle. The end product of the cycle is the transformation of four hydrogen nuclei into one helium nucleus. FUSION OF HEAVIER ELEMENTS Other elements havemoreprotons thanhydrogen, and so are even morepositively charged, so that even higher temperatures and pressures are required to cause fusion. For example: 1. Helium burning . Helium is fused into carbon at 100 million K. 2. Carbon burning . Carbon begins to be burned at 500 million to 1 billion K. 3. Iron burning .Elementswhosemassisgreaterthaniron,orironitself,alluse energy when they burn. In other words, more energy goes in than comes out. This means that iron fusion or fusion of heavier elements cannot make a star shine. These heavy elements are produced when the star is no longer steadily producing energy and explodes (see Supernovae, below). CONTRACTION AND COLLAPSE Gravitationalpotentialenergyisproducedwhenmassfallsontothestar.Thetotal amount of gravitational energy in a star is given by E tot ¼ GM 2 R where G is the gravitational constant (equal to 6 : 67 \u0003 10 \u0004 11 Nm 2 = kg), M is the mass of the star, and R is its radius. For example, if the Sun were to shrink to the size of the Earth, 3 billion years worth of solar energy would be released. This process of contraction is usually slow, because energy production in the inner regions balances gravity pulling inward. CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 155"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"ENERGY ESCAPE RATE The energy escape rate is governed by the opacity (‘‘opaque-ness’’), which changes with the chemical composition. As the star’s opacity increases, the photons pro- duced cannot escape the star. This raises the temperature, and therefore the pres- sure. Usually, a star’s outer layers will swell in response to this increased pressure. IDEAL GAS PRESSURE The interior of main-sequence stars can be described by the ideal gas law (see Chapter 1). As a star evolves, the temperature and pressure must always be in equilibrium. If the pressure goes up, the temperature must go up and, conversely, ifthetemperaturegoesdown,thepressurealsofalls.Asanexample,considerwhat happens when a star runs out of hydrogen in the core. With no fuel to burn, the temperature falls, so the pressure falls, and the core of the star contracts under the influence of gravity. As the core contracts, the pressure increases, and there- fore the temperature rises. If the mass of the star is high, the temperature and pressure increases may initiate fusion of helium. When helium ignites, the tem- perature rises some more, and so does the pressure, and the star’s outer layers expand. Changing the internal pressure by changing the chemical composition has a large effect on the way the star appears on the outside. DEGENERATE GAS PRESSURE When the core of a star becomes very dense, it can no longer be described by the ideal gas law. The temperature of such star can increase without increasing the pressure. This is referred to as ‘‘degenerate gas.’’ Degenerate gas is discussed further in Chapter 9. How Do Stars Evolve? THE H-R DIAGRAM The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram ( H-R diagram ) is a plot of temperature versus luminosity for many different stars. An example is shown in Fig. 8-2. Hot stars are on the left, and low-luminosity stars are at the bottom.

As the star leaves the main sequence, it begins to change in spectacular ways. There are two ways for stars to evolve after leaving the main sequence. The process is determined by the star’s mass. Stars with mass less than 8 M Sun lose their outer layers slowly. These outer layers are illuminated by the hot core, and become ionized, glowing shells. These shells arecalled planetary nebulae ,notbecausetheyhaveanythingtodowithplanetsbut because they are round fuzzy disks when viewed through a small telescope. Stars with mass larger than 8 M Sun lose their outer layers explosively, in a supernova. These outer layers are also illuminated by the exposed core, and become ionized, but the velocities of these supernova remnants is much different from that of the planetary nebulae. In general, supernova remnants have quite large outflow velo- cities, while planetary nebulae are less energetic.

HELIUM FLASH If a star is about as massive as the Sun (<2 M Sun ), then it will undergo a helium flash while on the giant branch. During a helium flash, the star undergoes a series of changes deep within: 1. As helium ash from the hydrogen-burning shell falls onto the core, the helium core gains mass, and shrinks, increasing in density. 2. Theelectronsinthecorebecomedegenerateandthetemperatureincreases without increasing the pressure, so the core can no longer expand. 3. The hydrogen-burning shell makes more ash; the helium core continues to grow. 4. The temperature in the degenerate core rises to 100 million K; the mass in the degenerate core accumulates to 0.6 M Sun . 5. Helium fusion begins suddenly in the core. 6. Because the core is made of degenerate electrons, the pressure and tem- perature are not related. Even though the core gets hotter, the pressure stays the same, and the core does not expand. CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 158"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"7. However, the higher temperature increases the rate of helium burning, further increasing the temperature. 8. Temperature and burn rate increase until T 300 million K. For a few minutes, the energy production of the core of the star is about 100 times the entire energy production of the Milky Way Galaxy. 9. At 300 million K, the electrons stop being degenerate, the interior expands, and the temperature and density drop. 10. This is all deep inside. Most of this energy is consumed in puffing up the core. The outside of the star contracts somewhat, raising the temperature, so that it becomes a yellow giant. Stars with mass greater than 2 M Sun do not have helium flashes. The temperature risestoofastfortheelectronsto becomedegenerate.They do begintoburnhelium in their cores, just not explosively. Once helium burning begins in any star, there are two sources of energy—the helium-burning core, which is turning helium into carbon and a little bit of carbon into oxygen, and the hydrogen-burning shell, which dumps more helium into the core as it burns outward through the star. THE HORIZONTAL BRANCH On the horizontal branch, the star burns helium in the core, and hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. The stars become hotter and smaller during this phase, and move across the H-R diagram. These stars stay at about the same luminosity because,eventhoughtheyarehotter, theyaresmaller.This iscalledthehorizontal branch (Fig. 8-2). PULSATING STARS As stars move across the horizontal branch, some of them begin to pulsate. These pulsating or variable stars change in size, growing bigger and smaller repeatedly, and their luminosity changes in a periodic way. Pulsating stars are not in equili- brium. Their outer shells trap energy, heat up, and expand. As they expand they cool off, and are pulled inward by gravity, which increases their pressure. The compressed layer is denser and absorbs energy, heats up, and so on. These stars are found on the instability strip , which crosses the horizontal branch (Fig. 8-2). There are two important types of pulsating stars: \r Cepheid variables . These stars make good standard candles, because there is a period–luminosity relationship. Cepheids vary in a unique way (Fig. 8-3), and so they are easily identified. Cepheids with the same period have the same luminosity. If a star in a distant galaxy is identified as a Cepheid by looking at the light curve, then the period can be measured and, from that, the lumin- osity. The apparent magnitude can also be determined, so the distance to the star can be found using the inverse square law. The distance to galaxies can be determined to fairly good accuracy using Cepheid variables. CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 159"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\r RR Lyrae stars . These stars are small and dim, and also have a period–lumin- osity relationship. Because they are dim, they are not useful for finding dis- tances to other galaxies, but they are useful for finding distances to globular clusters (groups of many stars all bound together by gravity) in our own galaxy. These distances have been very cleverly used to find the distance to the center of the Milky Way. ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH Eventually, the star runs out of helium in the core. It moves back across the horizontal branch as the surface temperature falls, and onto the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). While on the asymptotic giant branch, a sequence of changes occur that lead to the eventual ejection of the star’s outer layers as a planetary nebula and the formation of a white dwarf star: 1. Heliumburningbeginsinthe shell ,causingtheluminositytoincrease,while the temperature remains about the same (i.e., the star gets bigger). 2. The star expands, cools, but becomes more luminous. 3. Helium builds up in a shell around the (mostly) carbon core, until there’s enough of it at high enough pressure to ignite. 4. The mass of the core increases. 5. A wind develops, and the mass-losing phase begins: the star begins to lose mass at a phenomenal rate, as much as 10 \u0004 5 solar masses ( M Sun ) per year. At this rate, the entire Sun would disappear in only 10,000 years. 6. Thislostmassmovesawayfromthestar,andformsashellaroundit,which is opaque to visible and ultraviolet light.

The dust and gas is a planetary nebula, surrounding a white dwarf . The Ring Nebula (Fig. 8-4) is a perfect example of a textbook planetary nebula. A white dwarf is a small, hot star of less than 1.4 solar masses—stellar cores more massive than this will not become white dwarfs, but will instead con- tinue to shrink to become either neutron stars or black holes. White dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 161 Fig. 8-4. The Ring Nebula.

These stars will go through a mass-losing phase, and then finally explode as supernovae. There are two types of supernovae:TypeIandTypeII.ATypeIIsupernovaistheendofastar’slife,and happens to isolated massive stars. A Type I supernova occurs in a binary system, and is not a part of the star’s evolution, but is caused by the interaction of the pair of stars. Depending on the spectral details, we have Type Ia, Ib, and Ic super- novae. Observable supernovae should happen about once each century in our galaxy. We have not seen any in our galaxy in modern times. This is because of interstellar extinction due to dust in the Galaxy (see Chapter 10), which prevents us from observing the entire Galaxy. TYPE II SUPERNOVAE The internal structure of an evolved massive star looks something like an onion. Theouterlayerisanon-burninghydrogenenvelope.Insideof thisareahydrogen- burning shell, then a helium-burning shell, then carbon, then oxygen, neon, mag- nesium, and silicon. In the center of it all is a core of iron ash. In this core, the density, pressure, and temperature in the core of the massive evolved star even- tually become high enough that the iron begins to fuse. But iron is special. It is the lightest element for which fusion absorbs energy rather than releasing it. In other words, it takes more energy to cause iron to fuse than comes out in the reaction. Once the iron ignites, the gas will cool, because the fusing iron takes heat out of the system. As the temperature falls, so does the pressure, and the core begins to collapse. The collapsing core drives the temperature still higher, to 10 billion K. When the temperature reaches 10 billion K, the photons have enough energy to tear the atoms apart in a process called photo-disintegration . All of the elements in the core—helium, carbon, oxygen, iron, etc.—are destroyed. Over 10 billion years of fusion activity is reversed in less than 1 second. Like the burning of iron, this process absorbs energy, so that the core can collapse even more. The core is now composed of only protons, neutrons, electrons, and light. As the core collapses, the density rises. CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 162 Fig. 8-5.

However, because the infalling material has gathered momentum, it overshoots the degenerate density, and the core den- sity rises to as much as 10 17 \u0004 10 18 kg = m 3 . Just like a ball hitting a wall, the material in the core rebounds from the dense, degenerate center. The rebound produces shock waves, which travel outwards at high speed, picking up material as they go. These shock waves carry material from the envelope away from the core. In other words, the star explodes. The entire process, from start of collapse to rebound, takes less than 1 second. For a few days, the supernova may be as bright as a whole galaxy of billions of stars. The equivalent of the entire lifetime energy budget of the Sun is released in this explosion—and that’s just in light energy. 100 times as much energy is carried by neutrinos. TYPE I SUPERNOVAE An evolved binary star system, in which the white dwarf star is re-accreting mass, ignites all of the carbon at once and blows the white dwarf to bits, producing an explosion of supernova brightness. SUPERNOVA REMNANTS The material lost from a supernova moves outward from the central star in much the same way that material moves away from an asymptotic giant branch star. In the case of a supernova, the resultant nebula is called a supernova remnant . The Crab Nebula (Fig. 8-6) was created by a supernova observed on Earth in AD 1054. For nearly a month, this supernova was bright enough to see in the daytime. Figure 8-6 shows what is left ‘‘now.’’ (Since the nebula is about 1,800 pc away, this image actually shows what the nebula looked like 5,400 years ago.) Doppler shifts of the gas indicate that the Crab Nebula is expanding at a rate of several thousand km/s. Where Do We Come From?

Primordial elements . In the beginning, just after the Big Bang (see Chapter 11), there were only hydrogen and helium atoms in the Universe. By the time the Universe had cooled off enough for the helium atoms to survive the intense heat, the Universe was too cool to manufacture anything hea- vier. 2. Stellar nucleosynthesis (p–p chain, helium fusion, carbon fusion, etc.) pro- duced all the elements up to iron. 3. Neutron capture (s-process) . Elementsheavierthanironcanbeformedfrom iron, by a process called neutron capture. Neutrons get absorbed by the nucleus of iron. This makes a heavy isotope (an isotope is an atom with more or less neutrons than the most abundant form of that atom) of iron. These isotopes are unstable, and decay, with the neutrons turning into protons by emission of an electron and a neutrino. The new element can, in turn, capture neutrons, grow heavier, and then decay. This is called the ‘‘s-process’’ (slow process). It happens in a regular star, and can produce atoms as heavy as bismuth. 4. Neutron capture (r-process) .Inasupernovaexplosion,therearemanymany neutrons all moving with high energy. Any element present is likely to be completely bombarded with neutrons, and to capture many of them. This is how we get elements that are heavier than bismuth. It is called the ‘‘r-process’’ (rapid process). How do we know that this is how the elements formed? 1. Neutron capture and nuclear decay are well-studied phenomena in labora- tory experiments. When the results of these experiments are combined with models of the Universe since the Big Bang, they agree quite well with observation. 2. Technetium-99 is direct evidence that heavy-element formation happens in stars. This element has a half-life of 200,000 years, an astronomically short period of time.

CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 165"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Solved Problems 8.1. What event signals the end of the main-sequence life of a star? Stars evolve off the main sequence when they run out of hydrogen in the core. At this point, they must find another way of producing energy. Usually, they begin fusing helium in the core, and hydrogen in a shell around the core. 8.2. Why does the process of creating neutrons from protons and electrons reduce the ability of a giant star to support its own weight? Protons all have the same charge, and so resist being close together. Electrons also all have the same charge, and resist being packed tightly. Neutrons, on the other hand, have no charge, and so are able to be more densely packed. 8.3. Main-sequence stars of 5 solar masses are thought to evolve to white dwarfs of 1 solar mass. What happened to the other 4 solar masses? Five solar mass stars become planetary nebulae surrounding white dwarfs. The other 4 solar masses, which are not part of the white dwarf, become the planetary nebula. 8.4. What physical property determines the ultimate fate of a star? The entire fate of a star, from main-sequence lifetime, to eventual demise, is governed by the mass of the star. The initial composition plays a small part in the length of the lifetime as well, but whether the star explodes as a supernova or as a planetary nebula is governed entirely by its mass. 8.5. Why is an iron core unable to support a star? When iron fuses, the process absorbs energy. With no energy source in the core of a star, it is unable to support itself against gravity. 8.6. Suppose that asymptotic giant branch stars did not lose mass. What effect would this have on the number of white dwarfs in the Galaxy? White dwarfs are formed when an asymptotic giant branch star loses mass, ejecting a planetary nebula, and exposing a hot central core. If these stars did not shed mass, there wouldbefarfewerwhitedwarfsintheGalaxy, butinstead, therewouldbemoresupernovae, neutron stars, and black holes, depending on the initial mass of the asymptotic giant branch star. 8.7. Only a small percentage of the energy of a Type II supernova is carried away by light and the expansion of the supernova remnant. What happens to the rest of the energy? What fraction of the total energy is disposed of in this manner? Thevastmajorityofenergyinasupernovaiscarriedawaybyneutrinos.Asstatedinthetext, 100 times as much energy is carried away by neutrinos as by light and expansion of the remnant. There are a total of 101 parts of energy (the neutrino part plus the light/expansion CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 166"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"part), of which 100 are carried away by neutrinos.

Make a flow chart (Fig. 8-7) that shows how a 4 solar mass star evolves after leaving the main sequence. 8.9. Why are most of the stars in the H-R diagram on the main sequence? Stars spend the majority of their lives on the main sequence, so the majority of stars can be found there. 8.10. How does the luminosity of a giant star compare with the luminosity of a main- sequence star of the same spectral class? Since the same spectral class means that the stars have the same temperature, each square meter of surface emits the same amount of energy (and so is the same brightness). However, CHAPTER 8 Stellar Evolution 167 Fig. 8-7. Flowchart of post-main-sequence evolution."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the giant star is much larger than the main-sequence star: the radius is about 100 times as large. Since the luminosity of the star goes like the surface area, which in turn scales as the radius squared, the giant star is 100 2 ¼ 10,000 times as bright as the main-sequence star. 8.11. Why do nuclei of elements other than hydrogen require higher temperatures to fuse? Hydrogen has the fewest number of protons of all elements. The repulsion between protons is the main impediment to fusion. Therefore elements with more protons will have to be traveling faster to overcome this repulsion. In a gas, faster atoms mean higher temperatures. 8.12. Why does chemical composition change most rapidly in the center of a star? In the center of a star, the temperatures, densities, and pressures are the highest. This means that atoms interact more often, which increases the probability of fusion occurring. More atoms interact each second, and more atoms fuse each second, so the chemical composition changes most rapidly in the core. 8.13. What effect do supernova explosions have on the makeup of interstellar gas? Supernova explosions eject lots of processed material in the remnant. As this remnant expands, the density decreases until the remnant cannot be distinguished from the rest of the interstellar medium. All of the processed material remains in the interstellar medium. So the supernova explosions ‘‘enrich’’ the interstellar medium with processed material, i.e., heavier elements than hydrogen and helium. 8.14.

The maximum mass of a neutron star is probably somewhere between 1.5 and 2.7 M Sun . Neutron stars collapse from larger stars, and during that collapse, angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, the stars are rotating very rapidly, about 1,000 times per second! They also have large magnetic fields, due to the collapse and compression of the original magnetic field of the star. One special type of neutron star is the pulsar . Pulsars are spinning neutron stars, with the magnetic field axis not aligned with the rotation axis. Along the magnetic field lines that come out of the pole are many spiraling charged particles, which emit radiation. When one of these poles is pointed towards us, we detect a flash of radio waves. When neither is pointed towards us, we don’t detect any radio waves. The whole system functions very much like a lighthouse. Figure 9-1 shows a diagram of this model.

The speed of light is 300,000 km/s, so you would be traveling at approximately 20% of the speed of light! Black Holes Main-sequence stars with masses larger than 25 M Sun become supernovae, leaving behind a core that is more massive than the neutron star, about 3 M Sun or more. Therefore the gravity is higher, and can overcome the degenerate neutron pres- sure, and the mass collapses to a black hole. The laws that apply inside a black hole remain unknown, yet it is clear that the escape velocity from the vicinity of these extremely dense objects must be very high, and possibly higher than the speed of light. Recalling the escape velocity equation (Chapter 1), and setting v ¼ c , we have c ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 GM d r and rearranging, we have d ¼ 2 GM c 2 Within this distance (the Schwarzschild radius ), nothing can escape the gravita- tional influence of the black hole. HAVE BLACK HOLES BEEN OBSERVED? We have seen stars in binary systems, where we can observe only one star, and it behaves as though it has a companion of a few solar masses. These systems are also strong sources of X-rays. There are about half a dozen of these in our galaxy, and these are possibly locations of remnants of massive stars which have become black holes. We observe the centers of galaxies (including our own) as huge sources of X- rays. Astronomers can observe the speed of rotation near the center (from the Doppler shift), and therefore determine the mass within the orbits (from the circular velocity equation). This density is too high to be anything but a black hole. CHAPTER 9 Stellar Remnants 179"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Solved Problems 9.10. If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a one solar mass (1 M Sun ) black hole, what would happen to the solar system? The solar system would become quite dark and cold, but otherwise, nothing would happen.

If the Earth were suddenly replaced by a black hole with the mass of the Earth, what would happen to the Moon? What if the black hole had the mass of the Sun? If the Earth were replaced by a black hole with the mass of the Earth, nothing would happen to the Moon. It would orbit the Earth with the same period it currently has. However, if the black hole had the mass of the Sun, the increased gravitational attraction would pull the Moon closer. Would the Moon fall into the black hole?

In general relativity, space is bent by the presence of a mass. One experiment that supported this theory showed that stars appear farther apart when viewed towards the Sun than when viewed away from the Sun. How would the results of this experiment change if space were not bent by the presence of mass? How would the results change if the space were negatively curved (so it made a ‘‘hill’’ instead of a ‘‘hole’’)? If space were not curved by mass, the positions of the stars would be unchanged no matter where they were viewed. A picture of the background stars during an eclipse could be placed on top of a picture of the stars 6 months later, and they would line up exactly. If space were negatively curved, so the mass made a ‘‘hill’’ instead of a ‘‘hole,’’ the stars would appear to move closer to the Sun during the eclipse. (The light would roll ‘‘down’’ the hill.) So the stars would appear closer together instead of farther apart. 9.13.

Since we are a part of the Milky Way, it is difficult to construct an external view. Many parts of the Galaxy are not obser- vable. However, through various methods, we have determined the size and shape of our Galaxy, and our place in it. THE CENTER In 1915,Shapleyattemptedto figure outthelocationof thecenter of thegalaxyby mapping out the positions of globular clusters. A globular cluster is a group of hundreds of thousands of stars, all tightly bound together in a ball 20–100 pc across. They have a very distinctive appearance, and so are easy to find. He discovered that 20% of the clusters lay in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, and occupied only about 2% of the sky, and inferred that the bulk of the Galaxy must lie in that direction. He used RR Lyrae stars (see Chapter 8) to estimate the distances to the globular clusters. He found that these globular clus- ters are centered on a point about 15 kpc from the Sun. Shapley reasoned that if the clusters were distributed evenly about the Galaxy (and there’s no reason to think they shouldn’t be), then the center of the Galaxy lies in the direction of Sagittarius, about 15 kpc away. Shapley didn’t know about dust, so he overesti- mated the distance to the center of the Galaxy by a factor of two. The center is actually about 8.5 kpc away. THE SHAPE We think that the Milky Way Galaxy is a spiral galaxy, composed of three parts: 1. The disk . Most of the stars in the Milky Way are located in a disk about 2 kpc thick, and about 40 kpc across. The disk is composed primarily of hot, young stars, and contains lots of dust and gas.

It is about 6 kpc across, and extends above and below the disk. There is very little gas or dust (the material required to form new stars). Therefore the bulge consists mainly of old stars. 3. The halo . The halo is primarily made up of globular clusters, and is roughly spherical in shape. It is centered on the center of the galaxy, and is about 30–40 kpc in radius. Again, there is very little dust and gas—the halo is primarily composed of old stars. Interestingly, most of these stars are low- metallicity stars, which means that they have even fewer metals than the Sun. Figure 10-1 is a schematic diagram of the Milky Way as viewed from the ‘‘top,’’ and from the ‘‘side.’’ The edge of the Galaxy is ill-defined. It is hard to say where the influence of our Galaxy ends. There are many distant globular clusters, and even a few nearby dwarf galaxies, that seem to orbit the Milky Way. Whether or not these are considered part of the Milky Way is largely subjective.

As the distance increases, the velocity does not decrease, as expected for a planetary system. Instead, the rotation curve remains flat. The deviation from planetary motion is in part due to the fact that the mass is not CHAPTER 10 Galaxies and Clusters 185"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"concentrated at one point, so that Kepler’s law does not strictly apply. More importantly, the high velocity of distant objects indicates that the mass of the Milky Way is higher than our estimate of 10 11 M Sun derived from Kepler’s law. The mass of the entire Milky Way is estimated from these measurements to be about 10 12 M Sun . However, astronomers cannot see this much matter. All of the stars and planets and dust and so on that we can either observe directly, or infer from its effects on starlight, adds up to only about 10% of the measured mass of the Milky Way: 90% of the Milky Way is made of some kind of mass that we just can’t see. We call this ‘‘missing mass’’ dark matter . There are two main ideas about what dark matter might be: 1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( WIMPs ). These are theoretical par- ticles much like neutrinos. WIMPs have some mass, but barely interact with the rest of the Universe. 2. MAssive Compact Halo Objects ( MACHOs ). These could be objects much like Uranus or Neptune—ordinary matter, but so cold that they don’t emit light of their own—or they could be small black holes. Astronomers are convinced that the majority of the Universe (not just the Galaxy) exists in some as-yet-undetected form. SPIRAL STRUCTURE Astronomers believe that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, with arms like those in the spiral galaxy NGC4414 shown in Fig. 10-3. Optical observations show hot young stars and HII regions (see Chapter 6) in three big clumps, which offer evidence for three spiral arms in our local vicinity. Out past the nearby spiral arms, optical light is extinguished by dust. Radio telescope observations of the velocities of clouds of neutral hydrogen seem consistent with a spiral arm archi- tecture. Spiralarmsarefilled withgas anddust,andthereforeareregionsof intensestar formation. There are lots of young, hot stars (O and B type) in the arms of spiral galaxies, making them brighter and bluer than the surrounding regions. Spiral arms are actually density waves. These are analogous to bunching up of cars in a highway. If you were to watch this from above, you’d see that the clump CHAPTER 10 Galaxies and Clusters 186 Fig. 10-2.

Instead, cars come uptothejam,slowdown,weavetheirwaythrough,emergeouttheotherside,and then speed up again. This seems to be the way that spiral arms work. Stars and dust clouds approach the clump, slow down, weave their way through, then speed up again on the other side. This explanation solves one of the big mysteries of spiral arms (Why don’t they ‘‘wind up’’?), by allowing the arms to consist of different stars at different times. In another model, the spiral arms are the result of supernovae explosions which trigger massive star formation in a chain-reaction pattern. This is the self-propa- gating star formation model. There are two possible explanations for the forma- tion of the arms. 1. Tidal influence of companions . Suppose two elliptical galaxies undergo a near-collision. The stars from each galaxy will be pulled toward the other unevenly across the galaxy, with the near ones being pulled more strongly than the far ones. As the galaxies pass each other, they stretch and twist in response to the changing gravitational forces. This might cause spiral arms to form. 2. Small irregularities in the disk grow . Suppose the arms form in response to small over-densities in the disk (places where there are slightly more stars than usual). Since the disk is rotating, these over-dense pockets will orbit the center, and might cause spiral arms to form. CHAPTER 10 Galaxies and Clusters 187 Fig. 10-3. Spiral Galaxy NGC4414.

What is the evidence that most of the mass in the Milky Way lies in some as-yet- undetected form? If the mass setting the outer parts in orbit was constant, then as the distance increased, the gravitational force and hence the speed, should decrease. The fact that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is flat out to great distances from the center means that the outer parts see a higher mass, which causes them to orbit at a speed higher than expected. 10.2. Using the velocity of the Sun (220 km/s), and its distance from the center of the Milky Way (8,500 pc), calculate how long it takes the Sun to orbit the center. The total distance the Sun must travel in one orbit is the circumference of a circle of radius 8,500 pc: C ¼ 2 \u0005 \u0004 R C ¼ 2 \u0005 \u0004 8,500pc C ¼ 53,400pc Multiplying by 3 \u0002 10 13 km/pc gives C ¼ 1 : 6 \u0002 10 18 km.

Projection effects (which side of the galaxy you are seeing—the short end or the long side) may complicate the classification of an elliptical. Ellipticals can also be sorted by size. Giant ellipticals are a few trillion parsecs across. Giant ellipticals contain trillions of stars. Dwarf ellipticals, on the other hand, are only about a thousand parsecs across, and contain millions of stars. There are many more dwarfs than giants, but the giants are so large that they actually contain most of the mass that’s found in elliptical galaxies. Ellipticals contain very little gas and dust. Figure 10-4 shows a few elliptical galaxies. CHAPTER 10 Galaxies and Clusters 190 Fig. 10-4. Galaxy classification.

IRREGULARS Irregular galaxies are all the galaxies that don’t fit in the other categories. In general, they are thought to be the result of collisions between galaxies. They contain a lot of dust and gas, and consequently are full of young stars. There is no regular structure. The fraction of galaxies that are irregular is small. DISTANCES TO GALAXIES The distances to galaxies have been determined ‘‘step-wise,’’ with the closest ones determined first, and then farther and farther ones. More distant galaxies have more uncertain distances, as a rule. In general, the distances to galaxies are deter- mined by comparing objects in near galaxies with similar objects in more distant ones. For the most nearby galaxies, direct measurements of Cepheid variables yield good distances. Further out, the size of the largest HII region, or the average brightness of a globular cluster can be used. The Tully-Fisher relation is used to 100 million parsecs. This relation is a correlation between the luminosity of a galaxy and the breadth of the 21 cm line. Beyond this, the size of galaxies as measured on the sky and the brightest galaxy in a cluster are used to determine the distance. These methods are summarized in Table 10-1. Beyond this, we must use Hubble’s Law , an empirical relationship between the distance to a galaxy and the speed at which it is moving away from us. This relation is discussed in detail in the next chapter. Plots of the radial velocity of galaxies versus distance yield a straight line (Fig. 10-5). This line can be described by the equation v ¼ Hd CHAPTER 10 Galaxies and Clusters 191 Table 10-1. Each distance-determination method is useful only for a certain range of distances.

Currently, the best estimate for H is 65 km/s/ Mpc (1Mpc ¼ 1Megaparsec ¼ 1million parsecs). Astronomers can find the dis- tance to a galaxy simply by measuring its radial velocity, and using this law. GALAXY DISTRIBUTION Galaxies ‘‘cluster.’’ For example, the Milky Way is part of a group of galaxies known as the Local Group. The Andromeda Galaxy is also a part of this group, and isour nearestlargeneighbor.There areabout 20 galaxiesin ourLocal Group, which are gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. Apart from the Milky Way and Andromeda, the rest of the Local Group is composed of mainly dwarf ellipticals, which are so small that their gravity does not strongly influence the Milky Way. The next nearest cluster is the Virgo cluster, which is 18 Mpc away, and 3 Mpc across. Virgo is a much larger cluster, and contains about 2,500 galaxies. There are thousands of galaxy clusters like Virgo. There are so many galaxies that if they are plotted on a map of the sky, it looks denser than the stars. Clusters also ‘‘cluster,’’ and these clusters of clusters are called superclusters . In between these superclusters are great voids. The super- clusters seem to come in sheets, so that the structure of the Universe is bubbly (although not with round bubbles), like a pile of soapsuds. The origin of these walls and voids is poorly understood. It is not clear whether galaxies formed first, then gathered into clusters, or whether big cluster-sized clouds formed first, then galaxies condensed out of them.

Suppose that we were to discover that all galaxies are actually twice as far away as we think. How would this affect Hubble’s constant? Hubble’s Law says that the velocity and the distance are related by v ¼ Hd If the distance increases by a factor of two, but the velocity remains the same, then that means thatHubble’s constant must decrease byafactor of two. The currentlyaccepted value (65 km/s/Mpc) would be revised to about 32 km/s/Mpc. 10.7. Astronomers recently claimed to have discovered the most distant galaxy known. How would they have determined this distance? The distances to the farthest galaxies are determined using Hubble’s Law. Astronomers would have measured the spectrum of the galaxy, and determined the radial velocity from theDoppler shiftsof theemission lines. Thentheywouldhaveused Hubble’sLaw to find the distance from this velocity, and the currently accepted value of Hubble’s constant. 10.8.

Why can’t Cepheid variables be used to find the distances to galaxies 100 Mpc away? To use a Cepheid variable to determine the distance to a galaxy, it must be bright enough to observe. At 100 Mpc, Cepheid variables are too faint to distinguish their light from the rest of the light from the galaxy. 10.12. The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at 266 km/s. The galaxies are approximately 1 million pc apart. How long will it be until they collide? (Assume the speed of approach remains the same.) First, convert 1 million pc to kilometers by multiplying by 3 \u0002 10 19 km/pc, to find a distance of 3 \u0002 10 19 km. To find the time it will take the Andromeda Galaxy to travel that distance at 266 km/s, divide the distance by the speed: t ¼ d v t ¼ 3 \u0002 10 19 km 266km = s t ¼ 1 : 1 \u0002 10 17 s t ¼ 3 : 5 \u0002 10 9 yr The Andromeda Galaxy will not collide with the Milky Way for 3.5 billion years.

This is about 10,000 times the amount of energy produced by the entire Milky Way Galaxy. The spectrum of an active galaxy is quite flat compared with the spectrum of a star, and in many cases contains both broad and narrow emission lines. The luminosity in the radio waves through far-infrared is dominated by synchrotron radiation—radiation produced byelectronsspiralingaroundamagneticfieldline.Theluminosityintheultraviolet is dominated by the ‘‘blue bump’’ produced by hot (10,000 K), dense gas. And the near-infrared radiation is dominated by emission from cool dust (see Fig. 10-6). The nuclei of active galaxies are only a few parsecs in size. This is determined from the fluctuation time, \t , of the total luminosity. If the luminosity fluctuates rapidly, the object must be small, so that the entire object gets the message to start varying at about the same time, and the light from the more distant parts does not have to travel significantly farther (therefore take longer) to reach the observer. If the luminosity fluctuates slowly, the object is large, because it took longer for the signal to get out to the more distant side, and for the response of that distant side to travel back across the intervening space (see Fig. 10-7). An estimate of the size of the object, D , is given by the product of the fluctuation time, \t , times the speed of light, c : D ¼ c \t CHAPTER 10 Galaxies and Clusters 196 Fig. 10-6.

It is uncertain whether these types represent truly distinct objects, or the same objects viewed at varying distances or orientations (Fig. 10-8). In radio galaxies, the radio waves come primarily from two lobes protruding on opposite sides of a central elliptical galaxy. Seyfert galaxies eject mass, like radio galaxies, but have a spiral galaxy at the central portion. The nucleus of the spiral galaxy is much more luminousthannucleiofordinaryspirals.Theradiationfromthenucleusfluctuates very rapidly ( \t is on the order of 1 hour, so the size of the nucleus is about 7 AU). Quasars (quasi-stellar radio sources) are similar to the other active galaxies and their intensities fluctuate with \t ranging from months to hours, indicating small sizes. The red shift in some spectral lines of quasars are higher than any object, indicating that quasars have the highest recession speed.

The radiation produced by the infalling material pushes outward on the outer rim of the accretion disk. For a given mass, the luminosity has an upper limit, beyond which all the outer matter would be swept away by the radiation. This is called the Eddington Luminosity , L Edd , and is given by L Edd ¼ 30,000 M M Sun L Sun where M is the mass of the black hole, M Sun is the mass of the Sun, and L Sun is the luminosity of the Sun. This equation can be turned around to give the lowest possible mass that a central black hole could have to produce the luminosity of an active galaxy. The mass could be higher, but not lower than this value, and still produce this luminosity. Active galaxies often have jets (Fig. 10-9). These jets are produced when blobs of ionizedmatter arecarried awayfrom theaccretiondisk alongthemagneticfield lines.Thespiralingmaterialproducesamagneticfieldofitsownwhichcompresses the outflowing material into a thin jet.

(If they were equally common today, we would expect to find half of them nearer than this distance and half farther.

However, in the very early Universe, no quasars are observed. The implication is that it took some time for the host galaxies and the supermassive black holes to form and start producing the large luminosities by which we identify quasars.

The study assumes that over large distances the Universe looks essentially the same from any location (the Universe is homogeneous) and that the Universelooksessentiallythesameinalldirections(theUniverseisisotropic).The assumptions are known as the cosmological principle . In addition, it is assumed that the same laws of physics hold everywhere in the Universe. Reliable astronomical records are available for the last 100 years or so. This time interval is minute by astronomical scales, which are typically on the order of 10 billion years. To study the evolution of the Universe, astronomers rely on observations of distant objects. For example, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is about 2 million light years away. This means that our photographs of M31 show the galaxy as it was 2 million years ago. The Virgo cluster of galaxies is about 50 million light years away, and the information presently received by our telescopes describethestateoftheclusterasitwas50millionyearsago.Informationreceived from galaxies that are billions of light years away pertains to the state of these objects as they were billions of years ago, when they were much younger, possibly just forming. Receiving information from distant objects is equivalent to receiving information from the past. This information is vital in reconstructing the evolu- tionary stages of the galaxies, and the Universe as a whole. As the development of testable hypotheses is limited by our present instrumental capabilities, the theories proposed are speculative. Hubble’s Law Edwin Hubble determined that there is a relation between the distance of various galaxies and their radial velocity, derived from the Doppler shift of absorption lines in the spectrum of the galaxies. The spectral lines appear red-shifted for all galaxies. This result is very significant: all galaxies are moving away from us, i.e., Copyright 2002 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click Here for Terms of Use."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"they are receding. The amount of red shift in the absorption is proportional to the distance of the galaxy. The relation, known as Hubble’s Law, is given by v ¼ Hd where v is the radial recession velocity, d is the distance, and H is the Hubble constant. Current best estimates of H are around 65 km/s/Mpc. Note that the units of H are actually inverse time. The only galaxies that deviate from Hubble’s Law are those so close that gravity dominates their behavior. Hubble’s Law and the Expansion of the Universe If the galaxies are just moving randomly through space, some near ones would move rapidly and some distant ones would move slowly. About half as many would approach as recede. The fact that all the galaxies are moving away from us does not mean that we are in a special place in the Universe. Hubble’s Law could be measured at any location in the Universe, with the same result. This means that space itself is expanding, because the more distant the galaxies are, the faster they are moving away. A two-dimensional analog is the surface of an expanding balloon. If you blow up a balloon part way, and mark little dots on it to indicate galaxies, then continue to blow it up, you will find that the distance between the dots that were most separated increased more than the distance between dots that were close together. In the same way, more distant galaxies move away faster, and so we know that the space in between grew. Fortunately, there is more evidence than simply the Hubble Law, and this evidence has con- vinced astronomers that the Universe is expanding.This evidence will be discussed later in this chapter. Hubble’s Law and the Age of the Universe According to Hubble’s Law, the recession velocity v divided by the distance d is equal to the constant 1/ H , the same for all galaxies. The ratio v /d gives the time it took for the Universe to expand to the present state. This implies that 1/ H is the age of the Universe. Using H ¼ 65km/s/Mpc, and values from Appendix 2, we can estimate the age of the Universe to be about 15 billion years. An important assumption in this estimate is that the rate of expansion is con- stant. The gravitational interaction between galaxies would tend to slow down the expansion. On the other hand, observations of Type Ia supernovae in very distant galaxies indicate recession speeds lower than predicted by Hubble’s Law. But for verydistantgalaxies,themeasuredspeedcorrespondstotheir speedsinthedistant past when the observed spectrum was emitted, i.e., the speeds in the past were slower, so the expansion has accelerated. The expansion age of the Universe is often referred to as the Hubble Time, and depends on the value of Hubble’s constant, which may include significant uncertainty. CHAPTER 11 Cosmology 204"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The uncertainties lead to some paradoxical results. For example, some globular clusters and white dwarfs seem to be older than 15 billion years, which is incon- sistent with the Hubble Time. The error may result either from stellar evolution calculations, or in the determinations of distances and velocities, or in the assump- tions. The Universe is probably not younger than 15 billion years old. Though it may be older, it’s probably not very much older. Hubble’s Law and the Size of the Universe Using the Hubble Time we can use conversions from Appendix 2 to estimate the size of the Universe as R ¼ ct ¼ 15 billion light years The Big Bang OneimplicationofHubble’sLawisthattheentireUniversewasoncemuchdenser than it is now, so that all the mass was much closer together. But Hubble’s Law is not the only piece of evidence. 1. The Universe contains mass, and gravity is the only force acting on the large scale of distances, and tends to pull mass together . This observation implies that at least one of three things is true: (i) The Universe is of finite age. Gravity hasn’t had enough time yet to collapse the Universe. (ii) The Universe is infinite in extent. There’s no center for all of the mass to fall to. (iii) The Universe is expanding faster than its own escape velocity. All the galaxies have enough speed to overcome their mutual gravitational attraction. 2. The night sky is dark . This is also known as Olbers’ paradox . Given an infinite Universe, the night sky ought to be as bright as the day. This is analogous to standing in the forest and looking through the trees. If the forest is largeenough, then you observe nothing through thetrees butmore trees. This implies that at least one of four things is true: (i) The Universe is of finite age. Light hasn’t had enough time yet to get here from the most distant places. (ii) The Universe is of finite extent. There aren’t actually enough objects out there to fill up the sky. CHAPTER 11 Cosmology 205"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"(iii) The Universe is expanding/contracting so fast that the light is getting Doppler shifted out of any band of the electromagnetic spectrum we can observe. (iv) Stars are a ‘‘new’’ phenomenon. The Universe only recently started to produce light. 3. The Universe is expanding . This implies that (i) The Universe is of finite age. (ii) Because we can measure this, we know that 1(iii) and 2(iii) above are incorrect. 4. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) exists . It is a perfect blackbody spectrum at 2.74 K. The CMBR is the same (isotropic) to a fairly high degree of precision in every direction in the sky, with only very small deviations (anisotropies). The existence of this background implies that at one time the whole Universe was the same temperature. 5. The helium abundance . The amount of helium in the Universe is about 25% of the total amount of matter. By stellar nucleosynthesis alone, it should be only about 10%. This implies that, at some time, there was a massive burning of H into He. In summary, the Universe is finite in age. It may or may not be finite in extent. At one time, the Universe was hot, compressed, and all the same temperature. Thus, the Big Bang: a hot beginning. The Big Bang was the beginning of time and space. Asking what happened before the Big Bang is a lot like asking ‘‘Where is north from the North Pole?’’ Anywhere from the North Pole is south. Any when from the Big Bang is later in time. The Big Bang is the beginning of time. There is no ‘‘before.’’ Where did the Big Bang happen is a similarly impossible question. Space itself was created in the Big Bang. There was no where ‘‘before’’ that. In a sense, the Big Bang happened everywhere. This is why the CMBR is the same everywhere. All the points in the Universe were the same point, and all of them were the same temperature. The Universe does not have a ‘‘center,’’ whether or not it is infinite. A two- dimensional analog to the finite Universe is the surface of a balloon: all points on the surface are equivalent. There are no edges, and there is no center. Note also that this means that there is no ‘‘outside.’’ 1. There is no center. The Universe is not expanding ‘‘away’’ from anything. 2. There is no ‘‘before.’’ Time began at the Big Bang. 3. The Universe is not expanding ‘‘into’’ anything. Space is created by the expansion of the Universe.

Photons of high energy (gamma rays) can create pairs of particles of matter–antimatter, e.g., electron–positron pairs. The energy of the gamma ray required to produce a particle–antiparticle pair can be calculated from Einstein’s mass–energy formula: E ¼ mc 2 , where m is the mass of the particle (also the anti- particle)and c isthespeedoflight.Wecanusethisequationtoestimatetheenergy and the temperature required for the creation of particle–antiparticle pairs. For example, the gamma ray required to produce an electron–positron pair should be at least equal to 2( m e c 2 ) plus the kinetic energy of the particles ( m e is the mass of the electron). The factor 2 accounts for the fact that two particles are created. Neglecting the kinetic energy of the particles, and using values from Appendix 2, we can estimate the energy required to be E ¼ 1 : 6 \u0003 10 \u0004 13 joules. From Wien’s Law (Chapter 1), a blackbody (the Universe) at temperature T has a wavelength maximum of \u0005 max ð m Þ¼ 0 : 0029 = T .

The Universe cooled enoughso thatthegamma rays no longer had enough energy to make protons, and a few seconds later, the temperature was too low for the creation of electron/positron pairs. Pair annihila- tion continued. The density of the Universe decreased enough that neutrinos stopped interacting with matter, and propagated almost freely. 1 to>300 seconds after the Big Bang. The protons and neutrons fused to form deuterium nuclei (heavy hydrogen). The photons still had enough energy to break deuterium apart. At about 100 seconds, the temperature had dropped to 1 billion K, and the deuterons began to survive, since a typical photon no longer had enough energy to tear them apart. Deuterium nuclei fused to form helium (see the proton–proton chain, Fig. 8-1). In addition, minute amounts of lithium and beryllium were formed. The observed abundances of these elements in primordial matter is one of the most important pieces of evidence in support of the Big Bang. CHAPTER 11 Cosmology 207"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE MATTER-DOMINATED UNIVERSE Until 100,000 years after the Big Bang, the amount of energy in the form of radiation far exceeded the amount of energy in the form of mass. Once the tem- perature falls to a few thousand K, however, two things happen: matter begins to dominate, and the Universe becomes transparent to radiation. Until this time, the Universe was opaque. Astronomers can never observe the first 100,000 years, no matter what technical improvements in telescopes occur. This is the ‘‘current’’ epochoftheUniverse.Oncethetemperaturewaslowenoughforatomstosurvive, the Universe became transparent. The time when this happened is called the ‘‘decoupling epoch’’ (because the radiation and the matter become mostly decoupled from each other), or the ‘‘recombination epoch’’ (because the electrons and the nuclei ‘‘recombine’’). Nearly all of the radiation that existed at this time is still traveling through the Universe. This is what we see when we observe the cosmic background radiation—very strongly red-shifted light, which has been traveling through the Universe since about 100,000 years after the Big Bang, and is just now reaching us. Galaxies and stars began to form at about 1 billion years after the Big Bang. THE CURVATURE OF SPACE-TIME Spaceisbent,notjustlocallybygravity,butpossiblyinalargersense,astheentire Universe may have a curvature. There are three possibilities for the curvature of the Universe. Visualizing these curvatures is far easier in two dimensions than in four. 1. 0 curvature (flat) . In two dimensions, this can be visualized as a piece of paper. A flat Universe is infinite. Someone traveling in one direction, just keeps going that way forever and ever, and never comes back around to where they started. But still, there are no boundaries, and therefore no center. Angles in triangles add up to 180 8 . The circumference of a circle is always 2 \u0001 R . All of the Euclidean geometry rules apply. 2. Positively curved . In two dimensions, this can be visualized as the surface of a sphere. In this case, the Universe is finite, yet unbounded. Someone traveling in one direction long enough comes back to where they started. In positively curved space, there are no straight lines. The shortest distance between two points is along a great circle. The circumference of circles is < 2 \u0001 R . The sum of the angles in a triangle adds up to more than 180 8 . 3. Negatively curved . In two dimensions, this is often called saddle shaped. Like flat space, negatively curved space is infinite in extent, and has no boundaries. In this kind of space, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180 8 and the circumference of a circle is > 2 \u0001 R . Generalrelativitysaysthatspaceiscurvedbythepresenceofmatter.Therefore, the density determines the curvature. If the actual density of the Universe, \u0003 ,is larger than a critical density, \u0003 c , then the Universe will have positive curvature. If CHAPTER 11 Cosmology 208"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"\u0003<\u0003 c , then the Universe will have negative curvature. If \u0003 ¼ \u0003 c , then the Universe will be flat. The critical density is extremely small ( 10 \u0004 26 kg = m 3 ). The most recent results indicate that the density of the Universe is pretty close to flat, and \u0003=\u0003 c is between 0.1 and 2. That is, the density is close to the critical density. \u0003=\u0003 c is also known as \u0003 0 (pronounced ‘‘omega-naught’’). The future of the Universe depends on the density, and therefore on the cur- vature. If astronomers can determine either the density or the curvature, then they can predict how the Universe will end. Hubble’s constant determines the expan- sionrateoftheUniverse,andtheaveragedensitydescribestheself-gravitationand curvature. If H is small, and the density is large, the Universe will recollapse. If H islarge,andthedensityissmall,theUniversewillkeepexpandingindefinitely.The dividing line between the two occurs when \u0003 0 ¼ 1, where the Universe expands until it reaches equilibrium, then stops. THE BIG CRUNCH If \u0003 0 > 1, then the Universe will slow down, stop expanding, and begin to con- tract. As this occurs, the nearby galaxies will become blue-shifted. The more distant galaxies will still appear as they were in the past, before contraction began. However, as time passes, more and more distant galaxies will begin to be blue-shifted, until we are observing the Hubble Law in reverse. Gravity accelerates the collapse, and the density and the temperature of the Universe rise. Eventually, the density and temperature get so high that the Universe can ‘‘re-explode,’’ forming a new Big Bang. THE BIG FREEZE If \u0003 0 < 1, the Universe will expand indefinitely. Binary stars and galaxy clusters collapse into each other, and the stars gradually burn out, and form black holes. On time scales of 10 32 years, protons in the Universe will decay into radiation. All particles and black holes will ‘‘evaporate’’ over time. Eventually, all the mass in the Universe disappears. All that is left is radiation, which reddens and weakens forever. INFLATION While the Big Bang model is successful in explaining many things about the Universe, it fails to explain three major observations: 1. The extreme uniformity of the CMBR in different regions of space, which were widely separated even when the Universe first became transparent. If these regions were widely separated, how did they come to the same tem- perature? This is the horizon problem. 2. The value of \u0003 0 should remain either greater than or less than 1. The \u0003 0 ¼ 1 case is sensitive to small perturbations, and is unstable. Any deviation CHAPTER 11 Cosmology 209"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"from flatness should have grown to noticeable extremes by now. This is the flatness problem. 3. The existence of large-scale structure, like walls of clusters of galaxies and voids, which are unexplained in the basic Big Bang theory. This is the structure problem. Inflation is an adjustment to the basic Big Bang which has been proposed in order to solve these problems. Essentially, inflation removes the assumption that the Universe has always expanded at the same rate. Inflation says that between about10 \u0004 34 secondsand10 \u0004 32 secondsaftertheBigBang,theUniverseunderwent an extremely accelerated expansion, caused by the separation of various funda- mental forces into individual forces. Prior to this time, these three forces (called electromagnetic, strong, and weak) were unified at the higher temperatures and pressures, and indistinguishable from one another, because they have precisely the same strengths. This rapid period of expansion solves the three problems remain- ing in the Big Bang. Adding inflation to the Big Bang theory means that the Universe prior to 10 \u0004 34 seconds was much denser than previously thought. This solves the horizon problem. With inflation, the regionsofspacethatemittedtheCMBRwereactually quite close together when the Universe became transparent. Therefore it is reason- able that they might have been the same temperature, since they could exchange heat quite easily. Theflatness problem issolved by inflationbecause duringthat rapidexpansion, the Universe expanded faster than the speed of light, so a large fraction of the Universe nowexistsbeyondwhatwilleverbe observable.Consideryourselfonthe Earth. You can see about 1 mile all around you, and the Earth looks pretty flat on that scale. However, if the Earth were smaller, you would see significant curvature over the same 1 mile scale. In the same way, because our view of the Universe is limited, we see that it is locally quite flat, even if on larger scales (or when the whole Universe was smaller), it had noticeable positive or negative curvature. Minute deviations from uniformity that existed prior to inflation were magni- fied during inflation. The process occurred so quickly that the non-uniformities wouldnothavehadtimetobecome‘‘smoothedout,’’andimprintedthemselveson the large-scale structure of the Universe. Solved Problems 11.1.

Using the Hubble Law, we can derive an age of the Universe of about 15 billion years. But this assumes the Universe is empty, so that gravity is not slowing the expansion. If the Universe is flat, and the density is the same as the critical density, the age of the Universe is about two-thirds of the Hubble Time.

This is at the low end of current estimates of the Hubble constant. 11.3. Suppose we observe a galaxy 500 Mpc away, which is moving away from us with a velocity of 30,000 km/s. If the speed has been constant throughout time, when did the Big Bang happen? The key point is that when the Big Bang happened, the galaxy would have been at 0 distance from the Milky Way. We begin with the basic equation: t ¼ d v t ¼ 500Mpc 30,000km = s t ¼ 0 : 01667Mpc \u0004 s = km Now fix the units: t ¼ 0 : 01667Mpc \u0004 s = km \u0004ð 3 : 09 \u0002 10 19 km = Mpc Þ t ¼ 0 : 0515 \u0002 10 19 s t ¼ 0 : 0515 \u0002 10 19 s \u0004ð 1yr = 3 : 16 \u0002 10 7 s Þ t ¼ 0 : 0163 \u0002 10 12 yr t ¼ 16 \u0002 10 9 yr ¼ 16 billion years Ifagalaxylikethiswereobserved,itwouldimplythattheBigBanghappenedapproximately 16 billion years ago. This is comparable to current estimates of the age of the Universe, so it would not be unusual to observe a galaxy at this distance with this recession velocity. 11.4. If H ¼ 65km/s/Mpc, the critical density is 8 \u0002 10 \u0003 27 kg = m 3 . How much mass would be enclosed in a sphere with the radius of the Earth’s orbit ( R ¼ 1AU)? Assume a flat Universe.

This mass is quite small when compared to the mass of the Earth ( M E \u000b 6 \u0002 10 24 kg). This means that the Universe has a really low density. 11.5. Compare flat universes with positively curved universes. Are they closed? finite? do they have centers? A flat universe is infinite, and open. Because it is infinite, it doesn’t make sense to ask whether it has a center. Conversely, a positively curved universe is finite and closed. But it also has no center, and is unbounded (has no edges). 11.6. If the density of the Universe is less than critical ( \u0004<\u0004 c ), what is the curvature? What is the ultimate fate of the Universe in this case? If the density is less than the critical density, then 0 < 1, so the curvature is negative. Since there is not enough gravity to reverse the expansion, the Universe will continue expanding forever. 11.7. Explain how to use globular clusters to put a lower limit on the age of the Universe (see also Problem 8.19 in Chapter 8). Globular clusters are made of stars that were all born at the same time. In addition, all the stars are approximately the same distance away, so that differences in their apparent mag- nitudes represent differences in their absolute magnitudes. Therefore, we can make an H-R diagram, plotting the magnitude of the stars versus their color or spectral type. From the location of the main sequence turn-off, we can find the age of the globular cluster. Since the globular clusters could not have been created before the Universe, the Universe must be at least as old as the oldest globular clusters. 11.8. Why were no significant amounts of elements heavier than lithium or beryllium formed in the Big Bang? IntheBigBang,conditionswereveryhot.Itwastoohotforelements heavierthanlithiumto live very long (they were almost immediately torn apart by photons). Then the Universe cooled very quickly, over just a few hundred seconds. As soon as it was cool enough for the elements to survive, it was too cool to make them. 11.9. If a gas of temperature 3000 K emitted CMBR, why does the CMBR have the spectrum of a 2.728 K blackbody? Since the radiation was emitted, space has expanded, red-shifting the radiation, so that it now represents a much cooler blackbody. 11.10. Astronomers observe several galaxies in the Local Group that actually approach the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxyisthe largest of these. Does this mean that the Hubble Law is incorrect? Why or why not? No, this does not disprove the Hubble Law. On small scales, such as the size of the Local Group, the behavior of space is dominated by gravity, rather than by expansion.

Responds . Life responds to stimuli, such as excessive heat or cold, light or darkness, etc. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR LIFE Life on Earth is based on amino acids, which are carbon-based molecules. Water seems also to be a crucial factor. Water is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve materials so that they canmove andinteract. Water isalso a liquidat a wide range of temperatures (0–100 8 C), and it can act as a temperature regulator as it absorbs heat on evaporation and releases heat on condensation. Other liquids might serve thesefunctionsforlifeelsewhere,suchasammoniaandmethylalcohol.Ammonia, however, has a smaller range of temperatures over which it is a liquid, and methyl alcohol has a low heat of vaporization, which means that methyl alcohol is not a good temperature regulator. Thus, abundance of carbon and water would indicate conditions favorable to life. Planets and moons have lots of carbon. Mars may at one time have had liquid water, and so it seems a good place to look for fossils of life. Europa currently has lots of liquid water, so it might be a good place to look for current life.

Inside, they found organic compounds, which increased in number closer to the center of the meteorite. This is unusual. Organic compounds are often found in space, and in meteorites, but in most meteorites the number decreases near the center. Also, some tube-like structures were seen near the organic compounds that resemble fossils of living organisms. However, there are other, non-biological processes that can form similar tubules, and the organic compounds are the same as those found elsewhere.

The cracks may persist for centuries before the ice fills them in again, allowing sunlight to penetrate to the water below. Also, Europa is heated from within by tidal interactions, which also provide a source of energy.

LOOKING FOR LIFE From another star, the Sun would look like a variable radio source, since the Earth and the Sun would be indistinguishable from that distance. The signal would vary with a period of 24 hours, as the Earth rotates on its axis. So, we look for life in a similar way.

For example, 300 ¼ 3 \u0003 10 2 (to make the number 300, multiply 3 by 10 twice). Combining numbers in scientific notation means following three rules. 1. Adding and subtracting . Numbers written in scientific notation can only be added and subtracted if the exponent on the 10 is the same. Then, simply add or subtract the numbers before the \u0003 . For example, 3 \u0003 10 8 þ 4 \u0003 10 8 ¼ 7 \u0003 10 8 3 \u0003 10 8 \u0004 4 \u0003 10 8 ¼\u0004 1 \u0003 10 8 and 3 \u0003 10 8 þ 4 \u0003 10 9 ¼ 3 \u0003 10 8 þ 40 \u0003 10 8 ¼ 43 \u0003 10 8 ¼ 4 : 3 \u0003 10 9 2.
