Hart Allow me to take you back in time, before David Wilcock welcomes you to thefuture. It is one A.M. on Monday, September 28, 2009: exactly 3 years, 84 days,10 hours, 11 minutes and 11 seconds before the world ends on December 21, 2012.I am in my barn in Pound Ridge, New York, writing what I think is the bestscreenplay I have ever been involved with since I was fortunate enough to havewritten the original screenplay for the motion picture Contact, having workedwith the late, great man of the universe, Carl Sagan. And then I receive ane-mail from my writing partner in California, Amanda Welles. She directs me to aYouTube site and there I have my first encounter with David Wilcock: seer,scientist, philosopher, dream reader. And he is quoting and citing passages fromtwo of the films I have written, Contact and The Last Mimzy, as if their filmiccontent were the equivalent of a cinematic Rosetta stone—unlocking the secretsof the universe. I was impressed that this young, gangly sage, part oracle andpart stand-up cosmic comedian, found so much meaning in one of the greater filmexperiences I’d had as a writer—Contact, and one of my lesser—The Last Mimzy.So I introduced myself to David and thus began a most fortuitous journey—formyself and my collaborator, Amanda Welles—that continues into the haze of 2012and the clarity beyond.I don’t know about you, but I know where I am going to be on January 1, 2013;and it won’t be buried under volcanic ash and mud from a tsunami, or crushed bya ten-mile-high tidal wave. Not this believer. I will be wherever David Wilcockis—celebrating the genesis of a new Golden Age, and enjoying every precioussecond of it. If you want doom and gloom, and a replay of the tortured end tohumankind’s existence, there is plenty of that at the multiplex. Read no furtherif you are hopeless, do not believe in the power of consciousness, and thinkthat $#.+ happens and there is nothing we as a species can do about it. Stopright here if you truly believe we are alone in the universe. As I wrote in thefilm Contact, based on Carl Sagan’s brilliant novel, regarding whether or notthe universe is populated with intelligent life: “If we are alone, seems like anawful waste of space.”But I am here to tell you: We are not alone in this universe. And we have DavidWilcock to prove it—and to guide us to this golden prophecy.From that very first encounter with David Wilcock, watching him in 2012 Enigmaon YouTube at one A.M. in the morning, I understood with great clarity thathere, finally, was a mind that was taking the time to connect the dots betweenthe human species and the rest of the cosmos—to ready us to finally becomeCitizens of the Galaxy.This was Carl Sagan’s wish as well. The time I spent with this generous,visionary man of science prepared me for this big adventure with David Wilcock.Sagan did not believe in UFOs and little green men, but he did believe in theabundance of life in the universe, and our potential to join the collectivecosmos of that life if we would only open ourselves to the possibility—and stopdestroying one another with our warring religions, small gods, and hateful,divisive dogmas and political insanities. David Wilcock has added Carl Sagan’shope for the human race to his synthesis of the cosmos and our place in it.As I write this introduction to David’s seminal work on our collective future inthe post-2012 world we will evolve into, I am filled with that same awe andchildish wonder at what is going to happen next. What is waiting for us as aspecies—to embrace and to invigorate. It ain’t going to happen if we just sitand wait. We have to understand now what our role is in this great opportunitythat begins on December 21, 2012.A line comes to mind that I wrote ten years ago, for a new animated epic that isnow in production at Fox for release in 2013. The line sums up the truth that Ifirmly believe David Wilcock is bringing from the universe to the human species.. . .“One heart beats for all. . . . All hearts beat for one.”Thank you, David Wilcock, for putting hope back on the table. Pay attention,humans. And keep your karma dry. J. V. HartPound Ridge, New York2009"},{"pageContent":"Introductionby Graham Hancock I was researching my book Fingerprints of the Gods in the early 1990s when Ifirst became aware of the so-called Mayan prophecy that the world will come toan end on December 21, 2012.It’s since become obvious—thank goodness—that there is more than one way to readthe “prophecy.”Some still favor gloom and doom but growing numbers have found good reasons tointerpret 2012 not so much as a specific date but as an epoch that has alreadybegun—a period of thirty, fifty, even a hundred years in which, though there maybe trials and tribulations, a bright new future will dawn for humanity—allowingus to manifest a higher state of consciousness and realize our full potential.David Wilcock is a leading thinker amongst the latter group—and he makes amagnificent case in the pages that follow that a golden age is indeed within ourgrasp and can be brought into manifestation if only we choose to make it so.Skeptics react to such unorthodox notions with savage attacks on those who putthem forward, and David must expect a firestorm of criticism as the influence ofthis book spreads. Indeed, if the establishment behaves true to form, then justabout everything he says here is going to be combed through for mistakes andweakness by teams of very clever people. Whatever they find—and no author everwrote a book without making at least some mistakes—will be used to suggest thateverything else in the book is wrong as well.Do not be discouraged. There is a tremendous amount of good science here, muchof it new to Western readers because it is the work of Russian scientists. Davidhas done a great service in bringing all this material together in one place forthe first time. In some cases the implications of the Russian research are soradical that it has already been outlawed or disregarded by the mainstream.Keep an open mind, especially where the establishment says “NO,” accept David’sinvitation to dig deeper into the facts, and pretty soon you will find thatthings are beginning to connect before your eyes into an entirely new patternthat you might never have considered before.It’s not my purpose to comment on all the extraordinary concepts in this bigbook of ideas, but here are three David puts forward, all closely interlinked,that particularly stand out for me:1. The visible, material realm—the collective experience that we all agree tocall the “real world”—is an emanation into three-dimensional space of aninvisible parallel universe. We cannot claim a full understanding of the “realworld” without taking account of the hidden realm that it emerges out of.2. Precisely because it is an emanation—and therefore in some senses like anillusion or a hologram—the “real world” is not a fixed and firm, immutableconstruct that can be changed only by direct physical or mechanical action.Sometimes it behaves more like a lucid dream that can be changed by the power ofthought and imagination.3. “Thoughts” are therefore “things” and we should be aware that our thoughtscan manifest tangible effects in the “real world.”In one sense these are very modern, twenty-first-century ideas that David isexploring here—ideas at the cutting edge of disciplines such as quantum physicsand consciousness research. But what draws me to all of them are the ways inwhich they also resonate deeply with ancient wisdom traditions, reminding usthat the truth is always true and indivisible, wherever—and whenever—it isexpressed.For example, the notion that the “real world” is an emanation or manifestationof a hidden realm is central to the ancient Egyptian idea of the nature ofreality expressed in documents as old as the Pyramid Texts (circa 2200 B.C.).The same idea is reworked and restated through the various recensions of theCoffin Texts, the Book of What Is in the Duat, and the Book of the Dead, andfinally trickles down into the Gnostic and Hermetic texts that began to becompiled in Greek and Latin around the time of Christ—and had a profoundinfluence on mystical Christianity.The essence of this ancient idea can be summed up in the simple and beautifulHermetic dictum “As Above So Below”—which is to say that the pattern of thingshere on earth in the “real world” (the “sensible Kosmos” as it is known in theHermetic texts) can only be understood properly when you realize that itmanifests the workings of a higher, unseen domain:“If you consider the whole you will learn that in truth the sensible Kosmositself, with all things that are therein, is woven like a garment by that higherKosmos.”1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en1] Or put another way, there exists a Kosmos that is “imperceptible to sense. Thissensible Kosmos [i.e., the “real world”] has been made in the image of thatother Kosmos and reproduces eternity in a copy.”2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en2]I can see no difference between the Hermetic Kosmos “imperceptible tosense”—which weaves the visible Kosmos like a garment—and David’s concept of theSource Field, undetected as yet by our conventional scientific instruments, butshaping and defining every aspect of our reality.What the Hermetic texts say about the cyclical nature of time and itsinterpenetration with matter also gels nicely with the latest science on thesubject brought together by David in these pages. After you’ve finished TheSource Field Investigations, come back here and reread the three passages fromthe Hermetica set out below and I guarantee you will see what I mean:The Kosmos is that in which time is contained; and it is by the progress andmovement of time that life is maintained in the Kosmos. The process of time isregulated by a fixed order; and Time in its ordered course renews all things inthe Kosmos by Alteration.3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en3] The Kosmos revolves with an everlasting movement. That movement has had nobeginning, and will have no end; it manifests itself and disappears by turns inthe several parts of the Kosmos, and that in such fashion that again and againin the checkered course of time it manifests itself anew in those same parts inwhich it disappeared before. Such is the nature of circular movement; all pointsin the circle are so linked together, that you can find no place at which themovement can begin; for it is evident that all points in the line of movementboth precede and follow one another forever, and it is in this manner that timerevolves.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en4] If you suppose the present time to be separate from the past time, and thefuture from the present, you will find yourself in a difficulty. For it isimpossible for the present to come into being unless the past has also come intobeing (and for the future to come into being unless the present has); for thepresent issues from the past and the future from the present. And inasmuch asthe past joins onto the present, and the present to the future, they are madeone by their continuity. They are therefore not separate from one another.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en5]David’s very useful and interesting notion that the “real world” may actually bea form of lucid dream, subject to change by acts of will or imagination, is alsoprefigured in the Hermetic writings—which go so far as to state that “Illusionis a thing wrought by the working of Reality.”6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en6]Even the human bodies that we inhabit are, in the Hermetic view, unreal:You must understand that that which always exists, and that alone, is real. Butman is not a thing that always exists and therefore man is not real, but is onlyan appearance. . . .7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en7]In these realms of appearances, thoughts may indeed become things and we musttake care with the thoughts we put out there. It’s difficult withtwenty-four-hour rolling news showing us the worst aspects of humanity; if toomany of us focus for too long on doom and destruction, if too many of uscontinue to dwell on negative emotions like hatred and envy, if too many of usfail to express love and gratitude and remain unwilling to seek forgiveness,then it will not be long before we turn our lucid dream into hell on earth.It doesn’t have to be that way.A fundamental message of this book, and of many ancient wisdom teachings, isthat we are cocreators of our own reality and that the golden age is thereforejust around the corner, all the time, for all of us. To embrace it we must setaside the negative patterns and reference frames of the past, let go of rigidhabits of thought that serve us no longer, and be willing to accept a permanentshake-up in our outlook on just about everything.It’s proof of how difficult it is to do any of this that the golden age has beenso long coming. Yet if David is right, the hidden Source Field generating thelucid dream that we call reality can be expected to make its presence and itsinfluence felt with great power and persistence in the coming years—and to haveprofound effects on human consciousness.Perhaps the epoch of 2012 really does mark a crossroads in our story. Andperhaps the time has come for us to pay close attention to the Kosmos—both seenand unseen—which does not idly send us signs and wonders, or speak to us throughdreams and visions, but which ungrudgingly favors our welfare and seeks alwaysto set us on the right track.

Where did I come from? How did I get here—andwhere am I going? Various teachers have come along who claimed to have theanswers—and the differences of opinion on these overwhelmingly profound conceptshave led to many of the greatest sorrows and atrocities in recorded history.Nonetheless, consistent themes emerge in almost all spiritualtraditions—including the idea that the Universe is not made of “dead” and inertmatter, but is rather a living, conscious Being. This superintelligence, we aretold, has woven the strands of space, time, energy, matter, biology andconsciousness together in Its own image. Despite the vastness of the Universe,we all apparently have a personal connection to this majestic Identity—and wewill live on long past the death of our physical bodies.Most spiritual teachings also say we will eventually reunite with this“Oneness”—and even when we walk in complete ignorance of these greaterrealities, a hidden spiritual curriculum is influencing our lives—and willeventually guide us back Home. We also consistently hear that benevolentsuper-beings, such as Jesus, Buddha, Krishna and others, have directlyintervened in earth’s history to help show us the way to this greater Truth. AsGraham Hancock, Zecharia Sitchin and others have reported, many of the oldestcultures speak of “gods” who gave them practical assistance—written language,mathematics, astronomy, agriculture, animal husbandry, ethics, law andarchitecture—including massive stone edifices, built out of impossibly heavymultiton blocks, which apparently served some useful purpose. Despite theimmense difficulty in duplicating these feats even with today’s technology,these “megalithic” structures appear all over the world.In our own “modern” era, the awe-inspiring origins of major world religions andspiritual traditions are usually written off as mythology and superstition. Dueto the seemingly irresolvable differences between these various philosophicalsystems, and our ever-increasing desire for information that is provable,Science has replaced Religion as the ultimate arbiter of Truth in many people’sminds—and this formerly majestic, wonderful view of a Divine Cosmos has beendismissed. The Universe has become a giant collection of dead, empty “stuff.”Our minds, thoughts and emotions—not to mention all the richness and diversityof species on this planet—are now seen to be the result of sheer coincidence andhappenstance in an otherwise unthinking, unfeeling, infinitely cold, anddepressing void. We have nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to afterwe die—and even the need for ethics or morality at all becomes a subject ofhealthy philosophical debate. If we know we can’t escape death, and all we haveis this one chance to exist, then why not devote our lives to the pursuit of asmuch pleasure as we can find? Why not throw ourselves fully and completely intoa hedonistic lust for money, power and privilege, and hope we can then pass onthese same benefits to our children, who are created from our own bodies?The more we think we know, the more lonely our lives seem to be. The magic hasbeen stripped away. We have no special abilities or mystical powers. We havenothing to look forward to after we die. We have no one else in the Universe tomeet. And before we ever even get the chance to travel out into space on anysustainable basis, we may all perish in a planetary catastrophe—either by ourown weapons of mass destruction, or by natural causes we apparently have noability to control or prevent. A seemingly endless lineup of big-budget disastermovies entertains audiences by threatening the earth with total annihilation.You may now be listening to the “profits of doom” a little more carefully—andmight indeed be wondering if, in fact, all is well.If you have seen my YouTube documentary that was the genesis for this bookentitled The 2012 Enigma,1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en8] my Website, Divine Cosmos,2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en9] or some of mytelevision appearances, you probably know I do not believe our future isdepressing, terrifying or cataclysmic. Instead, I feel our destinies on earthare being carefully and meticulously guided by a hidden intelligence—a livingenergy field the entire Universe is built from. Many great researchers haveindependently discovered this unseen Universal force and given it their ownnames, without there ever being a single, unifying standard. Since this forcemay well be the source of all space, time, matter, energy, biology andconsciousness in the Universe, the simplest all-inclusive term I use is theSource Field.This is not a book of philosophy, speculation or wishful thinking—it is a vastsynthesis of investigations into the Source Field. I am standing on theshoulders of giants in writing this book, as the overwhelming majority of thesefindings was developed by Ph.D.s from accredited universities, who ended updiscovering things that often put them at odds with their colleagues, employersand much of the mainstream world. There are also many examples in which ascientist or research institute made one specific breakthrough that was releasedinto the mainstream press—but the media did not see or understand how well ittied in with so many other related discoveries. In Russia, however, there hasbeen a consistent, focused effort to investigate the Source Field since at leastthe 1950s—but until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the vast majority ofall these revelations were classified for national security. Over ten thousandpapers investigating the Source Field were published by 1996 alone,3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en10] with more than half of them fromRussia. The implications of what they found are so staggering that I suspect youwill be stunned by how much we already know about this unseen force—whichinfluences absolutely everything we see, hear, do and believe.It has taken me over thirty years of dedicated research to assemble this grandcollection of data—and particularly since 1993, I have spent as many wakinghours as possible in pursuit of this radical rethinking of science. After Ibecame self-employed in the summer of 1998, I began working fourteen hours aday, seven days a week researching and investigating the Source Field phenomena.After Brian Tart, the president of Dutton Books, contacted me and offered topublish this research, it took me almost two years of focused, concentratedeffort to develop this book. When I finally started combining the very best ofeverything I had found into one single vision, a seemingly endless parade ofstunning new connections emerged. If these breakthroughs become common knowledgeand are developed into working technologies—and/or if existing technologies thatuse these principles are declassified and released to the public—we could end upin a world that rivals or exceeds our finest visionary science fiction films andnovels.As I bring you on a guided tour into the deeper mysteries of space, time,energy, matter, biology and consciousness, we will also explore subjects asfascinating as antigravity, dematerialization, teleportation, the parallelreality where time is three-dimensional, quantum geometry, natural “vortexpoints” on the earth where ships and planes disappear, real-world examples oftime travel, the Maya calendar as a tool for calculating when these “portals”will open, and an analysis of how our galaxy is driving all the different cycleswe experience—for our own physical, biological and spiritual evolution. Thepotential technological applications of this science are incredible.Furthermore, we may see a fundamental change in the nature of space and timeitself as we fully cross over into this new zone of energy in the galaxy youwill learn about.The Source Field is the key to unlock all of these mysteries, and ultimatelyunderstand the big questions: who are we, where did we come from, how did we gethere, and where are we going. Our journey into the Source Field Investigationsbegins in the next chapter by exploring the work of Dr. Cleve Backster—a pioneerwho helped us understand the true nature of Mind. We no longer need to remainignorant about the structure, identity and purpose of Consciousness. It is notmerely a biological phenomenon—it is written into the energy of the Universeitself. David Wilcock, January 2011"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEThe Backster Effect, Free Energy and the ConsequencesCould all space, time, energy, matter, biological life and consciousness in theUniverse be the product of a Source Field? Is it possible that the ancientspiritual teachings and philosophies are correct when they say “As Above, SoBelow”? What if everything we see in the visible universe is ultimately acrystallization of a vast Mind—which has a singular identity and awareness?Might we be living in amnesia—going through experiences that will eventuallyguide us through a full awakening into the vastness of this infiniteconsciousness?The Source Field Investigations must begin with compelling evidence thatconsciousness is not strictly trapped within our own brain and nervous system.We would need to see tangible proof that our thoughts are constantly interactingwith our environment—and having an effect upon our surroundings. If our conceptof a Source Field is correct, then Mind would become an energetic phenomenonthat is not confined to biological life-forms, but can pass between them—throughallegedly “empty space.”A variety of scientists and scholars in the Western world have made discoveriesthat reveal the existence of the Source Field—including controversial figureslike Wilhelm Reich, who was a protégé of Dr. Sigmund Freud, the father ofpsychology. Here, our Source Field Investigations will begin with Dr. CleveBackster—who summarized his fascinating life’s work in his recent book PrimaryPerception.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en11]THE STUNNING POWER OF HYPNOSISWhile attending Rutgers University prep school, Backster was fascinated to hearhis friend describe a hypnosis technique he’d just learned from his professor.Backster decided to try to hypnotize his roommate with this technique, who soonfell into a very deep trance. Backster then told him, “Now, I want you to openyour eyes, but you’re not going to wake up. I want you to go down the hall andget permission for late lights.”2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en12] Inthis prep school, the students could not have their lights on past ten P.M.without special permission. Under hypnosis, Backster’s roommate then opened hiseyes, got up, walked down the hall and got permission for late lights from theprofessor on duty. He signed the log and returned to the room. When Backsterbrought his roommate back out of hypnosis, he didn’t even realize anything hadhappened to him: “See? It doesn’t work. This so-called hypnosis is a bunch ofbaloney.”3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en13] When they walked down tothe on-duty professor, he confirmed that Backster’s roommate had just come andasked permission a few minutes earlier—but the roommate couldn’t believe it wasreal. He was then shocked to discover his own signature in the late lights log.Backster began researching hypnosis—reading as many books as he could find onthe subject, which were not that many in the late 1930s—and performed additionalsuccessful experiments. After the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941,Backster joined the military ROTC program at Texas A & M University—and there hebegan making frequent demonstrations of hypnosis to larger audiences. Typicallyabout a third of his audience went into some stage of trance—and he picked thedeepest subjects for more intensive work. One man was told he would not be ableto see Backster in the room for the next thirty minutes after he woke up.Indeed, once this subject was brought out of hypnosis, he could not see Backsterat all. Just to test how far this would go, Backster picked up a cigarette andblew out some smoke, although he was not a smoker. This man saw the cigaretteand the smoke levitating in the air, but he could not see anyone holding it—andhe became very alarmed. He wanted to leave the room, but the audience compelledhim to stay. After the thirty minutes, Backster again reappeared to him; hefollowed his posthypnotic commands perfectly, with no conscious memory of whathe had been told to do.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en14]My own introduction into the powers of hypnosis came after I had a dramaticout-of-body experience. When I was only five years old, I woke up one night andfound myself floating about three feet over my own body. That little boy in thebed was breathing normally—but if he was “me,” then who the heck was I? Thisquickly started to scare me—and as soon as I panicked, I snapped back into mybody. For the next two years, I wished I could have another chance to explorethis bold, new frontier—but nothing happened. When I finally asked my mother howI could learn more about this, she took me down into the basement and suggestedI read some books she had on ESP—extrasensory perception. The first one I readwas Harold Sherman’s How to Make ESP Work for You.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en15] Sherman said that when you hypnotizesomeone, you can get them to have an out-of-body experience like I had—withapparently stunning results.The deeper the state of trance, the more activated become the Extra Sensoryfaculties of the subject. Under these conditions, he can be instructed to leavethe body and to visit a certain person or place, and to report on what he seesand hears. Hypnotism and Astral Projection Dr. Thomas Garrett, a therapeutic hypnotist who pioneered in the treatment ofshell-shocked soldiers in the First World War, told me of an outstandingexperience he had had with one of his private patients. The young man, son of afamous Broadway playwright, came to Dr. Garrett emotionally upset over a brokenromance. He submitted to hypnotism and told Dr. Garrett that he and his formerfiancée, who was a student at Wellesley, had had a falling-out over some trivialmatter and she had returned his ring.Dr. Garrett, on impulse, told the hypnotized young man he could visit the womanhe loved and see if he could determine how she now felt about him. Dr. Garrettexplained he had the power to leave his physical body, in his astral form, andtravel direct to Wellesley, to the sorority house where the young lady wasresiding. There was a moment of silence. Then the entranced subject announcedthat he was standing in the hall outside the girl’s closed door.“Don’t let that stop you,” said Dr. Garrett. “You can pass right through thedoor. Go on in and tell me what she is doing.”After another moment, the young man said: “She is at her desk, writing aletter.”“That’s fine,” said Dr. Garrett. “Look over her shoulder and read to me what sheis writing.”Almost instantly the face of the sleeping subject took on a surprised anddelighted expression. “Why, she’s writing to me.”“What is she saying?” demanded Dr. Garrett, picking up a pencil.The young man then read to Dr. Garrett several word-for-word paragraphs, to theeffect that his sweetheart was sorry for her part in the lovers’ quarrel, wasasking forgiveness, and expressing the hope for a reconciliation. The young manbecame so excited that he tried to embrace the girl and the reaction on hisphysical body was such that Dr. Garrett quickly brought him back from his astraladventure and woke him up, with the suggestion that he would remember all thathad transpired.Late the following day, this young man received a special delivery letter fromhis sweetheart—the very letter he had either astrally or telepathicallyperceived. Dr. Garrett has this letter in his files, together with the notationshe had made, as reported by his entranced subject. There were only a few wordsof variation between the two.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en16]An even more fantastic-sounding hypnosis story can be found in Michael Talbot’sepic work The Holographic Universe— one of the best collections of Source Fieldinvestigations ever committed to the printed page. Talbot witnessed his father’sfriend Tom being hypnotized in the early 1970s by a professional. The hypnotisttold Tom his daughter, Laura, would be invisible to him when he came out oftrance. He then had Laura stand directly in front of her father. Tom apparentlysaw right through her body as he woke up and gazed around the room—and alsocould not hear her giggling. The hypnotist then pulled a watch out of his pocketand quickly pushed it into the small of Laura’s back, keeping it concealed inhis hand so no one could have seen what it was—and asked Tom if he could seewhat he was holding.Tom leaned forward as if staring directly through Laura’s stomach and said itwas a watch. The hypnotist nodded and asked if Tom could read the watch’sinscription. Tom squinted as if struggling to make out the writing and recitedboth the name of the watch’s owner (which happened to be a person unknown to anyof us in the room) and the message. The hypnotist then revealed that the objectwas indeed a watch, and passed it around the room so that everyone could seethat Tom had read its inscription correctly. When I talked to Tom afterward, hesaid his daughter had been absolutely invisible to him. All he had seen was thehypnotist standing and holding a watch cupped in the palm of his hand. Had thehypnotist let him leave without telling him what was going on, he never wouldhave known he wasn’t perceiving normal consensus reality.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en17]I read this back in 1995, and it made a huge impression upon me. Tom’shypnotized mind could see right through his daughter as if she didn’t evenexist—and he could read detailed written inscriptions from a pocket watch. Iftrue, this challenges everything we think we know about solid matter—andsuggests there is a part of our minds with vastly greater capabilities than mostof us are ever aware of. What we think we see may be nothing more than theproduct of a collective decision we’re all making to see it that way—a form ofmass hypnosis. Remember—we can walk, talk and interact with the world underhypnosis, travel out of body and make accurate observations, and may or may nothave any conscious memory of what we did after we are brought out of trance. Wecan also be given posthypnotic suggestion to act, think or behave a certain wayafter we wake up. These suggestions are apparently powerful enough to make ahuman being utterly invisible to us while we’re in an otherwise normal state ofconsciousness. When we discover that ordinary people can be hypnotized likethis, we typically write it off as the work of the “subconscious mind”—but westill don’t understand what, exactly, this is . . . or why it works. Thesubconscious seems to automatically obey hypnotic commands—generally withoutquestion—as if it were quite accustomed to hearing orders and acting upon them.After his university training, Cleve Backster eventually joined the U.S.Counter-Intelligence Corps, and lectured on the potential danger of foreignpowers using hypnosis to extract classified information from overseas governmentpersonnel. Backster took a huge risk to demonstrate the seriousness of thissubject to a high-ranking military officer. With her permission, Backsterhypnotized the secretary of the commanding general of the Counter-IntelligenceCorps. While under hypnosis, he asked her to remove a highly classified documentfrom the general’s locked file cabinet—and she willingly obeyed. Backster toldher she would not remember what she had done when she awoke—and sure enough, shehad no idea she had just leaked very sensitive information when he brought herback.That night I secured the document in my locked file and the next day presentedit to the General. I explained to him that I might be risking a court martial,but hoped instead to expedite further consideration of the importance of myresearch. Rather than a court martial, on December 17, 1947, I received a veryfavorable letter of recommendation from the General, stating that my researchwas “of high importance to military intelligence.” Then positive things startedto happen.8 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en18]EARLY PIONEER OF THE POLYGRAPHAfter giving ten days of hypnosis and sodium pentothal “truth serum”demonstrations at the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., Backster beganworking for the Central Intelligence Agency as of April 27, 1948. Shortly afterjoining the CIA, Backster studied with Leonarde Keeler—a pioneer in the use ofthe polygraph.“In addition to other classified activities, I was a key member of a CIA teamthat was prepared to travel to any foreign location to analyze the possible useof unusual interrogation tactics, including my original areas of concern, mainlyhypno-interrogation and narco-interrogation. . . . Back in Washington, D.C., thepolygraph operation I had established was becoming popular for the screening ofapplicants for employment at the CIA and for some general screening of key CIApersonnel. The ever-increasing schedule of rather routine polygraph examinationsstarted to interfere with my more creative interests in research.”9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en19]Shortly after Leonarde Keeler’s death, circa 1951, Backster left the CIA—toserve as director of the Keeler Polygraph Institute in Chicago. This was theonly classroom-type school teaching the use of the polygraph at the time.Backster went on to start his own polygraph consultant business, working withseveral government agencies, in Washington, D.C.—and then expanded into a secondoffice in Baltimore, Maryland. By 1958, Backster had freed up the time to beginintensive polygraph research, and he developed the first standardized system fornumerical evaluation of polygraph charts—which is still being used today. Hemoved to New York City in 1959 and continued to operate a commercial polygraphbusiness. Seven years later, Backster struck gold.In February 1966 an event occurred that was about to expand the entire focus ofmy research through a kind of paradigm shift in my own awareness. At the time ofits occurrence I had been involved in the use of the polygraph on humans foreighteen years.10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en20]Backster’s secretary purchased a rubber plant and a dracaena cane plant from astore that was going out of business. This was the first time Backster had everowned any plants. On February 2, 1966, Backster had worked through the night inhis lab, and finally took a coffee break at seven A.M. In those weary hours,Backster got an idea—he would try to connect his new dracaena plant to thepolygraph and see what happened. Much to his surprise, the plant did not have asmooth, flat pattern of electrical activity—it was surprisingly jagged andalive, changing moment to moment. Then, as Backster kept watching in amazement,it got a whole lot more interesting.About one minute into the chart recording, the tracing exhibited a short-termchange in contour—similar to a reaction pattern typical of a human subject whomight have been briefly experiencing the fear of detection.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en21]In simple language, the plant’s electrical activity looked just like the graphfrom a person who was starting to tell a lie. Backster knew that if you want tocatch someone lying, you first have to confront them about whatever they mightbe hiding. If your questions then cause them to feel threatened and anxious, theelectrical activity in their skin gets much stronger. Backster wanted to see ifhe could get a humanlike response out of his new plant by threatening itswell-being somehow.An example of what we do with a human taking a polygraph test is ask a questionsuch as, “Did you fire that shot [that was] fatal to John Smith?” If they didcommit the crime, that question threatens their well-being and produces areaction that shows up on the chart.12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en22]Backster tried dipping one of the leaves into a cup of hot coffee. Nothing. Hetapped one of the leaves with his pen. There was hardly any response.Then, after about fourteen minutes of elapsed chart time, I had this thought: Asthe ultimate plant threat, I would get a match and burn the plant’s electrodedleaf. At that time, the plant was about fifteen feet away from where I wasstanding. . . . The only new thing that occurred was this thought.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en23]What happened next would change the history of science forever—and the impactstill has not reached our common, public awareness.The very moment the imagery of burning that leaf entered my mind, the polygraphrecording pen moved rapidly to the top of the chart! No words were spoken, notouching the plant, no lighting of matches, just my clear intention to burn theleaf. The plant recording showed dramatic excitation. To me this was a powerful,high-quality observation. . . . I must state that, on February 2, 1966, at 13minutes, 55 seconds into that chart recording, my whole consciousness changed. Ithen thought, “Gee, it’s as though this plant read my mind!”14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en24]005 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_005_r1.gif]Dr. Cleve Backster’s graph of his dracaena cane plant having an electricalreaction right as he thought of burning one of its leaves.As the plant continued to have what would be considered an enormous, panickedreaction, Backster then went and got matches from his secretary’s desk.When I returned, the plant was still showing highly visible reactions. . . . Imade a feeble pass at [a] leaf with a lighted match, but by then I was notreally into harming the plant. I thought the best thing for me to do was toremove the threat, and see if the plant would calm down. After returning thematches to my secretary’s desk, the tracing [finally] returned to the calmnessdisplayed prior to the original decision to burn the electroded leaf.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en25]As of nine A.M., Backster’s associate Bob Henson came to work—and was fascinatedwhen he heard about what Backster had just done. When Henson repeated theexperiment and threatened the plant himself, the same reaction occurred.Backster now felt sympathy for the plant and did not let Hanson actually burnany of the leaves. In fact, Backster never again did an experiment that involvedburning or threatening to burn plants.A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE BACKSTER EFFECTIn 2006, I called Backster’s research laboratory in San Diego to ask if hewanted to participate in a film shoot to dramatize this event in a modernclassroom setting. Until I was actually on the phone with him, I did not realizethat I had called on February 2, 2006—forty years to the day from when he firstmade this discovery in 1966. Backster agreed to do my movie. A few months laterwe brought him up to Los Angeles and spent a healthy chunk of investor capitalfor a professional Hollywood-level shoot.In this key scene, Backster is invited to a college classroom to discuss hisoriginal experiment—while he has a live plant connected to his polygraph. Onerebellious student in the audience gets excited and impatient, and wants tore-create the Backster Effect for himself. The kid jumps out of his seat with alighter in his hand and runs toward the plant to burn it—but my character holdshim back. The plant still “screams” from the fear of being burned—thus provingto the entire class that the Backster Effect really works.This was how I had written the scene. I had a significant amount of investordollars on the line, and Backster had promised to work as an actor and followthe script. To my horror, he refused to “pretend” that the plant was having aterrified reaction each time I held the kid back. We did take after take, butBackster simply wouldn’t act out his part. Unless he saw the graph actually gowild, like he witnessed in his original discovery forty years earlier, heobviously wasn’t going to have any kind of authentic reaction on camera. I thenrealized the only way I could save my film was to use the Backster Effectmyself.Up until then, we were only acting. There were no strong emotions going around.The kid didn’t really want to burn the plant, and I knew he wasn’t really goingto try to push past me. The plant “knew” it wasn’t in any real danger—so as aresult, its graph stayed nice and smooth. I knew I had to do something—and fast.The next time we did the scene, I sent that plant the blackest, darkest thoughtsI could possibly conjure up—right when I confronted the kid. I really felt itdeep down in my core. I absolutely hated that plant. I wanted to tear it topieces. Burn it to a crisp. Right at that exact moment, the polygraph needlewent completely nuts—just like a person screaming in terror. With the camerasstill rolling, Backster said, “Wow, we’ve got quite a reaction here!” I savedthe shoot—and proved, for myself, that the Backster Effect really works.I then told the plant I was sorry, and sent genuine feelings of love to it, incase it could somehow hear me or feel me. The graph calmed right back down.Backster let me save the graph paper from this stunning event—and I still haveit in the box with all the bills we racked up from that day of shooting. Thescript went through many more changes and we never ended up using our promofootage professionally, but I was very happy to get my own chance to experiencethe Backster Effect with the man himself—and really know, deep down inside, thatit works. I also will never forget the day I was speaking to my landlady and herten-year-old daughter about Backster’s amazing discovery. Her daughter suddenlyran outside and started rolling around in the grass, in total ecstasy, saying,“You can hear me! You can hear me!”THEY’RE ALWAYS LISTENINGAfter his initial discovery in 1966, Backster found out that once you starttaking care of a plant, it seemingly tracks your thoughts and feelings.During plant monitoring sessions, when I left the lab to run an errand, I foundthat the moment I decided to return to where that plant was, the plant oftenshowed a fairly significant reaction—especially when my decision to return wasmade in a spontaneous manner.16 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en26]Backster used synchronized watches to prove that the plant was responding at theexact moment he made the decision. In another case, Backster set up a plantexperiment in New York and traveled to Clifton, New Jersey, with his associateBob Henson, who was unaware that his wife had set up a surprise party for theirwedding anniversary. Backster noticed several strong reactions in the plant asthey went through various phases of their trip—including the time theyapproached Port Authority, the time they boarded the bus for Clifton, the timethe bus entered the Lincoln Tunnel, and the time they made the final part of thetrip out to Clifton. Right at the moment they entered the house and everyoneyelled, “SURPRISE!” the plant definitely felt it. Backster said, “There was abig reaction from the plant at that exact time.”17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en27]Backster began leaving plants connected to his polygraph without trying to doanything—just observing their reactions and then trying to figure out what mighthave caused them. One day he found a very strong reaction—and eventuallyrealized it happened right as he poured a pot of boiling water into the sink inhis lab. I’ve been in Backster’s lab myself and know how disgusting those sinkscan get. Later tests revealed that his sink was loaded with bacteria—“somewhatsimilar to the cantina scene from Star Wars”18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en28]—and when the bacteria suddenly diedfrom the scalding hot water, the plant perceived a threat to its ownwell-being—and “screamed.”Backster later designed an experiment to try to standardize this effect. Hetried to think of the most expendable living creature he could find—and he chosebrine shrimp, which are commonly used as fish food. He invented a machine thatwould dump the shrimp into boiling water at a random time. The plants did indeedreact, strongly, as the shrimp died—but only if the experiment was done atnight, when no human beings were around in the lab. Otherwise, the plants seemedto “lose interest” in the shrimp; the energy fields from an average person weremuch stronger. Skeptics later attempted to repeat this experiment—but they didnot follow Backster’s protocols.As best we could determine, the people trying to replicate really didn’tunderstand how to automate human consciousness out of an experiment. Theythought you could go to the other side of a wall and watch the experiment unfoldthrough closed-circuit television. That wall meant nothing as far as theplant-to-human attunement was concerned.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en29]This study was given a brief column-and-a-half write-up in ElectroTechnologyMagazine—and a stunning 4,950 scientists wrote Backster to request moreinformation.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en30]Then, on November 3, 1969, Backster demonstrated this effect at Yale UniversityLinguistics School. An ivy leaf was plucked and connected to the polygraph: “Ithen asked if they had any insects around that could be utilized for hopefullystimulating a plant reaction.” The students captured a spider—which is actuallyan arachnid, as Backster points out. They put the spider on a table and had oneguy surround it with his hands so it couldn’t escape. The ivy leaf did not reactduring this time.But, when he took his hands away, as the spider became conscious that it wasable to run, you’d see a huge chart reaction just prior to its attempt toescape. This sequence was repeated several times.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en31]Backster soon appeared on numerous television shows to demonstrate this effect,including ones hosted by Johnny Carson, Art Linkletter, Merv Griffin and DavidFrost.22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en32] Frost asked Backster if hisplant was male or female. Backster and his plant both had an amusing response tothis rather personal question.I suggested he go over and lift up a leaf and take a peek. Before he evenapproached the plant, [it] . . . showed a wild reaction, evoking a very amusedreaction from the studio audience.23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en33]Backster’s results were replicated by Russian scientist V. N. Pushkin in 1972,using EEG instrumentation. People under hypnosis were brought into a powerfulstate of emotional stimulation, and a nearby geranium would have a strongreaction each time this occurred.24 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en34]Despite all these intriguing results, the scientific community was predictablysevere in its criticism. Dr. Otto Solbrig of Harvard University’s biologydepartment was not amused.[This is a] waste of time. This work is not going to advance science very much.We know enough already about plants—so that when someone comes up with somethinglike this, we say it’s quackery. You might say we are prejudiced. Maybe we are.Yale professor Arthur Galtson was a little more polite—but still not supportive.I don’t say Backster’s phenomena are impossible. I just say there are enoughother things of more value to work on. . . . It’s attractive to think thatplants are listening to you or that they respond to prayer, but there’s nothingin it. There’s no nervous system in a plant. There are no means by whichsensation can be transferred.25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en35]Others, like Stanford Research Institute’s Dr. Hal Puthoff, were moreencouraging.I don’t regard Backster’s work as quackery. The way he conducts his experimentsis pretty good. It’s not the sloppy thing that most people believe who think thework’s no good.26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en36]ALL OF NATURE IS IN A CONSTANT “CONVERSATION”Backster also connected yogurt bacteria, ordinary chicken eggs from hisrefrigerator and even live human cells to his polygraph—and continued to getstunning results. Consistently, what he found was that every living thing isintimately attuned to its environment. When any stress, suffering or deathoccurs, all the life-forms in the surrounding area have an immediate electricalresponse—as if they all share the pain.Backster first got the idea to wire up chicken eggs when a philodendron planthad a strong reaction—right as he cracked one open for breakfast.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en37] Even though he used conventional,non-fertilized eggs from the grocery store, Backster’s electroded eggs displayedunexpected behavior—including patterns similar to a heartbeat on an EEG, andcomplex “cycles within cycles” on an EKG.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en38] One of Backster’s electroded eggs hada sudden shock when he picked up his Siamese cat, Sam, and startled him out of adeep sleep. Even more impressive is the graph of an electroded egg “screaming”each time its former neighbors are dropped into boiling water, one by one. Thisegg was kept inside a lead-lined box that screened out all electromagneticfields. That meant this effect could not be due to any radio waves, microwavesor other electromagnetic frequencies.29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en39]Backster clearly understood the importance of shielding out electromagneticfields in an experiment like this.At the suggestion of several scientists, and the physicists in particular, Ilater attempted to shield the smaller electroded plants from electromagneticinterference by using a copper screen cage [also known as a Faraday cage]. . . .The plants behaved as if the screen cage enclosure did not exist. Much later Ihad the opportunity to confirm this using [a] state-of-the-art shielded room. .. . I felt certain [the information passing between plants, bacteria, insects,animals and humans] was not within the known electromagnetic frequencies, AM, FMor any form of signal which could be shielded by ordinary means. Distance seemedto impose no limitation. I made observations that suggested that this signalcould traverse dozens, even hundreds of miles. It seemed that the signal may noteven fall within the electromagnetic spectrum. If not, this would certainly haveprofound implications.30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en40]This is one of many such investigations that proved the Source Field is almostcertainly not electromagnetic (EM). Every scientist knows EM waves cannotpenetrate through lead-lined enclosures, copper-screened Faraday cages and/orshielded rooms.Backster’s experiments with human cells made his discovery far more personal. Inthese experiments, Backster would obtain living cells from someone’s mouth byhaving him swish a little water around and spit it into a test tube. This tubewas then whirled in a centrifuge, bringing the living white blood cells to thetop, which Backster extracted with an eyedropper. The cells were then placedinto a tiny one-milliliter test tube and electroded with very thin gold wires.31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en41] These living samples could survivethis way for “ten to twelve hours,”32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en42]giving high-quality reactions the entire time.My favorite example of Backster’s work with human cells was performed with NASAastronaut Dr. Brian O’Leary in 1988, who served on the faculties of CornellUniversity, California Institute of Technology, University of California andPrinceton University. O’Leary brought an ex–lady friend along to the lab andapparently they had a strong argument—which “provided ample opportunity for himto witness firsthand extremely high quality chart reactions.”33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en43] O’Leary then left for the San Diegoairport so he could fly back to Phoenix, Arizona—some three hundred miles away.He synchronized watches with Backster, and his cells were monitored in the labthe entire time.It was previously agreed that [Dr. O’Leary] would keep an accurate log of eventswhich might have caused him momentary anxiety. These included missing a turn onthe freeway while returning his rental car to the airport, nearly missing hisflight because of the long line at the ticket counter, his flight’s departureand landing in Phoenix, his son’s failure to meet him on time at the airport,and a number of other logged events. Later when comparisons were made bytransferring the logged events to the appropriate portions of the chartrecording, there was a good correlation between chart reactions and nearly allof the perceived anxieties. His chart became very quiet after he returned homeand retired for the evening.34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en44]I discussed this experiment with Dr. O’Leary over a private dinner in Zurich,Switzerland, while we were both speaking at a conference—and he confirmed to mehow amazed he was by it. His own mind was broadcasting waves of information thatwere being picked up by his living cells in a lab three hundred miles away. Theeffect works just as well if the cells are kept in shielded rooms, again provingthe signals are not being transmitted by electromagnetic energy. There issomething “out there,” some energy field, that allows our thoughts to propagatethrough space—even over vast distances. The implications of this arestunning—particularly when you start to consider how it seems that every livingthing in nature is listening to everything else. We are definitely not excludedfrom this process.I’ve lectured on this subject a number of times, and invariably the audiencegroans when they find out that vegetables, fruits, yogurt, eggs and the livingcells in raw meat are all “screaming” when they are cooked and/or eaten. Evenhard-core vegan/vegetarian/raw foodists who consider themselves to be on a“cruelty-free” diet are now faced with the fact that the food they eat must gothrough measurable distress—at least from a human’s perspective. Even if you donot cook your vegetables, your digestive activity still has a “burning” effect.Backster did tell me that if you “pray” over your food, by sending it positive,loving thoughts, it then seems to accept its role in helping you stay alive—andthese severe reactions no longer occur on the graph paper.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en45] Many cultures and spiritualtraditions encourage us to “thank our food.” With Backster’s research we now seethat this seemingly unimportant behavior—from a scientific standpoint—has adefinite purpose in our new model.FREE ENERGY—AND THE CONSEQUENCESAt this same Zurich conference, Dr. Brian O’Leary revealed a wealth ofinformation suggesting “free energy” devices have been invented, again andagain, but are invariably suppressed by corporate power brokers. According tothe Institute for New Energy, as of 1997, “the U.S. Patent Office has classifiedover 3,000 patent devices or applications under the secrecy order, Title 35,U.S. Code (1952) Sections 181-188.”36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en46]The Federation of American Scientists revealed that by the end of Fiscal Year2010, this number had ballooned to 5,135 inventions—and included “review andpossible restriction” on any solar cell with greater than twenty percentefficiency, or any power system that is more than seventy to eighty percentefficient at converting energy.37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en47]According to Dr. O’Leary, some researchers are bought off and their discoveriesput on a shelf. Others are threatened into submission, while others die understrange circumstances. Dr. O’Leary then brought me up onstage for a paneldiscussion, and he mentioned how Dr. Stefan Marinov—“the head of the Europeanfree energy movement”—allegedly jumped to his death from the tenth story of thelibrary building at the University of Graz in Austria. Marinov flew out of thewindow backward, as if he had been shoved. And according to Dr. O’Leary, “Heleft no suicide note, and he was one of the most positive, highly spiritedpersons I’ve ever met.”38 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en48] O’Learyalso mentioned Dr. Eugene Mallove, arguably the world’s leading figure inalternative energy research, during this same time.Overwhelmed with emotion, I actually burst into tears onstage in front of thisfour-hundred-person audience while I discussed my own personal experience withDr. Mallove. I’m sure you could have measured a huge electrical surge in theplants that were around me onstage when this happened. Dr. Mallove started outas the head science writer for Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s ownjournal. Mallove claimed he was ordered to suppress research into coldfusion—during which they had gotten positive results suggesting free energy wasbeing generated from the reaction.39 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en49]From there, he quit his job and went on to start Infinite Energy Magazine40[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en50]—and became arguably the topcoordinator, publisher and liaison for alternative-energy inventors worldwide.On May 15, 2004, I was a featured guest on an episode of Coast to Coast, thelargest nighttime talk-radio program in the United States, with Art Bell andRichard Hoagland.41 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en51] I found out a fewdays before airtime that Dr. Mallove was going to come on as our surprisespecial guest. We were about to make a stunning announcement: Hoagland andMallove were going to visit Washington, D.C., the following week, and bringalong a working, tabletop free-energy device. This device apparently would beginspinning by simply being stared at and did not use any conventional powersource. I wasn’t sure how it worked but it sounded fascinating—and I knew suchthings were theoretically possible from the Source Field investigations I hadbeen doing already. Hoagland had lined up meetings with various senators andcongressmen to demonstrate the device—and push for these breakthroughs to bereleased to the public for study and commercial application.Less than twenty-four hours before we were about to go live on the air, Dr.Mallove was bludgeoned to death outside his parents’ home.42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en52] I found it quite suspicious that thishappened right before the announcement to the public of Dr. Mallove’s secretdevice—and of his imminent political mission to Capitol Hill.Certain groups do appear to have a serious, vested interest in suppressing theSource Field Investigations. I am aware that any discussion of these issuesinvariably gets you labeled as a “paranoid nutcase,” but the events surroundingthe death of Dr. Mallove have made it much more personal for me.Regardless of the skepticism, sarcasm, ridicule, humiliation, and threats thatmay be associated with the Source Field investigations, there is real truth tobe found—hard science you need to know, today, to help make a brighter futurefor everyone. And best of all, these discoveries are very positive—ultimatelyproving that most people’s idea of a loving God is, in fact, alive and well."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOConsciousness, Eternity and Universal MindWe are on a quest to discover if a Source Field really does exist—and ourinvestigation is starting to uncover surprising information. Dr. CleveBackster’s research gives the compelling suggestion that all livingthings—bacteria, plants, insects, animals, birds, fish and humans—are in someform of constant communication with one another. This communication involves theuse of a field that is not supposed to exist—because it cannot be found in theconventional electromagnetic spectrum of visible light, radio waves, infrared,microwaves, X-rays, and others. Furthermore, Backster is only one of a varietyof hypnosis researchers who have discovered that we can become completelyunaware of signals in our environment if we are simply told, while in trance,that we will not be able to see or hear them. If all living things are sharing aconstant, psychic attunement with one another, perhaps our minds deliberatelyscreen out most of this information for our own sanity.In Mexico, there lived a remarkable female healer known as Pachita—born BarbaraGuerrero—who was a practitioner of psychic healing. Pachita discovered inchildhood that she had a profound healing ability, and practiced it on animalswhile she worked as a high-wire acrobat for the circus. She later foughtalongside Pancho Villa as a teenager, sang in cabarets and sold lottery ticketsbefore recovering her abilities as a thirty-year-old housewife. For the nextforty-seven years, she strictly avoided publicity as she practiced her skills,and helped many different people with seemingly incurable medical problems. Onlyin late 1977 did she become open to the idea of her talents being scientificallystudied—and asked Dr. Andrija Puharich to investigate her psychic healing powerswith a team of specialists from the United States.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en53]Carla Rueckert wrote firsthand of her healing treatment from Pachita in The Lawof One, Book I.In late 1977 and early 1978 we accompanied Dr. Andrija Puharich and his researchassociates to Mexico City to investigate a Mexican psychic surgeon, aseventy-eight-year-old woman called Pachita, who had been practicing for a greatmany years. . . . Pachita used a very dull knife with a five-inch blade. Shepassed it around amongst the entire research group watching to see ourreactions, especially mine, since I was the guinea pig. Since her “operations”took place with me lying on my stomach I cannot give a firsthand account of whatoccurred, but Don informs me that the knife seemed to disappear four inches intomy back and was then moved rapidly across the spine. This was repeated severaltimes. Pachita was, she said, working on my kidneys. Again we made no attempt toconserve “evidence” as we knew that it would come to nothing. Many haveattempted to research psychic surgery by analysis of its products, and havefound either inconclusive results or null results, indicting that psychicsurgery is a fraud.2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en54]I was definitely curious about what this actually felt like, so that was thefirst thing I asked Carla when I interviewed her. Apparently the procedure didcause her very significant pain. She also said there was some blood, even thoughthe wounds miraculously closed up as soon as Pachita withdrew the knife. I amaware this sounds crazy, but it was all witnessed by a room full of trainedscientific observers.Dr. Puharich also received a treatment from Pachita for progressive hearing lossin both ears due to otosclerosis—excess spongy bone growth. Pachita apparentlystuck the tip of her blade right into each of his eardrums for about fortyseconds each—causing him extreme pain—but the wounds then immediately closed up,and there was minimal bleeding and no additional pain. Though this knife traumashould have caused him permanent hearing loss, by any conventional medicalunderstanding, he was stunned by the healing results he then achieved.My head was ringing with loud noises. . . . I estimated them to be at the levelof a New York subway train, or about 90 decibels above hearing threshold. Thenoise was so loud that I could not discern speech of those around me, but I hadno fear that I might be going deaf as a result of the procedure. Pachita gave mea tincture (contents unknown) and told me to put one drop in each ear daily. Thehead noises decreased about 10 decibels each day, and by the eighth day, postoperative, the noises had ceased. My hearing, however, had become so keen thattelephone conversations were painful, and I had to hold the earpiece away frommy head to a comfortable distance. This hyperacusia lasted for about two weeks.One month post-operative I had normal pure tone hearing in both ears.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en55]If Pachita was actually just a hypnotist, somehow inducing mass hallucinations,then apparently her treatments were still quite effective. Carla Rueckertdescribed only the first of two operations she had from Pachita. The secondoperation was explained by Dr. Andrija Puharich in H. G. M. Herman’s book—in farmore detail.Twelve days after the aforementioned operation, Pachita was ready to perform thesecond operation. She had been able to obtain a human kidney from a post mortemexamination. It was brought to her placed in an unsterile jar, suspended inordinary water, and was stored in a kitchen refrigerator. On the day of theoperation, Pachita lifted the kidney out of the jar with her bloody hands. Shethen sliced it in two longitudinally, stating that she was going to transplanteach half separately. Next she plunged the knife deeply into one side of theback, twisted the knife around, and asked me to drop one kidney half into thehole. I was utterly surprised to find that the kidney in my hand was literally“sucked” into the body of the patient. When I palpated the spot where the kidneyhad been “sucked” in, I found that the tissue had closed immediately, there wasno hole in the skin. It was awesome! In this manner both halves of the kidneywere transplanted. The entire operation lasted 92 seconds. One hour afterwardsthe patient was able to stand. She slept well, and was urinating normally some14 hours later. After three days she boarded a plane and flew home to the UnitedStates.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en56]Said the book’s author, “Andrija was convinced that Pachita’s ‘instant surgery’was completely genuine, and that no fraud of any kind was possible under his andhis colleagues’ scientific observation and documentation.” 5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en57]MEXICAN NEUROSCIENTIST ENTERS THE TWILIGHT ZONEWhether or not these were actual surgical procedures, Pachita’s work also had ahuge impact on Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum—arguably Mexico’s mostcontroversial neuroscientist. In 1977, Grinberg took a teaching job at theNational Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City—and produced awealth of hard scientific data on the physiology of learning and memory, visualperception and physiological psychology. That same year, Grinberg metPachita—who completely transformed everything he thought he knew about biology,psychology and medicine. Sam Quinones described the effect Pachita had onGrinberg in a 1997 article.According to Grinberg, [Pachita] performed successful surgery withoutanesthesia, using a mountain knife. She replaced diseased organs with othersthat appeared out of thin air. . . . Grinberg spent several months watchingPachita’s operations and talking and traveling with her. He admitted that hisdescriptions of her operations sounded like ravings, but he insisted he’d seenthem.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en58]According to this same article, Grinberg ultimately wrote seven volumes on theshamans of Mexico, and had gone deeply into this type of research by themid-1980s. Puzzled by the feats he believed he had observed Pachita performing,he theorized that there must be a “neuronal field,” as he called it, createdwithin the brain, which in turn interacts with what he called the “pre-spacestructure”—a field that all space, time, matter, energy, biological life andconsciousness emanates from—i.e., the Source Field. Here is how Grinbergexplained it in his own words—which are admittedly technical.The pre-space structure is a holographic, non-local lattice that has . . . theattribute of consciousness. The neuronal field [created by the brain] distortsthis lattice, and activates a partial interpretation of it that is perceived asan image. Only when the brain-mind system is free from interpretations, do theneuronal field and the pre-space structure become identical. In this situation,the perception of reality is unitary, without ego and with a lack of anyduality. In this situation, pure consciousness and a feeling of an all-embracingunity and luminosity is [sic] perceived. All the systems that spiritual leadershave developed . . . have had the goal of arriving at this direct perception ofthe pure pre-space structure. . . . The science of consciousness that I wouldlike to develop is a science that will try to understand, study and research theabove-mentioned ideas.”7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en59]Obviously, if such feats as Pachita’s are even possible, very few people possesssuch abilities. In order to awaken the world to what our true potential mightbe, Grinberg knew he would need to start with something very simple andrepeatable. His earliest experiments in this category began in 1987. Two people,usually a male-female couple, would sit and meditate together for twentyminutes—to form a close bond with each other. They were then separated into twodifferent rooms, each of which was shielded from any and all electromagneticfields. Both participants’ brainwaves would begin to noticeably synchronize,even while they were apart—and Grinberg could measure it on their EEG readouts.He also found that both hemispheres within each person’s brain would show thesame patterns—which normally only happens in deep meditation. Furthermore, theperson who had the most coherent, well-organized brain waves seemed to always“win”—exerting a greater influence upon the other.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en60]In 1994, Grinberg came up with an even more compelling way to demonstrate thiseffect. Most of the experiment was the same—two people meditated together fortwenty minutes and then went into separate, shielded rooms. Now, however, heflashed bright lights in one participant’s eyes—causing them to experiencesudden shocks. Each time he ran the experiment, one hundred different flashes oflight were given at random. Twenty-five percent of the time when he flashed thelight in one person’s eyes, the other person had a very similar brainwave“shock”—at the exact same time. Grinberg’s control subjects did not show anysuch connections. This was a stunning discovery—and the results were publishedin the prestigious, peer-reviewed journal Physics Essays.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en61] A revolution in science seemed to bewell under way—the Source Field was finally going mainstream, in a rigorous,clinically verifiable fashion—taking Backster’s breakthroughs to the next level.This is when disaster struck. Shortly after the publication of his paper in1994, Grinberg disappeared. He still has never been found—and there is even aFacebook page dedicated to tracking him down after all these years.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en62] His wife was seen a few times afterhis disappearance, the last time being in mid-1995, and her behavior indicatedthat she was extremely distressed about whatever had happened.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en63] Some people interpret this as a signthat she may have murdered her husband, but it is also possible that she wasthreatened that the same fate would happen to her if she didn’t disappear forgood. We will probably never know what happened—but we can safely addGrinberg-Zylberbaum to the list of Source Field investigators who may have metwith lethal threats as a result of their groundbreaking work. That certainlydoesn’t stop us from putting all the pieces together in this investigation.RIGOROUS LABORATORY PROOF OF CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFERThankfully, other scientists have performed similar experiments, furthervalidating Backster’s initial results, without disappearing or being threatened.Dr. Charles Tart, from Berkeley, set up a bizarre experiment where he gavehimself painful electrical shocks, automatically—and then attempted to “send”his pain to another person who was the “receiver.” This person was wired up tomeasure heart rate, blood volume and other physiological signals. Tart foundthat the receiver’s body did indeed respond to the shocks—through things such asan increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood volume—but the receiver had noconscious knowledge of when Dr. Tart was sending them.12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en64]Probably the greatest modern pioneer in these sorts of experiments is Dr.William Braud. According to Lynne McTaggart in The Field, Dr. Braud began byperforming an experiment in the late 1960s in which he attempted to transmit histhoughts to one of his students—while the student was under hypnosis. When Dr.Braud pricked his hand, the student felt pain. When he put his hand over acandle flame, the student felt heat. When he stared at a picture of a boat, thestudent made comments about a boat. When Braud stepped into the sun, the studentmentioned sunlight. Distance did not seem to matter; even when Braud was manymiles away, it worked just as well.13 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en65]This certainly suggests that the Backster Effect is just the beginning—we sharemuch more information with one another than just the shocks from our nervoussystem. As the years went by, Dr. Braud sought ways to study this effect undercontrolled laboratory conditions—and he has now published more than 250 articlesin professional psychology journals, and written numerous book chapters.14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en66] -15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en67]Braud’s first rigorous laboratory experiment involved knife fish, which emitelectrical signals that change whenever they move from one position to another.These electrical signals can be used to precisely determine the fish’s position,and can be picked up by electrodes attached to the side of the tank. Braud’sparticipants were consistently able to change the position of the fish by theirconscious intent alone. Similarly, Braud found that participants could increasethe speed that Mongolian gerbils ran on their activity wheels, with all otherfactors being ruled out. Braud also designed an experiment in which he put humanred blood cells in a test tube—along with a saline solution that had enough saltin it to kill the cells. His participants were able to focus their minds andprotect these cells from bursting open. This was easily verified by measuringhow much light could pass through the solution. The more the cells broke down,the more transparent the solution became—so less light was a sign of healthiercells.16 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en68]From there, Braud moved on to human beings. Have you ever felt someone staringat you, only to turn around and find out you were right? Braud wanted to see ifhe could study this effect in the lab, and confirm that it really works. He putone person in a private room with a small video camera, wired him up to thepolygraph and told him to relax. In a neighboring room, he could see theparticipant’s face on his television monitor. A second participant was then toldto stare intently at this person on the monitor and try to get his attention—butonly when a computerized random-number generator told them to. Sure enough, whenthe first person was being stared at, his skin revealed significant electricalspikes. This occurred an average of 59 percent of the time he was being staredat—as opposed to the 50 percent that would be expected by random chance.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en69] This might not sound like much, but a9-percent increase above chance is considered highly substantial.Dr. Braud then changed the experiment. He had his participants meet each otherfirst—and stare intently into each other’s eyes while they talked. He encouragedthem to get comfortable with each other. Now, when the person was stared at byhis new friend, he noticeably relaxed—on a measurable electrical level.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en70] This is solid proof that people canbe staring at us, sending us their pain, transmitting thoughts—and even thoughour bodies may react to these signals on a physical level, we usually don’t haveany conscious awareness of what’s going on. The same thing might be happeningwhen the phone rings and we think we know who it is—only to find out we wereright. When the caller visualizes our face, we feel something—and if our mind isquiet enough, we might get a mental image of who it is. Rupert Sheldrake, one ofthe most renowned Source Field investigators in modern times, also has proven“the sense of being stared at” is indeed genuine—in multiple, publishedexperiments.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en71]THE OUTER LIMITS OF SHARED CONSCIOUSNESSMinor anxiety disorders, like nervousness and the inability to concentrate, alsowere measurably improved in Dr. Braud’s studies. In an experiment from 1983, Dr.Braud and an anthropologist named Marilyn Schlitz studied a group of highlynervous people along with a group of calmer people. The nervousness of eachgroup, in this case, could be directly measured by the amount of electricalactivity on their skin. In some cases, the groups were given common relaxationtechniques and instructed to calm themselves down. In other cases, Braud andSchlitz tried to calm them down by simply concentrating on them from anotherroom. The originally calm group showed very little change by practicing theexercises or being “remote influenced,” but the nervous group became muchcalmer—in both cases. Surprisingly, Braud and Schlitz’s remote influencingeffects upon the nervous group worked almost as well as any relaxation exercisesthey did for themselves.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en72] Similarly,when Braud and Schlitz remotely concentrated on someone in an attempt to helphim focus his attention, the subject had an immediate improvement. The peoplewhose minds were the most apt to wander gained the strongest benefits from thisprocess.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en73]Thankfully, Braud also found out that we are not helpless against these remoteinfluences—we can shield the ones we don’t want.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en74] If you visualize a protective shield,a safe, a barrier or a screen—whatever you feel comfortable with—you can indeedstop these influences from affecting you.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en75] The remote influencers did not knowwhich participants were trying to block their thoughts, but the people who didtry to shield themselves were successful.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en76] Other evidence suggests a positiveattitude in life is your best protection, as we will see—the highest “coherence”wins.Sperry Andrews put together a proposal for a series of ninety-second televisionspots that would demonstrate these “collective consciousness” experiments to theworld—for an initial investment of $711,000 dollars.The Human Connection Project contends that a significant number of people willshare a greater sense of belonging together after watching extensive mediaannouncements and presentations that illustrate this subject. Out of thisheightened sense of connection to a larger whole, it is predicted that a newlevel of shared intelligence, compassion, and creativity will begin to emergeamong people.25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en77]In this proposal, Andrews mentions some startling facts. More than five hundreddifferent scientific studies have proven that human consciousness can affectbiological as well as electronic systems26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en78]—and we will learn more about theelectronic experiments later on. Schlitz and Honorton explored thirty-ninedifferent studies during which people successfully shared thoughts andexperiences—while they were physically separated from one another. The overallprobability that these effects were caused by chance alone was less than onepart in a trillion.27 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en79] In somestudies, ordinary people detected events that had not even happened yet inlinear time.28 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en80] -29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en81] In an extremely comprehensive paperon the Source Field from 2004, Robert Kenny revealed that the Institute ofHeartMath developed Grinberg’s original discoveries about brain-to-brainentrainment much further:Even when participants were in separate rooms, their heart and brain wavesbecame synchronized or entrained, when they had close living or workingrelationships, or when they felt appreciation, care, empathy, or love towardeach other. . . . When people were able to internally entrain their own personalheart and brain waves [through meditation and other related techniques], theycaused the heart and brain waves of other individuals to entrain with theirs.Entrainment appears to increase attention, to produce feelings of calm and deepconnection, and to facilitate tele-prehension of each other’s sensations,emotions, images, thoughts and intuitions. 30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en82]There is no turning back. These discoveries are undeniable facts. Ourmind-to-mind connection, sharing our thoughts and experiences, has now beenproven—at odds of more than a trillion to one against chance. Skeptics continueto boldly proclaim that “there is no evidence,” but perhaps a better phrase touse is “there is no publicity.” No one has taken Sperry Andrews’s offer toproduce these groundbreaking, civilization-defining TV spots. Hardly any of thisinformation appears in newspapers, magazines, TV shows or movies. In 2006,Britain’s premier science forum featured research from Rupert Sheldrakesuggesting that some people know who is calling them before they answer thetelephone—and this prompted a furious reaction among participating scientists.Dr. Peter Fenwick also presented his conclusions that consciousness survivesafter clinical death, and Deborah Delanoy discussed research similar to WilliamBraud’s—showing we can influence someone else’s body by thinking about him orher. Oxford Professor of Chemistry Peter Atkins said, “Work in this field is acomplete waste of time . . . there is absolutely no reason to suppose thattelepathy is anything more than a charlatan’s fantasy.”31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en83]Just as this book was in its final edits in January 2011, great controversyagain arose because The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a highlyrespected science journal, decided to publish the research of Dr. Daryl J.Bem—an emeritus professor at Cornell University. What makes this research socontroversial is it contains some of the most stunning proof ever revealed thathuman consciousness has direct access to events in the future.In one case, Dr. Bem wanted to see if people would “remember” words that theydidn’t actually study until after they had already been tested on these words.This experiment began with the participants being given a test in which they hadto memorize certain vocabulary words. After they took the test, Dr. Bem randomlychose some of the specified vocabulary words and had the participants study themclosely: learn their definitions, practice with them and become comfortable withthem. The words they studied in the future (after the test) became the wordsthey memorized the most easily in the past (during the test). Another experimentproved that the emotional shock of seeing an erotic picture would actuallytravel backwards in time. In this case, a computer screen showed two “curtains.”The participant was told that one of the curtains would have a picture behindit, and he was asked to guess which curtain. The picture was chosen, at random,only after the participant made a guess—which the computer program had no accessto. Dr. Bem found that when the computer selected an erotic picture, theparticipants were more likely to guess which curtain it would appear behind—anaverage of 53 percent of the time. Photographs that were neutral or negative didnot have this effect.32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en84]Naturally, this turns everything we think we know about science and physics onits end—so many scientists are obviously “mortified” about it, and believe it is“pure craziness.”33 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en85] Science should beabout discovering the truth, and that requires an open mind. Dr. Bem’s researchis very sound—it just reveals new things about ourselves, and about reality,that most people do not already know. The data is there—but up until veryrecently, the publicity has been lacking. Hopefully the publication of Dr. Bem’spaper will help start a new trend.Obviously, some of the problem is that we are constantly being bombarded withnew information, and it is increasingly difficult to sort through all of it.However, this research is obviously far more important than the latest newsabout which celebrity got drunk, angry, naked or arrested, or photographed insome embarrassing way. It does appear, however, that these same celebrities canget addicted to being stared at—as we now know there is a very real energy highthey get from all the attention.The Backster Effect occurs within each and every cell, as we saw in his studieswith the white blood cells from a human mouth. However, many ancient traditionsadamantly insisted there is a master gland in the human body that is responsiblefor pulling in thoughts and images from the Source Field, and sending our ownthoughts back out. In the next chapter, we will pursue this intriguinginvestigation—and see if modern science can shed any new light on this ancientmystery."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEThe Pineal Gland and the Third EyeMany different ancient traditions say there is a physical gland, nestled deepwithin the center of the brain, where telepathic thought transmissions andvisual images are received. This tiny pinecone-shaped gland is known as theepiphysis or pineal gland, and is about the size of a pea. In fact, the word“pineal” comes from the Latin pinea, which means “pinecone.” Ancient culturesall over the world were fascinated by the pinecone and pineal-gland-shapedimages, and consistently used them in their highest forms of spiritual artwork.Pythagoras, Plato, Iamblichus, Descartes and others wrote of this gland withgreat reverence. It has been called the seat of the soul. Obviously, if this“third eye” is receiving direct impressions from the Source Field, we have notyet identified how such a mechanism might work—but that doesn’t necessarily meanthe ancients were wrong.The pineal gland is not technically a part of the brain; it is not protected bythe blood-brain barrier.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en86] It existsin the approximate geometric center of the brain’s mass, has a hollow interiorfilled with a watery fluid, and receives more blood flow than any other part ofthe body except the kidneys. Since it is not protected by the blood-brainbarrier, the fluid inside the pineal gland gathers an increasing amount ofmineral deposits, or “brain sand,” over time—which have optical and chemicalproperties similar to the enamel on your teeth.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en87] This calcification appears as abonelike mass in the center of your brain on an X-ray or MRI. Doctors use thishard, white cluster to tell if you have a brain tumor. If the white dot appearsto be pushed off to one side in your scan, they know a tumor has changed theshape of your brain.006 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_006_r1.jpg]The pineal gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland located in the geometric center ofthe brain that fascinated many ancient cultures.

Calcified pinealgland appears in the top-right image as a round white mass, slightly offset bythe tumor.As I detailed in my online documentary The 2012 Enigma,3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en88] pinecones are prominently featured insacred art and architecture from all over the world—in an apparent homage to thepineal gland. This is a truly astonishing phenomenon that has never beenadequately explained. A Christian article entitled “Pagans Love Pine Cones andUse Them in Their Art” has many pictures that prove the point4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en89]:• A bronze sculpture of a hand from the mystery cult of Dionysus in the lateRoman Empire has a pinecone on the thumb, amidst other strange symbols;• A Mexican god holds pinecones and a fir tree in a sculpture;• A staff of the Egyptian sun god Osiris from a museum in Turino, Italy, has two“kundalini serpents” that entwine together and face a pinecone on the top;• The Assyrian/Babylonian winged god Tammuz is pictured holding a pinecone;• The Greek god Dionysus carries a staff with a pinecone on top, symbolizingfertility;• Bacchus, the Roman god of drunkenness and revelry, also carries a pineconestaff;• The Catholic pope carries a staff with a pinecone directly above where hishand is positioned—and the staff then extends up into a stylized tree trunk;• Many Roman Catholic candle holders, ornaments, sacred decorations andarchitectural samples feature the pinecone as a key design element;• The largest pinecone sculpture in the world is prominently featured in VaticanSquare—in the Court of the Pinecone.We’ll come back to these startling Catholic examples in a minute. In The 2012Enigma, I also pointed out that King Tut’s golden burial mask features a uraeus,or “kundalini serpent,” emerging from the general area of the pineal gland inhis forehead. Statues of Buddha often feature a prominent third eye between hiseyebrows as a raised, circular area. Buddha’s hair appears to be stylized in theshape of a pineal gland as well. Almost all Hindu gods and goddesses arepictured with a bindi, or third eye, between their eyebrows. Many Hindus stillwear such a symbol to this day. The Hindu god Shiva’s hair also looks like astylized pineal gland—and the “kundalini serpents” wrap around his neck.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en90]008 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_008_r1.jpg]Pope Benedict XVI holding papal staff with carved pinecone—apparentlysymbolizing his ability to contact higher intelligence via the pineal gland.After I released The 2012 Enigma, I found a sculpture of the Mesoamerican godQuetzalcoatl emerging from the mouth of a serpent—and the body of the serpent iscoiled into the exact shape of the pineal gland. In this same sculpture,Quetzalcoatl wears a necklace made out of pinecones. 6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en91] 7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en92] Better yet, the pinecones appear tohave energetic waves streaming into them from the bottom. The mouth of theserpent frames Quetzalcoatl’s face just like we would see in a modernastronaut’s helmet. Also, if you look at pictures of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl,the “Plumed Serpent,” at Teotihuacan, you can easily see multiple images ofpinecones carved alongside the serpent heads.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en93]Statue of Quetzalcoatl emerging from serpent’s mouth and wearing a wreath ofpinecone-shaped objects. The entire statue is shaped like the pineal gland.009 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_009_r1.jpg]SACRED STONESAncient cultures also used sacred stones to symbolize the pineal gland. TheSumerian version was called the “Primitive Mountain”—and it was believed to bethe first piece of land to emerge from the primordial sea during the foundationof Heaven and earth. This may represent how the pineal gland is allegedly thefirst place in the body that is contacted by the waters of Spirit—thenonphysical realms of the afterlife. In Babylonian culture, this same mountainbecame a symbol for the axis mundi—the axis the world turns on, and/or thecentral navel of the earth. This was the place where the gods came and went—andit was illustrated with the king standing directly on top of the mountain. Aphysical stone was also erected to mark this most sacred location—and itdetermined all the parallels and meridians, as well as the cardinal points ofthe compass.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en94]The Egyptians had the same myth of a stone marking the center of the world,which they called the Benben—and the king Atum stood upon it during his act ofcreation. Some forms of the Benben are shaped exactly like the pineal gland. Thecapstone of a pyramid, as well as the pyramid structure itself, is also believedto represent the Benben stone.10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en95] Thisobviously gives incredible new context to the Great Seal of the United States.Here we have a single eye in a triangle, floating on top of a pyramid. In lightof the pyramid/Benben/third-eye relationship, the symbolic connection betweenthe Great Seal and the pineal gland is undeniable—and we will discuss thismysterious symbol in chapter 7. In early illustrations of the Great Seal of theUnited States, the bird on the front side was not an eagle—it was deliberatelyillustrated as a phoenix.The Egyptians drew the Benben stone with a bird flanking it on eitherside—called the Bennu bird.11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en96] Thisbird may be depicted as a hawk, eagle, heron or yellow wagtail, depending uponwhich Egyptian source you study—but in Greek mythology the Bennu bird is knownas the phoenix.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en97] This mythicalcreature experiences death by fire, followed by a spontaneous rebirth from theashes—clearly associating the Bennu bird with a profound spiritual awakening andtransformation. The words Benben and Bennu are both derived from the rootsyllable Bn, which means “ascension” or “to rise” in Egyptian.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en98] Two serpents may also be picturedwith the Benben stone, at times, and they appear equivalent to the “kundaliniserpents” in Hinduism—illustrating the flow of energetic currents moving up thespine and on into the pineal gland.010 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_010_r1.gif]Early concept art for Great Seal of the United States, c. 1776–1782. The bird isa stylized phoenix, and bears no resemblance to an eagle.It is also fascinating to note that in Egyptian mythology, the Bennu’s cry isbelieved to have started the great cycles of time. These cycles were said tohave been appointed by a Divine intelligence—and Horus, the Bennu bird, becamethe Egyptian deity associated with the division of time.14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en99] There is a strong possibility thatthe main unit of time represented by the Bennu’s cry is the Precession of theEquinoxes—a 25,920-year cycle that appears as a slow wobble in the earth’s axis.This strongly implied association between the Bennu and the 25,920-year cyclemay be a prophecy that humanity will experience a phoenix-like transmutationeffect at the end of this cycle—and we will explore other prophetic traditionsthat support this concept as well. (Our investigation into the precession beginsin chapter 6.) The Egyptian Book of the Dead features instructions on how thespiritual seeker may transform himself or herself into a Bennu bird or phoenix,symbolically speaking—and the results of this practice, if successfullyachieved, are very interesting:I have flown up like the primeval ones . . . I appear in glory with the stridesof the gods. . . . As for him who knows this pure spell, it means going out intothe day after death and being transformed at will. . . . And nothing evil shallhave power over him.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en100]In Hinduism the Shiva lingam is a stone shaped exactly like the pineal gland—andis mythologically associated with the center of the world, from which the godShiva first burst through in a fiery spectacle.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en101] Again we remember the pineal glandis in the geometric center of the brain, and was believed to be the first pointof contact for telepathic information exchange—not unlike the idea of a godbursting through to communicate a message. Let’s not forget that Shiva is alsodrawn with the fully opened third eye, the kundalini serpents around his neckand his hair stylized to look like a pineal gland.In Greece we have the omphalos stone, which was housed at the Oracle at Delphiand is also shaped exactly like the pineal gland. This was believed to be astone in which the god Apollo resided—and through it, the oracles couldcommunicate with him and harness the power of prophecy. Some omphalos stones areclearly pictured with the “kundalini serpent” wrapping around them. The wordomphalos means “the center of the earth” and “navel” in Greek, and this area wasagain the main geographic reference point for the entire Hellenic empire.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en102]In the Roman empire this same stone was known as the baetyl, a Phoenician wordthat was later written as Beth-el18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en103]—and was apparently the word root forBethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, who became the “chief cornerstone” of theChristian world. The baetyl stone was directly associated with oracles andprophecy. A surprising number of Greek and Roman coins prominently feature theomphalos or baetyl stone on one side, sometimes guarded by a hawk—as one ancientdepiction of the Bennu bird—or a serpent. Some of these coins feature the “Treeof Life,” another symbol of the axis mundi, growing directly out of the stone—oradjacent to it.011 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_011_r1.jpg]Greek coins with eagle/phoenix and omphalos stone with Tree of Life emergingfrom it (top) and winged god and pyramid-shaped baetyl with capstone (bottom).Other Roman coins feature a triangular baetyl—specifically an isosceles trianglewith a narrow base and two longer sides of equal length. This triangle lookshalfway between a pyramid and an obelisk in shape, and is curiously similar tothe pyramid we see on the U.S. dollar bill, although steeper. Even moreinterestingly, some of these Roman coins have the top part of the triangle cutoff by a horizontal line, which forms the equivalent of a small capstone.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en104] If you think about a Roman coin witha baetyl on one side and a hawk or eagle on the other, you’re now much closer tothe Great Seal of the United States, with a pyramid on one side and the eagle onthe other—and this does not appear to be a coincidence.Many of these Roman baetyl coins feature the image of a winged angel on theopposite side. The design of this angel is very similar to that of wingedBabylonian gods, such as Tammuz, who were pictured holding a pinecone in onehand and pointing it as if it possessed mystical powers.012 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_012_r1.jpg]Greek coins with god Apollo sitting on omphalos stone, stylized to look like apinecone.One coin from Syria, circa 246–227 B.C., features the god Apollo sitting on theomphalos stone—which is very clearly stylized to look like a pinecone in thiscase. Two other Greek coins show Apollo sitting on an omphalos that is even moreblatantly stylized as a pinecone.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en105]Given this history, and the widespread use of the omphalos and baetyl on Greekand Roman coins, we can understand why the Romans placed a giant bronze statueof a pinecone in the center of Saint Peter’s in the Vatican, and built apinecone into the pope’s staff. The pope is supposed to be God’s anointedmessenger, and in the ancient traditions, this requires an “awakened” pinealgland. A quick Google Images search proves the staff I show in The 2012 Enigmais not the only one with a pinecone in it that the pope carries.The gigantic bronze pinecone at the Vatican is much taller than a human being,and is surrounded by Egyptian symbols. This statue fixed the Vatican as thecenter of the Roman Catholic world—the axis mundi—in accordance with the ancienttradition. Two lions guard the statue at its base—sitting on pedestals that areinscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphics. The statue itself is flanked with twobirds that almost certainly represent the Egyptian Bennu/phoenix, but none ofthis is explained. Behind the looming pinecone statue lies an openEgyptian-style sarcophagus, similar to what is found in the King’s Chamber ofthe Great Pyramid. Elsewhere in the Vatican we find Egyptian obelisks—withChristian symbols apologetically included on their tops.013 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_013_r1.jpg]View behind Vatican pinecone, showing open Egyptian sarcophagus with protectivePlexiglas cover to stop people from lying in it.This massive bronze pinecone is found in the Court of the Pigna, or Court of thePinecone—at the northern end of the great Renaissance Belvedere Courtyard inSaint Peter’s. To the south, we find Pope Pius VII’s Braccio Nuovo. Eastward wesee the Chiaromoni Gallery. Pope Innocent VIII’s palazzetto is to the north, andPope Sixtus V’s Apostolic Library galleries are to the west. This huge pineconewas cast in the first or second century A.D., by Publius Cincius Salvius—whoinscribed his name on the base. Near the end of the eighth century, it was moveddirectly into the center of the entrance hall in the medieval Saint Peter’s. Itwasn’t dismantled and moved into its current position until 1608.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en106]014 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_014_r1.jpg]The Vatican Court of the Pinecone, showing giant pinecone statue (right) andbronze “sphere within sphere” sculpture (left), stylized much like an eye.Obviously, the early Church fathers felt the pinecone was an extremely importantsymbol if they placed it so prominently in the Vatican. Further clues may befound in the Bible—where Jesus said, “The light of the body is the eye: iftherefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be filled with light.”(Matthew 6:22)22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en107] The Court of thePinecone also has an enigmatic “sphere within sphere” sculpture at the center.Various images seem to be conveyed, including the shell of an egg cracking open,the possible idea of two planets colliding together, and the concept of hiddengears and machinery being exposed under the surface of the spheres. The twospheres are offset from each other by ninety degrees, and various physics modelshave suggested we must make an angular turn like this—what they call an“orthogonal rotation”—to enter into higher dimensions. Intriguingly, thissculpture also looks like a stylized eye—which fits with the idea of thepinecone representing the pineal gland or “third eye.”015 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_015_r1.jpg]Close-up view of peculiar bronze sculpture in Vatican Court of the Pinecone,suggesting a cracked egg and hidden machinery underneath.Islamic tradition is also built around a sacred stone—the Ka’aba—that is thecentral object of devotion for the pilgrimage to the holy land of Mecca. It alsois the axis mundi of the Islamic world, since every Muslim in the world praystoward this location. A small area of the stone is exposed for the pilgrims tokiss, and this area is surrounded by a polished metallic brace that looks justlike a vertical, stylized third eye. The Ka’aba may therefore be anotherrepresentation of the pineal gland, in further accordance with the ancienttradition. Ireland also has cult stones dating back to around 200 B.C. that fitthe pattern—and the Turoe Stone in County Galway looks just like the omphalos,Benben, shiva lingam and baetyl, with stylized, firelike waves of energy carvedacross its surface. 23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en108]THE WRITTEN LEGENDSThe written history of the pineal gland as our possible gateway to the SourceField, where it is discussed without any veiled symbolism, begins with the workof Pythagoras and Plato—as the occultist Helena Blavatsky explained. When shebrings up “the Mysteries,” she is referring to an allegedly hidden tradition ofsecrets that have been handed down from ancient Egypt and other civilizations inthe distant past. Apparently there are “mystery schools” that have continuedteaching these ancient traditions through to the present day.The key to the whole Pythagorean system, irrespective of the particular scienceto which it is applied, is the general formula of unity in multiplicity, theidea of the One evolving and pervading the many. . . . Pythagoras called it theScience of Numbers. Pythagoras taught that this science—the chief of all inoccultism—was revealed to men by “celestial deities,” those godlike men who werethe Divine Instructors of the Third Race. It was first taught to the Greeks byOrpheus, and for centuries made known only to the “chosen few” in the Mysteries.. . .In his Life of Pythagoras, Iamblichus repeats the statement of Plato that thestudy of the science of Numbers tends to awaken that organ in the brain that theancients described as the “eye of wisdom”—the organ now known to physiology asthe pineal gland. Speaking of the mathematical disciplines, Plato says in TheRepublic (Book VII), “the soul through these disciplines has an organ purifiedand enlightened, an organ better worth saving than ten thousand corporeal eyes,since truth becomes visible through this alone.”24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en109]According to the prolific and controversial Masonic scholar Manly Palmer Hall,Freemasonry traces itself back to these same Egyptian mystery schools. He alsoclaims the biggest secret of Freemasonry is the regeneration of the human beinginto a Divine state—through the awakening of the pineal gland. Each of thethirty-three degrees of Masonry correspond to one of the vertebrae in the humanspine—as the kundalini fire rises up to merge with the pineal gland.The exact science of human regeneration is the Lost Key of Masonry, for when theSpirit Fire is lifted up through the thirty-three degrees, or segments of thespinal column, and enters into the domed chamber of the human skull, it finallypasses into the pituitary body (Isis), where it invokes Ra (the pineal gland)and demands the Sacred Name. Operative Masonry, in the fullest meaning of thatterm, signifies the process by which the Eye of Horus is opened.E. A. Wallis Budge has noted that in some of the papyri illustrating theentrance of the souls of the dead into the judgment hall of Osiris, the deceasedperson has a pinecone attached to the crown of his head. The Greek mystics alsocarried a symbolic staff, the upper end being in the form of a pinecone, whichwas called the thyrsus of Bacchus. . . . In the human brain there is a tinygland called the pineal body, which is the sacred eye of the ancients, andcorresponds to the third eye of the Cyclops. Little is known concerning thefunction of the pineal body, which Descartes suggested (more wisely than heknew) might be the abode of the spirit of man. As its name signifies, the pinealgland is the sacred pinecone in man—the eye single, which cannot be opened untilCHiram (the Spirit Fire) is raised through the sacred seals [or chakras,] whichare called the Seven Churches in Asia.”25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en110]Hall gave additional information into this deep Masonic secret in another book,The Occult Anatomy of Man.The Hindus teach that the pineal gland is the third eye, called the Eye ofDangma. It is called by the Buddhists the all-seeing eye, and is spoken of inChristianity as the eye single. . . . The pineal gland is supposed to secrete anoil, which is called resin, the life of the pine tree. This word [resin] issupposed to be involved in the origin of the Rosicrucians, who were working withthe secretions of the pineal gland and seeking to open the eye single; for it issaid in scripture: “The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye besingle thy whole body shall be filled with light.” . . .[The pineal gland] is a spiritual organ which is later destined to be what itonce was, namely a connecting link between the human and the divine. Thevibrating finger on the end of this gland is the rod of Jesse and the scepter ofthe high priest. Certain exercises as given in the Eastern and Western mysteryschools cause this little finger to vibrate, resulting in a buzzing, droningsound in the brain. This is sometimes very distressing, especially when theindividual who experiences this phenomena, in all too many cases, knows nothingabout the experiences through which he is passing.”26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en111]It appears the Freemasons and other secret societies may have also referred tothe awakened pineal gland as the Philosopher’s Stone. Manly Palmer Hall’sdescription is but one of many that make this strong suggestion—when youconsider the context.The Philosopher’s Stone is an ancient symbol of the perfected and regeneratedman whose divine nature shines forth. . . . As the rough diamond is dull andlifeless when first removed from the black carbon, so the spiritual nature ofman in its “fallen” state reveals little, if any, of its inherent luminosity. .. . He who possesses the Philosopher’s Stone possesses Truth, the greatest ofall treasures, and is therefore rich beyond the calculation of man; he isimmortal because Reason takes no account of death and he is healed ofIgnorance—the most loathsome of all diseases.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en112]Rudolf Steiner, a well-known scholar of the esoteric mystery schools, arguedthat the legend of the Holy Grail—a chalice filled with the “waters of life” or“elixir of immortality”—is yet another symbolic reference to the pineal gland.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en113] The bowl of the Grail chalice isshaped like a pineal gland in most historic illustrations—but upside downcompared to everything else we’ve been discussing so far. A recent Steinercompilation entitled The Mysteries of the Holy Grail establishes detailedconnections between the Grail legends and the pineal gland.The [Holy] Grail is also located within each of us, in the castle of the skull,and can nourish our subtlest perceptions in a way that dispels all but the mostrefined material influence. . . . Steiner is referring here to the pineal glandin the brain. . . .29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en114]The legends of the “Cosmic Egg,” “World Egg” and particularly the “Orphic Egg”also appear to be pineal gland references. The Orphic Egg is pictured with aserpent wrapped around it, and the shape of an egg is similar to the shape ofthe pineal gland. Manly Palmer Hall again gives insight into the meaning of thisancient symbol, hinting at a connection with the pineal gland—when you considerhis other statements as well.The ancient symbol of the Orphic Mysteries was the serpent-entwined egg, whichsignified Cosmos as encircled by the fiery Creative Spirit. The egg alsorepresents the soul of the philosopher; the serpent, the Mysteries. At the timeof initiation the shell is broken and man emerges from the embryonic state ofphysical existence wherein he had remained through the fetal period ofphilosophic regeneration.30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en115]Hall also believed the unicorn was another mythical symbol of the awakenedpineal gland:The single horn of the unicorn may represent the pineal gland, or third eye,which is the spiritual cognition center in the brain. The unicorn was adopted bythe Mysteries as a symbol of the illumined spiritual nature of the initiate. . ..31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en116]According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, René Descartes believedthat human beings were composed of two main ingredients—a body and a soul—andthe pineal gland was the junction point between them. In Descartes’s view, thepineal gland is “involved in sensation, imagination, memory and the causation ofbodily movements.” Though much of what Descartes said does not line up withmodern understandings of the brain, some of his thoughts may have come directlyfrom the ancient mystery schools.The part of the body in which the soul directly exercises its functions is notthe heart at all, or the whole of the brain. It is rather the innermost part ofthe brain, which is a certain very small gland situated in the middle of thebrain’s substance. . . . A low-pressure image of the sensory stimulus [from thesoul] appears on the surface of the pineal gland.32[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en117]Descartes’s idea of visual images appearing on the surface of the pineal glandmay be far more accurate than most people realize—as we are about to discover.This suggests that he did not think of this concept himself, but might haveleaked ancient secrets he had been entrusted with—mixing them in with his ownideas as well.The Edgar Cayce Readings also spoke about the pineal gland on a variety ofoccasions—and agreed that this was a literal eye in the center of the brainstem, and that it was the anchor point where the soul joins with the body.33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en118]MEDICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE THIRD EYEAccording to Dr. Richard Cox in USC’s Health & Medicine journal, Descartes“perceived the mind as some sort of out-of-body experience expressed through thepineal gland.”34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en119] Cox reveals somesurprising facts about the pineal gland.Under the skin in the skull of a lizard lies a light-responsive “third eye”which is the evolutionary equivalent of the boneencased, hormone-secretingpineal gland in the human brain. The human pineal is denied access to lightdirectly, but like the lizard’s “third eye,” it shows enhanced release of itshormone, melatonin, during the night. . . . Dissected, the reptile’s pineallooks much like an eye, with the same shape and tissue. The pineal . . .uniquely remains the major source of circulating melatonin, [which tells us]when to go to sleep at night and when to get up in the morning. . . . Thepresence of light reduces the pineal gland’s secretion of melatonin, anddarkness stimulates production. Since daylight and darkness affect the gland’sproduction of the hormone, the pineal functions as a kind of internaltimepiece.35 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en120]It is certainly strange that a reptile’s pineal gland has the same shape andtissue as a normal eye—considering the ancients literally believed the pinealgland was a third eye within the human body, performing a similar biologicalfunction. The more I researched this subject, the more I found clues theancients may have indeed known something that has since been lost. An article inScience News by Julie Ann Miller began to reveal the biological connectionbetween the pineal gland and the retina of the eye.The retina and the pineal gland are the organs primarily responsible for thebody’s recognition and sophisticated processing of external light. Untilrecently these two organs in mammals seemed to have little else in common andwere consequently studied by separate groups of scientists. But a new allianceof researchers is now exploring striking similarities that are speeding researchefforts in both fields. . . . Once the groups of scientists began workingtogether, they discovered surprising similarities between the two organs.36[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en121]An article in Science Daily featured startling statements from Dr. David Klein,the chief scientist in the National Institute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment’s Section on Neuroendocrinology. Many sub-mammal species alreadydetect light with their pineal glands—as a third eye.Dr. Klein noted that the photoreceptor cells of the retina strongly resemble thecells of the pineal gland, and that the pineal cells of sub-mammals (such asfish, frogs and birds) detect light.”37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en122]An even more surprising suggestion can be found in a 1986 paper by A. F.Weichmann, in the professional science journal Experimental Eye Research.It is apparent that several relationships exist between the pineal gland andretina. The similarities in development and morphology have been obvious formany years. A recent resurgence of interest in this field has led to a furtherunderstanding of many functional similarities between these two organs. . . .Although the mammalian pineal gland is considered to be only indirectlyphotosensitive, the presence of proteins in the pineal which are normallyinvolved in phototransduction [light sensing] in the retina, raises thepossibility that direct photic events may occur in the mammalian pineal gland.This possibility awaits further study.38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en123]Weichmann is openly speculating that “direct photic events”—flashes of photonsof light—may be somehow occurring in the pineal gland by an unknown mechanism.Due to the similarity of the pineal gland and the retina in the eye, the cellswithin your pineal gland may be detecting photons and sending them to yourbrain—by a process called phototransduction.R. N. Lolley and associates also noticed the similarities between thelight-sensing activities of the retina and the pineal gland—in a paper from thepeer-reviewed science journal Neurochemical Research. Recent breakthroughs inunderstanding how the retina actually works have made this connection muchclearer than it would have been before.As the mechanisms of phototransduction in retinal photoreceptor cells havebecome more clear, it has equally become apparent that pinealocytes [pinealgland cells] have . . . a selective group of retinal proteins that are involvedin the phototransduction cascade. How the pinealocytes utilize these proteinsand whether [they] participate in signal transduction in the pineal is stillunknown. . . . The pinealocytes and retinal photoreceptors seem to possess asimilar repertoire of activities. . . .39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en124]No one has proven that the area inside the pineal gland is completely dark.Trace amounts of photons may be appearing by an unknown mechanism, as Descartesappears to have suggested. The pineal gland does appear to be set up for signaltransduction, just like the retina of the eye, where it picks up visual imagesand sends them to the brain. Another group of scientists studying the pinealgland in chickens also concluded that “the pineal gland may contain a rodlikephototransduction cascade.”40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en125]PIEZOLUMINESCENCEWhy would the body go to all this trouble to make a third eye, with the sametissues and light-sensing mechanisms as the retina, if there was nothing for usto see in there? What are we really seeing when we dream, have an out-of-bodyexperience or get sudden images flashing into our minds? And why were ancientcultures all over the world so obsessed with this gland as the center of ourpsychic vision? In a 2002 study published in the Bioelectromagnetics journal, S.S. Baconnier and associates may have found the answer—without even realizing it.They dissected twenty different human pineal glands and found one hundred tothree hundred microcrystals per cubic millimeter that were floatinginside—largely composed of a common mineral called calcite. Each of thesecrystals were between two and twenty micrometers in length, basically hexagonalin shape, and were very similar to other crystals we find in the inner earcalled otoconia. These inner-ear crystals are known to be piezoelectric—whichmeans they expand and contract in the presence of electromagnetic fields.41[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en126] The hairs inside the inner eardetect sounds when the otoconia bump against them—as they move around from thevibrations picked up by the eardrum.Piezoelectric crystals can be used to tune in to radio stations without anyelectricity. The electromagnetic waves that are jittering all around us makethese crystals expand and contract constantly. These movements can then bedetected and amplified to make sound.42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en127] Microphones also have piezoelectriccrystals that pick up sound vibrations and turn them directly into electricalcurrent. Some, if not many, piezoelectric crystals also give off varying amountsof light—in a process known as piezoluminescence.43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en128] This can be seen in a handheldlighter; when you push the button down, a spark of light comes out—which iscaused by compressing a piezoelectric crystal inside. Through a process calledpiezochromism, some piezoelectric crystals release different-colored photonsfrom the same crystal, depending upon the signal they receive. So far, thesepiezoelectric color changes have only been spotted in crystals under highpressure. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry in the United Kingdom,these piezoelectric color changes “have been observed in a few systems, but havenot been exploited in any commercial way.”44[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en129] So far, no one has needed to make amicroscopic computer monitor or video projection system, for example.Baconnier’s calcite crystals may not be the only potential source of light inthe pineal gland. Some scientists, such as Dr. Rick Strassman, suggest thepineal gland may also secrete a psychoactive chemical called DMT—though this hasnot yet been proven, due to how fast it breaks down. DMT also appears to releaselight by piezoluminescence, as we will see. Dr. Laurance Johnston discussed thecontroversial idea that the pineal gland creates DMT, which is chemicallysimilar to melatonin and serotonin—two chemicals that appear naturally in thepineal gland and appear to be synthesized by it.DMT is structurally similar to melatonin. The biochemical precursor to bothmolecules is serotonin, a key neurotransmitter whose pathways are involved inmood and targeted in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. DMT alsostructurally resembles other psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and psilocybin, andis the active agent in ayahuasca brew Amazon shamans use to provoke out-of-bodyexperiences. . . .Trace amounts of DMT have been found in humans, particularly in the lungs, butalso in the brain. Strassman emphasizes that the pineal gland is theoreticallymore capable than virtually any other tissue to produce DMT, includingpossessing prerequisite biochemical precursors and transforming enzymes.However, we do not yet know for certain whether DMT is made by the pineal.45[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en130]DMT may very well be the “resin” that Manly Palmer Hall said the ancient mysteryschools were looking for. However, I am definitely not an advocate of takingpsychedelic drugs, as they can be very dangerous and upsetting. There arespiritual practices that achieve similar effects in a positive way, and I’drather use what I already have—naturally and safely. However, I was fascinatedto discover that Nick Sand, the son of a prominent scientist on the ManhattanProject, found that DMT had enormous piezoluminescence—and apparentlycolor-shooting piezochromism as well.Sand was . . . the first underground chemist on record to have synthesized DMT.Sand and a lab colleague were the first people to notice that DMT exhibitspiezoluminescence: when hardened DMT that had collected in a tray was beingchipped out with a hammer and screwdriver in a brightly lit room, the blowsemitted massive amounts of colored light.46[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en131]Since the pineal gland is not protected by the blood-brain barrier, flooding thebloodstream with DMT may load up the pineal gland with piezoelectricmicrocrystals. This in turn may cause the third eye to pull in many morephotons—which might be emerging directly out of the Source Field, thanks toprinciples we have not yet discussed. (DNA also appears to be pulling in photonsby a similar process, as we will see.) Baconnier’s groundbreaking pineal glandstudies helped set the stage for this speculative idea of how the third eyecould actually be “seeing” photons of light.If piezoelectricity were to exist [in the pineal calcite microcrystals], anelectromechanical coupling mechanism to external electromagnetic fields may bepossible.47 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en132] These crystals could be responsible for an electromechanical biologicaltransduction mechanism in the pineal gland, due to their structure andpiezoelectric properties.48 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en133]For this same reason, Baconnier expresses deep concern about our use of cellularphones and other microwave-emitting devices—as they may couple directly withthese piezoelectric crystals in the pineal gland and change how they function.This could interrupt our synthesis of melatonin—with negative healthconsequences.HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF PINEAL GLAND CALCIFICATIONThe more we find out about the pineal gland, the more important it becomes inhuman health.Until relatively recently, the pineal gland was considered a vestigial organlacking function, i.e., the brain’s appendix. Then scientists showed it producedmelatonin, a hormone that profoundly affects us. The pineal gland converts theamino acid tryptophan into serotonin (a neurotransmitter) and, in turn,melatonin. The melatonin then is released into the bloodstream and cerebrospinalfluid where it is transported throughout the body. The release is closelycorrelated to our sleep-wake cycle. . . . Researchers have actually foundmagnetite clusters near the pineal gland. Like homing pigeons, humans haveresidual ability to orient to geomagnetic directional cues, an ability lost withpineal dysfunction. . . .Because the gland accumulates fluoride, it contains the body’s highest fluorideconcentration. Research shows that this accumulation depresses melatoninsynthesis with adverse consequences such as accelerating puberty onset . . .Because pineal dysfunction and, in turn, low melatonin secretion are correlatedwith MS [multiple sclerosis] symptoms, pineal failure may predispose one to MS.For example, Dr. Reuven Sandyk (New York) has stated, “Dysfunction of the pinealgland can explain a far broader range of biological phenomena associated withMS, and therefore the pineal gland should be considered the pivotal mover of thedisease.” . . . Sandyk suggests that MS severity may be related to the degree ofpineal failure. . . .Clearly, MS is associated with pineal calcification. For example, one studyshowed 100 percent of individuals with MS who were consecutively admitted to ahospital had pineal calcification compared to only 43 percent for similar-agedcontrols with other neurological disorders. In addition, groups that have a lowMS incidence (e.g., African Americans, Japanese) also have less pinealcalcification.49 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en134]Fluoride—such as you get in tap water and commercial toothpaste—is very likely ano-no if you want a healthy pineal gland. Fluoride apparently passes directlyinto the pineal gland through the bloodstream, where it then attaches itself tothe tiny crystals that are already floating around inside and covers them withhard mineral deposits—creating the white, bonelike lumps we see in X-ray images.This may damage the pineal gland’s ability to synthesize the chemicals we need.Fluoride may affect the enzymatic conversion of tryptophan to melatonin . . .Fluoride may also affect the synthesis of melatonin precursors (e.g.,serotonin), or other pineal products (e.g., 5-methoxytryptamine). . . . Inconclusion, the human pineal gland contains the highest concentration offluoride in the body. . . . Whether or not fluoride interferes with pinealfunction in humans requires further investigation. 50[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en135]As your pineal gland fills up with brain sand, or calcification, such as fromfluoride, you may well be losing your ability to produce melatonin—and that’sdefinitely not a good thing. One study in the Journal of Pineal Researchrevealed how many problems could be caused by pineal calcification andmalfunction—including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, schizophrenia andother forms of mental illness.Collectively, these findings suggest that melatonin probably is significantlyassociated with the regulation of memory, cognition, and also involved inemotional processes. . . . These findings emphasize a specific role formelatonin in mechanisms of consciousness, memory, and stress, [and] are alsoconsistent with reported studies that indicate melatonin alterations inpsychopathology mainly in patients with depression, schizophrenia, anxietydisorders, eating disorders and also in other mental disorders. . . .For example, in many studies decreased melatonin levels in patients withdepressive disorder were reported. . . . Typical melatonin alterations have alsobeen found in schizophrenia and suggest that diminished melatonin secretion maybe associated with the pathophysiology of a subgroup of schizophrenic patients.. . . [C]haracteristic alterations in rhythm of melatonin secretion have beenfound in various mental disorders. . . .51[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en136]I learned in 1995 that emotions like happiness don’t just happen automaticallybecause you want them to—they are controlled by chemicals in the brain. If yourbrain doesn’t have enough serotonin, you will be chemically incapable of feelinghappiness—even if you have many things in your life that should otherwise makeyou feel good. I had no idea how important the pineal gland was in manufacturingserotonin—and therefore in how happy we will feel—until I did the research forthis book.Nicholas Giarmin, a professor of pharmacology, and Daniel Freedman, a professorof psychiatry, confirmed that the human brain manufactures serotonin at varioussites in the brain. For example, in the Thalamus, they discovered 61 nanogramsof serotonin per gram of tissue; in the Hippocampus, 56 ng.; in the Central GraySection of the Midbrain, they found 482 ng. But in the Pineal Gland, they found3140 ng. of serotonin per gram of tissue. The Pineal Gland was unmistakably therichest site of serotonin in the brain. This discovery implicates the PinealGland as an important site of serotonergic [serotonin-forming] activity.52[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en137]These same scientists also found even more connections between the pineal gland,its serotonin levels and various mental disorders.An absolutely shocking discovery was the correlation between high serotoninlevels in the Pineal Gland and certain mental disorders! . . . The averageamount of serotonin found in the Pineal Glands of normal persons is about 3.14to 3.52 micrograms per gram of tissue. One schizophrenic was found to have aPineal Gland containing 10 micrograms of serotonin, around 3 times higher, whileanother patient, a sufferer from delirium tremens, had a Pineal Gland containing22.82 micrograms of serotonin, around 10 times higher then the average amount!53[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en138]This same study also established a direct connection between serotonin levels inthe pineal gland and tremors, such as tardive dyskinesia, Parkinson’s diseaseand even epileptic seizures. They found several studies showing “significantdifferences between the severity of dystonic movements [tremors] in patientswith no Pineal Gland calcification and those with pathologically enlarged PinealGland calcification.”54 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en139]Many health professionals have discussed the problems with calcification in thebody. In the worst-case scenario it can even create painful conditions likegout, in which your feet and toes have so much calcification that they formcrystals that hurt when they break. The most important key to eliminatingcalcification is a healthy diet. If you drink lots of purified water, you helpyour liver and kidneys flush out all these toxins. Eating a diet of fresh,organic raw foods insures you won’t have pesticides and preservativesaccumulating in your body and creating mineral deposits.Dr. Weston Price found that many traditional, undisturbed cultures had muchhigher bone density from eating their native foods. Their teeth stayedbeautifully straight, without any need for orthodontics, and they hardly evergot cavities—without even brushing. As soon as processed Western foods wereintroduced into their diets, such as refined sugar, white flour, nonorganicdairy and factory-farmed meats, their teeth became crooked and started to rotout of their heads. Thankfully, by going back to a pure, natural diet, rich intraditional foods—including organic animal products—we can actually reversethese problems and decalcify the pineal gland.Dr. Price identified a compound he called Activator X, which is also now knownas vitamin K2, in these traditional foods—which seemed to be the key ingredient.If you’re a vegetarian, you can get it from organic butter oil—harvested fromcattle who feed only on fresh, organic, rapidly growing grass. Meat eaters cantake fermented cod liver oil or ratfish liver oil, which is even better. Pricealso recommended combining land and sea—butter oil and fermented fish liveroil—for even stronger results. Activator X is also found in organic grass-fedeggs and meat products. In his book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, Dr.Price reveals controversial photographs of people who apparently reversed toothdecay and regrew enamel once they restored Activator X into their diets.Arterial plaque—the great killer in heart attacks and strokes—could also becleaned out, and pineal function greatly improved by decreasing itscalcification.55 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en140]As we look over the information in this chapter, there are compelling avenuesfor new research. I want to make it clear that I do not consider the SourceField to be some abstract, metaphysical idea. I agree with many Russianscientists who have concluded that the Source Field is directly measurable—as aspinning current within gravity. It appears that the more you screen out theinfluence of electromagnetic energy fields, the more sensitive you become to theinformation within the Source Field—perhaps through the pineal gland, as theancient traditions suggest.Considering all the information we have surveyed in these last three chapters,the obvious question we now must ask ourselves is this: What is consciousness?Where is the mind getting its orders from—in what may be a hidden, ongoing formof posthypnotic suggestion from some other aspect of ourselves? Are thoughtshappening in the brain, where they then generate an energy wave that can movethrough the Source Field? Or, are we actually using the Source Field tothink—and even share a collective mind with all others as well?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURThinking with the Field—in the Great Cycles of LifeAncient cultures all over the world were fascinated with pineal gland symbolism.Many different spiritual teachings—including secret mystery-schooltraditions—believed the pineal gland acts as a literal third eye in the brain.Recent scientific breakthroughs have determined that there are substantial,biological similarities between the retina and the pineal gland. Piezoelectricmicrocrystals may be transmitting photons that can be picked up by theretina-like tissue in the pineal gland—where they are then sent to the brain anddescrambled into visual images. This may be responsible for what we call the“mind’s eye”—such as when we suddenly see a mental image of our friend rightbefore he or she calls us.Clearly, more research is necessary to fully understand how the pineal glandactually works, but we already have some intriguing clues. Either way, inchapters 1 and 2 we found compelling scientific proof that all of Nature is inconstant telepathic communication—through a field that is clearly notelectromagnetic. When we combine Dr. William Braud’s extensive research withBackster’s breakthroughs, everything we think we know about being living,conscious humans must change. No longer can we see ourselves as separate fromour environment; we are fundamentally intertwined with those around us. Whateverwe think, they think—and whatever we feel, they feel. Exactly how far can thismindsharing effect go? Does it only work from one person to another? Does thisknowledge have any practical value, or is it just another piece of “weirdscience”?At this point, we may need to consider a shift in perspective. Let’s start byasking ourselves this question: What, exactly, is Mind? Even when we discuss thepineal gland, we are still prone to think of the mind as something that existswithin each person—where one mind then sends messages to another mind like atwo-way radio. However, what if we’re actually all sharing the same mind, tosome degree—and that mind is far more energetic in nature than we’ve been led tobelieve?Let’s go back to Backster and really think about what he discovered. If the mindis an energetic field, then bacteria could be sharing the same mind as plants.Plants could share the same mind as eggs. Eggs could share the same mind asanimals. And all living things may share the same mind with us. When Backsterwanted to burn a leaf, the plant responded. When Backster started watering aplant, it tracked his movements. Backster once told me his plants always“screamed” when one man came into the lab—and this man turned out to mow lawnsfor a living. When two people meditate together and then go their separate ways,a jolting flash of light in one person’s eyes will create an identical brainwaveshock in the other person—25 percent of the time. The Institute of HeartMathshowed that when we live together, work together or have an affinity for eachother, we begin synchronizing brainwaves, heartbeat patterns and other vitalsigns. Dr. William Braud found that a nervous person could be calmed down by“remote influencing.” A distracted person could have better concentration and animmediate improvement in mental focus—simply by having someone else do thethinking for them at a distance.THOUGHTS OCCURRING DIRECTLY IN THE SOURCE FIELDA September 2010 article in Wired magazine featured a discussion between KevinKelly and Steven Johnson on what they called “the hive mind.” A surprisingnumber of human innovations appear in different people’s minds simultaneously—asif we’re all using the same energy field to think with. As new ideas areintroduced into that energy field, they suddenly become available to everyone.Steven Johnson: . . . Calculus, the electrical battery, the telephone, the steamengine, the radio—all these groundbreaking innovations were hit upon by multipleinventors working in parallel with no knowledge of one another. . . .Kevin Kelly: It’s amazing that the myth of the lone genius has persisted for solong, since simultaneous invention has always been the norm, not the exception.Anthropologists have shown that the same inventions tended to crop up inprehistory at roughly similar times, in roughly the same order, among cultureson different continents that couldn’t possibly have contacted one another. . . .Gregor Mendel’s ideas about genetics, for example: He formulated them in 1865,but they were ignored for 35 years because they were too advanced. Nobody couldincorporate them. Then, when the collective mind was ready and his idea was onlyone hop away, three different scientists independently rediscovered his workwithin roughly a year of one another.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en141]An article in The New Yorker by Malcolm Gladwell reveals that this phenomenon isfar more prevalent than most people think. As of 1922, fully 148 different majorscientific discoveries had been documented as occurring nearly simultaneously.This phenomenon of simultaneous discovery—what science historians call“multiples”—turns out to be extremely common. One of the first comprehensivelists of multiples was put together by William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas, in1922, and they found a hundred and forty-eight major scientific discoveries thatfit the multiple pattern. Newton and Leibniz both discovered calculus. CharlesDarwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both discovered evolution. Three mathematicians“invented” decimal fractions. Oxygen was discovered by Joseph Priestley, inWiltshire, in 1774, and by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, a year earlier.Color photography was invented at the same time by Charles Cros and by LouisDucos du Hauron, in France. Logarithms were invented by John Napier and HenryBriggs in Britain, and by Joost Bürgi in Switzerland. “There were fourindependent discoveries of sunspots, all in 1611; namely, by Galileo in Italy,Scheiner in Germany, Fabricius in Holland and Harriott in England,” Ogburn andThomas note, and they continue:“The law of the conservation of energy, so significant in science andphilosophy, was formulated four times independently in 1847, by Joule, Thomson,Colding and Helmholz. They had been anticipated by Robert Mayer in 1842. Thereseem to have been at least six different inventors of the thermometer and noless than nine claimants of the invention of the telescope. Typewriting machineswere invented simultaneously in England and in America by several individuals inthese countries. The steamboat is claimed as the “exclusive” discovery ofFulton, Jouffroy, Rumsey, Stevens and Symmington.” 2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en142]Dr. Erwin Laszlo commented on how often this effect appears in history.The great breakthroughs of classical Hebrew, Greek, Chinese and Indian cultureoccurred almost at the same time [750 to 399 B.C.] . . . among people who werenot likely to have been in actual communication.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en143]In Dr. Rupert Sheldrake’s classic The Presence of the Past, a variety ofexperiments support the idea that we are all accessing a common databank ofinformation when we try to think about something—such as to solve a particularpuzzle or problem—just like these inventors were doing. In one case, Sheldrakegave a difficult hidden-figure puzzle to random groups of people and timed howlong it took them to solve it. Then the solution was revealed to two millionviewers in a British television broadcast. Everyone watched as the hidden faceof a Cossack emerged from the background—including his handlebar mustache. WhenSheldrake then gave the puzzle to new groups in Europe, Africa and America whohad not seen the original puzzle nor the British TV show with the answer, theynonetheless solved it much faster.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en144]Dr. Paul Pearsall’s fascinating work with organ transplants is another exampleof shared thoughts—though in this case there is a clear biological componentinvolved. Dr. Pearsall has authored more than two hundred professional articlesand eighteen best-selling books on this fascinating subject, and the entirearticle—with all the incredible specifics—is free to read on Pearsall’s Website.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en145]According to this study of patients who have received transplanted organs,particularly hearts, it is not uncommon for memories, behaviors, preferences andhabits associated with the donor to be transferred to the recipient. . . . Atotal sample of 74 transplant recipients (23 of which were heart transplants) .. . showed various degrees of changes that paralleled the personalities of theirdonors.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en146]Thoughts are apparently being stored within individual organs before they appearin the recipient’s mind. The Source Field has spoken once again.The Co-Intelligence Institute gives a thorough summary of experiments Sheldrakehas either run himself or compiled in his impressive works on this concept ofthe shared mind. All of these breakthroughs suggest we are using the SourceField to think—at least to some degree.In one experiment, British biologist Rupert Sheldrake took three short, similarJapanese rhymes—one a meaningless jumble of disconnected Japanese words, thesecond a newly composed verse and the third a traditional rhyme known bymillions of Japanese. Neither Sheldrake nor the English schoolchildren he got tomemorize these verses knew which was which, nor did they know any Japanese. Themost easily learned rhyme turned out to be the one well-known to Japanese.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en147]Experiment 1: In the 1920s Harvard University psychologist William McDougall didexperiments for 15 years in which rats learned to escape from a tank. The firstgeneration of rats averaged 200 mistakes before they learned the right way out;the last generation 20 mistakes. . . .Experiment 2: In later efforts to duplicate McDougall’s experiments inAustralia, similar rats made fewer mistakes right from the start. Latergenerations of rats did better even when they were not descendents of theearlier rats. . . .Experiment 3: In the 1920s in Southampton, England, a bird called the blue titdiscovered it could tear the tops of milk bottles on doorsteps and drink thecream. Soon this skill showed up in blue tits over a hundred miles away, whichis odd in that they seldom fly further than 15 miles. . . . [The habit] spreadfaster and faster until by 1947 it was universal throughout Britain[,] . . .Holland, Sweden and Denmark. German occupation cut off milk deliveries inHolland for eight years—five years longer than the life of a blue tit. Then, in1948 the milk started to be delivered. Within months blue tits all over Hollandwere drinking cream. . . .Experiment 4: In the early sixties psychiatrists Dr. Milan Ryzl of Prague andDr. Vladimir L. Raikov of Moscow hypnotized subjects into believing they wereliving incarnations of historical personages. Such subjects would developtalents associated with their alter egos. A subject told she was the artistRaphael took only a month to develop drawing skills up to the standard of a goodgraphic designer. . . .[Experiment 5 is Sheldrake’s hidden-figure puzzle, already discussed.]Experiment 6: Psychologist Dr. Arden Mahlberg of Madison, Wisconsin, created avariation of Morse code that should have been no harder to learn than thestandard variety. Subjects learned the real code much faster than his inventedone, not knowing which was which.Experiment 7: Gary Schwartz, Yale professor of psychology, selected 24 common3-letter words in Hebrew and 24 rare ones, all from the Old Testament, all inHebrew script. For each word, he created a scrambled version (as, in English,one might do by scrambling “dog” to spell “odg”). . . . [Among participants withno knowledge of Hebrew,] not only was the confidence [in the accuracy of theirguesses] significantly higher with the real words than with the false words(regardless of subjects, words, or experiments), but the common words got higherconfidence scores than the rarer words. . . .8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en148]Schwartz’s experiment was also covered in Combs, Holland and Robertson’sSynchronicity: Through the Eyes of Science, Myth and the Trickster in 2000. Thephrase “morphic fields” is Sheldrake’s own term for thought forms that build upwithin the Source Field.Schwartz found, as Sheldrake’s theory would predict, that students rated thereal words with considerably greater confidence than the ones that had beenscrambled (though they did not accurately guess their meaning). Moreover, hefound that confidence ratings were about twice as high for the words that occurfrequently in the Old Testament compared with those that occur only rarely. Theidea here is that the real words had, in fact, been learned by countless personsthroughout history, forming strong morphic fields; the most frequently occurringwords had, of course, been seen and read the greatest number of times. . . .Similar experiments have been carried out using Persian words and even Morsecode.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en149]Richard Linklater’s 2001 film Waking Life features a scene in which twocharacters discuss this phenomenon—and one of them mentions a study wherecrossword puzzles become easier to solve once they have been published andworked on by large numbers of people.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en150] A graduate student named MonicaEngland conducted this research for her thesis at the University of Nottingham,and summarized the results in the August 1991 Noetic Sciences Bulletin—but itwas never published in a traditional academic journal. Sheldrake wrote about itin words that are no longer found on his Web site, but were originally publishedin a Journal of Memetics discussion forum post—on the memorable day of September11, 2001.The crossword puzzles she used were from the London Evening Standard, not TheNew York Times, and in the experiments she tested groups of subjects before andafter the crossword puzzles were published in the Evening Standard on Feb 15th1990. Each group of subjects also did a control crossword which had beenpublished ten days earlier in the Evening Standard. . . . She found that . . .the subjects performed better after the crossword had been published in London,relative to scores before publication. This difference was significant at the 5percent level, using the one-tailed t test. . . . The reason Monica Englandthought of doing this experiment in the first place is that there is a folkloreamong people who do crosswords, especially difficult ones like those in TheTimes or the Daily Telegraph, that these crosswords are easier to solve ifthey’re done the next day or in the evening rather than on the morning of theday they are published, suggesting a possible influence from others who havedone them.11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en151]REMOTE VIEWING: VENTURING DIRECTLY INTO THE FIELDIf we actually do use the Source Field to think, at least to some degree, thenwhy couldn’t we venture directly out into it—rather than having our awarenesstrapped within our own bodies? Harold Sherman, the author of How to Make ESPWork for You, was one of the early test subjects brought in by the military, andits contractors, to develop the science of remote viewing12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en152]—which theoretically allows us toaccess any point in the Source Field. Their results suggest that everything inthe Universe is ultimately One Mind—as the consciousness of the viewer canproject into any remote location and experience it as a part of his ownawareness. In my opinion, some of the best books on remote viewing are DavidMorehouse’s Psychic Warrior—and you may want to get the first edition from199613 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en153]—and the works of JoeMcMoneagle.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en154] A good remote viewercan make detailed sketches of a remote location that are almost perfect—withnothing more than random numbers called “coordinates” that were assigned to thetarget. The person acting as their guide also does not know what thesecoordinates correspond to either. Joe McMoneagle has located three differentmissing persons in sessions filmed for Japanese television—leading the crewsright to the door of where these people were, while he sat at his home inVirginia. The cameras then filmed their tearful reunions.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en155]Jahn and Dunne trained forty-eight ordinary people in an early type of remoteviewing, where one person would visit a randomly chosen location from five tosix thousand miles away and the viewer would attempt to gain information aboutwhat that person was seeing. In 336 rigorous trials, almost two-thirds of theviewers’ observations appeared to be significantly accurate—at odds of a billionto one against chance. When the sender and receiver were bonded emotionally orby familial relationship, their results improved dramatically.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en156] A distinguished government panel ofskeptical scientists and two Nobel laureates studied twentythree years ofexperimental data in remote viewing—and concluded the research was flawless.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en157] Another team, headed by notedskeptic Dr. Ray Hyman, concluded the results were much too strong to be writtenoff as random chance or coincidence.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en158] Screened rooms were used to proveelectromagnetic waves could not be responsible for transferring the informationto the viewer’s conscious mind.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en159]Remote viewers also were able to see events that had not yet happened in lineartime, even when those events were chosen at random—after they had already beencorrectly viewed in a secure location.20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en160]- 21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en161] This suggests the mind is notconfined to linear time at all, in the greater sense—and we will have much moreto say about this in Part Two.Do we create measurable energetic traces when we go out and remote-view aparticular area? In 1980, Drs. Karlis Osis and Donna McCormick performed aremarkable experiment to see if they could find out. A gifted psychic named AlexTanous was asked to remote-view a specific target. Several different scatteredpieces were used to form an image, but only when they were viewed from onelocation. Tanous had no idea what the target looked like, and it was changed atvarious times. In the exact location where the pieces all lined up, Osis andMcCormick hung two metallic plates side by side on strain gauges, which candetect very subtle movements. When Tanous was describing the target accurately,the plates jiggled around much more than usual. Their greatest movement occurredimmediately after Tanous began viewing the image. There was no obvious visiblelight in the area as Tanous did the viewing—only the slight but measurablemovement of the plates.22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en162]Two years later, the People’s Republic of China expanded this investigation evenfurther. The Chinese scientists asked remote viewers with “exceptional vision”to view complex characters from their own alphabet as targets. These characterswere placed in a room where no visible light could possibly enter. Verysensitive light-detecting devices were also positioned inside the room. Duringthe times the viewers properly described the target, the number of photons inthe room surged tremendously—from one hundred to one thousand times above thenormal background levels of “virtual photons.” This could amount to as many asfifteen thousand individual photons that were released during any one event.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en163] -24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en164] A group of American scientists ledby Dr. G. Scott Hubbard attempted to replicate this experiment in 1986. Theyused a very high-quality photomultiplier tube for sensing light and a35-millimeter slide of a scene as the target. Their results were excellent.During the times the viewers correctly described the target, pulses of photonsconsistently appeared—at a level much higher than random chance. However, theirstrongest pulses were only twenty to forty times larger than the backgroundnoise level, unlike the Chinese results of one hundred to one thousand timesabove normal.25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en165] This may be becausethe participants in the Chinese experiments were found by an open, systematic,nationwide sweep for the most talented intuitives.In 1907, as published in the American Medicine journal, Dr. Duncan MacDougallfound that his patients suddenly lost a little over one ounce of weight directlyafter their physical death. In these studies, the patients were kept on bedswithin a metallic basin that would catch any bodily fluids. The air they exhaledfrom their lungs upon death did not weigh anywhere near one ounce—nonetheless,the weight loss remained consistent in every case.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en166] In 1975, Dr. Hereward Carrington andassociates found that the average person would lose two and a quarter ounces ofweight while they were having an out-of-body experience. When they returned tothe body, the missing mass immediately returned. 27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en167]It appears there is an “energetic” component of our bodies that may bewithdrawing from each and every cell, and projecting to other locations—eitherat death, when remote viewing or when having an out-of-body experience. As wesit inside an electrically shielded room, we can create photons in a remotelocation we are viewing—even if no visible light can get into that area, as wesaw in the Chinese experiments. This gives us a compelling insight into howlight may actually be appearing inside the pineal gland. A surprisingly highnumber of people who have out-of-body or near-death experiences see a silvercord that attaches their astral body to their physical body. In the majority ofcases the cord appears to be attached to the exact location of the pineal gland,and emerges either from the front or the back of the head.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en168] It may very well be that we all havean energetic duplicate of our physical body that is constantly traveling outsideourselves, as in remote viewing, and reporting back what it sees to the pinealgland—through the silver cord. Ecclesiastes 12:6 seems to refer to thisenergetic cord: “Remember him—before the silver cord is severed, or the goldenbowl is broken.”29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en169]EXPERIENCES AFTER DEATHA surprising number of people experience a continuing consciousness when theyare clinically dead—again suggesting that some part of our thinking mind isstrictly energetic, and does not need a physical body at all. In order for aperson to be considered clinically dead, the heart has to stop beating, thelungs stop breathing and there is no measurable brain wave activity due to thelack of oxygen. By any conventional medical account, our minds should no longerfunction—or even exist. However, a variety of people report having vividnear-death experiences (NDEs) during this time. According to Dr. Sam Parnia andhis associates at the University of Southampton, many studies have concludedthat being clinically brain dead does not interrupt the continuity of ourthinking minds—in a surprising number of cases.A number of recent scientific studies carried out by independent researchershave demonstrated that 10–20 percent of people who go through cardiac arrest andclinical death report lucid, well structured thought processes, reasoning,memories and sometimes detailed recall of events during their encounter withdeath.30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en170]The largest hospital-based study of NDEs was led by Dr. Pim van Lommel, acardiologist in the Netherlands. Dr. Van Lommel heard his first NDE report in1969, where a patient reported a tunnel, a light, beautiful colors and wonderfulmusic. Dr. Raymond Moody’s groundbreaking description of NDEs did not appearuntil seven years later, in 1976, and Dr. Van Lommel’s interest wasn’t piquedagain until 1986—when he read a more detailed account of an NDE that occurredduring a six-minute period of clinical death.After reading [this] book I started to interview my patients who had survived acardiac arrest. To my great surprise, within two years about fifty patients toldme about their NDE. . . . So, in 1988 we started a prospective study of 344consecutive survivors of cardiac arrest in ten Dutch hospitals with the aim ofinvestigating the frequency, the cause and the content of an NDE. . . . Results:62 patients (18%) reported some recollection of the time of clinical death . . .In the core group 23 patients (7%) reported a deep or very deep experience. . .. In our study about 50% of the patients with an NDE reported awareness of beingdead, or had positive emotions, 30% reported moving through a tunnel, had anobservation of a celestial landscape, or had a meeting with deceased relatives.About 25% of the patients with an NDE had an out-of-body experience, hadcommunication with “the light,” or observed colours, 13% experienced a lifereview, and 8% experienced a border. . . . Patients with an NDE did not show anyfear of death, they strongly believed in an afterlife, and their insight in whatis important in life had changed: love and compassion for oneself, for others,and for nature. They now understood the cosmic law that everything one does toothers will ultimately be returned to oneself: hatred and violence as well aslove and compassion. Remarkably, there was often evidence of increased intuitivefeelings.31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en171]For further information, the Web site Near-Death.com [http://Near-Death.com] hasan excellent list of fifty-one different proofs that support the reality ofNDEs.32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en172] At the very top of the pagethey mention the groundbreaking studies of Dr. Kenneth Ring, who investigatedcases where people reported accurate observations of real events—sometimes faraway from the location of their physical bodies—while they were clinically dead.They saw the events taking place and also overheard the conversations, in somecases, and their reports were later verified as being stunningly correct. Inother examples, the clinically dead person appears in a ghostlike form to aloved one—and both people end up reporting the same experience once the patienthas been resuscitated.33 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en173]Where do we go and what happens to us after we die? In his wonderful booksJourney of Souls and Destiny of Souls, Dr. Michael Newton reports his detailedinvestigations into this fascinating subject. Dr. Newton conducted thousands ofdeep hypnotic regressions, where he would bring people back through the eventsof their lives, eventually return them into the womb and then further regressthem into the “life between lives”—and he found remarkable consistency in thereports.In the introduction to Journey of Souls, I explained my background as atraditional hypnotherapist and how skeptical I had been about the use ofhypnosis for metaphysical regression. In 1947, at age fifteen, I placed my firstsubject in hypnosis, so I was definitely old school and not a New Ager. Thus,when I unintentionally opened the gateway to the spirit world with a client, Iwas stunned. . . . After more years of quiet research, I was able to construct aworking model of spirit world structure. . . . I also found that it did notmatter if a person was an atheist, deeply religious, or believed in anyphilosophical persuasion in between—once they were in the proper superconsciousstate of hypnosis, all were consistent in their reports. . . . I built up a highvolume of cases. . . . While these years of specialized research into the spiritworld rolled on, I worked practically in seclusion. . . . I even stayed out ofmetaphysical bookstores because I wanted absolute freedom from outside bias.34[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en174]Newton’s first book, Journey of Souls, is organized sequentially, in terms oftime and location, to walk us through all ten stages from initial death to finalreincarnation: Death and Departure, The Gateway to the Spirit World, Homecoming,Orientation, Transition, Placement, Life Selection, Choosing a New Body,Preparation and Embarkation, and Rebirth.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en175] I highly recommend these books, asthe number of commonalities Dr. Newton points out among his participants, andthe depth of inspiration their accounts provide, is quite profound. Dr. Newtonalso found that souls displayed visible colors that were relative to their levelof advancement—falling neatly in line with the spectrum we see in the rainbow.I found that typically, pure white denotes a younger soul and with advancementsoul energy becomes more dense, moving into orange, yellow, green and finallythe blue ranges. In addition to these center core auras, there are subtlemixtures of halo colors within every group that relate to the character aspectsof each soul. For want of a better system, I have classified soul development asmoving from a level I beginner through various learning stages to that of amaster at level VI. These greatly advanced souls are seen as having a deepindigo color. I have no doubt even higher levels exist, but my knowledge of themis restricted because I only receive reports from people who are stillincarnating . . . it is my subjects who use “level” to describe where they areon the ladder of learning. . . . While in a superconscious state during deephypnosis, my subjects tell me that in the spirit world no soul is looked downupon as having less value than any other soul. We are all in a process oftransformation to something greater than our current state of enlightenment. . ..There certainly is structure in the spirit world, but it exists within a sublimematrix of compassion, harmony, ethics and morality far beyond what we practiceon earth. . . . There is a value system here of overwhelming kindness,tolerance, patience and absolute love. . . . Advanced subjects talk about thetime of conjunction when they will join the “Most Sacred Ones.” In this sphereof dense purple light there is an all-knowing Presence.36[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en176]Dr. Linda Backman received training from Dr. Michael Newton and since 1993 hasconducted her own research into the “life between lives.” Her work serves as avaluable source of independent, professionally obtained data that corroboratesthe results Newton gained in his own practice—although she focuses on the morehighly advanced souls. One of her main conclusions is that these people oftentake on very difficult lives as a way of dramatically increasing their own rateof spiritual growth.37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en177]REINCARNATIONHave we lived before? Is there any proof that we return to a new body, inanother lifetime, after we die? In this case we have very reliable and extensivescientific data. Dr. Ian Stevenson, a professor of psychiatry at the Universityof Virginia School of Medicine, spent more than forty years tracking down overthree thousand children who experienced specific, detailed memories of theiralleged “past lives.” Many of these children were able to tell Dr. Stevensonwhat their names used to be, as well as who their alleged friends and familywere. They often revealed how and where they died, along with many otherastonishingly specific details that could easily be proven or disproven byinvestigation. Personality and behavioral quirks carried over from one apparentlifetime to another, and the children bore a surprising facial resemblance towhomever they said they had been before.38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en178]Over and over again, Dr. Stevenson found the names the children gave werecorrect. The surviving relatives could be tracked down. Their faces lookedsimilar to their suspected past lives, and the specific details all checked out.One Lebanese girl was able to remember the names and precise interrelationshipsof twenty-five different people she claimed to have known before, without everhaving had any contact with them, or anyone who knew them, in her current life.Respected academics like Dr. Jim Tucker, medical director of the Child andFamily Psychiatric Clinic at the University of Virginia, have said that“reincarnation is the most likely explanation for the strongest cases.”39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en179]Dr. Tucker is considered the worthy successor to Dr. Ian Stevenson, and hascontinued his research, including many new cases, with a focus on documentableevidence such as specific details that can be verified from the children’smemories. Or matching birthmarks. (Our new bodies often have visible birthmarksin areas where our alleged former selves were mortally wounded.) And facialrecognition software—allowing Dr. Tucker to prove that they do both look thesame.40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en180] Since these culturesbelieved in reincarnation, the children did not receive any “hypnoticsuggestions” telling them to overlook or dismiss any memories they may have had.Skeptics can and do write off such accounts as anecdotal and unverifiable innature, but Dr. Ian Stevenson’s forty-plus years of scientific research providedsolid proof that reincarnation is real—just as the adherents of Hinduism,Buddhism and even Orthodox Judaism have often believed. The implications arestunning, and absolutely central to our main theme in this book—it means you canlook yourself in the eye, standing in front of a mirror, and say “I will alwaysexist,” with a deep inner knowing that this is true. Without the hidden fear ofnon-existence hanging over your head, you will soon lead a much happier life. Ifyou are willing to try out certain practices, you can have personal experiencesthat will confirm this greater truth for you—and which may ultimately cause youto wonder if we are all living in a “global lucid dream.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEAre We Living in a Lucid Dream?Bacteria, plants, insects, eggs, animals and humans all appear to be sharing thesame Mind—thanks to a non-electromagnetic energy field. We now know that if youhave trouble concentrating, and someone else in a remote location tries to helpyou think, then soon you will be able to focus much better. Scientificbreakthroughs all over the world consistently seem to happen in parallel. Organtransplant recipients may pick up thoughts, behaviors and habits from theirdonors. Humans and animals appear to draw from a common databank ofinformation—which in our case includes written words in foreign languages, Morsecode and crossword puzzle solutions. Remote viewers can make detailedobservations of distant locations, and create measurable signals of theirpresence in those areas—including surges of visible photons. Our bodies losesmall but measurable amounts of weight when we die or have an out-of-bodyexperience.An energetic conduit seems to exist between our astral body and our physicalbody—the silver cord—and it may be sending visible images from distant locationsdirectly into our pineal gland, not unlike a fiber-optic cable. Floatingpiezoluminescent crystals in the pineal gland may then release these images in athree-dimensional matrix of light. The retinal tissue in the pineal gland mightbe capturing these photons and sending them to the brain, where they areunscrambled into visual images if they remain stable enough. Ancient mysteryschools and religions seemed singularly obsessed with pineal gland symbolism—andbelieved that awakening this gland was the ultimate key to spiritualadvancement. Many people continue to be able to observe their environment andthink normal thoughts while they are clinically dead, showing no brain waveswhatsoever. Some people have appeared in a ghostly form to their loved oneswhile having a near-death experience, and both people report the same sequenceof events afterward. Dr. Michael Newton found remarkable consistency in reportsfrom the afterlife among thousands of people he had hypnotized into asuperconscious state. Dr. Ian Stevenson identified over three thousand childrenwho gave specific, detailed and accurate memories of past lives—and even lookedlike the people they claimed to have been before.There does appear to be a parallel reality out there that we all have accessto—at least on some level. Is there any way you can travel into this alternateworld and experience this unbound awareness for yourself—without actually dying?Are you already doing this every night when you dream? Is there a way you canbring your conscious awareness with you and become lucid—so you have fullcontrol over your experience? I believe there is—because I’ve done it myself.Certain techniques do allow you to recognize you are dreaming while it isactually happening, “wake up” in the dream, and take conscious control of yourexperience. After having had enough of these experiences personally, I can’thelp but wonder if the real world behaves more like a lucid dream than we everimagined—thanks to how interconnected we are in the Source Field.This adventure started when I was still a high school student, and I read LucidDreaming1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en181] and Exploring the World ofLucid Dreaming 2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en182] by Dr. StephenLaBerge—from Stanford University’s Sleep Research Center. Dr. LaBerge was ableto scientifically prove that you can be fully conscious in a dream, while beingphysiologically asleep and dreaming at the same time. Dr. LaBerge also workswith Dr. William Braud, who performed many experiments proving our mind-to-mindconnections—as we already discussed in chapter 2.In 1952, Dr. Eugene Aserinsky found that in the lighter stages of sleep, we allexperience rapid eye movement, or REM. If we get awakened from this state, weusually report having just experienced a vivid dream. By 1973, Dr. MontagueUllman and Dr. Stanley Krippner published ten years of pioneering experiments indream telepathy at the Maimonides Medical Center in New York City, with morethan one hundred participants. In these groundbreaking studies, ordinary peoplecould concentrate on specific images while awake, and send them to people whowere dreaming. The dreamers then experienced symbols and events in their dreamsthat were obviously similar to the senders’ message.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en183]Drawing upon the experience of over nine hundred lucid dreams of his own, Dr.LaBerge developed exercises that would allow you to wake up, or become lucid,while you were dreaming in his lab. Once you achieved the lucid dreaming state,you would signal Dr. LaBerge by repeatedly moving your eyes back and forth—sincethe rest of your body could not move due to sleep paralysis. By signalingLaBerge with your eyes, counting to ten and signaling again, he was able toconfirm that your physical time and dream time are just about the same. LaBergealso reported on cases where people seem to share the same dream—although thishas not been investigated as rigorously as dream telepathy.Accounts of “mutual dreaming” (dreams apparently shared by two or more people)raise the possibility that the dream world may be in some cases just asobjectively real as the physical world. This is because the primary criterion of“objectivity” is that an experience is shared by more than one person, which issupposedly true of mutual dreams. In that case, what would happen to thetraditional dichotomy between dreams and reality?4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en184]In his book Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self, Robert Waggoner gives avariety of compelling examples in which people shared the same dreamenvironment, and reported the same experiences, in isolation, after they wokeup. This again implies that dreams are not merely psychological artifacts, butare occurring in a parallel reality, of sorts—where more than one person canhave experiences and interactions with others at the same time.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en185] This idea was popularized inChristopher Nolan’s highly successful 2010 film Inception.The key to Dr. LaBerge’s technique, which he called Mnemonic Induction of LucidDreaming, or MILD, was that after you wake up naturally from a dream—which mightbe in the middle of the night—you say, internally, “Next time I’m dreaming, Iwant to remember to recognize that I’m dreaming” as you fall back asleep. At thesame time, you review the dream in your mind, but then change the ending, byimagining yourself becoming lucid—realizing that you’re actually living, walkingand breathing in a dream. LaBerge also said the best way to tell if you were, infact, dreaming was to simply look at something, look away from it and then lookback again. In dreams, the “before” and the “after” view will always bedifferent enough that you can easily spot the changes.I did not succeed right away when I began practicing Dr. LaBerge’s techniques,but I kept on trying . . . and eventually struck gold. In a lucid dream you canfly, levitate objects, walk through walls, and manifest anything you want to seeor experience—even change your entire environment with the snap of a finger. Iremember one time I was in a department store, and I levitated a whole series ofbig gray plastic garbage cans and started orbiting them around each other like alittle solar system. Everyone in the store stood there in awe. Some were evenmoved to tears. The experience is so fantastic and awe-inspiring that if youhaven’t actually done it yet, there really are no words to describe it. However,Dr. LaBerge cites a great quote from Hugh Calloway’s report of a lucid dream hehad in 1902, at age sixteen, which began his research into consciousness.Then the solution flashed upon me: though this glorious summer morning seemed asreal as real could be, I was dreaming. With the realization of this fact, thequality of the dream changed in a manner very difficult to convey to one who hasnot had this experience. Instantly, the vividness of life increased ahundred-fold. Never had sea and sky and trees shone with such glamorous beauty;even the commonplace houses seemed alive and mystically beautiful. Never had Ifelt so absolutely well, so clear-brained, so inexpressibly free. The sensationwas exquisite beyond words, but it lasted only a few minutes and I awoke.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en186]Indeed, many of Dr. LaBerge’s own participants ended up concluding that they had“never really been awake before.” This may be what will happen to you when youexperience a direct awareness of the Source Field, and your greater identitywithin it, for the first time in your conscious, waking life. And of course, nodrugs or occult rituals are required to do this—just a consistent effort topractice Dr. LaBerge’s technique.In one particularly fantastic lucid dream, I was soaring high over the treetops,gliding through impossibly vibrant colors in the sky and connecting with agorgeous woman who kept appearing along the way. I desperately wanted to writedown everything that was happening to me, as I knew I would probably forget mostof it otherwise. So, I took a break, landed on solid ground, and manifested apen in my right hand and a notebook in my left. In my dreaming trance, I somehowhoped, or believed, that I could bring the notebook back through with me, and itwould show up there next to me in bed. I frantically scribbled down what wasgoing on. Eventually I went back and read my notes—but they were all in French.I had studied French in high school, but I was nowhere near good enough to havewritten anything like this. And yet, I absolutely knew that everything waswritten properly. I could read it back, out loud, and I knew exactly what I wassaying. My thoughts still felt the same, but now they were coming out in French.I could speak to anyone in French, at any speed—and I knew it would be perfect.It was very, very strange. When I woke up, the papers were gone, of course, andmy French was no better than usual. But what if, I wondered? What if I couldsomehow bring that new ability back “through the veil” of dreaming?In 2007, an eighteen-year-old Czech motorcycle racer named Matěj Kůs got knockedout in an accident. Before the crash, he only knew the most basic phrases inEnglish, but after he woke up, he was speaking perfect, fluent English with theparamedics. Peter Waite, the promoter for the Berwick Bandits, his racing team,was quite surprised.I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It was in a really clear English accent,no dialect or anything. Whatever happened in the crash must have rearrangedthings in his head. Before his crash, Matěj’s use of the English language wasbroken, to put it mildly. . . . Yet, here we were at the ambulance doorlistening to Matěj talking to the medical staff in perfect English. [He] didn’thave a clue who or where he was when he came round. He didn’t even know he wasCzech.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en187]Sadly, Kůs quickly lost the new ability, and could not remember anything thathappened during the accident, nor for the next two days afterward—just as if hehad been in a hypnotic trance. This was not the only case, however. On April 12,2010, the U.K. Telegraph featured the story of a Croatian girl who awoke from acoma speaking fluent German, even though she’d only just started studying it inschool—and she no longer could speak her own native Croatian. Psychiatrist Dr.Mijo Milas explained his view on this intriguing phenomenon:In earlier times this would have been referred to as a miracle; we prefer tothink that there must be a logical explanation—it’s just that we haven’t foundit yet. There are references to cases where people who have been seriously illand perhaps in a coma have woken up being able to speak otherlanguages—sometimes even the Biblical languages such as that spoken in oldBabylon or Egypt.8 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en188]In a lucid dream, out-of-body experience, remote viewing session, hypnotictrance, coma or near-death experience, our thinking minds may be using theSource Field much more than when we are conscious. This appears to give us muchgreater access to the information stored within the Source Field—including theability to speak various languages. Many people don’t realize that Edgar Cayce,while in a hypnotic trance, could give people funny little sayings or even havecomplete conversations with them in their own language—despite being unable tospeak anything but English in his waking mind. He is estimated to have spokenover twenty-four different languages while in trance.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en189]Dr. LaBerge believes that every landscape, every object, every character andevery situation in the dream represents some aspect of yourself. A dream is amessage from your subconscious mind and/or “astral self,” and the language issymbolism. In a dream, you are presented with various problems from your wakinglife, but they often appear in disguise. If someone is abusing you in yourwaking life, they may become a monster in your dream, as one example. Everythingin the dream is symbolic, and every symbol is some part of who you are—or somesituation that is happening to you in your waking life. The basic aspects ofthis symbolic language are commonly understood among dream researchers.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en190] Nothing is more frustrating thanwatching people share dreams in which the earth is being destroyed, and thentreat it as a prophecy of real events that are about to happen in theworld—rather than a reflection of some massive change that is about to happen,or has already been happening, in their own lives.So when you run into terrifying, threatening and aggressive characters in adream, don’t think of it as a nightmare. You can train yourself to recognizethat such frightening situations must be dreams, and then use them as triggersto become lucid. Dr. LaBerge says those evil characters ultimately representsome aspect of yourself that you have not forgiven and accepted. If you learnthe art of lucid dreaming, you can quickly turn your worst nightmares into thegreatest triumphs. Dr. LaBerge shared his own experience of how you do this:I dreamed that I was in the middle of a classroom riot; a furious mob was ragingabout, throwing chairs and trading punches. A huge, repulsive barbarian with apockmarked face, the Goliath among them, had me hopelessly locked in an irongrip. . . . At this point, I recognized I was dreaming, and remembering what Ihad learned from handling similar situations previously, I immediately stoppedstruggling. . . . I was absolutely certain about the proper course of action. Iknew only love could truly resolve my inner conflict, and I tried to feel lovingas I stood face to face with my ogre. At first I failed utterly, feeling onlyrevulsion and disgust. He was simply too ugly to love: that was my visceralreaction. But I tried to ignore the image and seek love within my own heart.Finding it, I looked my ogre in the eyes, trusting my intuition to supply theright things to say. Beautiful words of acceptance flowed out of me, and as theydid, he melted into me. As for the riot, it had vanished without a trace. Thedream was over, and I awoke feeling wonderfully calm.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en191]As LaBerge and others have said, the dreamer often experiences blinding whitelight as the villainous character merges back into them—and he or she awakens intears. I have had multiple experiences like this, and was very deeply moved.Nearly every day, I hear a story that people are becoming more aware . . . moreattuned to the consciousness of the world and its effects. I believe this is noaccident: It appears that our thinking minds are being energetically transformedby outside forces that are affecting our entire solar system, as we will explorein later chapters. And this raises an intriguing question: Is it possible thatthe rules of the dream world could also apply to the physical world? If we allshare a collective consciousness, are there practical things we can do toimprove the world, by nothing more than the power of our own thoughts? Could weimprove the lives of others by improving ourselves? Can we change the dream whenwe change our own minds? There is rigorous evidence that we have much more powerto improve the overall health of the people on earth than we ever believed.HEAL THE WORLD BY HEALING YOURSELFOver a two-year period, groups of about seven thousand people gathered threedifferent times—and during these meetings, they were able to reduce all acts ofterrorism, worldwide, by a phenomenal 72 percent. Obviously, the tactical valueof such a winning strategy would be of massive importance to national security.Were these people diplomats, politicians or military planners plotting out thenext offensive? Were they peace activists, diving down into the trenches andrescuing people in a hail of gunfire? Were they protestors, gathering in frontof government buildings and demanding change? What exactly did they do?The answer may well change everything we think we know about the way theUniverse really works. These people got together and meditated—with thoughts oflove and peace. Bear in mind that this was a scientific study, published andaccepted in the Journal of Offender Rehabilitation. They ruled out cycles,trends, weather, weekends, holidays and all other variables—the 72 percentreduction in terrorism had to be caused by them meditating, and nothing else.12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en192] In another example, violent crime inWashington, D.C., was decreased by up to 23.6 percent over a two-month period inthe summer of 1993, as the number of participants rose from eight hundred tofour thousand—despite the fact that violent crime had been increasing beforethey met. As soon as their meetings ended, the crime level started going back upagain.13 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en193] The likelihood that thiseffect could have been caused by a “chance variation in crime levels” was lessthan two parts per billion, and all other factors—including temperature,precipitation, weekends, and police and community anticrime activities—wereruled out.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en194]As of 1993, fifty different scientific studies had rigorously proven that thiseffect really works—over the preceding thirty years. They were published inmainstream peer-reviewed journals and showed the meditators had createdimprovements in health and quality of life, as well as decreases in accidents,crime, war and other such factors.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en195]I propose that this effect works because we’re all sharing the same mind, tosome degree. There appears to be a balance between private thoughts andinformation we acquire directly from the Source Field. Let’s not forget theInstitute of HeartMath’s experiments, in which those people with the greatestcoherence affected the brain wave patterns and biorhythms of others who wereclose to them. If seven thousand people can reduce worldwide terrorism by 72percent, this suggests the Source Field is significantly biased in favor ofpositive emotions rather than negative ones.Therefore, any time someone tries to tell you it’s hopeless, that “we’re allgoing to die,” that some dream or prophecy said we have no ability to controlthe outcome of our future here on earth, I highly recommend you don’t fall intothe trap of indulging in such faceless fear. We can scientifically prove that bysimply focusing on a positive attitude in your own life, you are helping toreduce war, terrorism, suffering and death. There is also compelling evidencefrom Russia that severe weather, earthquakes, volcanic activity and the like canalso be reduced by the effects of consciousness, as we will see.Dr. LaBerge thought the ogre attacking him in his dream was really someone else:the villain, the enemy, the other. However, once he became lucid, he realizedthe ogre was just a mirror of himself—and love was the key to solving theproblem. Now we know that simple meditations on love and peace can actuallychange the behavior of people out in the world—ordinary folks living theirlives, apparently making free will decisions. These are people we will neversee, never meet, never know. When even a small number of us move into a statethe meditators called “Pure Consciousness,” there is less death, less terrorismand less warfare. According to Saint John of the Cross, from sixteenth-centurySpain, “a little of this pure love is more precious to God and the soul and morebeneficial to the Church, even though it seems one is doing nothing, than allthese other works put together.”16 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en196]By “works” he means anything we normally would do in our attempts to help theworld. In a book called The Cloud of Unknowing, a revered English priest in thefourteenth century referred to this same state as “Pure Contemplation,” andsaid, “The whole of mankind is wonderfully helped by what you are doing, in waysyou do not understand. . . . It is more profitable to your friends, natural andspiritual, dead or alive . . . [and] without it all the rest is virtuallyworthless.”17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en197]Now that we see how strongly a small group of people can affect everyone’sbehavior on a mass scale, the idea that the real world is like a lucid dream ora hologram doesn’t seem so crazy-sounding after all. What if the rules of thedream world actually do apply to the physical world? If so, then all theseglobal disasters may actually be symbolic reflections of our own inner distress:our fear, pain, sorrow and anger. After years of my own meditation, I finallyconcluded on a deep level that our sadness comes from a very convincingillusion: the seemingly inescapable truth that we feel alone.The evidence I have already presented here suggests that we all have asoul—constantly watching over us, while also enjoying its own experiences,thoughts and travels. I believe any one of us can reach out to this greateraspect of our own being, and develop the ability to gain reliable spiritualguidance—to understand the greater plan and Purpose we may have chosen tofulfill before we ever came here. We might also avoid a great deal of needlesssuffering in the process. However, when we resist our Purpose, we only encountermore and more pain, difficulty and seemingly random bad luck. According to EdgarCayce, the noteworthy psychic reader who practiced in the early twentiethcentury, ignorance does not grant us an exemption from the great spirituallaws—and this includes the Law of Karma18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en198]—in which whatever we measure out toothers will be measured back to us. If we sufficiently violate someone’s freewill, we may require another lifetime to balance ourselves out—by enduringsimilar hardships. Cayce also said we can eliminate this entire cycle of karmaby practicing true forgiveness and acceptance—both of ourselves and of others.That, ultimately, appears to be the core Purpose we are all here to achieve. Andif it were easy, we wouldn’t require multiple incarnations to figure it out.I realize the label “God” for some people is emotionally charged—although youmay now be thinking differently about such a “foolish notion” after readingthese last few chapters. Either way, the Cayce Readings used this word todiscuss the universal intelligence that we have been investigating in this book.Cayce’s Readings, which allegedly came from a greater part of his own being thatspoke while he was under hypnosis, said all the disturbances in the worldtoday—wars, terrorism, government corruption, natural disasters,earthquakes—were all part of a big Story that we are being told. It’s a storyabout our Selves, and our relationship to the Universe.For, as ye do unto others, ye do to thy Maker. And when those activities . . .dishonor thy fellow man, ye dishonor thy God—and it brings all of those forms ofdisturbance that exist in the world today. . . . When there has been in theearth those groups that have sufficiently desired and sought peace, peace willbegin. It must be within self.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en199]The Cayce Readings spoke of God as a universal loving intelligence that does notdiscriminate against anyone—nor should we: “More wars, more bloodshed have beenshed over the racial and religious differences than over any other problem.These, too, must go the way of all others; and man must learn . . . whether theybe called of this or that sect or schism or ism or cult, the Lord is ONE.”20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en200] According to the Cayce Readings, youdon’t need to get a group of seven thousand people together in order to beeffective. The reality of our greater shared mind is powerful enough that eventen souls can do an amazing amount of good for the planet.Man’s answer to everything has been POWER—Power of money, Power of position,Power of wealth, Power of this, that or the other. This has NEVER been GOD’Sway, will never be God’s way. Rather little by little, line upon line, here alittle, there a little, each thinking rather of the other fellow. . . . [This iswhat] has kept the world in the various ways of being intact. Where there wereten, even, many a city, many a nation has been kept from destruction.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en201]Dr. Hew Len, a Hawaiian psychiatrist,22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en202] discovered a similar technique thatcould substantially increase health and happiness in the psychiatric ward hemanaged. It didn’t start out very well: “That ward where they kept thecriminally insane was dangerous. Psychologists quit on a monthly basis. Thestaff called in sick a lot or simply quit. People would walk through that wardwith their backs against the wall, afraid of being attacked by patients.”23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en203] Dr. Len’s job allowed him to becompletely isolated from the ward—he reviewed patients’ case files to prescribemedication and/or treatment plans with the staff. Nonetheless, by simply holdingeach patient’s file in his hand and practicing the “Ho’oponopono” technique weare about to discover, he got results.After a few months, patients that had to be shackled were being allowed to walkfreely. . . . Others who had to be heavily medicated were getting off theirmedications. And those who had no chance of ever being released were beingfreed. . . . Not only that . . . but the staff began to enjoy coming to work.Absenteeism and turnover disappeared. We ended up with more staff than we neededbecause patients were being released, and all the staff was showing up to work.Today, that ward is closed.24 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en204]What exactly was Dr. Len doing while he reviewed each patient’s file? He simplytook on their pains and problems as if they were his own, and worked on healingthose issues within himself: “I just kept saying ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘I love you’over and over again.”25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en205] Dr. Len waspracticing his own variation of a Hawaiian spiritual practice calledHo’oponopono.26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en206] Dr. Len recommendsgoing inside, to wherever you feel hurt by a particular person or issue, andthen saying each of these four statements with as much feeling aspossible—thinking through the real reasons why you genuinely feel this way: “Ilove you. I am sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.”27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en207] That’s all it takes. You heal theother person by healing yourself—and this apparently works because in thegreater sense, you are both sharing the same Mind.PROOF, BELIEF AND HOPEI’ve encountered some very sarcastic people in my life. They don’t want to hearabout spirituality. They don’t care about religion. They see a Higher Purpose asnothing more than ignorant nonsense. They use Science as a weapon against anyonewho believes there is a loving Purpose to the universe—that we are more thanjust “meat computers” who struggle for a while on the earth before our Awarenessfades into a black nothingness.At the other extreme, I have met religious fundamentalists—including Christiansand occultists—who can be just as aggressive, and just as certain that they mustbe right. As soon as they hear the word god, or any of a number of other words,they feel like they automatically know exactly what that means—and there’s nopoint in arguing with them. It’s as if everybody were in a big horse race, andwe all want our lucky number to take home the big prize. Religious folks mayeven try to use the scientific breakthroughs in this book as proof that theirsmall group of chosen or elect will soar up into the heavens—while the rest ofus burn in eternal hellfire. Dr. David B. Barrett spent forty years, andenlisted the help of 444 specialists, to discover that there are over tenthousand different religions in the world—of which 150 have at least one millionfollowers. Dr. Barrett went and visited most of these 238 nations andterritories in person. He found that within Christianity alone, there are anincredible 38,830 denominations.28 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en208]So, with almost fifty thousand groups in competition—38,830 splinters ofChristianity, combined with ten thousand other world religions—how many of themhonestly believe that unless you see things their way, you might as well kissyour butt good-bye?Imagine how quickly Christianity would have failed if Bible scholars could quoteJesus as saying, “Love thy neighbor as thyself . . . as long as he’s aChristian. Otherwise, go ahead and kill him. You’ll be doing us both a favor,believe me.”I have a strong feeling that as the Source Field investigations becomeincreasingly mainstream—no longer suppressed by ignorance, threats or worse—thepositive effects will rapidly increase. We don’t have to wish that our leadersand politicians will obey the campaign promises we voted for in the first place.We don’t need to sit by and wait for a Messiah, or Divine Intervention, in thehopes that we will be rescued from some terrible fate that is outside ourcontrol. Cayce’s interpretation of the Book of Revelation confirmed that theEarth Changes are not merely random events—they are a “real world” story of ourstruggle to love and respect each other. In reading 281-16, Cayce’s source said,“The visions, the experiences, the names, the churches, the places, the dragons,the cities [in the Book of Revelation] all are but emblems of those forces thatmay war within the individual in its journey through the material.”29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en209]And what about the dreaded anti-Christ that so many Christians and conspiracytheorists shout from the rooftops about?(Q) In what form does the anti-Christ come, spoken of in Revelation?(A) In the spirit of that opposed to the spirit of truth. The fruits of thespirit of the Christ are love, joy, obedience, longsuffering, brotherly love,kindness. Against such there is no law. The spirit of hate, the anti-Christ, iscontention, strife, fault-finding, lovers of self, lovers of praise. Those arethe anti-Christ, and take possession of groups, masses, and show themselves evenin the lives of men.30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en210]The Cayce Readings also gave dramatic new insight into the devastating events ofthe Tribulation that many people—Christians or otherwise—are expecting. Theexisting catastrophes we are already experiencing now—the earthquakes,volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes—are said to be a collective mirror ofwhat each of us is going through. This again demonstrates the principle of ashared consciousness.The great tribulation and periods of tribulation, as given, are the experiencesof every soul, every entity. They arise from influences created by man throughactivity in the sphere of any sojourn.I think hope is a good thing, as it leads us into knowing, through directexperience, that all is well. And if we feel that everything is not well, thenwe can do something about it. Within this book is information that unites the38,830 religious sects beautifully, and shows that each of them have the truthin some form . . . including their most magnificent prophecies of a Golden Agethat will soon arrive in our future."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXA Precession of PropheciesWas there an advanced ancient civilization on earth, much older than we normallybelieve could be possible? Did these ancestors deliberately create a widevariety of myths and spiritual teachings, worldwide, about the pineal gland?Could these cultures, or their forgotten creators, manipulate giant blocks ofstone to build massive pyramids in two totally separate cultures—namely, theMayan and the Egyptians? Did the people of these cultures enjoy direct contactwith “gods”—human extraterrestrials who may have been far older, and far moreadvanced, than they were? Did these “ancient astronauts” understand that therewas a Source Field we were all a part of—and in fact were using to think? Andlastly, are there enough surviving traces of these ancient cultures left behindso we can figure out what happened—to understand who these people were, and whatthey might have known?The earth almost certainly went through a catastrophe around the last Ice Age,some twelve thousand to thirteen thousand years ago. If there was an advancedcivilization on earth before then, as many ancient astronaut theorists suggest,this Great Flood seems to have largely destroyed it. Rand and Rose Flem-Ath tiedtogether a whole host of unique references worldwide, with impeccable research,to arrive at this conclusion.From all corners of the earth, the same story is told. The sun deviates from itsregular path. The sky falls. The earth is wrenched and torn by earthquakes. Andfinally a great wave of water engulfs the globe. Survivors of such a calamitywould go to any lengths to prevent it from happening again. They lived in an ageof magic. It was natural and necessary to construct elaborate devices to pacifythe sun-god (or goddess) or monitor its path.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en211]Thanks to the best-selling Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock, thescholarly work of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend is now central toany investigation of these ancient prophecies. Why? Their magnum opus Hamlet’sMill tied together an incredible number of different ancient legends around theworld—and found that they all had common roots. Author Colin Wilson stated itclearly.In effect, Santillana is presenting a rich tapestry of legends of the Eskimoes,Icelanders, Norsemen, American Indians, Finns, Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese,Hindus, Persians, Romans, ancient Greeks, ancient Hindus, ancient Egyptians, anddozens of other nations, and asking: how did these strange similarities developunless [all these] myths have some common origin? And this origin, he isinclined to believe, lies in astronomy.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en212]What could possibly have caused all these different cultures around the world toend up with the same exact information—about astronomy? And what did all thesedifferent worldwide legends want us to know? The answer is deceptively simple:The myths encoded a long-term cycle in the earth’s orbit, which takes sometwenty-five thousand years to complete. The prophecies also tell us theseperiods of great difficulty give way to what they often call a Golden Age. Oneclassic example is the Norse legend of the Ragnarok. This is admittedly one ofthe most doom-and-gloom-sounding prophecies out there—but it does have a happyending, as Bulfinch described in 1855:It was a firm belief of the northern nations that a time would come when all thevisible creation, the gods of Valhalla and Niffleheim, the inhabitants ofJotunheim, Alfheim, and Midgard, together with their habitations, would bedestroyed. . . . The earth itself will be frightened and begin to tremble, thesea leave its basin, the heavens tear asunder, and men perish in great numbers.. . . The whole universe is burned up. The sun becomes dim, the earth sinks intothe ocean, the stars fall from heaven, and time is no more. After this Alfadur(the Almighty) will cause a new heaven and a new earth to arise out of the sea.The new earth filled with abundant supplies will spontaneously produce itsfruits without labour or care. Wickedness and misery will no more be known, butthe gods and men will live happily together.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en213]Let’s consider the evidence we’ve examined so far. I do not believe these areliteral prophecies, but they may be telling us a story about our future—usingdreamlike symbolism. We have powerful clues that the basic energy of theUniverse is conscious, and we all “think with the field,” to some degree. Couldthere be long cycles of time in which the character, quality and evenintelligence of the Source Field change for everyone here on earth? Could thesecycles drive our entire planet through a mass evolution—so we don’t all keepreincarnating again and again, learning the same lessons, for millennia? Manyscholars agree this great twenty-five-thousand-year cycle ends in 2012, orthereabouts—which makes this a very cutting-edge and relevant discussion intoday’s world.UNDERSTANDING THE PRECESSIONThe best way to understand this twenty-five-thousand-year cycle is to imaginethe earth as if it were a spinning top. Let’s say you have a top that isspinning clockwise at a fast speed. At first it stands up straight, but then itstarts tracing circles in the opposite direction—counterclockwise—as it slowsdown. Now imagine the earth is the top. Imagine you can see the earth’s axis, asif it were a solid bar running through the North and South Poles. Over thecourse of about 25,920 years, the earth’s axis makes a nice, slow circle in theopposite direction from the earth’s normal rotation—like the circles the topstarts making as it winds down. Some ancient myths compare the earth’s axis to along spoon in a pot of soup. The slow circular path of the earth’s axis is thestirring of the pot. (This visual only works if you keep the bottom of the spoonin one place as you make circles with it.) This slow movement of the earth’saxis causes the position of the stars in the night sky, during the equinox, toshift by one degree every seventy-two years. If you built your church or templeto line up with a certain star during every spring equinox, as many cultures,from the Druids at Stonehenge to Anasazis in Arizona, did, you’d be prettyunhappy when the stars started drifting away. By the time your grandchildrenstarted growing up, your building would already be noticeably out of alignment.In Western astrology, this master cycle is divided up into twelve “Ages of theZodiac.” Though the earth changes its speed slightly over time as it movesthrough this cycle, most astrologers round it off to 50 arc seconds per year.This creates twelve ideal Ages of the Zodiac at 2,160 years each, adding up to atotal of 25,920 years.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en214] If youcalculate the cycle based on our current speed of 50.3 arc seconds per year, itwould come out to 25,675 years—but since it fluctuates, most modern astronomersround it off at about 25,800.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en215] Thetechnical name for this cycle is the precession of the equinoxes. The wordprecession essentially means “movement.”Remember that Santillana and Von Dechend’s book is called Hamlet’s Mill? TheHamlet story is one of many ancient myths that describe the axis mundi—theearth’s own axis—getting disrupted in its orbital path. The earth’s axis isoften described, in metaphor, as the axle of a mill for grinding corn. In orderto build a mill, you have a horizontal wooden rod that runs through the centerof a heavy stone wheel. The wooden rod is connected to a central, vertical axle.A strong worker then grabs the rod and starts pushing it around in circles. Asthe heavy stone wheel moves along, it grinds the corn underneath it.Many myths set up a scene like this and then have the axle break. This isbelieved to represent the earth shifting on its axis. The myths then featurescenes where destructive Earth Changes seem to occur. Dr. Susan Lea, the Physicsand Astronomy Department Chair at San Francisco State University, explains thedeeper context behind this story—which is much older than the works of WilliamShakespeare.016 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_016_r1.jpg]Stone mill for grinding corn. This imagery was used in various ancient mythsworldwide to describe a slow wobble in the Earth’s axis lasting 25,920 years.. . . the Hamlet myth is cosmological, and describes the precession of theequinoxes. By the time Shakespeare adapted the story to his purposes, its originand meaning had lapsed into obscurity. . . . The mill is explained in the IndianBhagavata Purana. “. . . the exalted seat of Vishnu, round which the starryspheres forever wander, like the upright axle of the corn mill.” According toSantillana and Von Dechend, all these myths aim to explain precession: the millrepresents the rotation of the celestial sphere; the mill axle is the polar axisand the theme of the breaking of the mill represents the precession. . . . Eachage ends with a catastrophic event, frequently involving a flood or water insome way. This is where the Hamlet tragedy fits in.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en216]Entire books could be written just on this one subject, and some already havebeen. One common symbol in these myths is the earth’s axis—or the axis mundi.Let’s not forget that in chapter 3, we saw how the axis mundi was oftensymbolized by a stone—such as the Primitive Mountain, Shiva lingam, Benben,omphalos or baetyl—and this symbol was directly associated with the pinealgland. Let’s also not forget that the Romans also used tall pyramid shapes torepresent the baetyl on their coins. What we did not discuss in chapter 3,however, is that many of the Roman baetyl coins have a vertical axis runningright through the center of the pyramid-shaped stone.017 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_017_r1.gif]Precession of the equinoxes—a 25,920-year wobble in the Earth’s axis.Although this sacred stone is presumed to be solid . . . there is somethingmysterious going on inside. It is as if the outside skin has been rendered opento reveal some sort of structure. Four of the five coins show a pole or strut. .. . The mundane answer to this pole could be, and most likely is, the axismundi. These coins may be telling us something connected with the baetyl in amystical way. . . . All of these coins also have the angel on them.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en217]This suggests a curious, ongoing fascination in the top levels of the Romanempire with the movement of the earth’s axis, pyramids and the pineal gland. Ifthe Romans inherited a greater, worldwide secret about the 25,920-year cycle,then they may well have believed there would be direct effects upon humanconsciousness at the end of the cycle. Let’s not forget that in the Egyptianmythologies, the Benben stone is surrounded by two Bennu birds. The Bennu is thephoenix—a bird that undergoes a radical transformation. The Egyptians alsotaught that the Bennu’s cry was responsible for creating great cycles of timethat were ordained by Divine intelligence. We also saw teachings in the EgyptianBook of the Dead on how the seeker could achieve his or her own phoenix-liketransformation—and when this happened, they could levitate, perform miracles andglow with bright light. The mystery schools and the major religions all seem toagree on the importance of the pineal gland in this spiritual awakening process.Many authors want to sound the alarm about what they feel is imminent doomassociated with this cycle—and its apparent due date of 2012. Some of the peopleI’ve spoken to who worked in various classified projects would agree with them.There is compelling evidence that significant Earth Changes do occur at the endof each of these cycles, but remember—we are already seeing those changes now.THE FINAL DESTRUCTIONAccording to Santillana, these ancient legends from all over the world describethe conditions on the earth getting worse and worse as we head toward the end ofthe cycle—much like the flaming death of the phoenix before it is reborn. Theseprophecies forecast a wide variety of problems in government and society—wars,famines, diseases and corruption, not to mention catastrophic Earth Changes—butthe myths say they then usher in a stunning new Golden Age. Again, using ouranalogy of the lucid dream, it’s as if these events show us a worldwidereflection of who we are, and how asleep we have become—so we can be inspired tochange our lives for the positive. If there is an intelligence throughout theUniverse, and intelligent beings visited us who already knew about the SourceField, it seems quite ridiculous to consider that they would give us theseprophecies just to tell us we were all going to die on a certain date—and thatthere was nothing we could do about it.Our next set of prophecies come from the Mahabharata, a Hindu sacred scripture.They sound remarkably relevant to our own recent history, including EarthChanges, widespread corruption and moral decline—despite the fact that they mayhave been written some five thousand years ago. The numbers and symbolism inthese legends fit Santillana’s theory perfectly—the writers did seem to be awareof the twenty-five-thousand-year precession cycle. The Mahabharata describeshumanity’s entrance into the final age of hell on earth, or Kali Yuga, before weagain return to the Golden Age that will follow. Again, bear in mind what theCayce Readings said about prophecies of physical catastrophes—they are metaphorsof the changes we are all going through. The Cayce Readings also said the Bookof Revelation frequently described objects in groups of seven to symbolize theseven “chakras” or energy systems in the body. Here in this Hindu text, weapparently see the same symbolism being used—in the form of “seven blazing suns”that appear at the end of the age.In the Kali age, the Brahmanas [spiritual leaders] . . . abstain from prayersand meditation. . . . The course of the world looketh contrary, and indeed,these are the signs that foreshadow the Universal Destruction.And, O lord of men, numerous Mleccha kings then rule over the earth! And thosesinful monarchs, addicted to false speech, govern their subjects on principlesthat are false. . . . And, O tiger among men, the merchants and traders thenfull of guile, sell large quantities of articles with false weights andmeasures. And they that are virtuous do not prosper; while they that are sinfulprosper exceedingly. And virtue loseth her strength while sin becometh allpowerful. . . .And, O king, girls of seven or eight years of age do then conceive, while boysof ten or twelve years beget offspring. . . . And women given to impropriety ofconduct and marked by evil manners, deceive even the best of husbands. . . .O king, toward the end of those thousands of years constituting the four Yugasand when the lives of men become so short, a drought occurs extending for manyyears. And then, O lord of the earth, men and creatures endued with smallstrength and vitality, becoming hungry, die by thousands.And then, O lord of men, seven blazing Suns, appearing in the firmament, drinkup all the waters of the earth that are in rivers or seas . . . the fire calledSamvartaka, impelled by the winds, appeareth on the earth that hath already beendried to cinders by the seven Suns. And then that fire, penetrating through theearth and making its appearance in the nether regions also, begetteth greatterror in the hearts of the gods. . . . And, O lord of the earth, consuming thenether regions as also everything upon this earth, that fire destroyeth allthings in a moment.”8 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en218]I do not think these prophecies of a final destruction are literal—the “sevenblazing suns” appear to symbolize a sudden spiritual awakening that occursthroughout humanity. Right after everything on earth is allegedly “destroyed ina moment” by this incredible fire, the story mysteriously continues—and everyoneis still alive. A savior figure now arrives, with supernatural abilities, whodefeats the bad guys and helps the planet transform. Symbolism again appears tobe at work here. There are dreamlike myths like this all over the world, and theHindu prophecy seems surprisingly similar to how our world appears today. Thefiery catastrophe we just read about appears to be another metaphorical symbolof worldwide changes that sweep through our society at lightning speed—topplingour castles of sand, which we built in ignorance, and eliminating the old waysof doing things. Cayce described a very similar set of metaphors in his decodingof the Book of Revelation.THE COMING OF THE GOLDEN AGEOne could argue that things in society have always been this challenging, andthe authors are just pining away for a spiritual ideal that was never reached.Nonetheless, the Hindu myths begin with the Golden Age, which is literallyParadise on earth, and then gradually work their way down to the Kali Yuga—overmany thousands of years. All Santillana’s myths, worldwide, indicate that thingsget worse and worse, and then we get major Earth Changes—which we are nowseeing. Some of the myths end in a flood. The Hindu myths end in a fire. Therules of logic suggest that if “all things were destroyed in a moment” at theend of every 25,000-year cycle, then no life on earth could ever have survivedfor very long—so obviously we can’t take this prophecy literally. Similarly, theBible begins with Adam and Eve, in the book of Genesis—allegedly the firstpeople to live on earth—and ends with a major catastrophe in the Book ofRevelation. That’s not the end in the Bible either—the Tribulation leadsdirectly to a New Heaven and New Earth; a resplendent, glorious Golden Age.Just as we see in the Bible, the Hindu prophecy doesn’t end with destruction.The awesome Samvartaka fire leads to a new creation—the Krita, or Golden, Age:And when those terrible times will be over, the creation will begin anew . . .the Krita [Golden] age will begin again. And the clouds will commence to showerseasonably, and the stars and stellar conjunctions will become auspicious. Andthe planets, duly revolving in their orbits, will become exceedingly propitious.And all around, there will be prosperity and abundance and health and peace.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en219]In the Hindu prophecy, the Golden Age starts to restore the balance of natureand the Cosmos—creating greater prosperity, abundance, health and peace—beforeall the hard work is finally over. Then, Hinduism’s own version of amessiah—namely, Kalki—comes on the scene, ready to finish the job. Kalki clearlyhas “Ascended” abilities, similar to what we can all do in our lucid dreams. Hecan manifest vehicles, weapons and warriors just by thinking of them.And commissioned by Time, a Brahmana of the name of Kalki will take his birth.And he will glorify Vishnu and possess great energy, great intelligence, andgreat prowess . . . vehicles and weapons, and warriors and arms, and coats ofmail will be at his disposal as soon as he will think of them.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en220]According to Edgar Cayce’s readings about this major change, the “Second Comingof Christ” is what happens to all of us as we go through this process: “To him,to her that is faithful, there shall be given a CROWN of light . . . ye becomeas rivers of light, as fountains of knowledge, as mountains of strength, as thepastures for the hungry, as the rest for the weary, as the strength for theweak.”11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en221] Therefore, the wars andviolent acts you are about to read, where corrupt people are murdered, are mostlikely part of the dream symbolism. Rather than literally involving people beingkilled, it may be a symbolic story of the journey we all make within ourselves,to purify the ego—that part of us that has been addicted to manipulation, powerand control:And he will be the king of kings, and ever victorious with the strength ofvirtue. And he will restore order and peace in this world crowded with creaturesand contradictory in its course . . . that Brahmana will exterminate all themlecchas wherever those low and despicable persons may take refuge . . . whenthe Brahmanas will have exterminated the thieves and robbers, there will beprosperity everywhere (on earth) . . . when sin will thus have been rooted outand virtue will flourish on arrival of the Krita age, men will once more betakethemselves to the practice of religious rites. . . .And the Brahmanas will become good and honest, and the regenerate ones, devotedto ascetic austerities, will become Munis [silent meditators,] and the asylumsof ascetics, which had before been filled with wretches, will once more be homesof men devoted to truth—and men in general will begin to honour and practisetruth.And all seeds, sown on earth, will grow, and, O monarch, every kind of crop willgrow in every season. And men will devotedly practise charity and vows andobservances . . . and the rulers of the earth will govern their kingdomsvirtuously.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en222]If you read Helena Blavatsky’s controversial work The Secret Doctrine, moreinformation about this Hindu prophecy appears—complete with excerpts from theoriginal text. We find out that there are “eight superhuman faculties” Kalkidevelops, associated with this prophecy—obviously far beyond what most of ushave now:As the “Satya-yuga” is always the first in the series of the four ages or Yugas,so the Kali ever comes the last. The Kali yuga reigns now supreme in India, andit seems to coincide with that of the Western age. Anyhow, it is curious to seehow prophetic in almost all things was the writer of Vishnu Purana whenforetelling to Maitreya some of the dark influences and sins of this Kali Yug.For after saying that the “barbarians” will be masters of the banks of the Indus[River], he adds:“Thus, in the Kali age will decay constantly proceed, until the human raceapproaches its annihilation (pralaya). . . . When the close of the Kali ageshall be nigh, a portion of that divine being which exists, of its own spiritualnature . . . shall descend on earth . . . (Kalki Avatar) endowed with the eightsuperhuman faculties. . . . He will reestablish righteousness on earth, and theminds of those who live at the end of Kali Yuga shall be awakened and become aspellucid [clear] as crystal.“The men who are thus changed . . . shall be the seeds of human beings, andshall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws of the Krita age, the ageof purity.”13 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en223]Edgar Cayce went into detail about what he called the “fifth root race” in hisown readings. John Van Auken discussed this prophecy in the March–April 2009issue of the Association for Research and Enlightenment’s Venture Inwardmagazine.[Cayce’s readings predicted] the shift to a new era and a new body type that hecalled the “fifth root race,” indicating that there had been four previous agesand body types. The body change has been occurring in an evolving manner forsome time, but perhaps, through mutation, there will be new bodies—ones thatwill be more accommodating to soulful consciousness. We may be content with ourpresent bodies, but imagine incarnating again in a souped-up model that allowsfor more cosmic consciousness while incarnate. Sounds good, especially if itcoincides with a new age when “Satan is bound” and “no evil distracts ortemptations test the souls in the new earth.”14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en224]WHEN WILL THE GOLDEN AGE ARRIVE?When we go back to our excerpt from the Mahabharata in The Secret Doctrine, wecome across a tantalizing clue: The ancient Hindu scriptures gave us a precisetime window for when the Golden Age would arrive. They associated this with arare conjunction of planets in the solar system, thus allowing us to calculatean exact date.As it is said, “When the sun and moon and the lunar asterism Tishya and theplanet Jupiter are in one mansion, the Krita (or Satya) age shall return.”15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en225]No calculation is presented in Blavatsky’s book for when this may occur, butGeoff Stray presents an informed opinion in his book Beyond 2012.In The Way to Shambhala, [Edwin] Bernbaum says that the golden age will comewhen the Sun, Moon and Jupiter all meet in the same quadrant as the Tishyaconstellation (which is part of Cancer). The next time this happens will be onJuly 26, 2014, according to my astronomical software [Cyber-Sky]. . . .16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en226]That’s barely over a year and a half after December 21, 2012—the end of the Mayacalendar. Until Graham Hancock peer-reviewed an early draft of this book, I wasunder the impression that most astronomers believed the shift from the Age ofPisces into the Age of Aquarius, in the Western system, also occurred around theyear 2011 or 2012. According to Peter Lemesurier in Great Pyramid Decoded, theFrench Institut Géographique National fixed the Age of Aquarius as arriving in2011.17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en227]Obviously if there is a serious debate about the start time of the Age ofAquarius, we need to roll up our sleeves and dig for the answer. Mostastronomers feel the Age of Aquarius begins whenever the sunrise moves into theconstellation of Aquarius during the spring equinox—but no one can agree on whenthat is. When you go to NASA’s Get a Straight Answer Web site, and ask David P.Stern when the Age of Aquarius begins, his straight answer is “I don’t know.”18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en228]The ancients defined constellations by their brightest stars, and drew no exactborders. Modern star charts have exact boundaries, usually straight lines likethe boundaries of states in the western U.S., but I don’t know when the springequinox crossed the modern Pisces/Aquarius boundary.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en229]In modern times, the precession was rediscovered by Hipparchus, who began hiswork somewhere around the spring equinox of March 24, 146 B.C. That is animportant date, as we will soon see. Shirley Burchill, an astronomy historian,suggested Hipparchus was working from much older records.Much of Hipparchus’s work was only possible because he was able to consult thework of astronomers who had gone before. The ancient Babylonians had leftrecords of their astronomical observations, methods and equipment. There is muchevidence to show that Hipparchus used this information, and that [it] allowedhim to make comparisons. Hipparchus’s precise measurement of the equinoxes was,in fact, a mathematical interpretation of ancient Babylonian knowledge. 20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en230]David Andrew D’Zmura created a method to calculate when the shift into the Ageof Aquarius would occur, partly by going back to the original data. He soughtafter and was ultimately awarded a U.S. Patent—number 676618—so his findingswould not be stolen. In his patent, D’Zmura implies that Hipparchus was inspiredto begin all his groundbreaking astronomy studies in 146 B.C. because he wastipped off. As we just read, Hipparchus had access to ancient Babylonianrecords. We already have seen the Babylonians displaying the pinealgland/pinecone/ axis mundi/winged angel symbols in their sacred artwork. Theserecords may very well have revealed that 146 B.C., or thereabouts, was the yearwe shifted into the Age of Pisces. If various traditions kept this knowledgesecret all along, there would have been a great deal of interest in the comingof a new Age of the Zodiac. No one could be sure what might happen as thispivotal moment arrived. Everyone would be looking at the stars to try tounderstand the greater cycle that was driving these Ages—and Hipparchus’s methodfor classifying the brightness of the stars in the night sky is still usedtoday.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en231]D’Zmura calculated the average value for the precession between 150 B.C. andA.D. 2000, based on estimates of how fast the earth’s wobble has been movingduring this time, and came up with a number just slightly smaller than thetraditional 2,160-year Age of the Zodiac: some 2,158.1914 years. If we then addthat to Hipparchus’s start date of 146 B.C., we end up at seventy days after thebeginning of the year 2012.This date of A.D. 2012 is accepted as significant to spiritualists, mystics andbelievers, many of whom prognosticate that the Messiah appears in this year.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en232]The Hindus, the Mayas and the Egyptian/Greek/Roman astrology tradition allappear to converge on the same two-year period—from 2012 to 2014—as the windowin which major changes are predicted to take place. Hardly anyone is aware thatthese 2012 prophecies are truly a worldwide phenomenon—appearing on either sideof the Atlantic. An ever-increasing body of data in myths and propheciessuggests that we may undergo a phoenix-like transformation into a Fifth RootRace during this window of time—which may ultimately affect every person onearth. It seems like an impossible, starry-eyed dream that something like thiscould really happen to us—but the last thing I want to do is just wait and see.I think it’s even worse to just “trust the prophecies,” and not see if we can doany further research to clear things up.ASCLEPIUS’S LAMENTAnother excellent prophetic view of our future comes from an ancient Egyptiandocument that cannot be any more recent than A.D. 400—but is probably mucholder. It’s known as “Asclepius’s Lament,” and is a conversation that allegedlytook place between Asclepius and Hermes—thus classifying it as a Hermetic text.The very early Christians definitely knew about it and quoted from it. G. R. S.Mead discussed the problems with dating the Hermetic texts in 1906.It is impossible to base upon it any certain conclusions as to the date of theoriginal or its precise worth in the history of religion. That, however, ourLatin translation is an ancient one is proved by Augustine’s verbal quotationsfrom it. . . . It was thus in existence about 400 A.D. at least. Tradition,however, has assigned to it a far higher antiquity. . . .23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en233]The Cayce Readings repeatedly date the time of Hermes as being roughly twelvethousand years ago,24 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en234] claiming hewas the master architect of the Great Pyramid,25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en235] and also said he was a priorincarnation of Jesus.26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en236]Mead’s book has an older, harder-to-read translation of Asclepius’s Lament.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en237] Graham Hancock combined the clearestand most poetic aspects from Copenhaver’s28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en238] and Scott’s29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en239] modern translations, giving us anewer, friendlier version that appears, without credit, in various placesonline—as follows:30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en240]There will come a time when it will have been in vain that Egyptians havehonored the Godhead with heartfelt piety and service. . . . The gods will returnfrom earth to heaven. . . . O Egypt, Egypt, of thy religion nothing will remainbut an empty tale . . . only the stones will tell of thy piety.And in that day men will be weary of life, and they will cease to think theuniverse worthy of reverent wonder and worship. And so religion, the greatest ofall blessings . . . will be threatened with destruction; men will think it aburden and will come to scorn it. . . .As for the soul, and the belief that it is immortal by nature, or may hope toattain to immortality, as I have taught you,—all this they will mock, and evenpersuade themselves that it is false . . . the gods will depart from mankind,—agrievous thing!—and only evil angels will remain, who will mingle with men, anddrive the poor wretches into all manner of reckless crime, into wars, androbberies, and frauds, and all things hostile to the nature of the soul.Then will the earth tremble, and the sea bear no ships; heaven will not supportthe stars in their orbits, all voices of the gods will be forced into silence;the fruits of the earth will rot; the soil will turn barren, and the very airwill sicken with sullen stagnation; all things will be disordered and awry, allgood will disappear.But when all this has befallen, Asclepius, then God the Creator of all things .. . will call back to the right path those who have gone astray; he will cleansethe world of evil, washing it away with floods, burning it out with the fiercestfire, and expelling it with war and pestilence.And thus he will bring back his world to its former aspect, so that the Cosmoswill once more be deemed worthy of worship and wondering reverence. . . . Suchis the new birth of the Cosmos; it is a making again of all things good, a holyand awe-inspiring restoration of all nature; and it is wrought inside theprocess of Time by the eternal Will of the Creator.Again—the prophecy of floods, fires, war and pestilence has already come true,and we can and will prove that the earth’s recent behavior is unprecedented inmodern times. Notice that this prophecy again does not involve every livingthing being destroyed. It points to a world in which the “gods” are no longer onearth—if such people ever did live here in the past. It also says the changeswe’re now going through pave the way for a “new birth of the Cosmos” that willcreate an “awe-inspiring restoration of all nature.” Given all the otherprophecies that associate the exact same set of circumstances with the 2012–2014time window, this also seems to be a perfect fit. Another very curious clue inthis passage is where Hermes says this transformation is “wrought inside theprocess of time.” That’s a very curious choice of words. What might he mean bythe process of time, exactly? Could it have something to do with this GreatCycle? Time becomes much more interesting once we explore the new scienceconcepts in Part Two.I came across more and more of these mysterious Golden Age prophecies as myresearch went on—not just in Hancock’s discussion of Hamlet’s Mill, but in avariety of other sources. It was obvious to me that the ancients took thisprediction very, very seriously. I realized that if these ancient prophecieswere, in fact, talking about a real event, there had to be a physical processinvolved. It had to be something tangible, something measurable, and thereforesomething that could be studied scientifically. And clearly, the most importantclue we’re given in the worldwide ancient myths is “Study the precession of theequinoxes. Find out what it really means, and how it really works.” As the yearswent by, I spared no expense of time or energy in that quest. One of the firstmajor clues was apparently built into the Great Pyramid of Giza—which mayforecast nothing less than a messianic event for humanity as we head into theAge of Aquarius. Once I understood the symbolism, the symbol on the back of theU.S. dollar bill became much more interesting. The founding fathers of Americaappear to have been very well aware of these archaic prophecies—and gave us anew and improved version of the same prophecies we see in Sumer, Babylon, India,Egypt, Greece and Rome. The American eagle is the new version of the EgyptianBennu bird. The pyramid is the baetyl—a symbol of the awakened pineal gland. Thefounding fathers may have even started the United States to help usher theseprophecies in. And once you understand the seemingly impossible miracles of theGreat Pyramid’s construction, it becomes much easier to see how this may havebeen considered as the ultimate, living proof that gods had once openly assistedhumanity here on earth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENShedding New Light on the Great PyramidAre we walking around in a hypnotic trance? Have we forgotten that we have livedbefore, and will live again? Are we connected to all the living things around uson a direct, conscious level? Is there a working third eye in the center of ourbrains? Are there techniques we can practice that will allow us to venturedirectly into the Source Field and perform seemingly impossible miracles? Canothers go there with us at the same time, and experience the same things? Is the25,920-year cycle just a wobble in the earth’s axis? Did the ancients give us aworking Source Field technology—pyramids—as a way of revealing that this SourceField can indeed be harnessed and directed for the benefit of all life on earth?Is the Great Pyramid ultimately our single best piece of surviving evidence toprove that our ancestors had very highly advanced technology? Does it also giveus the tools to reconstruct their lost, ancient science?The Great Pyramid is considered the largest stone building on earth, coveringsome thirteen acres at its base—the equivalent of seven Midtown city blocks inManhattan—and it rises to the height of a forty-story building. Approximately2.3 million limestone and granite blocks were used to build it, each of themweighing 2.5 to 70 tons apiece—for a total mass of about 6.3 million tons. Nocrane ever built in modern times is strong enough to lift stones this heavy—itwould simply tumble over. The bedrock underneath the Great Pyramid was leveledout so perfectly that no corner of the pyramid’s base is more than a half-inchhigher or lower than the others.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en241]Such precise leveling goes significantly beyond even the finest architecturalstandards of today.2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en242]Strangely, the pyramid is also located at the exact center of the earth’slandmass—the one true axis mundi. Its east-west axis sits precisely on thelongest land parallel, covering the greatest amount of land and the least amountof water on earth—passing through Africa, Asia, and America along the way. Thelongest land meridian, crossing over Asia, Africa, Europe, and Antarctica, alsopasses right through the pyramid.3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en243]The likelihood of finding this “perfect location” by accident is 1 in 3billion.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en244] I didn’t understand whythis location was so important until years later, as we will see—but it has todo with the flow and positioning of natural energy fields from the earth thathave remained unknown to mainstream scientists in our own modern times.The sides of the pyramid line up so well with true rotational north that theyonly deviate by 3 minutes of arc in any one direction—less than 0.06 percent.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en245] Another “coincidence” is that if youcalculate the average height of land above sea level, with Miami as the low andthe Himalayas as the high, you come out with 5,449 inches—which is the exactheight of the Great Pyramid.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en246]To me, the most surprising fact of all was that when the Great Pyramid was firstbuilt, it was covered with twenty-one acres of gleaming, brightly polished whitecasing stones—a total of about 115,000 blocks of pure white limestone7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en247] averaging 100 inches, or 8.3 feet,in thickness. If you caught the glint of the sun’s reflection off of thesestones in the daytime, it would be blindingly bright—thus earning it the name TaKhut, or “the Light.” The reflections could apparently be seen from themountains of Israel hundreds of miles away.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en248] Despite the fact that some of thesecasing stones weighed sixteen tons, all six sides were carved to fit together soperfectly that the cracks between them were only one-fiftieth of an inch wide9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en249]—which is narrower than a humanfingernail. Sir Flinders Petrie described this in the late 1800s as “the finestopticians’ work on the scale of acres,” comparing it to the precision used togrind lenses for a telescope. Richard C. Hoagland has pointed out that even thetiles on a NASA space shuttle do not fit together this closely. Even moresurprisingly, these cracks are not empty—they are filled with a cement that isincredibly strong. There is no known way you could fit a mortar into cracksone-fiftieth of an inch wide, and evenly cover areas as large as five feet byseven feet wide in the vertical, with any known methods. And if you werefoolhardy enough to smash the casing stones with a sledgehammer, you would findthat the limestone itself breaks before the cement does.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en250]I’m well aware of how fantastic this must sound. It’s one thing to see thepyramid sitting there as it is today—a giant mass of decaying stone blocks. Itwould be quite something else to witness it in its original form, looking like agigantic, gleaming white sculpture in the desert—something totally unlike anyother technological achievement we’ve ever seen on earth—whether from ancienttimes or in our modern world. Thankfully, many people witnessed these casingstones in their original form and documented their observations in writing overthe centuries—and the history can be found in Peter Tompkins’s Secrets of theGreat Pyramid.11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en251]According to Tompkins, limestone becomes harder and more polished with time andweather, unlike marble—think about the gorgeous stalactites and stalagmites oflimestone you can find in underground caves. Therefore, the pyramid did not getprogressively more dull-looking as the centuries rolled by after it was firstbuilt.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en252] In approximately 440 B.C.,Herodotus wrote that the pyramid’s casing stones were highly polished—withjoints so fine they could scarcely even be seen with the naked eye.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en253] The thirteenth-century Arabhistorian Abd-al-Latif said that despite their polished appearance, these stoneswere inscribed with mysterious, unintelligible characters—enough to fill tenthousand pages. His colleagues assumed these writings were the graffiti ofancient tourists.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en254] William ofBaldensal visited the pyramid in the early 1300s and described these strangeinscriptions as being all arranged in long, careful rows of strange symbols.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en255] When the casing stones eventuallywere lost, so went any hope of documenting these mysterious writings for futurecode-breaking analysis and study.Diodorus Siclus, who lived soon after the time of Christ, wrote that the casingstones were “complete and without the least decay.”16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en256] The Roman naturalist Pliny witnessednative boys running up the polished sides, to the delight of tourists. In aboutA.D. 24, Strabo visited Egypt, and said there was an entrance on the north faceof the pyramid that was made of a hinged stone you could raise from the bottomup, but was otherwise indistinguishable from its surroundings when it layflush.17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en257]Inside the Great Pyramid there are three different chambers. The largest ofthese is known as the King’s Chamber, and is the only part of the pyramid thatis made of red granite, which is extremely hard. In the 1990s, Bernard Pietschanalyzed the twenty different stones on the floor of the King’s Chamber and madestartling discoveries. Strangely, although the stones are all either square orrectangular, hardly any of them are the same size—except when you have anidentical pair side by side. These stones are arranged in a series of sixdifferent rows—and each row has a different width from any of the others. InAnatomy of the King’s Chamber, Pietsch presents staggeringly complex andcompelling evidence that a variety of measurements from Mercury, Venus, Earth,the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn—including their orbital periods—are encodedin the stones’ dimensions.18 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en258]Within the King’s Chamber there is a loose stone coffin carved out of anextremely hard chocolate-brown granite, estimated to weigh three tons. Theexternal volume of the sarcophagus is exactly twice the internal volume. Thanksto the patterns of circular drill marks found inside, engineer Christopher Dunncalculated that the coffin was carved out by tubular drills that could cutthrough granite five hundred times faster than any technology we now haveavailable.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en259] [In chapter 13, Ipropose this is actually the result of a technology that can dramatically softenstone.] Skeptics believe this may have been done with diamond-tipped drill bitsin Egypt, despite the impossibility of achieving the necessary speeds involvedwith any modern technology. Dunn points out that the strongest metal they had atthe time was copper. The diamonds would have cut through the copper like butterbefore they ever even put a dent in the granite.20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en260]The sarcophagus has grooves for a lid to be fitted in place, but no such lid hasever been found—as if it were never intended to be found. Many pyramidresearchers, including Peter Lemesurier, interpret this open tomb as symbolizinga time when there will be no more death, i.e., the coming Golden Age. The coffinwas empty—and there is no evidence it ever held a mummy. The granite sarcophagusalso cannot fit through the Antechamber, meaning that it had to be built intothe pyramid from the very beginning—totally in contrast with any known Egyptianburial practices.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en261]018 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_018_r1.gif]The internal chambers, passageways and airshafts of the Great Pyramid.Although this was not discovered until much later, the north and south walls ofboth the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber also contained airshafts thatwent on an upward-sloping angle, all the way out to the surface of the pyramid.This supplied just enough oxygen to refresh the atmosphere inside each room. Inthe mid-1990s, Rudolf Gantenbrink sent a miniature robot some sixty-five metersup the shafts, and confirmed that in the King’s Chamber, the south shaft pointsat the star Al Nitak, or Zeta Orionis. The north shaft points at Alpha Draconis,which used to be the pole star in the third millennium B.C.. The northernQueen’s Chamber shaft is aimed at Beta Ursae Minoris, and the southern channelpoints to Sirius.22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en262] All thesealignments date back to about 2500 B.C. That was the most recent time in whichthey all lined up.23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en263] According toancient-civilizations researcher Joseph Jochmans, “As Bauval and Gilbert showedthrough computer calculations, the constellational alignments imprinted in theAir Passages for 2450 B.C.E. were also present earlier, in about 10,500 B.C.E.,because of the Precession of the Equinoxes.”24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en264] An Edgar Cayce reading from June 30,1932, said that work on the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx began this very sameyear.25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en265]In the thirteenth century, an Arab historian compared the pyramid to a giganticfemale breast, noting the casing stones still looked perfect on the outsideexcept for the original entrance carved by Caliph Al-Mamoun.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en266] Disaster struck in the year 1356,27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en267] as the first of a series ofearthquakes leveled significant areas of northern Egypt, collapsing entire cityblocks to rubble. The pyramid was shaken so hard by these quakes that many ofthe casing stones broke off and tumbled into a giant mess. The people weredesperate to rebuild—and used this fallen limestone from the pyramid as rawmaterial to help build the new capital city El Kaherah, “The Victorious,” aswell as to rebuild Cairo. Apparently, the stones that hadn’t already fallen offwere then deliberately broken off, because the quality of the limestone was verypure and provided an excellent building material. According to the French Barond’Anlgure, who visited this area of Egypt in 1396, “Certain masons demolishedthe course of great casing stones which covered [the pyramid,] and tumbled theminto the valley.”28 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en268] Two bridges werebuilt across the Nile specifically to help drag the stones across the river viacamel trains, so as to build mosques and palaces in Cairo and El Kaherah.29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en269]As the centuries rolled by, the legend of the once-great casing stones had fadedinto nothing more than a superstitious myth. However, Colonel Vyse conductedexcavations in and around the pyramid beginning in 1836 that permanentlyeliminated the skeptics’ arguments. Vyse found that the pyramid was surroundedby debris of limestone chunks and sand that had piled up around the base by asmuch as fifty feet. He cleared a patch in the center of the north façade, hopingto reach the base and bedrock of the pyramid. There he found two of the originalcasing stones—forever ending the scholarly argument about whether the pyramidhad ever been covered with a perfectly flat, polished white surface. Theoriginal blocks were still so finely carved that an exact measurement of theslope angle could be calculated.30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en270]According to Vyse, they were perfect: “in a sloping plane as correct and truealmost as modern work by optical instrument makers. The joints were scarcelyperceptible, not wider than the thickness of silver paper.”31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en271]Vyse published his detailed measurements and notes in 1840, and his assistantJohn Perring published his own book as well. This opened up a whole new phase ofstudy known as “Pyramidology.”32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en272]John Taylor, a gifted mathematician and amateur astronomer who worked as aneditor of the London Observer in the nineteenth century, was already in hisfifties when Vyse’s data came in from Egypt. Taylor then began a rigorousthirty-year investigation into all the measurements that had been reported inand around the pyramid, looking for hidden mathematical and geometric formulas.Taylor found that if he measured the perimeter of the base in inches, it cameout to roughly 100 times 366—and if he divided the perimeter by 25 inches, hegot 366 once again. What’s the big deal about 366? It is suspiciously close tothe exact length of an earth year—365.2422 days.33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en273] Taylor found that by slightlychanging the length of a typical British inch, these figures could become exactreflections of the earth year. Was this merely a cheap mathematical cheat, orwas there any worthwhile science behind it? That question was soon answered whena highly fortunate “coincidence” struck at almost the exact same time.Sir John Herschel, one of Britain’s most highly regarded astronomers at the turnof the nineteenth century, had very recently tried to invent a new measuringunit to replace the existing British system. He wanted it to be based on theexact dimensions of the earth. Without knowing anything about Taylor’s research,Herschel used the most accurate dimensions of the earth available at the time tosuggest that we should be using inches that were very slightly longer thannormal—by a mere half the width of a human hair, or 1.00106 British inches.Herschel blasted the French for basing their metric system on the curvature ofthe earth, which can change, rather than using a line that went straight throughthe earth’s center, from pole to pole. A recent British Ordnance Survey hadfixed that pole-to-pole distance within the earth as 7898.78 miles, or500,500,000 British inches. It would become exactly 500 million inches if theBritish inch were made just a slight bit longer. Herschel argued that theexisting British inch should be officially lengthened to obtain this trulyscientific measuring unit.Fifty of these inches would then be exactly one ten-millionth of the earth’spolar axis. Twenty-five of them would make a very useful cubit—which couldreplace the existing British yard and foot. Little did Herschel know that Taylorhad already discovered these exact same units within the dimensions of the GreatPyramid.34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en274] When Taylor found outabout this, he was thrilled. He now had compelling evidence that the builders ofthe pyramid must have known the true spherical dimensions of the planet, andbuilt their whole measurement system off it. That again implies that the ancientEgyptians possessed a significantly more advanced technology than we normallygive them credit for.35 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en275]Lemesurierreported that in International Geophysical Year 1957, the earth’s diameter frompole to pole was measured with flawless satellite precision—much more accuratelythan in Herschel’s time. As a result, we now know that the pyramid inch isindeed one five-hundred-millionth of the earth’s diameter at the poles—and thisconnection is so exact that the numbers check out down to multiple decimalpoints of accuracy.36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en276] This means thepyramid was indeed built to be a mathematically perfect reflection of the lengthof a year on earth around its perimeter. These precisely earthscaledmeasurements appear again and again in obvious ways—both inside and outside thepyramid.However, an even greater mystery is found when we measure the diagonals of theGreat Pyramid—namely, the distance from one corner, over the top and down to theother corner. This distance comes out to 25,826.4 pyramid inches37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en277]—remarkably close to moderncalculations of the true length of the precession of the equinoxes in years.It definitely seems that the Great Pyramid’s designers wanted us to use theEgyptian inch. By making the pyramid’s diagonals add up to the precession of theequinoxes in Egyptian inches, we seem to have been given a message to payattention to this great cycle. These same builders obviously knew the exactdimensions of the earth, and therefore may very well have traveled theworld—seeding many different ancient myths in many different ancient cultures.As Santillana and Von Dechend revealed again and again in Hamlet’s Mill, thehidden message in each of these ancient myths told us to look at theprecession—or what many ancient cultures also called the Great Year. ThePrimitive Mountain, Benben stone, Shiva lingam, omphalos, baetyl and Ka’abastone, not to mention the redundant worldwide pinecone symbolism of the Mayan,Egyptians, Hindus, Buddhists, Greeks and Romans, also suggests there was once aworldwide awareness that the end of the Great Year would somehow involve theawakening of the pineal gland. The Great Pyramid now appears to be yet anotherway in which our ancestors attempted to permanently preserve this message forfuture generations. The Vatican seems to know about it, as they put an openEgyptian-style sarcophagus directly behind their gigantic pinecone statue—whichwas flanked with Bennu/phoenix birds.019 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_019_r1.gif]The exterior diagonals of the Great Pyramid add up to 25,826.4 Pyramid Inches—afigure remarkably close to modern estimates of the precession of the equinoxes.If the Great Pyramid does have a symbolic story to tell, another obvious part ofthe message would be that it was deliberately left unfinished on the outside.There is a flat, square area at the top where a pyramid-shaped capstone—anotherform of the baetyl stone—can be fitted. When we remember how well the GreatPyramid preserves the earth’s exact measurements, it is no surprise that PeterLemesurier, the author of Great Pyramid Decoded, suggested the flattened topmeant the earth itself, like the Great Pyramid, is somehow unfinished. It couldbe that the folks who built the pyramid intended to return at some point—perhapsthe end of the Great Year—to finish the job they started. The return of thecapstone also transforms the pyramid from a six-sided object—with a base, foursides and a top—to a five-sided object. According to Lemesurier, in Egyptiannumerology, six means “imperfection” and five means “Divine Initiation.” Giventhat we see the exact length of an earth year in the perimeter, as well as theexact length of the precession in the diagonals, this suggests that the cycle ofprecession will ultimately remove the imperfections of humanity—by moving usthrough a Divine Initiation of some kind.THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATESI understand that some people might consider this entire interpretation of GreatPyramid prophecy to be numerology, and therefore lacking in any scientificcredibility. However, no one can deny that this same symbolic message of areturning capstone was forever enshrined on the reverse side of the Great Sealof the United States. The strange symbol of a single eye inside a gleaming-whitetriangle, descending onto a thirteen-course pyramid, has appeared on every U.S.dollar bill in circulation since the 1930s. The Great Seal was first proposed onthe very day the Declaration of Independence was signed—July 4, 1776. ThomasJefferson commissioned a French West Indian portrait painter named Eugene Pierredu Simitiere to create the original design, which was then approved byJefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.Even in these earliest versions, the “Eye of Providence”—a single eye, gleamingwith light—appears over the pyramid. The original phrase that was written aroundthe pyramid was “Deo Favente Perennis.” Deo means “God,” as well as “the opensky” and something that is “charged with the brightness of day.” The wordfavente means “favor, befriend, support and back up,” and perennis means“continual, everlasting, perpetual, perennial and eternal.” So, a loosetranslation would be “God Supports [us] Eternally.” In Latin, the word perennialmeans “yearly,” something that repeats every year—so this could be anotherreference to the Great Year of precession: “God Supports the Great Year.” Someof the earliest American currency featured the unfinished pyramid as the mainsymbol on the front—although in this case the Eye of Providence did not appearat the top. As we now know, the pyramid is also a baetyl—the symbol of thepineal gland in many ancient cultures. Perhaps the founding fathers felt theinclusion of this obviously Masonic symbol—the awakened pineal gland, or thirdeye, inside a triangle—would be too controversial for the early Americancolonists. In this case, the word perennis was written overhead, by itself.By 1782, later revisions of the Great Seal changed the wording to what we nowsee—with “Annuit Coeptis” on the top and “Novus Ordo Seclorum” on the bottom.These phrases make the message even clearer. The word annuit means “to favor orsmile on,” often by nodding approval—and the word coeptis means “undertaking,”as well as “beginning, starting and commencing.” When we include the Eye ofProvidence as a symbol of God, the phrase thus translates as “God has favoredour beginnings.” However, there’s deeper symbolism in this phrase as well. Theword annuit is related to other Latin words that mean “yearly”—and this is wherewe get the word annual from. One translation of the Latin word annui is a“yearly payment.” So, Annuit Coeptis can also mean “The [Great] Year Begins.”The payment we are expected to get from the Great Year appears to be writteninto the symbol itself—namely, the transformation of the earth, where theprecessional cycle begins again.020 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_020_r1.gif]United States $50 bill from 1778 with 13-course pyramid and the wordPerennis—likely symbolizing the Great Year, or precession of the equinoxes.This message is made much clearer when we delve into the mysterious roots of thephrase “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” which was incorporated into the Great Seal of theUnited States in 1782 by Charles Thomson. The official record openly states thatThomson was inspired by line five of Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue, which we willdiscuss shortly. The original Latin reads Magnus ab integro seclorum nasciturordo, and it is interpreted to mean “and the majestic roll of circling centuriesbegins anew.” This sounds very much like a description of the Great Cycle ofprecession—describing the “majestic roll of circling centuries” that now “beginsanew,” creating a Golden Age in the process.THE GREAT ROMAN ORACLEIn my early years of intensive research, circa 1994, I found a direct quote fromC. A. L. Totten, a 1st Lieutenant in the 4th artillery of the U.S. Army, whoexplained the deeper meaning of the Great Seal. This was published as a letterhe wrote to Charles J. Folger, the secretary of the Treasury, on February 10,1882:The All-Seeing Eye is one of the oldest hieroglyphics of the Deity. The trianglealso is a cabalistic symbol of the most remote antiquity. . . . The descent ofthe mystic eye and triangle in the form of a capstone to this mysteriousmonument [the Great Pyramid] of all times and nations, is to us as a people mostpregnant with significance. The motto, Novus Ordo Seclorum, is a quotation fromthe 4th Eclogue and was borrowed in turn by Virgil from the mystic Sibyllinerecords.38 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en278]Totten goes on to give the exact quote, which is stunning—but first, let’sexplore the “mystic Sibylline records” in greater detail, so we understand thecontext. In the early days of the formation of Rome, the name “sibyl” wasderived from the Greek word sibulla, which meant a woman who givesprophecies—also known as an oracle. The Oracle at Delphi hosted the mysteriousomphalos stone, a symbol of the pineal gland that was also believed to be adirect telepathic conduit to the god Apollo. There were ten famous sibylsthroughout the ancient world, including Persia, Libya, Delphi, Samos, Cimmeria,Erythraea, Tibur, Marpessus, and Phrygia—but the most highly revered was theSibyl of Cumae, who lived in a cave near Naples.39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en279] Cumae was the first Greek colonyfounded in Italy, in a volcanic region near Mount Vesuvius.40[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en280] In 1932, the Sibyl of Cumae’s cavewas discovered, dispelling rumors that she was only a myth—and it had a60-foot-high ceiling and a 375-foot-long passage leading into it.41[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en281] The Sibyl wrote her prophecies onoak leaves, which she then left outside the cave, at any one of a hundreddifferent entrances. If no one came to pick them up when they arrived, theysimply blew away in the wind.A 2001 National Geographic article suggested that the oracles’ mysticalabilities may have been the result of hallucinogenic gases such as ethylene thatnaturally appear in the caves. Spring water near the site of the Temple atDelphi tested positive for ethylene, which has a sweet smell and creates anarcotic effect.42 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en282] Apparently theCumaean Sibyl would sit on top of a tripod that was built directly over a grottowithin the cave that volcanic gases would rise through.43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en283] She also swallowed a few drops ofbay laurel juice before entering into the trance state where she received theprophecies.44 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en284] Virgil gave an intensedescription of the Sibyl of Cumae at work in the Aeneid. Her behavior definitelysuggests a powerful hypnotic influence had taken hold of her.She changes her features and the color of her countenance; her hair springs uperect, her bosom heaves and pants, her wild heart beats violently, the foamgathers on her lips, and her voice is terrible. . . . She paces to and fro inher cave and gesticulates as if she would expel the gods from her breast.”45[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en285]During the time of the fiftieth annual Olympic Games and the founding of thecity of Rome, the Sibyl of Cumae approached King Tarquin with nine books of herprophecies, claiming they contained the entire future history of Rome.46[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en286] Tarquin ruled from 534 to 510 B.C.This wizened old woman asked the king for nine bags of gold as payment, and herefused her exorbitant price. Right in front of King Tarquin she burned thefirst three of the nine books, which at the time he didn’t think was a big deal.However, her fame and reputation as a prophetess quickly grew, and when shelater returned, she offered Tarquin the remaining six books for the same price.Again he refused—and again she burned the next three books right in front ofhim, making her seem all the more crazy. Nonetheless, by the time she returnedwith the final three books, she had become truly legendary for her accuracy. Theking’s advisors urged him to accept her offer even though she still asked himfor nine bags of gold—and he finally accepted.Regardless of what any skeptics may think in modern times about the art ofprophecy, the Sibylline Leaves were soon considered to be the greatest treasurein all of Rome—precious beyond any and all other government assets. They wererenowned for their stunning accuracy, which apparently included a prediction ofthe invasion of Hannibal and his eventual defeat seven hundred years before ithappened, as well as a prediction of Constantine by name, eight hundred yearsbefore he was born.47 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en287] They wereconsulted in times of great national emergency, such as earthquakes, floods,hurricanes, diseases and hardship.48 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en288]Michelangelo even included a depiction of the Sibyl of Cumae in his famouspainting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.49[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en289]As the Sibyl of Cumae originally described to Tarquin, these books apparentlydid contain the future history of Rome—but the problem was that the prophecieswere worded in cryptic language that was not always clear. In many cases, whenRoman emperors attempted to use the mystery texts to avoid a major catastrophe,they ended up actually fulfilling the prophecy they had hoped to prevent. Forthis reason the books were considered to be potentially dangerous; by trying touse them to stop a disaster from happening, you might actually create thedisaster. They were thus kept under high security in vaults within subterraneanchambers in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill in Rome—accessible onlyto the high priests. The chambers and the temple were completed as of 500 B.C.,specifically to store this treasure—which was only to be consulted in the mostsevere emergencies.The Roman Senate considered the texts so valuable that ultimately an entireCollege of Priests was tasked to either track down or reenvision the first sixlost volumes. They never succeeded in recovering the original words of theSibyl. When Marcus Atilius authorized someone to copy the original three books,going against the official secrecy, he was punished by death—sewn into a sackand thrown into the Tiber River.50 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en290]Virgil was finally allowed to copy some of the texts into his Eclogues as ofA.D. 82,51 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en291] and the temple of Jupiterthen burned in A.D. 83, destroying most, if not all of the originals. GeneralFlavius Stilicho burned the remaining copies in A.D. 405, believing them to bepagan and evil. Five years later, when Rome was invaded by the Visigoths, somefelt this was Rome’s punishment for having destroyed the prophetic texts.Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue is thus believed to be one of the last remainingtranscripts of the original Sibylline texts. The fact that “Novus Ordo Seclorum”was directly adopted from these mystery texts, and was combined with the GreatPyramid in the design of the Great Seal of the United States as of 1782, makesthe story of the founding fathers much more interesting. Peter Tompkins wroteabout this in Secrets of the Great Pyramid.According to Manly P. Hall, an expert on Masonic lore, not only were many of thefounders of the U.S. government Masons, but they received aid from a secret andaugust body existing in Europe, which helped them to establish the United Statesfor “a peculiar and particular purpose known only to the initiated few.” TheGreat Seal, says Hall, was the signature of this exalted body, and theunfinished pyramid on its reverse side “is a trestleboard setting forthsymbolically the task to the accomplishment of which the U.S. Government wasdedicated from the day of its inception.” The eagle was apparently intended torepresent a phoenix, or symbol of the immortality of the human soul. Greatcurrency has been given to the pyramid and phoenix symbols by placing them upona one-dollar bill.52 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en292]It is fascinating to consider that the United States was founded for a secretpurpose from the very beginning—which appears to be directly related to the endof the Great Year and the prophecies of a coming Golden Age. Based on theevidence we surveyed in chapter 3, the Great Seal now appears to be only themost recent version of this ancient symbol—which was featured prominently onGreek and Roman coins. The “secret and august body existing in Europe” appearsto have originated in Sumer, Babylon and Egypt, and has hidden techniques thathelp awaken the pineal gland.Let’s return to Lieutenant Totten’s letter, which described the exact content ofthe Sibylline text that “Novus Ordo Seclorum” comes from. When I first read thisin 1994 I was shocked—and even more surprised that hardly anyone seemed to knowabout it. The Sibyl of Cumae broke up history into a series of “ages,” and inthis passage she refers to the coming of the last age in her story—which isreferred to as the “Cumaean song.” Here’s the exact translation of the Sibyllinemystery text as Totten wrote in 1882—and don’t forget these are the exact wordsquoted, in shorthand, on the back of the U.S. dollar.The last age of Cumaen song now comes. (Novus Ordo Seclorum altered from MagnusSoeclorum ordo), A mighty order of ages is born anew. Both the prophetic Virginand Saturnian kingdoms now return. Now a new progeny is let down from the loftyheavens. Favor, chaste Lucina, the boy soon to be born in whom the iron ageshall come to an end, and the golden one shall arise again in the whole earth.53[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en293]Let’s review some of the astonishing elements of this passage: “The last age . .. now comes. A mighty order of ages is born anew. . . . Now a new progeny is letdown from the lofty heavens.” The word progeny means “offspring”—so this may bedescribing some sort of transformation of the human species as we now know it,at the end of a great age. What exactly might this new progeny be like? Theanswer may come in the next passage: “The boy soon to be born in whom the ironage shall come to an end, and the golden one shall arise again in the wholeearth.” This implies a prophecy where humanity as a whole is transformed—notjust a single messianic figure. There is also a suggestion that other groupswill assist this process when we read the line, “Both the prophetic Virgin andSaturnian kingdoms now return.”When we go on to read the rest of Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue, from other availabletranslations, even more detail is given. Bear in mind that in ancient Greek andRoman traditions, “heroes” are demigods—born from one human parent and oneparent who was a “god”—and this unique genetic heritage apparently gave themabilities we would now consider to be superhuman.Under thy guidance, whatso tracks remain of our old wickedness, once done away,shall free the earth from neverceasing fear. He shall receive the life of gods,and see heroes with gods commingling, and himself be seen of them, and with hisfather’s worth reign o’er a world at peace. . . . Assume thy greatness, for thetime draws nigh, dear child of gods, great progeny of Jove! See how ittotters—the world’s orbed might, earth, and wide ocean, and the vaultprofound—all, see, enraptured of the coming time!54[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en294]From this passage, we see that the gods are indeed predicted to return—and thathumans on earth will “receive the life of gods” themselves. This is the GreatSeal of the United States—printed right on the dollar bill. Clearly we areexpected in these prophecies to be seen as gods ourselves once this process iscomplete. These Sibylline prophecies therefore represent a bold prophecy of acoming Golden Age, in which “the Golden One shall arise again in the wholeearth”—meaning everyone who is here. The founding fathers obviously realizedthat there was a relationship between these prophecies in the Sibylline records,the symbolism of the Great Pyramid, and the awakened pineal gland. Again, whenwe inspect the exterior of the Great Pyramid, there are 25,826.4 Pyramid inchesof distance across the diagonals—just like the number of years in theprecession. The capstone sits right on top of those same diagonal lines. So,when we put all these pieces together, it is obvious that the founding fathersof America clearly believed the return of the capstone on the pyramid symbolizedthe dawning of a new era in human history at the end of the Great Year. Thiswould usher in the often-prophesied Golden Age that the ancient myths alsodiscussed, complete with a transformation of humanity into a godlike state andthe return of the original founding fathers. With the association between thecapstone and the baetyl, we can clearly see how much they believed this prophecywas associated with the awakening of the pineal gland.THE ILLUMINATIThere is abundant evidence—far outside the scope of this book—that the “secretand august body existing in Europe” is still in power today. We’ve alreadyexplored how the pineal gland symbolism is woven through Freemasonry, theRosicrucians and other groups—including the Vatican. More and more people arebeginning to suspect that there are some very dark things going on in worldpolitics right now, and that our elected leaders may not really be the onesrunning the show. I’ve already discussed how some people who investigate theSource Field may be threatened, bought out, hurt or even killed. The Internet isabsolutely flooded with articles and books you can read about all of this, andmany of them are quite dreadful and filled with doom and fear. The original,positive prophecies of a Golden Age seem to have become contorted, over manythousands of years, into the perverted concept of a New World Order—in which anelite, multinational power group wishes to greatly reduce the earth’s populationand bring the people under the control of a worldwide dictatorship. In myopinion, perhaps the single most comprehensive source of written data on thissubject is New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies by William T.Still.55 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en295] Many of the mostprovocative historical references on the Internet about the New World Orderoriginated in Still’s book from 1990. Still provides evidence that Sir FrancesBacon worked with this group to create plans for a “New Atlantis” that wouldusher in a universal democracy—a world free of war, crime and poverty. Bacon’svision apparently inspired the foundation of America and the principles offreedom in the U.S. Constitution. Bacon also believed human beings would regainmastery over forces of nature once this plan was fulfilled.Let me be clear that I do not in any way support the politics, policies,treachery, lies and deceit of these world elites—which some people, includingStill, now call the “Illuminati”—meaning the “illuminated ones.” Thisillumination is apparently a metaphor of the awakened pineal gland—and thesegroups may believe their worldwide power and control are the result of arcanespiritual practices that make them feel superior to others, if not gods in theirown right. Despite the horrors that are often attributed to these people, I alsodo not feel we should rush to condemn all those who have been involved withthese groups—for if we do, we truly have not grown past Hitler’s grotesqueattitude toward the Jews in World War II. Hate begets hate. Every human beinghas a right to exist, and genocide is a crime against humanity—paving the wayfor the next group to become just as odious as those they opposed. According toseveral insiders I know personally, many innocent people are trapped in thesegroups—and would get out in a mass exodus if they could. However, the hate thathas been whipped up on the Internet is so high these days that these peoplewould genuinely fear for their lives if they actually were able to escape—andtry to do sincere good for the world.It clearly seems that the founding fathers of America were aware of theseprophecies of a coming Golden Age, and of the transformation of humanity thatwas predicted to occur. The great world religions and the many secret traditionsall appear to have originated from a common, worldwide source, which may havebeen humans who were well ahead of us in terms of biological and spiritualevolution—and were therefore seen as gods. Darkness, secrecy and the trappingsof money and power may well have distorted the original intent of the message invarious power groups—leading to a glaring difference between these secret,occult teachings and the positive, loving focus of many other religious andspiritual traditions that incorporated similar symbols and themes. I do feelthat many people within these groups have been working for the good of humanity,but since they are forced to keep everything secret, the extraordinary maliceand deceit of the few has now become a brush that tars and feathers the many—andthis is a shame. Through good fortune in earlier years, and the publicity of myWeb site and videos in more recent years, I have been able to meet several ofthe living inheritors of this tradition. I do believe that a change isoccurring, where the members of these groups now realize they do not need tohonor the negativity, narcissism and selfishness of some of their peers—and canstep into a fuller understanding of what their ancient mission may reallyinvolve. I believe the secret lies in “coherence”—to restore this planet to theloving essence it originates from. This is no ancient cult teaching—this is thefruit of an active, ongoing scientific investigation. Negative, occult practicesare a gross misunderstanding of the facts.Although the founding fathers of America incorporated the pyramid into theirdesign, we have no way of knowing how much they really knew about it. Thisphilosophical tradition is obviously very old, and at one time was trulyworldwide—before there was a terrible flood that may have nearly destroyed thiscivilization. The more time goes by since the original teachings were given, themore of a telephone game we have—and the message can become more and moreconfused and distorted. Obviously, these insider groups have not gone publicwith what they may know—and I feel the best thing we can do is fearlessly endthe secrecy and set the truth free. Clearly, the Great Pyramid is a magnificentarchitectural marvel, and appears to be far beyond our current technologicalcapabilities. Some people may have realized that and were inspired by it manyhundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. Whether it was built by an advancedancient civilization, extraterrestrial gods or both, the Great Pyramid may havebeen built to contain all the information we would need to understand the comingGolden Age—and perhaps even to help create that “New Earth” its individualarchitects may have forseen.As we head into the next chapter, we will find out how Dr. Alexander Golod beganbuilding massive pyramids in Russia and the Ukraine, beginning in 1990. Many topRussian scientists did conduct research in them—and they were able to confirmmany prior speculations about pyramid power and its mysterious effects. This hasthe potential to revolutionize our society in so many different ways that theimplications are utterly mind-boggling. It’s as if we’ve been given a massiveinheritance that is worth more, in practical value, than all the money we havein the world—and it’s been right there all along, just waiting until we wereready to rediscover it. The pyramid technology is indeed far more advanced thanwe ever realized, and has the power to completely transform our planet—as wellas our own lives. The only thing holding us back was that our own science hadnot yet progressed to the point where we could identify and understand such ahigh technology."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT“Pyramid Power”—Our Key to the Golden Age?The ancient prophecies do not speak of a worldwide extinction—they foretell acoming Golden Age. Even better, we have now found a significant number oftechnical details in the Great Pyramid’s measurements—including the earth’sexact size, the precise length of a year, the distance from the earth to theSun, various planetary dimensions, star alignments, the precession of theequinoxes—suggesting its builders may have also been responsible for seeding theancient world myths and prophetic religious teachings themselves. What if thepyramid structure itself was part of the Message we were supposed to inherit?Could it be a working technology—utilizing a science we have not yetrediscovered on a mainstream level?The pyramid power movement of the 1970s has been laughed off by skeptics as abrief flash of gullible behavior on a mass scale. Much of the excitementoriginated in the story of a Frenchman named Antoine Bovis, who allegedlyvisited the Great Pyramid in the early twentieth century. According to thelegends in many of the 1970s pyramid books, Bovis found a garbage can in theKing’s Chamber with corpses of cats and other small animals in it. Strangely,they did not smell bad, but appeared to have perfectly dried out andmummified—rather than having rotted away. If the Great Pyramid was indeed atomb, then perhaps the Egyptians didn’t need to work that hard to mummify thebodies of their beloved leaders—simply pop them in the Sarcophagus, give alittle time for the magic to occur, pull them back out, and now the pyramid hasdone all the work.History has not been kind to these beloved legends. In 1999, a former directorof the Egyptian National Museum told a Danish skeptic there was never a garbagecan in the King’s Chamber that could have held the bodies of dead animals.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en296] Furthermore, even though manyauthors went into great, loving detail about what Bovis felt, saw and smelled ashe shuffled through this garbage can, the truth is that he never even leftFrance, and the legend of his visit to the Great Pyramid was created by otherauthors who misinterpreted his work.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en297] What did actually happen is thatBovis built a thirty-inch-tall wooden model of the Great Pyramid at his home inFrance, and claimed to have mummified a dead cat by leaving it in the King’sChamber position. According to this same Danish skeptic, Jens Laigaard, it maynot all be a hoax.Thousands of people have tried leaving various foodstuffs inside a pyramid, andthey’ve advanced numerous assertions that pyramid power can preserve fish, meat,eggs, vegetables, fruit and milk. Cut flowers, treated by the energy, will byall accounts keep their color and fragrance. Moreover, coffee, wine, liquor andtobacco are said to give off a more appetizing aroma after a turn in a pyramid.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en298]The skeptic’s Web site that reprinted this Danish author’s work revealed theirtrue feelings in their endnotes, claiming Bovis “formed his pyramid ideasthrough armchair reasoning and occult experiments.”4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en299]Despite these skeptical dismissals, further research reveals that Karel Drbal, aradio engineer in Prague, successfully repeated Bovis’s “armchair, occultexperiments” in the 1950s with several different dead animals—preserving themquite nicely. Drbal concluded that “there is a relation between the shape of thespace inside the pyramid and the physical, chemical and biological processesgoing on inside that space”5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en300]—thoughhe wasn’t sure why this was happening. Drbal was also the first to allegedlydiscover, in 1959, that dull razor blades would be sharpened if he placed themin a pyramid-shaped structure built out of cardboard. Many East Europeancountries had difficulty finding good razor blades during this time, so therewas genuine interest in seeing if the pyramid trick really worked. The patentoffice in Prague refused to honor Drbal’s request to protect his discoveryunless their chief scientist could get the same results—and sure enough, hesucceeded. Drbal was thus awarded Czechoslovakian patent number 91304 for theCheops Pyramid Razor Blade Sharpener. In fact, this product was still beingmanufactured out of Styrofoam when Lyall Watson wrote about it in his excellent1973 book Supernature.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en301]That’s not all. In 2001, Russian scientist Dr. Volodymyr Krasnoholovets repeatedDrbal’s legendary razor-blade experiment and proved—with scanning-electronmicroscope photography—that the pyramid shape was able to change the molecularstructure along the cutting edge of a razor blade.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en302] Unlike what Drbal seemed to havediscovered, a northsouth alignment did not appear to make a fresh razor bladeany sharper. However, an east-west position had a clear, measurable dullingeffect on the blade—transforming its straight, flat surfaces into lumpy, bumpy,wavelike curves on a microscopic level.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en303] This is obviously not supposed tohappen in conventional science.Lyall Watson, the author of Supernature, also repeated Bovis’s originalexperiment with eggs, rump steak and dead mice, and found that “the ones in thepyramid preserved quite well, while those in the [shoe]box soon began to smelland had to be thrown out. I am forced to conclude that a cardboard replica ofthe Cheops pyramid is not just a random arrangement of pieces of paper, but doeshave special properties.”9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en304] Withoutciting specific references, on the next page Watson shared additional,intriguing leads.A French firm once patented a special container for making yogurt, because thatparticular shape enhanced the action of the microorganism involved in theprocess. The brewers of a Czechoslovakian beer tried to change from round toangular barrels, but found that this resulted in a deterioration in the qualityof their beer—despite the fact that the method of processing remained unchanged.A German researcher has shown that mice with identical wounds heal more quicklyif they are kept in spherical cages. Architects in Canada report a suddenimprovement in schizophrenic patients living in trapezoidal hospital wards.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en305]How could such spectacular-sounding discoveries possibly be true?By this point, I can understand the skeptics’ reaction. Very little of thisresearch has been done in the United States, and it also seems to violate manyof our cherished laws of physics. Hardly anyone in the Western world is aware ofthe Russian investigations into the Source Field that we will discuss lateron—in which these strange anomalies have elegant, new explanations. In thischapter, I ask you to be patient with me as I explain to you all the differentthings pyramids can do—because until you see the full extent of what we nowknow, any preliminary explanations will be incomplete and difficult tounderstand. Our ancient ancestors were confident enough in the value of thistechnology that they erected the most perfect structure in recorded humanhistory as a pyramid shape—not a big square box. Many other magnificent pyramidsappear throughout Egypt and South America—and new research suggests there mayalso be pyramids in Bosnia,11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en306] Italy,Greece, Slovenia, Russia and China,12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en307] among others, though most of them(except for the ones in China) are covered with dirt, trees and othervegetation—making them harder to spot. Some of them may also be naturalmountains that were sculpted into a pyramid shape. The Bosnian Pyramid of theSun would be over twice the size of the Great Pyramid, and the geometricsymmetry of this unusual, mountainous area is very compelling.021 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_021_r1.jpg]Aerial view of the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun—which is not yet acknowledged bytraditional archeologists as an intelligently designed structure.Why keep manipulating these massive, multiton stone blocks again and again,shape entire mountains like pyramids, and/or build giant pyramid-shaped moundsof dirt, if there’s no good reason for doing so? Why would so many differentcultures independently get the same idea to build structures using techniquesthat may very well surpass our own level of technology? Once you start exploringthe mysteries of what pyramids can actually do, this makes much more sense.PYRAMID POWER REBOOTRegardless of the facts, the entire concept of pyramid power had collapsed intolittle more than an urban myth until 2001, when Dr. John DeSalvo’s Giza PyramidResearch Association Web site first published the results of breathtaking newRussian pyramid studies for the Western world. The story begins in 1990, whenMoscow scientist and defense engineer Dr. Alexander Golod began building largepyramids within Russia and the Ukraine. Seventeen pyramids had been constructedby 2001, in eight different sites within Russia and the Ukraine,13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en308] and by summer of 2010, more thanfifty pyramids have been built worldwide, with the majority still in Russia andthe Ukraine.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en309]Dr. Golod built each of his pyramids from an internal framework of PVC pipescovered with fiberglass sheets, forming smooth faces. They were all built to fitthe Golden Section—the so-called phi ratio of 1 to 1.618—that appears so oftenin the growth patterns of living organisms, such as the spirals of seashells.This proportion makes Golod’s structures steeper than the Great Pyramid, with aslope angle of about seventy degrees. The top stretches up to a distance abouttwice as high as the Great Pyramid goes, relative to the perimeter of itsbase—making Golod’s pyramids look more like obelisks, church steeples or thebaetyls on Greek and Roman coins.Golod’s largest pyramid soars at 144 feet (44 meters) in height, weighs morethan 55 tons, took five years to complete, and cost him more than a milliondollars to build.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en310] It was finishedin 1999, and used “nonconductive materials without a single metal element.”16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en311] Golod found that any metal in thepyramid structure caused the seemingly magic effects to significantly decrease,if not disappear entirely—as if it had an absorbing effect upon whatevermysterious energy fields might be at work. This is one of the key designelements that could make a skeptic’s attempts to replicate pyramid power fail.In the U.S. capital, the Washington Monument was built into an obelisk—perhapsanother attempt to utilize such hidden technology by the United Statesgovernment—but it has a great deal of metal in it, and therefore cannot beanywhere near as effective as Golod’s pyramids.Dr. John DeSalvo’s Giza Pyramid Research Association Web site summarized Dr.Golod’s results—along with those of his many professional colleagues.Many different experiments were done using these pyramids that include studiesin medicine, ecology, agriculture, physics, and other areas. What is significantabout this work is that it has been carried out by top scientists in Russia andUkraine, and scientifically documents the changes that occur in thesepyramids.17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en312]As you can see, this was not occult or armchair science at all—it was beingtaken very seriously at the highest levels, and serious amounts of time andmoney were invested in these experiments. I was amazed when I read Dr. VolodymyrKrasnoholovets’s summary of this research back in 2001.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en313] Even though the English translationmade it difficult to follow, I certainly understood the implications of whatthey had found—and this was a vast, multidisciplinary effort from many top mindsof the former Soviet military-industrial complex. After the fall of the IronCurtain, they still had their research labs and budgets, but didn’t have tospend their time fighting wars. Dr. Golod’s pyramids provided them withwonderful opportunities for scientific exploration. The only tragic part of thestory was that no mainstream academic journal would publish their results,despite the meticulous care they took in using the strictest scientificprotocols. The main reason for this seems to be that entrenched power groupswould be heavily threatened by all the technological breakthroughs thesediscoveries would provide.The Pyramid of Life Web site explains how much attention these pyramids havegenerated—on an international level.Hundreds of thousands of people including famous actors, singers, sculptors,majors and presidents have already been to the biggest Russian pyramid. Thispyramid was built and is researched by scientists under Alexander Golod’ssupervision. Monks from Japan, Korea and Tibet got interested in the Russianpyramid; they consider it to be the ideal place, meaning the space inside andaround it. Their ideas are confirmed by scientific researches made in institutesof the Russian Academy of Sciences. All the researches showed a positiveinfluence on ecology and human health while visiting the pyramid, or usingproducts, crystals, solutions and objects prepared there.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en314]Dr. Golod’s research was taken seriously enough that crystals from his pyramidswere flown on the Russian space station Mir for more than a year, and theexperiment was later repeated on the International Space Station. The Pyramid ofLife Web site says these studies have now been covered on “CNN, BBC, ABC, AP,Boston Globe, The New York Times and other international mass media.”20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en315]As I read about this research back in 2001 and absorbed the greaterimplications, I realized that pyramids were indeed the most stunningly advancedtechnology ever built on earth. They have been standing there all along, waitingto be inherited—but it was only in our ignorance that we did not recognize suchan advanced technology when we saw it. Thankfully, multiple teams of accredited,mainstream Russian scientists did the work for us. Their results suggest thatpyramid technology, and its offshoots, could save the world—and substantiallyimprove our physical, mental and spiritual health along the way. In addition,these results tear the roof off everything we thought we knew about our ownbodies, and about science in general. The more you learn about it, the morewonderful the implications become.Imagine if you could take a simple drug that helps people fight viruses, andsuddenly make it 3,000 percent more powerful. That’s exactly what happened inone study from the Ivanovskii R & D Institute of Virology, within the RussianAcademy of Medical Science. Professor Klimenko and Dr. Nosik were studying anaturally occurring virusfighting compound in human beings called venoglobulin.When this drug was diluted into a concentration of fifty micrograms permilliliter and stored in a pyramid for a short time, apparently just a few days,it became approximately three times more effective at fighting viruses.Strangely, the drug worked just as well as they diluted it more and more—eventhough normally these ultra-weak concentrations, such as 0.00005 micrograms permilliliter, would have no effect whatsoever in the fight against viruses.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en316]If that isn’t groundbreaking enough, the healing powers discovered by ProfessorA. G. Antonov and his associates, from the Russian R & D Institute ofPediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, are seemingly miraculous. In theirhospital ward, they routinely had to treat premature babies with grave medicalproblems, who were only given days to live. Since their colleagues knew thepyramid had a remarkable strengthening effect on medication, and the drug itselfdidn’t even seem to be necessary, they tried something even more outrageous.Rather than using any known medicine, they took a simple placebo sample of 40percent glucose in distilled water, and stored it in the pyramid. Byadministering only one milliliter of this solution to twenty different prematurebabies who were almost certainly going to die, every single one of them enjoyeda complete recovery.22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en317] The babiesgiven ordinary glucose solution were just as likely to die as before.Could the pyramid be somehow activating a natural healing chemical in theglucose, they wondered? The only way to find out for sure was to switch toordinary water, and try the same experiment again—but a single milliliter of“pyramid water” worked just as well.What happens if you put a diseased organism directly inside the pyramid? Thiswas what a Russian Academy of Medical Science group headed by Dr. N. B. Egorovawanted to find out. Two groups of normal white laboratory mice were given strain415 of the virus S. typhimurium (typhoid fever) in equal amounts over the courseof one day. The only difference was that one group of mice was kept in thepyramid, and the other group was not. Amazingly, 60 percent of the mice in thepyramid survived smaller doses of the virus, whereas only 7 percent survived inthe control group. Even in much larger doses of contamination, which wouldnormally kill almost every single mouse, 30 percent of the pyramid mice stillsurvived—while only 3 percent of those unlucky enough to be in the control groupactually made it.23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en318]Dr. Egorova also fed pyramid water to mice that had been given nasty carcinogensthat would almost certainly give them massive cancerous tumors. The controlgroup was given the same carcinogens, but they were given only ordinary waterthat had never been inside a pyramid. The mice drinking the pyramid water hadsignificantly fewer tumors develop than the mice drinking the ordinary water.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en319]No dangerous or ill effects have ever been observed from these healingtreatments. Golod’s team found that the taller the pyramid was, the morepowerful the effects became—but even the tallest one was still just a littlemore than a quarter the height of the Great Pyramid. It does cost money to buildthese pyramids, yes—but compared to the outrageous, spiraling costs of healthcare, and the struggle to find effective remedies everyone can afford, it’scertainly worth investigating more. If it only takes one milliliter of water tosave a baby from dying, think about how much healing water even one pyramidcould create.QUANTUM EFFECTSMiracle health cures are still only one piece of the puzzle. Remember theeffects on the molecular structure of razor blades? Other strange quantumeffects were discovered as well. For example, chunks of granite and crystal werescattered along the entire floor of Golod’s tallest pyramid for months at atime. As we briefly see in some of the videos now online, a faint but visiblewhitening would occur along the tops of these rocks, which otherwise should havestayed reddish brown. These whitish areas did not appear on all the rocks—theyformed a visible ring that was perfectly aligned with the central axis of thepyramid. Between the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1999, this result wasduplicated forty times in the same pyramid, with different rocks each time. Eachring covered between fifty and three hundred rocks, with a total weight fromtwenty to two hundred kilograms. Golod’s team also gathered evidence suggestingthat when these rings formed most clearly, there were also fewer epidemics inthe surrounding area.25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en320]Dr. Golod also conducted studies of the air above the pyramid with a Russianinstrument known as a “military locator,” which is similar to radar. Using thisdevice, a column of “unknown energy” was detected around the pyramid—some fivehundred meters wide and two thousand meters tall. Unfortunately, Golod did notexplain what this energy was, since the entire technology they used to detect itis still classified. They later found that there was an even larger circle ofenergy around the pyramid that was an astonishing three hundred kilometers wide.Golod’s team calculated that if electrical energy were used to create such amassive disturbance in the atmosphere, you would need every single power plantin Russia running at full blast to do it. Furthermore, an ozone hole that wasdirectly over the pyramid closed up only two months after they built it.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en321]Golod also built a series of pyramids over an oil well, and then compared theresults with others that were nearby. It was discovered that the oil under thepyramids became 30 percent thinner, thus causing production to increase by 30percent because the oil was so much easier to pump. The surrounding wells thatdid not have pyramids over them showed no change. Golod also found that the oilwas much cleaner. Unwanted materials like gums, pyrobitumen, and paraffin alldecreased substantially. The Gubkin Moscow Academy of Oil and Gas confirmedthese results were fact, not fiction.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en322]In addition, Golod’s team kept agricultural seeds in the pyramid for one to fivedays before they were planted. This was done with more than twenty differentseed varieties, planted across tens of thousands of hectares. In every singlecase, the pyramid seeds experienced a 20 to 100 percent increase in cropproduction. These plants did not get sick, and were not affected by droughts.The same effects could be achieved by placing rocks that were stored inside thepyramid around the edges of the crops.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en323]Golod and his associates found that anything that was harmful to life wouldtransform, for the better, if it was kept inside the pyramid. Poisons and othertoxins would miraculously become far less destructive after even a short stay inthe Pyramid of Life. Radioactive materials decayed faster than they wereexpected to. Dangerous pathogenic viruses and bacteria became much less harmfulto living organisms after a stint in the pyramid. Even psychotropic drugs likeLSD had less of an effect on people who were inside or within close range of thepyramid.29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en324] If we remember that someof our thoughts seem to occur directly within the Source Field, thisantipsychotic effect starts to make more sense.Ordinary placebo solutions like glucose in water now became effective remediesthat could successfully treat alcoholism and drug addiction. All you have to dois keep them in the pyramid for a few days first. The cure could be administeredeither by an intravenous needle or through simply drinking the liquid.30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en325]ANCIENT TECHNOLOGYNow let’s consider even more discoveries from some of the other, smallerpyramids Dr. Golod built in Russia and the Ukraine. In this case Dr. YuriBogdanov, from the Scientific and Technological Institute of Transcription,Translation and Replication, coordinated these studies.In the Ramenskoe settlement of Moscow, a twelve-meter pyramid was able to makewheat grow 400 percent better than it had before. Radioactive carbon had ameasurable reduction in its half-life. Salts displayed curious changes in theirbasic crystallization patterns. Concrete would set more strongly. Diamonds thatwere synthesized within the pyramid became harder and purer than normal. Othercrystals experienced measurable changes, such as becoming clearer. I know thismay all seem hard to believe right now, but as we go on, everything we arediscussing will make much more sense. Bogdanov and his associates found thatrabbits and white rats became 200 percent stronger in their endurance, and theirwhite-blood-cell counts went up.31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en326]This discovery has obvious implications for professional sports. Suchperformance enhancements do not cause any of the damaging effects we see fromthe illegal use of steroids—in fact, those athletes would get healthier from thetreatments. If the reality of this pyramid power were to spread, with nationalprestige and millions of dollars of endorsements at stake, what country wouldn’twant their Olympic athletes enjoying the benefits of these effects—not tomention all the other professional sports teams fiercely competing around theworld?In the Arkhangelsk region of Russia, they had a serious problem with thewater—and looked to Dr. Golod’s pyramids as a potential solution. Strontium andheavy metals were contaminating their supply. The municipal administrationordered a series of pyramids to be built over the area, and within a short timethey were pumping out clean water. It appears that this water has remained pureever since. The same thing happened in the town of Krasnogorskoe near Moscow,where a single pyramid was able to clear up all the salt that had been pollutingtheir water.32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en327]The full extent of the power of this ancient technology didn’t become clearuntil I read about what some of the other teams within the Russian NationalAcademy of Sciences had discovered—where we see how the pyramids actually giveus clear protection against catastrophic Earth Changes. Given the incredibledamage that can be caused by hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes andthe like, there is absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be exploring thesepossibilities on a worldwide, massive scale. And if a skeptic comes along andtries to tell you we shouldn’t even try to use this technology, because it’s“fringe pseudoscience,” my obvious response would be, “How can we afford not totry it?” Do we dare to be so arrogant and overconfident in conventional sciencethat we completely ignore the power of a cheap, easy-to-build technology thatcould save the earth?Here’s one powerful example of what we can do with pyramid technology. TheRussian scientists compared how many earthquakes had occurred in their localareas before the pyramids were built with what they saw afterward in the sameregion. Amazingly, instead of getting one large and powerful quake, they foundseveral hundred tiny earthquakes happening instead—which caused no damagewhatsoever.33 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en328] The pyramids wereapparently bleeding off the charge of friction and geotectonic stress that wouldnormally cause huge, catastrophic earthquakes to occur under thesurface—obviously by a process that remains unknown to mainstream science.A team from the All-Russian Electrotechnical Institute in Moscow found that ifthey took seven one-hundred-gram chunks of granite that had been stored in thepyramid and arranged them into a one meter circle, that area was 5,000 percentless likely to be struck by lightning. They were able to confirm this by puttingthe granite on a flat, metallic plane, with an electrode that would dischargeone thousand, four hundred kilovolts of power overhead. Normally, when theyturned on the juice for a short time, there was a good chance that theelectrical current would “arc out” and form a lightning bolt—striking themetallic plate and creating a nasty burn mark that melted right through. Overthe course of one hundred different discharges, the circle of pyramid graniteproved to have a remarkable effect on protecting the inside area from lightningstrikes—there were five times fewer eruptions, which again is 5,000 percent.34[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en329]Remember the five-hundred-meter-wide column of energy that formed around thepyramid, as well as the much larger three-hundred-kilometer circle—which wouldhave taken all the energy from Russia’s power plants to form? Apparently thisenormous column doesn’t just sit there doing nothing—it actively deflects stormsand severe weather from the area around the pyramid.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en330] Incredibly, incoming storms goaround this whole area, not through it. Imagine what this technology could dofor areas that were prone to being destroyed by hurricanes. The cost of buildingpyramids could be much, much less than the expense of rebuilding from inevitablehurricane damage.Yet another series of observations further added mystery and intrigue to thepuzzle. The three-hundred-kilometer column of energy just mentioned had appearedaround a twenty-two-meter pyramid that was built on Seliger Lake. Several monthslater, the ozone hole that had been sitting over that area substantiallyimproved. As time went on, new streams of water appeared in the surroundingcountryside. A stork felt comfortable enough to set up a nest. And mostamazingly, the fields became covered with flowers that shouldn’t even exist—asthey were supposedly extinct.36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en331] Inshort, the land was renewed, healed and transformed—suggesting that thelife-giving energies harnessed by the pyramid had a significant effect uponeverything around them.The fact that all this data has been overlooked, and never even mentioned as apossibility after all these years, seems to be little more than criminal whenyou consider how many lives could have been saved in the process. And it alsomakes you wonder if other cultures in the past have built pyramids for verypractical reasons—perhaps because they were in a race against time with climatechange and possible catastrophes that could have wiped out their owncivilization. That could explain why they had such a strong incentive to buildmassive pyramids.New pyramids, or pyramid-shaped mountains, are being discovered that are notpart of conventional archeology. One pair of alleged pyramids, or distinctlypyramid-shaped mountains in an otherwise flat plain, can be found in Nakhodka,one of the largest ports in the far east of Russia. Two large pyramid-shapedmountains there were named Brat, or “Brother,” and Seska, or “Sister.”In the beginning of the twentieth century, the famous Russian traveler,historian and anthropologist Arseniev said these hills were holy places inancient times—and many travelers from China and Korea went and visited them topray there. The original Korean settlers said they were not naturalformations—they had been built, a long, long time ago, and they did not know whowas responsible. According to researcher Maxim Yakovenko, “Then and now, peoplesay they feel happy and healthy on these hills, and I agree with them. The sidesof those hills are oriented toward north, west, south and east, like thepyramids in Egypt.” Tragically, in the 1960s the peak of Brat was blown off toharvest stones for building projects, reducing its height by 78.5 meters. Here’sthe surprising part: “After the destruction of Brat’s peak (it’s located 5 or 6km. from the city), the climate in Nakhodka changed for some weeks. People toldme that there had been very hard wind for some days after the detonations, andthat it was raining.”37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en332] Apparentlythe weather had been very calm prior to this point. This change is totallyconsistent with what Golod and his associates discovered about the effect ofpyramids on our weather patterns. Even if Brat and Seska are only naturalformations, it’s still quite compelling that the weather changed so noticeablyonce Brat’s structure was damaged.The last study I read about from the Russian National Academy of Sciences, as weare about to see, really blew me away—as it shows how interconnected ourconsciousness may be with the world around us. If the pyramids can reduceearthquakes and severe weather, they probably can do the same for tornadoes,tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Let’s not forget that seven thousand peoplewere able to reduce worldwide terrorism by 72 percent—just by meditating. If theRussian pyramids could create a similar effect on criminal behavior without anyother human involvement, via meditation or otherwise, then we now have apowerful new connection worth exploring.THE POWER OF CONSCIOUSNESSCould our consciousness somehow be responsible for strengthening, or evencreating, earthquakes, hurricanes, severe weather and possibly volcanoes andtsunamis as well? Could this also mean that we have a cheap, easy way to helpthe earth through this critical transition period, so we don’t have to simplyhope and pray that someone or something else will rescue us? Would this alsosuggest that the earth is acting as a feedback mechanism for our ownconsciousness? Does our collective “dis-ease” appear as destructive EarthChanges? Are we getting a worldwide mirror for our own lack of love? Does thecoming Golden Age represent a time where enough of us move into a positive,loving attitude that we can protect ourselves from further problems?The Russian National Academy of Sciences confirmed that pyramid energy couldreduce criminal behavior and increase feelings of love and peace. All they didwas store granite and other crystalline structures in the pyramid and then setthem up in and around certain jails in Russia, which held a total of about fivethousand prisoners.38 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en333] According tothe Giza Pyramid Research Association Web site’s summary of these results, “In afew months most crimes almost disappeared, and behavior was much improved.”39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en334] Nothing in the jails under study hadchanged except that this pyramid-charged granite had been built into their ownsurroundings.40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en335]This last study with the prisoners is one of the most significant points—onceyou bring in the information we shared in the first five chapters about theSource Field. Somehow, feelings of love and peace, which are normally consideredto be abstract emotional phenomena that are strictly psychological in nature,have a direct effect upon our surroundings. The pyramid energies create ameasurable improvement in criminal behavior—just like the meditation effect ofseven thousand people that we discussed earlier, which reduced worldwideterrorism by 72 percent. Armed with this knowledge, we can heal the earth. It’sas if life itself has a yet-undiscovered energy field that supports its ownexistence, and it emanates directly from the earth—where it is then harnessedthrough these unique pyramid structures. Radiation can be quickly reduced, ozoneholes closed up, earthquakes and severe weather reduced or even eliminated,water purified, crops improved, illness and disease dramatically lessened,buildings made far stronger and safer, and even crime, terrorism and mentalillness greatly reduced—if not wiped out entirely. All these things we considerto be separate problems, well beyond the capacity of any one person to manage,can now be seen as part of an interconnected whole.Once I sat back and absorbed the full implications of this new science, itbecame very clear why so many ancient cultures went to the enormous trouble ofbuilding gigantic pyramids, mounds, standing stones and other forms ofmegalithic architecture all over the world. It appears that natural, crystallinematerials like limestone and granite are the most effective building supplies wecould ever find—to build the best, strongest Source Field generators. Thephysics laws that make pyramid power a reality should also work on any planetthat harbors intelligent life at any time, past, present or future—so it maywell be that pyramids are very, very common throughout the Universe. It appearsthat we are only just now getting up to speed on the science behind them.ENERGY EVOLUTIONHow does all this relate to 2012, and the prophecies of a Golden Age? Obviously,there are many mysteries in this new science that we have not tackled yet—and wehave to go through them step by step to understand the blueprints for a GoldenAge that we have seemingly been given. One of the most obvious areas we need tolook into is our own biological makeup. These healing effects are so bizarre andfantastic that it seems we have overlooked some very, very basic aspects of thelaws of physics—and of what it means to be a living organism. We are left withthe inescapable conclusion that one of our most basic forms of nourishment mustbe energy of some kind. Furthermore, it would appear that we can receive thisnourishment simply by being inside a pyramid, living near an object chargedwithin a pyramid, or ingesting seemingly plain substances, such as pure water,that have been stored inside a pyramid.As my research progressed, I found fantastic evidence to support this energeticconnection with biological life. Best of all, this hidden force appeared to bethe very source and creator of life itself—and could also spontaneously rewriteDNA to transform a given species into something entirely new and different.Think about the extinct plants that suddenly reappeared in the fieldssurrounding the pyramid near Seliger Lake. Where did they come from? Where didtheir genetic material come from? Could existing plants have been somehowrewritten, on the DNA level, to revert back to an older, more archaic species?And what about evolution? Is it possible that the DNA code is somehow writteninto the basic energy of the galaxy itself, so that we are actively beingtransformed into a whole new level of human evolution?This could very well be the fulfillment of many ancient prophecies predictingthe arrival of a Golden Age some time after 2012—a massive, energetically drivenevolution of the human species as we now know it. I know it’s obviously notsomething you’re going to hear about in conventional science. You’ve probablybeen conditioned all your life to think such concepts are ridiculous. Before youlaugh it off, I want you to join me in my investigation of the hard, scientificproof that such an evolution is indeed happening . . . and has actually beengoing on for quite some time."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEThe Source of the Source FieldAncient human civilization may have been far more advanced than we normallybelieve. Our ancestors made an incredibly strong effort to get us to study the25,920-year cycle known as the precession of the equinoxes, which washistorically broken down into twelve 2,160-year Ages of the Zodiac. The GreatPyramid of Giza also appears to have been built to alert us to this 25,920-yearcycle, when we measure the exact length of the diagonals in Pyramid inches. Thecraftsmanship of the Great Pyramid is well beyond our current technologicalcapabilities, particularly when we consider the mirror-polished white limestonecasing stones that once adorned the outside. And we now know the Americanfounding fathers combined the symbolism of the return of the capstone withmysterious passages from the Sibylline prophecies that foretold a coming GoldenAge. These prophecies strongly indicated that we would again comingle with thegods as the Great Year comes to an end, and in fact gain such supernaturalabilities on our own—so that “the Golden One shall arise again in the wholeearth.”If we want to take the Russian discoveries seriously, we would naturally assumethat equally stunning effects on matter, energy, biology and consciousnessshould be achievable without any pyramids being involved. We’ve already exploredthe Source Field as a living, thinking form of consciousness—suggesting that wehave to significantly broaden our ideas of what life really is. We sharethoughts with all living things, and may well continue to experience awarenesswhile our bodies are clinically brain dead. In this chapter we’re going to beginexploring the biological aspects of the Source Field in much greater detail. InPart Two we’ll move into the deeper mysteries of space and time that underliethe pyramid effects—and their influence on physical matter.A wealth of little-known scientific data reveals the unique biologicalproperties of the Source Field. A good place to start is with German scientistHans Driesch in 1891. Driesch was examining the sea urchin, which is a uniqueorganism in the sense that it has vegetative cells that look and behave exactlylike plants do, as well as animal cells. In the earliest stages of development,the sea urchin embryo is nothing more than a hollow sphere. The vegetative cellsare on the bottom half of the embryo, more or less, and the animal cells are ontop. Once the embryo develops a little more, the vegetative cells roll insideand form a pocket, which becomes the gut—and the animal cells remain on theoutside. In 1891, Driesch discovered that if he separated the very first twocells of a sea urchin embryo, each one produced a whole new embryo—rather thanjust growing into a deformed half-creature. At the time, this was consideredquite a shocking and unexpected discovery. Furthermore, Driesch found he couldcut the early, sphere-shaped embryo into as many as eight different pieces, andeach of them would grow into a fully new embryo—even if the piece he cut out wasfrom 100-percent vegetative cells, with no apparent animal characteristicswhatsoever.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en336]Most people would think nothing of these observations in today’s world. Weautomatically assume that each DNA molecule has all the building codes for anorganism, so you can grow a whole new life-form out of a single cell. Bear inmind that this is one explanation, but it is not the only one . . . and it maynot even be the right one. Driesch believed there was an overall guiding forcethat determined the growth of any one cell within an embryo.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en337] The force contains information thatgives each cell instructions on what it should do—depending on where that cellis located. The force is what tells a cell whether it should become a vegetablecell or an animal cell—in the case of the sea urchin.Driesch published his key paper in 1912, and this inspired Alexander Gurwitsch,a Russian scientist, to continue this research. Gurwitsch believed these energyfields were not only found within the embryo—they governed and regulated thegrowth of fully adult life-forms as well. Gurwitsch also believed that allorganisms were being kept alive by this “mitogenetic energy field,” and thatthey both absorbed and radiated these fields throughout their life cycle.Gurwitsch explored the radiant aspect of these fields by using a growing onion.He assumed the majority of life energy would shoot out from the top of a newlysprouting onion, since that’s where all the new leaves are growing. Gurwitschthus aimed the top of a sprouting onion at the side of another onion, withoutever actually letting them touch. Sure enough, those cells on the second oniongrew much faster than the rest—forming a noticeable bump where the first onionwas pointing. Interestingly, Gurwitsch also found that the effect could becompletely blocked by putting a piece of glass in the way, which shieldsinfrared and ultraviolet light. However, a piece of quartz did not block theeffect—and quartz allows infrared and ultraviolet to pass through. So, we don’tneed pyramid power to get a sudden growth spurt after all—just the life force ofthe onion itself is enough to have an effect on other onion cells.Gurwitsch published his key paper in 1926.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en338] By this time, he had conductedseveral other experiments that proved a very weak but measurable ultravioletradiation was emanating from the tip of the onion, creating his “mitogeneticeffect.”4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en339] Again, it appears thatthis ultraviolet light is a signature of the Source Field, but is not the actualSource Field itself—much like the ripple in the surface of a lake, from a stoneyou just dropped in, is not the stone itself. Many Russian scientists replicatedGurwitsch’s classic experiment with positive results over the years, though thisintriguing research got washed away in the excited speculation that genes andDNA were responsible for all the codes that build living organisms—and determinetheir growth.Another early pioneer worth mentioning is neuro-anatomist Harold S. Burr fromYale University. He discovered that even an unfertilized salamander egg had anelectrical energy field that was already shaped like an adult salamander—showinga straight line of charge along the egg in the direction it would eventuallygrow into an adult. In plant seedlings, Burr found electrical fields that lookedsimilar to the adult plant. Burr found these electrical fields around manydifferent life-forms. He noticed that the charge of these fields would changewith growth, sleep patterns, the amount of light exposure, tissue regeneration,the presence of water, storms, the onset of cancer and even the cycles of theMoon.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en340] Furthermore, Dr. RobertBecker, an orthopedic surgeon, studied the human body’s natural electricalfields and found that every person he studied had the strongest electricalcharges on the Chinese acupuncture meridian points.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en341] The ancient sciences apparently havemuch more truth to them than many of us have been led to believe.THE DNA PHANTOM EFFECTNow I want to jump ahead in time to 1984, because this was the year our“addiction” to DNA was heavily challenged, if not defeated, by Dr. PeterGariaev. Gariaev’s discovery also gave us a compelling hint that Gurwitsch’smitogenetic radiation—the Source Field—may well be operating through our DNA.Furthermore, Gariaev’s discovery suggests that the complete genetic codes for anorganism might not actually be found in the DNA molecule after all—at least notas their final location.When Gariaev put a sample of DNA in a tiny quartz container, zapped it with amild laser, and then observed it with sensitive equipment that could detect evensingle photons of light, he found that the DNA acted like a light sponge.Somehow, the DNA molecule absorbed all the photons of light in the area, andactually stored them in a corkscrew-shaped spiral.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en342] This is very, very strange. The DNAapparently created a vortex of some sort that attracted the light, not unlikethe idea of a black hole—but on a much, much smaller scale.Few scientists would be willing to suggest that light could appear inside thepineal gland either—but Gariaev proved that the DNA molecule is pulling inphotons from somewhere, by some unknown process. Due to the difficulty ofstudying a living human brain, no comparable experiments like this have beendone within the pineal gland—at least none that are openly available to thepublic. The only technology we have that could hold light in a spiral likeGariaev found in the DNA molecule is a fiber-optic cable—but even then,fiber-optic cables don’t hungrily draw in all the light from their surroundings.022 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_022_r1.jpg]Dr. Peter Gariaev’s DNA Phantom Effect proved that the DNA molecule captures andstores light. A mysterious force holds the light in the same place for up to 30days after the DNA molecule itself has been removed from the area.We’re not used to thinking of light as something that can actually be stored—itnormally just zips along through space at a very nice speed. If we could evencapture it in one spot, we’d probably expect that it would just wear out—andlose its energy. Even in the case of photosynthesis, the only way a plantappears to be able to store light is by immediately converting its energy intogreen-colored chlorophyll. Now we’re seeing light itself being used like a foodsupply that DNA can store away . . . not unlike a squirrel hiding acorns in ahollowed-out tree for winter. This triggers a bunch of new questions. Whatexactly is storing the light? How is it being stored? And why is it beingstored? In order to answer those questions, we have to delve deeper into whatGariaev actually discovered—because this is just the beginning.The real magic happened when Dr. Gariaev ended the experiment. He grabbed thequartz container with the DNA in it and moved it out of the way. Nothing morewas supposed to happen. Nonetheless, to his utter amazement, even thougheverything was gone—the container, the DNA, you name it—the light continuedspiraling along in the same space, as if the DNA were still there.Whatever was holding that light in place, it did not need the DNA molecule atall. It was something else. Something invisible. Something powerful enough tostore and control visible light within the shape of the DNA molecule itself. Theonly rational, scientific explanation is that there has to be an energy fieldthat is paired up with the DNA molecule—as if DNA has an energetic “duplicate.”This duplicate has the same shape as the physical molecule—but once we move theDNA, the duplicate still hangs around in the same spot the molecule was inbefore. It doesn’t need the DNA molecule to be there in order for it to keep ondoing its job—storing visible light. Some force, perhaps akin to gravity, isholding the photons in place.The implications of this are mind-boggling. Obviously, in the case of a humanbody we have far more than one DNA molecule to consider—we have untold trillionsof them, in a very highly structured arrangement. We have bone DNA, organ DNA,blood DNA, muscle DNA, tendon DNA, skin DNA, nervous-system DNA and brain DNA.So, just by a simple extension of Gariaev’s experiment, it is very likely thatour entire body must have an energetic duplicate. This fits in perfectly withwhat Driesch, Gurwitsch, Burr and Becker all theorized and observed—there is aninformation field that tells our cells what to do, and where to do it. Once weadd Gariaev’s discovery in, we find out that perhaps the most important thingthe DNA molecule does is store light—both in our physical body and in ourenergetic duplicate body as well. Obviously, conventional science issignificantly in need of an overhaul. There is a great deal of information aboutbiological life that we simply do not know, or recognize, in the mainstreamsense.The DNA Phantom Effect is arguably one of the most significant scientificdiscoveries in modern history. It shows us that the DNA molecule has somebizarre relationship with quantum mechanics that our scientists have not yetdiscovered in the mainstream world. We now have proof that DNA is interfacingwith an unseen, yet-undiscovered energy field that is not electromagnetic, butwhich obviously can control electromagnetic energy—in this case by storingphotons, even when there is no physical molecule there to hold them in place.And that’s not all. When Gariaev blasted this Phantom with liquid nitrogen,which creates a sudden burst of great cold, the light spiral would disappear—butthen it mysteriously returned after five to eight minutes.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en343] This persistence of the DNAPhantom—our energetic duplicate—even in the face of seemingly certaindestruction, is very strange. Even if you destroy the coherence in the areawhere the DNA Phantom had been, in this case by the sudden blast of cold, itwill repair and restore that coherence once more. The surrounding light willagain be organized into the unique spiraling pattern of the DNA that used to bethere. Conventional science has nothing to offer us that can explain why thishappens—but it does.How long do you think this phantom could have lasted? Amazingly, the DNA Phantomremained visible for up to thirty days after it first appeared.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en344] Gariaev could blast it with liquidnitrogen over and over again, during this entire time, but it just kept oncoming back. As I’m sure you can see, this completely challenges everything inconventional biology—not to mention physics—but it works.This information has been available for more than twenty-five years now, and theexperiment was replicated in the United States by R. Pecora in 1990—but no oneever hears about it. Obviously, the DNA Phantom is not electromagnetic—there areall sorts of strange things about it that violate everything we know aboutelectromagnetic energy. However, it does fit in very nicely with what we’ve beencalling the Source Field. On a microbiological level, it appears that we have anenergetic duplicate. Our DNA is somehow interfacing with an energy field thathas remained largely unknown to Western scientists, and which leaves behind aphantom that can easily be measured. This means your duplicate is still doingits job capturing light for you, even when you’re no longer there. If you’resitting in your chair right now, reading this book, and then get up and gosomewhere else, your energetic duplicate is still spinning light into tinylittle spirals, right where you were sitting—within each and every one of youruntold trillions of DNA molecules—for at least thirty days after you leave yourseat. Since the sizes involved are microscopic, you can’t see any of this withyour naked eye—but Gariaev was able to measure it in the laboratory. It’s like aperfect hologram of your physical body—which is correct down to the tiniestcell.Now think back to Dr. Ian Stevenson’s studies we discussed in chapter 4. Formore than forty years, Dr. Stevenson collected evidence for reincarnation fromsome three thousand children, and found that memories, personality quirks,talents and other attributes carried over from one apparent lifetime toanother—including the ability to remember people’s names and relationships—andthere was a facial resemblance. 10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en345]Dr. Jim Tucker went even further with this research, and used facial recognitionsoftware to confirm that these children had a forensic match with the peoplethey remembered having been in their alleged past life.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en346] Furthermore, let’s not forget thatlethal wounds from an allegedly prior lifetime often appeared as birthmarks inthe “new” body. All of this can be explained if we assume that our energeticduplicate is not dying when our physical body ceases—it carries over from onealleged lifetime to another, and brings our memories along with it. Some of usare able to access these memories directly—particularly when we are children,before we are hypnotized into believing it is impossible by the compellingopinions of parents, teachers and other adults.THE HOLOGRAPHIC BRAINIf there is an energetic duplicate of your body in the Source Field, wouldn’tthat mean your entire brain has a holographic duplicate as well? Maybe so. Thisraises an even more controversial question. If all the DNA in your brain has anenergetic duplicate, then could this holographic brain somehow be responsiblefor at least a part of how you are thinking and functioning? Is a part of yourMind working in a hidden, unseen parallel reality right now, as you read thisbook? Do you have a perfectly identical holographic brain that somehow interactswith your physical brain, using the DNA within every physical neuron almost likean antenna? These are intriguing questions. We’ve already given stunning newevidence to support the idea of an energetic mind in chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and5—but now it’s time to look at some additional biological research.In 1997, The New York Times reported that brain-damaged children actuallyimproved their level of intelligence and physical coordination by having theentire hemisphere of their brain that was damaged—or should we call it thebroken antenna—completely removed. If you lose half your brain, shouldn’t youlose half of your memories, and half of your ability to function? Apparentlynot. This finding “astonishes even seasoned scientists,” and according to Dr.Eileen P. G. Vining of Johns Hopkins University, who studied fifty-fourdifferent children who had the operation, “We are awed by the apparent retentionof memory, and by the retention of the child’s personality and sense ofhumor.”12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en347] This kind of extremeoperation is obviously not an easy thing to persuade any loving parents to do,but it works. Johns Hopkins published a newer version of the same study in 2003,now involving 111 children who had the operation between 1975 and 2001, andshowed that 86 percent of them became either completely seizure free, or atleast no longer needed to take medication. Dr. Eric Kossoff explained what aseemingly miraculous effect this procedure produced.It’s clear now that the quality of life of children with chronic, severeseizures greatly improves following [the operation]. . . . In almost all cases,the children no longer depend on multiple medications, and post-operatively,most of the children are walking and running and living normal lives.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en348]In 1980, Roger Lewin published “Is Your Brain Really Necessary?” in theprestigious journal Science, discussing the work of Dr. John Lorber—arguably theworld’s top expert on a condition called hydrocephalus, or “water on thebrain.”14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en349] In these cases,cerebro-spinal fluid backs up into the skull and builds in pressure, with no wayto drain out. In the most extreme cases, the skull can become almost entirelyfilled with fluid, leaving hardly any visible brain tissue at all. Many of thesepatients die or are severely disabled. Doctors now correct the problem withsurgical shunts to drain the fluid, but in Lorber’s time this was not beingdone.Lorber studied a total of 253 hydrocephalus sufferers at the University ofSheffield in London. Of this group, nine of them only had 5 percent of theirregular brain tissue left—which would appear to be an utter and completetragedy. Nonetheless, four of these nine people had IQs that were greater than100—and an additional two had IQs greater than 126. Six out of nine werefine—other than the fact that they were almost completely missing a brain as wenow think of it.Here’s a direct quote from Lewin’s paper about this astonishing phenomenon.“There’s a young student at this university,” says Lorber, “who has an IQ of126, has gained a first-class honors degree in mathematics, and is sociallycompletely normal. And yet the boy has virtually no brain.” The student’sphysician at the university noticed that the youth had a slightly larger thannormal head, and so referred him to Lorber, simply out of interest. “When we dida brain scan on him,” Lorber recalls, “we saw that instead of the normal4.5-centimeter thickness of brain tissue between the ventricles and the corticalsurface, there was just a thin layer of mantle measuring a millimeter or so. Hiscranium is filled mainly with cerebrospinal fluid.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en350]Again, in case you didn’t catch that, Lorber is saying the only brain tissueleft was a one-millimeter-thick layer against the inside edge of the skull.According to Patrick Wall, a professor of anatomy at University College, London,this is nothing new.Scores of similar accounts litter the medical literature, and they go back along way . . . but the important thing about Lorber is that he’s done a longseries of systematic scanning, rather than just dealing with anecdotes. He hasgathered a remarkable set of data and he challenges, “How do we explain it?”16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en351]After this controversial study emerged, there was naturally a tidal wave ofcriticism. Dr. Lorber acknowledged that it is difficult to interpret brainscans—and he published a much more thorough study in 1984. He found that in thecase of the math student who had an IQ of 126, fully 44 percent of his entirebrain volume had been lost—and the rest of his brain tissue was compressed downinto a super-thin layer lining the inside of the skull.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en352] Nonetheless, he was happily enjoyinga significantly above-average IQ, and had no trouble thinking and rememberinginformation. This shows just how far our concept of “thinking with the SourceField” can really go.Luckily, no one has to suffer with this condition anymore, thanks to thesurgical solution of installing shunts to drain the fluid. The same is not truefor the animal population. Throughout Central Europe, many laboratory hamstersend up with hydrocephalus as a hereditary condition. In 2006, VeterinaryPathology journal published a study showing that even the hamsters with the mostsevere forms of hydrocephalus—again where their brains are almost completelynonexistent—still appear to be just fine. They do not show any strange behaviorsor difficulties—and can act, think, remember, move their bodies and breed in allthe normal ways.18 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en353]It is fascinating to explore the connection between Gariaev’s DNA Phantom andthe idea of a holographic brain that actually is doing some of the thinking forus. If Gariaev is right, and the DNA molecule really does capture and storelight, then we should certainly assume that other scientists would haveindependently discovered the same thing.DNA STORES, TRANSFORMS AND RELEASES COHERENT LIGHTOne of my favorite parts of The Field by Lynne McTaggart is her discussion ofthe work of Fritz-Albert Popp, a theoretical biophysicist at the University ofMarburg in Germany, who began making very similar discoveries starting in1970.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en354] Although Popp did notdiscover the DNA Phantom, his work ties in with Gariaev’s findings verynicely—and also adds in additional breakthroughs. Popp started out by examiningone of the most deadly carcinogens known to man, technically calledbenzo[a]-pyrene. When he zapped it with ultraviolet light, he found that itabsorbed the light, but then sent it back out at a totally different frequency.A very similar chemical, benzo[e]pyrene, did not have this light-scramblingeffect—and unlike its deadly cousin, it was totally harmless to livingorganisms.Was this light-scrambling effect the missing key to understanding what causescancer? After Popp studied thirty-seven other chemicals, some of which werecarcinogens, he found that every single cancer-causing substance would rearrangeultraviolet light the same way. These deadly carcinogens consistently targetedthe frequency of 380 nanometers. In fact, the only common link Popp could findbetween these various cancer-causing chemicals was that they all took in this380-nanometer light and rearranged it to some other frequency. Obviously, thisimplies that 380-nanometer light is very important for our overall health andwell-being—but if you never allow any sunlight to touch your skin withoutwearing sunscreen, you may not be getting very much of it, since sunscreencompletely blocks ultraviolet light.Popp then learned that many biological lab experiments have proven you candestroy 99 percent of a cell with ultraviolet light, but if you then give it avery weak pulse of the same wavelength, it almost completely recovers—in asingle day. This is known as “photo repair,” and no one really understands whyit works. To Popp’s amazement, the best photo-repair effects were already knownto occur at 380 nanometers—even though none of these scientists knew anythingabout his discovery. 20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en355]Therefore, it appears that as the Source Field flows into our own measurablereality, its electromagnetic signature is the strongest at the 380-nanometerwavelength. The Source Field also has fluidlike properties—a very importantpoint we will go into more detail about later on. This means you can create arhythmic pulsation, or what most people would call a vibration, within the fielditself and get much stronger effects. Think about how Roman soldiers had tochange the speeds they were marching as they went over a bridge, in differentgroups. Otherwise, if they all marched at the same speed, the entire bridgewould start shaking—and could even completely come apart. All those littlevibrations kept on resonating, and pretty soon they would build up to muchlarger effects. The same thing applies to the Source Field—except that here it’sa good thing.So, in the photo-repair experiments, those weak pulses of 380-nanometer lightapparently created a vibration in the Source Field that actually caused a muchhigher amount of healing, 380-nanometer energy to start flowing in. This, inturn, bathed the dead cells with a splash of rejuvenating, life-giving energy ina short period of time—and they enjoyed a remarkable healing effect.Popp was hooked on the idea of finding out if the human body was indeed storingand giving off light. He challenged a student named Bernard Ruth to set up anexperiment that could prove our bodies were giving off this light—in order forRuth to finish out his Ph.D. dissertation. Ruth was a skeptic and thought thewhole idea was ridiculous, so Popp challenged him to disprove the conceptinstead. Ruth then went to great lengths to design equipment that could countlight—one photon at a time. His device is still considered one of the best lightdetectors out there. Ruth’s equipment was ready for the first test in 1976, andthey decided to start out with cucumber seeds. To their amazement, the seedlingswere giving off photons—and these light pulses were significantly stronger thanPopp had expected.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en356] Ruth wasskeptical, and felt it had to be due to the presence of chlorophyll—so theyswitched over to potatoes, which do not have chlorophyll or go through anyphotosynthesis. Nonetheless, the potatoes gave off even more light than thecucumber seeds. Furthermore, their light emissions were extremelycoherent—meaning they were highly structured, just like a laser beam’s.Next, they tried hitting DNA with a chemical called ethidium bromide, whichcauses the molecule to unwind and die. Not surprisingly, the more Popp blastedDNA with this chemical, the more light burst out of it.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en357] This led Popp to conclude that theability to store and release light was a key aspect of how DNA works—just asGariaev later discovered. Mainstream science still hasn’t caught up with thesebreakthroughs yet, nor to how Gariaev proved that the energy field responsiblefor storing this light isn’t electromagnetic—and doesn’t even require DNA to bethere for it to work.As Popp’s research went on, he found that all living things were continuouslyemitting photons—ranging from only a small number to many hundreds.Interestingly, rudimentary animals or plants give off significantly morelight—some one hundred photons per square centimeter per second—than humans do,at only ten photons per second in the same-size area. This was high-frequencylight, ranging between two hundred to eight hundred nanometers—well above thevisible range. And again, it was coherent light—just like a laser beam.Popp also discovered that if he shined light on living cells, they would firstabsorb it, and then release an intense burst of new light after a brief periodof time. He called this “delayed luminescence.” This is exactly what we wouldhave expected to see after Gariaev’s discovery that the DNA molecule storeslight. Obviously, the DNA is doing something with the light—not just storing itindefinitely. This also fits in perfectly with Gurwitsch’s observation of theenergy emerging from the tip of an onion—including the fact that the effectcould be blocked by shielding off ultraviolet light. In short, our DNAapparently stashes away light as if it were a direct source of energy andvitality. If the DNA gets too much light, it sends it back out—perhaps like anorganism might excrete waste products it no longer needs. However, Popp believedthat, unlike waste, these light emissions were serving a very usefulpurpose—they contained information. Specifically, these light pulses carried thecodes to reestablish order and balance throughout the body.Popp also found that we give off significantly more of these photons when we aregoing through stress, even though we are not taking in additional light. Iconsider this a very significant point. We know that many illnesses are enhancedor even caused by stress—and it could be that when we get stressed out or gothrough negative emotions, we’re giving away some of our own vitality byshedding the light stored in our DNA, all throughout our cells. Why do ourbodies end up doing this? It appears that these extra bursts of light containthe information our cells need to heal themselves—from all the damage we’ve beencausing them through negative emotions.Therefore, in order to get healthy again, we’re going to have to charge our DNAback up—and get more light. This raises another interesting question. Obviously,the vast majority of our cells are not being exposed to outside light of anykind—other than the very top layer of our skin. So how exactly do we get morelight? How does the light make its way through to the deepest, most internalparts of our bodies? Is all this light strictly coming from visible sources allaround us? (Obviously, we don’t die if we are kept in a totally dark room—butour DNA clearly seems to be using light all the time.) Indeed, could thesephotons be emanating directly out of the Source Field itself? And if the SourceField and its energy is fundamentally interconnected with consciousness, as theRussian pyramid research suggests, then could our minds and emotions beaffecting how much light can get in—and where it gets in? Do we have to be opento the Source Field in order for its healing effects to move into our bodies?Could this explain the placebo effect, where simply believing we will be healedactually helps us get better? In short, is it possible that our attitudedetermines how well our DNA and our cells can absorb light?DNA MEASURABLY RESPONDS TO HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESSDr. Glen Rein, a biochemist who graduated from the University of London, madestunning discoveries that reveal how DNA behaves in direct response to humanconsciousness. For starters, DNA unwinds when a cell is about to divide, or hasbeen damaged (i.e., when it is dead), and it winds when it is working to repairand heal itself. The amount of winding or unwinding in DNA can be directlymeasured by how well it absorbs light at 260 nanometers. In these remarkableexperiments, Dr. Rein started out by taking living DNA from a mix of humanplacentas, putting it in deionized water, and then storing the whole mixtureinside a beaker. Then various people attempted to either wind or unwind theDNA—by nothing more than the power of their own thoughts, in heavyconcentration. The control samples, where no one tried to do anything to them,changed by only 1.1 percent—but the treated samples changed by anywhere between2 to 10 percent. This meant that our thoughts alone have, at the very least, atwo-fold effect on the winding of human DNA.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en358]Even more interesting, the senders with the most coherent brain wave patternshad the strongest ability to change the structure of DNA. And on the flipside ofthe coin, “one individual who was particularly agitated (and had a veryincoherent [brain wave pattern,]) produced an abnormal shift in the UV,” orultraviolet light, that the DNA was absorbing. The change occurred at awavelength of 310 nanometers, which is close to Popp’s magic value of 380nanometers—that same frequency that can cause cancer when it is scrambled.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en359] This angry person also caused theDNA to coil up tighter in its winding. Both of these are very unusual effects.According to Rein, this change in the 310-nanometer light could only mean that“an alteration in the physical/chemical structure of one or more of the bases inthe DNA molecule has occurred.”25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en360]That means our thoughts can actually create physical and chemical changes in thestructure of the DNA molecule—as well as winding and unwinding it. This is themicrobiological proof for the connection between angry thoughts and canceroustissue growth that we’ve been waiting for—and the implications are just asprofound for healing effects as well. Let’s not forget how we can projectsignificant bursts of photons into an electromagnetically shielded area when weare accurately remote-viewing that location, as we learned in chapter 4. Thosephotons may well have genetic information in them that can restructure others’DNA to restore health—such as the 380-nanometer light frequency.In another case, when DNA was placed in front of people who were generatingcoherence in their brain wave patterns, but were not trying to change the DNA,there was no change in the winding or unwinding of the DNA sample. It was onlywhen they wanted it to change that it actually did. This strongly suggests thatthe conscious intent of the people was causing these effects to occur. Dr. LewChildre was able to wind or unwind DNA in the laboratory from a half a mileaway. Valerie Sadyrin was able to wind DNA in Dr. Rein’s California lab from hishome in Moscow, thousands of miles away, during one thirty-minute period oftime. According to Rein, the key quality of this energy that can generatecoherence in the brain waves and directly affect DNA is love: “Although thetechniques used by the different healers are quite varied, they all appear torequire a heart focus.”26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en361]The implications of this are tremendous. The Source Field appears to beresponsible for creating the DNA Phantom, and storing light in the DNA molecule.It would appear that our thoughts change the DNA Phantom in Dr. Rein’sexperiments first, and only later do we see any changes in the physical DNAmolecule. Best of all, we now know that the most important emotional quality ofthe Source Field is love. Dr. Rein proved that love has a direct, measurableeffect on DNA—very likely through the same energetic process that creates theDNA Phantom.Greater coherence, greater organization, greater structure and greatercrystallization—all these effects show us that the energy fields, molecules andcells of our bodies are working in greater harmony and Unity. For the firsttime, this actually gives us a scientific definition of love. It is not strictlyan abstract emotional and biological concept—like the chemicals fired off in thebrain when we eat chocolate, or the genetic urge to reproduce. Love can now beseen as a basic principle of universal energy. The more coherence, the morestructure, the more harmony we have, the more love there is. And as the Russianpyramid studies show, this also has a direct effect on the behavior of theearth—again suggesting we may all be living in a collective Lucid Dream, to somedegree.Now let’s return to Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp, as some of his results are now beingrediscovered by others. Popp found out that our bodies had a variety ofdifferent cycles—where the intensity of light would increase and decrease overtime. This included biorhythms of 7, 14, 32, 80 and 270 days, which held trueeven after a year. He also found similarities by day and by night, and by theweek and the month—suggesting our rhythms were somehow tapped into the movementsof the earth as well. The basics of this phenomena were found again by Japanesescientists in a 2009 study. They were using extremely sensitive cameras that candetect single photons within very dark rooms—similar to the device Ruthdeveloped for Popp’s experiments. To their surprise, the Japanese scientistsfound our bodies were indeed glowing. The lowest intensity of light was at tenA.M., and the strongest point was at four P.M.—and it then dropped off graduallyafter that.27 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en362] Another interestingdiscovery was that our faces glowed more than the rest of our bodies. TheJapanese scientists firmly believe this light can help us understand thecondition of a person’s health—but they are seemingly not aware of all the otherresearch that has already made great strides in these areas.Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp found that cancer patients had lost their natural,cyclical human biorhythms. Furthermore, the light they were emitting was notanywhere near as coherent as a healthy person’s.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en363] It was as if the overall level oflight stored in their bodies were significantly reduced. Multiple sclerosisseemed to be an exception to this rule of ill health, though. In this case, Poppfound that people were absorbing too much light, and it appeared to bescrambling and confusing the cells’ natural ability to function.Popp wanted to find out whether the level of light stored in the body couldindeed reveal how healthy the organism was—so he kept on doing more experiments.In one case, he found that free-range chicken eggs had significantly morecoherent light than factory-raised eggs. When he examined various types of food,he found that the healthiest food consistently had the lowest and most coherentintensity of light.29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en364] That’s aninteresting point, as it truly suggests that it is quality, not quantity, thatcounts with this bioenergy system.Popp made another significant breakthrough when he studied a common water fleaknown as Daphnia. To his amazement, he found that as one flea emitted light,other fleas reabsorbed it. They were drawing vitality directly from each other.This obviously implies that when we absorb too much light, the photons we giveaway are not waste products—they still contain all the vitality our bodies need.Sure enough, Popp found that small fish were also absorbing light from eachother, sunflowers would position themselves to where the most number of photonscould be absorbed, and bacteria would soak up light from their surroundings.30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en365] It is frankly quite amazing thatthis natural, biological system has eluded our mainstream scientific thought forso long—but once this knowledge spreads, the effects will be tremendouslypositive.Popp then tested a variety of plant extracts to see if any of them couldactually change the quality of light emissions from a human body—such as topotentially find a cure for the light-scrambling effects of cancer. Everysubstance he tried only seemed to make the problem worse, except for one:mistletoe. Indeed, one woman in Popp’s care was able to completely cure hercancer through the use of mistletoe extract.31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en366]Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp is not the only early pioneer whose work deserves a secondlook. Another classic breakthrough was Adamenko’s “phantom leaf effect” from1975. In this case, Adamenko was studying Kirlian photography. All you do is puta leaf or other living thing on an electrified Kirlian plate, and you then see abeautiful aura that appears around it as a fuzzy electrical current. ToAdamenko’s amazement, when he cut off the top of a living leaf and put it on theKirlian plate, a phantom image of the missing piece would still appear for tento fifteen seconds. 32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en367] Manydifferent groups have repeated this experiment around the world, and it wascommon to read about it in the 1970s pyramid power books.Again, normal electromagnetic energy should not be able to do this—but theeffect does fit in perfectly with our concept of a Source Field. Every livingorganism stores and releases photons inside its DNA, but you can remove the DNA,and the photons mysteriously still keep spiraling in that same area for up tothirty days. This is almost certainly what is causing the phantom leaf effect.It is therefore possible that if you left the leaf on the Kirlian plate for alonger period of time before you cut it, the phantom might also last longer—asthat entire area has now built up a greater spiraling flow within the SourceField.GENETIC RESTRUCTURING AND HEALINGJust one year after the phantom leaf effect was discovered, Dr. VlailKaznacheyev made a very significant breakthrough that takes us even farther downthe “rabbit hole.” Kaznacheyev started out with two hermetically sealed cellcultures—and infected one of them with a disease. When he shined the light fromthe diseased cell culture into the healthy cell culture, the healthy cellsmysteriously got infected with the disease.33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en368] Bear in mind that there was nopossible way, through any known genetic process, that this could have happened.The only way this could have worked is if the DNA inside the healthy cellsactually rearranged to form the DNA of the virus. The virus then cannibalizedthe cellular material around itself to form more viruses, as it normally wouldhave done in its typical life cycle. We are seeing DNA and living tissue beingrearranged by the genetic codes contained within coherent light.Even more interestingly, when Kaznacheyev put a piece of glass in the way, thehealthy cells did not get the disease. Glass, again, blocks infrared andultraviolet light—so the genetic codes for the virus could not get through tothe healthy cells. Of course, Gurwitsch used the same method to block the energyemerging from the tip of a growing onion. And if you put a pane of quartz in theway, in either Gurwitsch’s or Kaznacheyev’s experiments, the effect stillworks—and the key is that quartz allows infrared and ultraviolet to passthrough.How could a burst of coherent light completely transform the DNA molecule—andrearrange it from one life-form to another? Don’t forget that we are constantlysurrounded by electromagnetic waves that are bursting with information. We havecell-phone conversations, satellite television and high-speed Internet accessgoing on all around us—uploading and downloading untold gigabytes ofinformation. Laser light is very coherent—meaning there is a great deal ofstructure within it. This makes it ideally suited to carry information—just likewe already do with other electromagnetic waves, but much more efficiently inthis case. Just one pulse of light may well contain the entire genetic code tobuild an organism. And based on Kaznacheyev’s landmark discovery, it appearsthat DNA is ready and waiting to be rearranged from one type of organism toanother—if it receives the proper codes first. This will become much clearer,with multiple examples, as we go on.After discovering the DNA Phantom Effect back in 1984, Dr. Peter Gariaev madeadditional discoveries in 2000 that have profound implications for human health.In this case, Gariaev started out by collecting seeds that had died of radiationpoisoning from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Amazingly, by simply shining anon-burning laser light through healthy seeds of the same variety, andredirecting that light into the dead seeds, the radiated seeds miraculouslyrecovered—and were completely healed. They could now grow into fully healthyadult plants.This excited Gariaev greatly, so he decided to try a similar experiment on labrats. In this case, he gave them a lethal dose of a toxin called alloxan.Typically, this toxin destroys the pancreas, an organ that creates insulin inthe body to regulate blood sugar—and the rat dies within four to six days fromType 1 diabetes. Gariaev removed the pancreas and spleen from a healthy rat,shined a laser beam through it, and redirected that light into a rat that hadbeen poisoned with alloxan. Amazingly, even though this experiment was repeatedmany times, involving three different research groups in 2000, 2001 and 2005,nearly 90 percent of all the rats who received this treatment experienced a fullrecovery. Their pancreas regrew, their blood sugar normalized, and within onlytwelve days, they were good as new.34[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en369]What’s even more fantastic is that Gariaev was able to send the light from thehealthy pancreas across a distance of twenty kilometers, using non-locality (nocables or wires required) and the healing effect still worked just as well.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en370] As I’m sure you’re starting to see,these healing results are equally as miraculous as what we saw from the Russianpyramids—and they are taking place without the use of pyramid technology. In2005, Gariaev reported that “by the same means, we have significantly curbed theaging process in human cells, and even grown new adult human teeth inindividuals who had lost them.”36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en371] Icontacted Dr. Gariaev to get more information. As some of his technical papersreveal, all of which are still in Russian at this time, this was an accidentthat happened while he was treating an elderly woman for diabetes. Specifically,he was trying to regrow a healthy new pancreas for her by energizing the bloodof her ten-year-old grandson—and beaming in the proper healing frequencies. InGariaev’s model, a child’s DNA still has the parents’ and grandparents’ energysignature in it—but in a healthier, younger configuration. This process involvesthe use of a specially modified, wide-spectrum red laser. Most of the detailsare still in Russian, but can be found at Gariaev’s official Web site,wavegenetic.ru [http://wavegenetic.ru].This woman only had one tooth left in the front of her mouth. After two weeks oftreatment, she started experiencing pain and swelling in her jaw. Bumps appearedin her mouth and three new teeth cut through the skin—all of which were wisdomteeth in the back. This forced her dentist to completely redo both her top andbottom denture plates to account for the new growth. Gariaev also sent me anX-ray diagram of what happened, but did not have a “before” photograph availablefor comparison. Sadly, before Gariaev could repeat the experiment with others,Bauman’s State University in Moscow declared it “pseudoscience,” terminated theexperiment and fired him. Some might consider this to be a fatal indictment ofGariaev’s credibility as a scientist, but this is not uncommon. Many, if notmost of the scientists who make discoveries like this end up being scorned,ridiculed, feared and attacked. So many different scientists have independentlydiscovered the same things that it is very unlikely we are dealing with hoaxesor pseudoscience at all. Indeed, the evidence is clear that this is a medicalrevolution waiting to happen. Given the results of the pancreas study, a singleorgan donor could now regrow hundreds of organs for other human beings . . . andin rats, the entire process only took twelve days.Another Russian scientist named Budakovski proved that we may not even need thedonor organs at all. Budakovski started out by taking a holographic image of ahealthy raspberry plant with a red laser. He then shined the hologram into araspberry tumor, known as a “callus.” Normally we consider tumors to be uselesstissue that we should surgically remove and throw away—but the holographic lightcompletely transformed the tumor back into a healthy raspberry plant.37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en372] This proves that once you have theenergy signature you need—the information—you will get results. No living tissueis required to supply the original code—you just need the code itself, which canmanifest in coherent light. In this case, the holographic image captured thewave information that told the tissue in the tumor how to regrow into a healthyplant.One of the single most significant and revealing breakthroughs was discovered byDr. A. B. Burlakov, another Russian scientist. Remember Popp’s discovery thatfleas, fish and other organisms are all absorbing light from each other?Burlakov put growing fish eggs next to each other, so light could pass betweenthem—even though they were hermetically sealed. Here’s the amazing part: if heput older, more mature eggs in front of younger eggs that were just gettingstarted, the older eggs apparently sucked the life force out of the youngereggs. The older eggs grew stronger and faster, and the younger eggs withered,experienced deformities, and had significantly higher death rates. Burlakovnoticed that mother fish were careful to never lay their eggs next to other fisheggs, and this seemed to explain why. On the other hand, if Burlakov put aslightly younger egg next to a slightly older egg, the younger egg would absorblife-giving energy from the older egg. Its growth and development would actuallyspeed up until it was at the same level as the others.38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en373]I spent years trying to find a scientific study featuring data like whatBurlakov discovered, because so many other breakthroughs seemed to be leading usin this direction. Everyone has experienced being around people who are anenergy drain, and some even call them psychic energy vampires—though that is anawfully harsh and disrespectful term.It is easy to overreact once you are equipped with this knowledge, and accuseothers of stealing your energy. However, this doesn’t necessarily serve you wellin the spiritual sense, because it reinforces the idea that your energy is afinite thing that can be taken from you. I believe the truth is that there islimitless energy in the Source Field—and if you do start to feel drained, youcan replenish yourself by moving into a state of coherence. The loving space,coming from the heart, keeping your mind quiet and peaceful, all appear toactively rejuvenate your batteries in a very short time. A handy visualizationthat works for me is to think of our energetic duplicate, or aura, as beingsimilar to a balloon filled with water. The size of the balloon can increase anddecrease depending upon how much energy you have stored within you. We cannotdirectly measure the size or shape of this balloon with any instrumentscurrently available, but with Burlakov’s fish-egg study, we see the negativeside of all this—where the strong can absorb Source Field energy directly out ofthe weak.This may also be happening in pack animals that cluster around an alpha male forstrength, guidance and protection. Popp found out that when we are under stress,we release a great deal of the light that is stored within our DNA. Some of itappears to be going to heal our cells, but perhaps that’s not all it does. InBackster’s experiments, the stress and death of living organisms sent out awide-ranging signal that was available to plants, bacteria, eggs and otherlife-forms in the area. Nature may therefore have a built-in system where theherd automatically releases their energy when they are feeling stress and fear.Then, by looking up to their leader, their alpha male, they send their energydirectly to him—just like in Dr. Glen Rein’s study where the DNA samples did notget energized unless we wanted them to be. It could very well be that this is anatural survival mechanism where the herd sends their collective, combinedSource Field energy to their leader, so he will be stronger, faster and moreeffective in battle to protect them. This may also explain why sports teams seemto consistently perform better in their home stadium rather than in theircompetitors’ arenas. Granted, some of it is obviously caused by the fact thatthey know their own playing field better, and they are inspired by the sound ofthe crowd—but there may also be an energetic component as well that we justhaven’t acknowledged yet.With Burlakov’s discovery, we have solid evidence that this exchanging of energyis going on all the time. It is also interesting that healing effects occurredwhere the stronger eggs helped the weaker eggs—if they were fairly close intheir level of development. It seems that if a mother fish lays some eggs, andsome of them have minor birth defects that slightly slow down their rate ofgrowth, Nature has a corrective mechanism that uses the energy from the othereggs to bring them up to speed. However, if the egg is significantly lessdeveloped than its neighbors, perhaps it’s considered to be too far gone—andit’s own life force is then absorbed for the benefit of the older, strongereggs. Since Burlakov was also aware of Gurwitsch’s work, he tried putting apiece of glass between the two sets of eggs—and once again, by shielding offinfrared and ultraviolet light, the effect completely stopped. As expected, itworked perfectly if he used a piece of quartz instead.39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en374] Burlakov also found that by usingdifferent wavelengths of light and polarizing lenses, he could create freakabnormalities—such as multiple heads and multiple hearts. If he thenreintroduced the normal wavelengths, these abnormalities disappeared—and thefish larvae would revert back to their usual pattern, showing no signs of everhaving been mutants.40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en375] This createssignificant trouble for the Darwinian model of evolution, which is all based onmutation—but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.According to Russian researcher Dr. Alex Kaivarainen, both bacteria and insectshave been observed to experience remarkable healings by simply being close toother members of their own species who were healthy. Parsons and Heal poisonedbacteria with antibiotics in 2002, and found that they recovered if they werenear other bacteria that were healthy. Agadjanian got the same results in 2003with insects.41 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en376] It certainly pays tohave healthy friends. Think about how people who are dying tend to reach outwith both hands to touch someone who comes up to speak with them. It may verywell be that a two-handed touch enhances the absorption of the Source Field.Is it possible that human beings can send energy to bacteria, plants, animalsand other humans, and help improve their health in some way? This is exactlywhat Dr. Daniel Benor discovered after analyzing a total of 191 differentcontrolled studies of spiritual healing. Amazingly, 64 percent of these studiesshowed statistically significant effects—including studies where the healingwork was performed over substantial distances. 42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en377] Let’s not forget that 36 percent ofthe studies did not appear to show any healing effect—so what you usually see inthe mainstream media is an article that discusses one of the experiments thatfailed, and then concludes that we have “scientific proof” these effects do notand cannot work. This is simply not the case.Alexandra David-Neel visited Tibet in the 1920s, and wrote up her stunningobservations in the 1931 classic With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet. Among manyfascinating things she witnessed firsthand, some of which we will discuss later,the Tibetan monks explained to her that all of their mystical abilities camefrom being able to harness waves of energy—through meditation.The secret of the psychic training . . . consists in developing a power ofconcentration of mind greatly surpassing even that of men who are, by nature,the most gifted in this respect. Mystic masters affirm that by the means of suchconcentration of mind, waves of energy are produced which can be used indifferent ways. . . . That energy, they believe, is produced every time that aphysical or mental action takes place.43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en378]So, as we make our own thoughts more coherent, we may increase our ability toaccess the Source Field—and determine how and where it flows. This is a veryimportant point, as it helps explain why so many ancient spiritual traditionsplace significant importance upon meditation. Let’s again go back to our seventhousand people meditating, and reducing all terrorism in the world by 72percent. It appears they are doing this by creating coherence in the SourceField. This in turn affects everyone else’s minds directly, since we all shareconsciousness with each other in a measurable sense—and this is truly afascinating new way of looking at ourselves and the world.In Kaznacheyev’s stunning discovery, healthy cells picked up the genetic code ofa virus from diseased cells—through nothing more than the information structureof disease that he transmitted into them. This strongly suggests that DNA is notfixed in one configuration, but the code can actually be transformed from onelife-form to another on a strictly energetic basis. This fascinating discoveryopens the door to a whole new investigation of one of the greatest scientificmysteries of all: the evolution of species. Is this truly a random process, asmost Darwinian scientists insist, or is something else going on? Believe me, I’mdefinitely not a creationist who thinks every word of the Bible is literallytrue, and that nothing on earth is over seven thousand years old. Nonetheless,it is ridiculous for the mainstream media to polarize the discussion between“science” on the one hand—a model that is more than one hundred years old, andfraught with problems we will soon explore—and “religion” on the other. Theevidence we’ve already looked at suggests that the codes for life may exist inthe Source Field itself. This information then flows into our own realitythrough ultraviolet light—not unlike how visual information may be flowing intothe pineal gland through a stargate-like silver cord tethered to our energeticduplicate body. In the next chapter, we will explore new data on speciesevolution and find out if we have any proof of these radical new ideas."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENEnergetically Driven EvolutionThe Great Pyramid appears to be one of many ways that our ancient ancestors gaveus a prophecy of a coming Golden Age, which reaches a key turning point in andaround the year 2012. The pyramid structure itself appears to be part of themessage. When Russian scientists built pyramids out of PVC pipe and fiberglass,with no metal, they found a variety of remarkable effects. The scope of thesediscoveries is stunning—and it forces us to completely reexamine everything wethink we know about science and physics. Cancer, rather than being somemysterious and awful problem, can now be traced back to a loss of coherence inthe light we store in our bodies—as all carcinogens end up scrambling light at a380-nanometer frequency. Within the pyramid, cancer-causing chemicals quicklybecome nontoxic—as if their molecular structure were rearranged in a way thatsupports life, rather than damaging it. Similarly, any geological andmeteorological problems that threaten human life are remarkably reduced simplyby building pyramids.Once we begin looking for pyramid power–type effects on a scientific level,within biological systems, we find fantastic new discoveries. This includes thefact that we do appear to have the power to heal others with nothing more thanour own thoughts, perhaps by visiting them directly with our energetic duplicatebody and releasing photons containing healing codes—and ancient cultures wereapparently well aware of this. We also found out that the DNA molecule leavesbehind a phantom that absorbs light from its environment, almost like aminiature black hole, and holds it in place for up to thirty days—even once themolecule itself is taken away. This raises a very important question: Which camefirst—the DNA or the phantom? Is it possible that the phantom actually comesfirst?Gariaev already proved that the DNA Phantom can absorb photons of light, andhold them in place. Could the DNA Phantom be strong enough to do the same thingwith atoms and molecules? We do have some interesting clues. In 2008, Dr. SergeyLeikin put various types of DNA in ordinary salt water—with no proteins ormaterial that could help them communicate with each other. Each type of DNA wastagged with a different fluorescent compound. Surprisingly, the DNA moleculesthat were identical to each other were then mysteriously drawntogether—displaying a “telepathy-like quality.” Specifically, matching DNAmolecules were roughly twice as likely to gather together than molecules withdifferent genetic sequences. Leikin believes this is merely caused by electricalcharges, but the important point is that it works.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en379] Further experiments may well provethat the Source Field is doing this—and assembles DNA out of tiny atoms andmolecules that have not yet formed even basic amino acids.In 2007, a team of scientists from Russia, Germany and Australia, led by Dr. V.N. Tsytovich, discovered that ordinary dust arranged into DNA-like structureswhen suspended in a plasma of charged particles—similar to the conditions wefind in outer space. A computer model was built to reproduce this environment,and no order or structure was expected—but the dust naturally formed intocorkscrew-shaped helical structures. These DNA-like structures were attracted toeach other. They would divide and form two equal copies of the original, similarto the process of reproduction. They would change the structure of theirneighbors simply by being nearby them. They also evolved into increasinglycomplex structures as the simulation continued. According to Tsytovich, “Thesecomplex, self-organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary propertiesto qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter . . . they areautonomous, they reproduce and they evolve.”2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en380] Furthermore, in 2006, UCLA professorof astronomy Dr. Mark Morris announced the stunning discovery of a DNA-shapeddouble helix nebula near the center of our galaxy: “We see two intertwiningstrands wrapped around each other as in a DNA molecule. . . . Nobody has everseen anything like that before in the cosmic realm. . . . What we see indicatesa high degree of order.”3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en381]023 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_023_r1.jpg]NASA image of a nebula near the center of the Milky Way galaxy that is curiouslysimilar to a DNA molecule in shape—first noticed by Dr. Mark Morris.Just as this book was in final edits, in January 2011, a Nobel Prize–winningbiologist announced that he had transferred a piece of bacterial DNA into asealed test tube with nothing more than water inside. The water in the test tuberearranged into an exact duplicate of the DNA, which was floating in anothersealed test tube next to it. In order for this to work, the original DNA sampleneeded to be greatly diluted, and a weak electromagnetic field of seven hertzhad to be applied. After eighteen hours, some of the water molecules in thesealed tube transformed into perfect DNA molecules. John Dunn wrote about theimplications of Dr. Luc Montagnier’s discovery in Techworld.com[http://Techworld.com].What does all of this mean? It could be that the propagation of life is able tomake use of the quantum nature of reality to project itself in subtle ways, ashas been hinted at in previous experiments. Alternatively, it could be that lifeitself is a complex projection of these quantum phenomena and utterly depends onthem in ways not yet understood because they are incredibly hard to detect. . .. Water might be a good medium in which DNA can copy itself using processes thathint at quantum entanglement and “teleportation” (our term).4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en382]DNA may well be created by a quantum template that we can’t even see or measuredirectly, but exists as a structure in the Source Field—and is written into thebasic laws that govern matter and energy. Could this energetic structure gatherphotons, atoms and molecules together—to spiral life as we know it intoexistence? The answers may very well be staring us in the face, as Montagnierjust discovered—but most scientists do not want to go there. Ever since theReformation, there has been an unspoken deal between scientists and theChurch—“You deal with the spirit and we’ll deal with the facts, which of courseis that life is an accident, and there is no higher purpose or intelligence tothe Universe.” Nonetheless, this is as much of a blind, religious belief asanything else. I personally believe in evidence. So let’s see what we can find.THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON EARTHNo matter where we look on earth, we find bacteria. As reported in ScientificAmerican, a wide variety of microorganisms were found in core samples taken from500 meters below the Savannah River. Even at core samples from 1.7 miles belowthe earth’s surface (2.8 kilometers), living bacteria are still being found. Innormal topsoil you can find over one billion bacteria in a single gram of dirt,but even in rock samples from 400 meters down into the earth’s crust, you canfind anywhere between one hundred and ten million bacteria. Over nine thousanddifferent types of microorganisms have been found in these subsurface areas, andsome of them were found in temperatures as high as 167 degrees Fahrenheit (75degrees C).5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en383]You may also think that Darwinian evolution is scientific, but considerthis—once you’ve got microbes, the vast majority of all the magic that needs tohappen in order to create life has already taken place. You have DNA, proteinsynthesis, respiration, movement, awareness—as well as all the magicalphoton-capturing properties we’ve been exploring here. Our earth is only fourbillion years old, and it very likely started out as a molten rock. Thingsdidn’t cool down enough for oceans to form until 3.8 billion years ago, but evenat this time, rock samples have been found that contain all the basic isotopesplants create from photosynthesis. 6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en384]Even better, a primitive, yeastlike organism has also been found in 3.8billion-year-old rocks.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en385] That meansthat as soon as the earth had water, life essentially appeared instantaneously.Once we reach 3.5 billion years ago, we find many more fossilized microbes inrocks that were not melted by volcanic activity. According to Dr. JohnjoeMcFadden, “The world is just not big enough to evolve life if it relied entirelyon chance. . . . These fossil microbes look like organisms alive today, and arelikely to have been just as complex. Life may be improbable, but it was quick.”8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en386] Just to prove how ridiculous theodds really are, an MIT biologist calculated how likely it is that even oneprotein with a hundred amino acids could form by random mutation—and it came outto one chance out of a number with sixty-five zeroes.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en387]A 2008 article in Wired magazine revealed new discoveries that bacteria can livein the earth’s most inhospitable areas—including the smoldering heat insidevolcanoes and nuclear reactors, and the freezing cold temperatures deep withinthe Antarctic ice. In fact, Antarctic bacteria were able to be thawed out andbrought back to life after ten million years. The article also says thatmicrobes can survive the shock of being launched into space, and amino acids—theprecursors to all biological life—have been found in the dust from comet81P/Wild 2.10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en388] Another recent studyfrom the Imperial College of London found uracil and xanthine, the precursors toDNA, in fragments from a meteorite that crashed in Australia in 1969.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en389] In January 2011, the GeologicalSociety of America announced that living bacteria were found floating in fluidthat was trapped inside salt crystals for 34,000 years. They were shrunken andsmall, and appeared to be in a hibernation-type state. It took them about twoand a half months to wake up and begin reproducing normally. “We’re not surewhat’s going on,” Professor Tim Lowenstein said. “They need to be able to repairDNA, because DNA degrades with time.”12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en390]An even more stunning discovery was made by British astronomers Sir Fred Hoyleand Dr. Nalin Chandra Wickramasinghe, who explored the composition of galacticdust in the 1960s. More and more, the evidence suggested that the vast majorityof dust throughout the entire galaxy—some 99.9 percent13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en391]—is actually freeze-dried bacteria.This discovery began when Hoyle and Wickramasinghe studied the infrared lightfrom the dust in our galaxy, and concluded that these dust grains had to be 70percent hollow on the inside. Bacteria have a hard outer cell wall and a softerinterior. They were stunned when they found out that freeze-dried bacteria arealso 70 percent hollow on the inside. By simply assuming that galactic dustgrains were freeze-dried bacteria, they found a perfect fit to theirobservations.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en392]This led them to an utterly stunning conclusion: “Interstellar grains mustsurely be bacteria—albeit freeze-dried, perhaps mostly dead. At the very leastthis was a hypothesis that had to be explored.” In a lecture from April 15,1980, Hoyle spelled it all out.Microbiology may be said to have had its beginnings in the nineteen forties. Anew world of the most astonishing complexity began then to be revealed. Inretrospect I find it remarkable that microbiologists did not at once recognizethat the world into which they had penetrated had of necessity to be of a cosmicorder. I suspect that the cosmic quality of microbiology will seem as obvious tofuture generations as the Sun being the centre of our solar system seems obviousto the present generation.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en393]Some thirty years later, as I write this book, that predicted change inscientific thought has obviously still not arrived. Most scientists who evenbother to write about interstellar bacteria still try to stick with thecomfortable idea that they evolved by Darwinian mutation, freeze-dried in space,and then crashed to earth where they then seeded all life. It’s a much greaterstep to realize that bacteria are everywhere, because that’s what the Universedoes—create life. If this is true, then how could we possibly have missed such astunning discovery in the history of science?In his noteworthy book Sparks of Life, Harvard professor James Strick revealedthat there was an extensive conspiracy in the 1800s to suppress any scientificdiscoveries of microbes that appeared spontaneously, from nonliving material,rather than through allegedly “random Darwinian mutation.”16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en394] Dr. Strick clarified his position ata 2003 conference held by the Wilhelm Reich institute, and it was written up andpublished online by Jack Flannel.17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en395]In the 1800s, the French Academy of Sciences offered prize money to anyscientist who could conclusively prove that life was either spontaneous orrandom—and Louis Pasteur won the contest. When you see a carton of milk thatsays it is pasteurized, this means it was cooked to kill all the bacteria—andthis process was named after Louis Pasteur. The problem is that Pasteur’scompetitors did get life-forms to grow out of nonliving environments—such as byusing preparations of hay that had been totally sterilized in water. Pasteursimply refused to repeat these experiments. It’s even more disappointing thatPasteur found life that spontaneously appeared in a small percentage of his ownexperiments, but he never even wrote about them—because he felt they had to bemistakes, and were not worth mentioning.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en396]The biogenesis side of the debate had evidence to support its conclusions goingall the way back to 1837, with the little-known work of Andrew Crosse. At thetime, electricity was a new and exciting phenomenon. Crosse wanted to try togrow crystals artificially, by zapping chemicals with a weak electrical current.Specifically, he mixed up a silicate of potash and hydrochloric acid, and thendropped a fist-size chunk of iron oxide rock into it. He then zapped the acidbath with a small battery, and hoped to find artificial silica crystals growingon the rock. Instead, he got something much, much weirder. After fourteen days,whitish specks started forming in the center of the electrified stone. Four dayslater, each speck was twice as large, and had six or eight tiny strands growingout from it. Each strand was longer than the speck itself.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en397]Crosse reported what happened next in a paper he wrote for the London ElectricalSociety in 1837.On the 26th day of the experiment, the objects assumed the form of perfectinsects, standing erect on the bristles which they were growing. Although Iregarded this as most unusual, I attached no singular significance to it untiltwo days later, the 28th day of the experiment, when the magnifying lens showedthat these things were moving their legs. I must say now that I was quiteastonished. After a few more days, they detached themselves from the stone andmoved about through the caustic acid solution. In the course of a few weeks,more than a hundred of them made their appearance on the oxide of iron.20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en398]The creatures appeared to be similar to the genus Acari, which is a form ofmite: “Under a microscope I examined them, and found that the smaller ones hadsix legs, the larger ones had eight. Others who have examined them pronouncedthem to be of the genus acari, but some say they are an entirely new species.”Crosse knew he would be attacked by his colleagues, so he carefully repeated theexperiment by sterilizing all the ingredients with heat in a closed containerbefore he ever started it—but the little critters still appeared the same way.Other scientists repeated Crosse’s experiment and got the same results, butaccording to the 1959 article by Frank Edwards that we pulled the above quotesfrom, they were too afraid to speak out about it.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en399] This finally changed when thelegendary Michael Faraday reported to the Royal Institution that he, too, hadgotten these small creatures to grow under the same conditions.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en400] He was not sure whether they wereactually created spontaneously in the sterile solutions, or brought back to lifeby the electricity—but either result is a total challenge to mainstream scienceand biology as we now know it.Another early pioneer we briefly mentioned in chapter 1 is Wilhelm Reich. Hisresearch into orgone energy, as he called it, was dismissed as a joke.Nonetheless, given everything we’ve been uncovering in this investigation, heappears to have been on the right track. Reich concluded that orgone fills allspace in the Universe, does not have mass, penetrates matter, has a pulsatingmovement that can be measured, has a strong attraction to water, and isaccumulated naturally in organisms by eating, breathing and taking it in throughthe skin. So far this all sounds very familiar. Reich created accumulators thatconcentrated this orgone energy, and found they remarkably increased the speedthat wounds and burns would heal in laboratory mice. These treatments alsodecreased shock. Seeds grew into substantially larger and healthier plants whenzapped by Reich’s orgone accumulator.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en401]Reich also found evidence of spontaneous generation in sterile environments. Hesaw what he felt to be bluish points of light under the microscope, whichappeared before the life-forms themselves were created—and he called thesebursts of light “bions.” This theory was widely ridiculed, and is still attackedby skeptics on the Internet today—criticizing Reich’s protocols asscientifically unsound.24 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en402]Nonetheless, Professor Ignacio Pacheco successfully replicated Reich’s resultsin 2000—and the photographs of what grew in his test tube are quite stunning. 25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en403] Pacheco heated ordinary sand from anonpolluted beach to white-hot levels—namely, 1400˚ C. This destroys all knownforms of biological life, other than the extremophile bacteria we spoke aboutearlier that appear in volcanoes and nuclear reactors. The sand was then cooledoff in a sterile environment, poured into a sterile test tube with distilledwater in it, and capped off. Each tube was then sterilized in an autoclave, twotimes in a row, with twenty-four hours between each sterilization. This processis used to destroy all known spores and vegetative cells. Pacheco then studiedthe particles floating at the top of the water under a microscope after eachtwenty-four-hour period following sterilization—and that’s where the magichappened.Amazingly, a variety of different structures appeared in the water that lookedlike complex living organisms—capable of growth and division. They were activelymoving around in the solution, and Pacheco videotaped the results. AlthoughPacheco has not yet identified whether these structures have DNA in them, hefeels “these bions can be considered living structures in almost every sense.”Some of them look like simple microorganisms, but others were much more complex.This included microscopic sea vegetables similar to Gorgonia. Some of Pacheco’smost compelling photographs are of single leaves that broke off from theseplants when they were put on the microscopic slide. He also found soft-lookingblobs which then started to grow a bright white spiraling shell of calciumaround themselves—showing what appears to be the formation of an ordinary oceanshellfish at a very tiny level.024 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_024_r1.gif]Dr. Ignacio Pacheco’s photograph of a microscopic leaf-shaped object that formedin a sterile solution containing nothing but beach sand and distilled water.The beginning spiral of the outer shell can be clearly seen, and it matches whatwe would expect to see perfectly—even though the soft inner body is stillpartially exposed.My favorite photograph, as you can see on the next page, is of what looks like acritter with an obvious head, and a roughly spherical body that is covered withspikes for self-defense. Pacheco believes these are “transitional forms from theinorganic stage of organization to the organic and living condition ofevolution.”26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en404] Interestingly, if hedid not sterilize the beach sand first, none of these little things would grow.It seems that the purity of the molecules was a very important element thatallowed life to form. When we look at these little guys the obvious question isthis: Where did their DNA come from?025 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_025_r1.gif]Pacheco’s photograph of what appears to be a shellfish beginning to form in asterile solution containing only beach sand and distilled water.The same question needs to be asked for all the bacteria we find in the mostinhospitable places on earth—and indeed throughout all the dust in the galaxy.Pasteur may have made off with the prize money in the 1800s to support Darwin’smodel of evolution, but in the process we’ve been robbed of a much greatertruth—that life is indeed a product of intelligent design. You don’t have to bea Bible thumper to see that—all you need is rational thinking in the face of allthe evidence.THE DARWIN PROBLEMNow let’s talk about evolution. Although the official view is that Darwinianevolution is a proven fact, many scholars have concluded that it is simplyimpossible—and these are not creationists, but grounded scientific researcherswith professional credentials. For example, Professor Louis Bonoure, Director ofResearch at the French National Center of Scientific Research, said,“Evolutionism is a fairy tale for grown-ups. This theory has helped nothing inthe progress of science. It is useless.”27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en405] Wolfgang Smith, a mathematicsprofessor from MIT and Oregon State University, made his position very clear.026 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_026_r1.gif]Pacheco’s photograph of what appears to be a complex, multicellular organism,with a head and defensive spikes, formed out of a sterile solution of sand andwater.Today . . . the Darwinian theory of evolution stands under attack as neverbefore. . . . A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from theevolutionist camp. . . . For the most part, these “experts” have abandonedDarwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but onstrictly scientific grounds.28 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en406]Niles Eldredge, a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History,discussed the speed with which complex life suddenly appeared on earth.Beginning about six hundred million years ago . . . all over the world, atroughly the same time, thick sequences of rocks, barren of any easily detectedfossils, are overlain by sediments containing a gorgeous array of shellyinvertebrates: trilobites, brachiopods, mollusks. . . . Creationists have mademuch of this sudden development of a rich and varied fossil record where, justbefore, there was none. . . . [This] does pose a fascinating intellectualchallenge.29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en407]J. R. Norman, a zoologist from the British Museum of Natural History, said in1975 that “the geological record has so far provided no evidence as to theorigin of the fishes.”30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en408] In 1960, W.E. Swinton, also from the British Museum of Natural History, said, “The[evolutionary] origin of birds is largely a matter of deduction. There is nofossil evidence of the stages through which the remarkable change from reptileto bird was achieved.”31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en409] ProfessorDerek Ager, from the Imperial College of London’s Department of Geology, wrotein 1976 that “it must be significant that nearly all the evolutionary stories Ilearned as a student . . . have now been ‘debunked.’ ”32[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en410]The Darwinian crowd has naturally fought vigorously against this opposition,claiming there have been new advances—but in light of all the evidence we’vebeen presenting, along with many other data points, the theory simply doesn’thold up very well. The fossil record consistently shows us one type of creature,which then upgrades into a new, improved, more evolved version over a very shortperiod of time, geologically speaking. There are very few transitional fossilsthat could support Darwin’s original theory. We don’t see any examples of fishwhere the skeleton is half in and half out of the body—we have shellfish andbony fishes, with nothing in between. And that’s just one of many curiousexamples. Even in the case of human evolution, there are significant andunsolvable problems. If you remember hearing about the search for a so-calledmissing link, a transitional species that can explain how human brain sizesuddenly doubled in a short time, bear in mind that it still hasn’t been found.According to Lord Solly Zuckerman, Chief Scientific Advisor to the UnitedKingdom and a professor of anatomy at the University of Birmingham, “If manevolved from an apelike creature, he did so without leaving a trace of thatevolution in the fossil record.”33 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en411]If it’s not Darwinian “random mutation” causing these changes to occur, thenwhat is it? Two University of Chicago paleontologists, David Raup and JamesSepkoski, may have found the answer. Together, they carefully assembled thelargest collection of marine fossils ever accomplished—comprising an incredible3,600 genera of ocean life. In 1982, they first published an article in thejournal Science describing four mass extinctions they’d found in the fossilrecord, as well as a fifth one that was less significant.34[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en412] As they continued to process thisdata, they faced a perplexing problem—patterns were increasingly appearing inthe fossil record that shouldn’t be there. Yet, the more research they did, andthe harder they tried to get rid of it with the facts, the stronger the patternbecame. In 1984, two years after they released their initial paper, they cameclean—publishing their astonishing results, which still haven’t had the effecton the scientific community that they should have. In short, new species werespontaneously appearing in short bursts in the fossil record—in a repeatingcycle of approximately 26 million years.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en413] This pattern extended back some 250million years—out of a total of 542 million years of fossils they cataloged.The story became even more interesting in 2005, when Dr. Richard A. Muller, aphysics professor at University of California, Berkeley, and his graduatestudent Robert Rohde discovered another cycle of evolution in Raup’s andSepkoski’s data. This time, it went all the way back to the beginning of themarine fossil record—some 542 million years ago. Muller and Rohde found thatevery 62 million years, more or less, all life on earth went through arelatively spontaneous upgrade—transforming the existing species into newer,more evolved forms.36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en414] In a NationalGeographic article that same year, Muller said, “I wish I knew what it all meant. . . I’m betting it will be astronomy, and he’s betting it will be somethinginside of the earth.”37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en415]In a Daily Galaxy article originally from 2009, Muller seemed to be closer towinning the bet. As it turns out, astronomers have discovered that our solarsystem travels in a long, see-sawing wavelike motion, continually moving aboveand below the galactic plane as it goes along. One complete cycle of up-and-downmovement takes approximately 64 million years—suspiciously close to the62-million-year cycle discovered by Muller and Rohde. Obviously, such long-rangeastronomical calculations could be slightly incorrect, and the real figure forthe galactic see-saw could actually be 62 million years. University of Kansasprofessors Adrian Mellott and Mikhail Medvedev believe this galactic cycle isthe answer to the puzzle. The top half of our galaxy faces the Virgo cluster aswe shoot through space, and Mellott and Medvedev believe this area should havean increased number of charged particles and cosmic rays—just like we see at thefront end of our solar system from galactic dust. Their theory is that everytime we rise out of the magnetic fields of the galactic plane and move into thenorthern area, we get a boost in cosmicray exposure. This radiation could thenlead to more genetic mutations, and possibly create new species.38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en416]That’s certainly one possible explanation—but now that we are armed with ourbreakthrough research into the Source Field, there may well be other answersthat move us even closer. This galactic see-saw theory also doesn’t account forthe roughly 26-million-year cycle that was originally discovered by Raup andSepkoski. Something else has to be going on here. It does seem very likely thatgalactic energy fields will be responsible—and in Part Two, I’ll present a newmodel that neatly explains everything, and gives us a solid, scientific way tomap out these changes.027 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_027_r1.gif]Adapted from Raup and Sepkoski, Rohde and Muller graphs by David Wilcock.We’ve already seen how living bacteria and other species, complete with theirDNA, could spontaneously emerge from seemingly nonliving matter. If DNA can be“created out of nowhere,” and both Popp and Gariaev’s research proves that DNAstores and releases light, then why couldn’t DNA actually be reprogrammed andrewritten with the right light frequencies? Let’s not forget that when Gariaevzapped a poisoned rat with the wave information from a healthy pancreas, itsdevastated pancreas regenerated in only twelve days. Budakovski found that thehologram of a healthy raspberry plant was all he needed to transform seeminglydead tumor tissue back into a perfectly normal new plant. What we’re seeing isthat coherent ultraviolet light can carry complex code that directly affects thestructure and behavior of DNA—transforming diseased tissue back into fullhealth. Are there any clues that the source code of DNA could indeed be like ajigsaw puzzle that has more than one correct solution, when given the rightinformation? Surprisingly, the answer is yes.DNA IS A WAVE STRUCTURE THAT CAN BE REARRANGEDMany spiritually oriented people feel a great affinity with dolphins—and thereappears to be much more to that story than most of us ever imagined. In 2000,NOAA scientist Dr. David Busbee discovered something truly astonishing.It became very obvious to us that every human chromosome had a corollarychromosome in the dolphin. . . . We’ve found that the dolphin genome and thehuman genome basically are the same. It’s just that there’s a few chromosomalrearrangements that have changed the way the genetic material is put together.39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en417]This is quite amazing, as humans and dolphins certainly do not look alike. Then,in 2004, the BBC News published the work of Dr. David Haussler from theUniversity of California, Santa Cruz, and his team. When Haussler’s teamcompared the DNA codes of human beings, rats and mice, “they found—to theirastonishment—that several great stretches of DNA were identical across the threespecies.” Chickens, dogs and even fish also had almost identical DNA codes tohuman beings as well—although sea squirt and fruit flies were less similar. Dr.Haussler said, “It absolutely knocked me off my chair. . . . It’sextraordinarily exciting to think that there are these . . . elements thatweren’t noticed by the scientific community before.”40[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en418]If the DNA of humans, dolphins, rats, mice, chickens, dogs and fish are all sosimilar, and the DNA molecule can absorb and release coherent light, then we gettantalizingly close to the idea that all DNA is ultimately the product of asingle wave, which undergoes relatively minor modifications to produce differentspecies.If this is true, then could we change the wave by feeding it new information—andactually rearrange one species into another, directly at the DNA level? Indeed,if we think back to Dr. Alexander Golod’s pyramid on Seliger Lake, this appearsto have already happened. A variety of seemingly extinct plants began growing inthe land surrounding the pyramid. Do we have any other evidence that couldverify such a fascinating effect? The answer arrived in 1989, when a majorchemical company known as Ciba-Geigy patented a process that allowed them tocultivate new and original forms of plants and animals. The process isdeceptively simple—they place seeds between two metal plates, and run a weak DCcurrent through them for three days as they germinate. When they zapped anordinary fern seed using this process, they were astonished to find that ittransformed into a formerly extinct species that had only ever been found infossils from coal deposits. The “extinct” fern had forty-one chromosomes ratherthan the expected thirty-six. Furthermore, within four years, the originalplants mutated into a wide variety of different strains of fern—some of whichnormally only grew in South Africa.41[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en419]When Ciba-Geigy tried the same technique with wheat, they were able to revert itback to a much older and stronger variety—from a time before it had been heavilyover-bred. This wheat could be fully harvested after only four to eightweeks—and the norm is seven months. This, of course, has marvelous implicationsfor impoverished areas where people suffer from starvation. When they tried itwith tulips, they found thorns appearing on their stems—and this appeared to bean original trait that gardeners had long since bred away. The effect didn’tjust work on plant seeds either. When they tried the same experiments with trouteggs, they found that a much stronger and more disease-resistant trout wasformed. Best of all, they tried out the process on 200-million-year-old sporesthat had been found in a salt deposit 140 meters deep in the ground. Even thoughnothing else had been able to revive these spores, simply zapping them with theelectrostatic field brought them back to life—as if the 200 million years didn’teven matter.42 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en420]Unfortunately, this was a chemical company—and a large part of their businessdepends on agricultural plants being weak and vulnerable, so they requirechemical fertilizers. Once Ciba-Geigy realized that these plants could put themout of business, they quickly stopped pursuing this new technique. Thankfully,the original papers survived—so this information was not lost.43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en421]Another weird discovery emerged in National Geographic News from 2009.Scientists from the University of Rennes in France drowned 120 differentspiders, from three different species, in water. They probed the spiders everytwo hours until they appeared to be completely dead, which took twenty-fourhours for the forest species and either twenty-eight or thirty-six hours for thetwo marsh species. Once the spiders had apparently died, the scientists leftthem out to dry, so they could be weighed. Amazingly, the spiders’ legs begantwitching and they came back to life—with the longest time interval being twohours for the marsh species that took thirty-six hours to die. Of course, thescientists assume this is the result of a coma rather than actual death, but itraises fascinating questions.44 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en422] Lifemay be far more resilient than we normally give it credit for. Just like we sawin the 34,000-year-old bacteria that reanimated after two and a half months, orin Gariaev’s dead seeds from Chernobyl, if you have genetic material that isalready fairly close to being alive—even if it is technically dead—a littlejump-start may be all you need to reanimate it. This is obviously a much easierand faster process for the Source Field to use, rather than creating life out ofotherwise inanimate molecules.LIFE-FORMS THAT REWRITE THEIR OWN GENETIC CODEIf we want to understand this new concept of evolution even further, we must beaware that some species can rearrange their own DNA without the use of anyoutside electrostatic fields—such as we saw in the Ciba-Geigy experiments. As ofApril 2009, a Rockefeller University study revealed that a parasite known asTrypanosoma brucei, which creates African sleeping sickness, is able tospontaneously rearrange its own DNA so it cannot be defeated by the body’simmune system. Amazingly, the parasite is able to dice up and rearrange bothstrands of its DNA, changing its outer coat so it can continue to avoid beingdetected. Though the scientists involved in this study suspected the parasitewas doing this as early as 2007, they didn’t find the proof until 2009.According to their press release, adapted for Science Daily, this “suggested acommon mechanism by which parasites and humans rearrange their DNA. “It wasunbelievable,” Dr. Oliver Dreesen says. “One experiment after another and itjust worked.”45 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en423]These scientists were apparently unaware of a similar effect that was discoveredby Dr. Robert Pruitt, a geneticist with Purdue University, in 2005. Pruitt andhis associates were studying a mustardlike plant called Arabidopsis, which iscommonly used in laboratory experiments. Specifically, they were exploring amutation in one of the genes that made the flowers clump together in an odd,misshapen way. What they found was that even when the plants inherited thismutation from both of their parents, over a three-year period of study, fully 10percent of them reverted back to normal. They rewrote their own DNA, and fixedthe mutation. The startled scientists examined the plants’ DNA and confirmedthat it had been transformed back into its original, healthy form.46[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en424] This is a spontaneous DNA rewrite tofix a mutation—and it deals another critical blow to the Darwinian model. If DNAhas an underlying wave component that can correct mutations, Darwin may havejust lost his job. According to Dr. Elliott Meyerowitz, a plant geneticist fromthe California Institute of Technology, Pruitt’s finding “looks like a marvelousdiscovery.”47 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en425] I also like this studybecause it proves that no giant industrial company can ever create true“terminator seeds” that will always destroy themselves after a singlegeneration. Nature always finds a way to repair the damage.Another example of “marvelous” genetic repairs comes from Francis Hitching’s1982 book The Neck of the Giraffe—Where Darwin Went Wrong. Hitching reported onhis experiments with the fruit fly, technically known as Drosophila, which isone of the most common living organisms studied in biology experiments. Eventhough various scientists have used radiation to try to dramatically speed upthe rate of mutation, “Fruit flies refuse to become anything but fruit fliesunder any circumstances yet devised.”48[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en426] Even more interestingly, whenHitching took away all the genetic codes from both sets of parents that wouldbuild eyes for the fruit fly, they nonetheless regrew their eyes—in roughly fivegenerations. According to Hitching, “Somehow the genetic code had a built-inrepair mechanism that reestablished the missing genes.”49[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en427] Of course, that makes us ask a muchdeeper question: What is the “genetic code”?More and more, we are seeing evidence of a guiding intelligence that can somehowmodify the genetic code in ways that will benefit the organism. Are there otherexamples where organisms rewrite their own DNA to adapt to changes in theirenvironment? Dr. John Cairns was one of the first to discover this sort of aneffect in 1988. Cairns studied a type of bacteria that cannot digest lactose,and then put them in an environment where that’s all there was. Of course, thevast majority of the bacteria starved and went into a suspended-animation state.However, after a day or two, several of his bacterial cells spontaneouslyevolved—rewriting their own DNA to digest lactose. And this was not a randomevent—if there wasn’t any lactose in the area, the “adaptive mutation” did nothappen. 50 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en428] Dr. Barry Hall continuedthis work with a study he published in 1990—and he found that if he deprivedbacteria of certain key nutrients, such as the amino acids tryptophan andcysteine, some of their offspring ended up being able to synthesize thesenutrients within their own bodies. 51[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en429] Whatever the bacteria needed tosurvive was provided for them—by the hidden laws of Nature. Hall also suspectsthat this same effect explains how dangerous bacteria are able to adapt to newantibiotics so quickly.52 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en430]In 2008, another study proved that organisms can quickly rearrange their own DNAto help them adapt to the challenges of their environment. Back in 1971,biologists moved five breeding pairs of Italian wall lizards from their barrenisland home in the South Adriatic Sea, where they survived on insects, to aneighboring island that was lush and tropical. Up until this point, thesespecies had never existed on the neighboring island. When the biologistsreturned to the tropical island beginning in 2004, they were shocked to findthat the descendants of these original parents had experienced substantialevolution in a short time.As revealed in a Daily Galaxy article, “Striking differences in head size andshape, increased bite strength and the development of new structures in thelizard’s digestive tracts were noted after only 36 years, which is an extremelyshort time scale,” remarks Duncan Irschick, a professor of biology at theUniversity of Massachusetts–Amherst.”53[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en431] Each of these changes wastailor-made to help the lizards eat plants. Thanks to a very rapid DNA rewrite,their digestive systems developed cecal valves—which were never before seen inthis species. These organs create fermentation that breaks down plant material.Less than one percent of all lizard species in the world have this uniquefeature. Their heads became longer, wider and taller, which gave them asubstantial increase in bite strength—so they could more easily chew throughplant fibers. Interestingly, they also stopped defending their own territory,now that they were eating by browsing rather than hunting. According to Dr.Irschick, “Our data shows that evolution of novel structures [within anorganism] can occur on extremely short time scales.”54[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en432]Another classic study was performed by Rosemary and Peter Grant, who spenttwenty years on an island in the Galapagos, studying and identifying everysingle individual bird there—beginning with four hundred when they firstarrived, and surging to over a thousand during their stay. Throughout thesetwenty years, they continuously observed about twenty generations of finches. Totheir amazement, individual species made genetic changes in remarkably shortperiods of time. The majority of these improvements involved a change in thesize and shape of their beaks. As one example, when the island went through aperiod of extended drought, seeds became tinier and harder to reach—so the birdsevolved longer and sharper beaks to be able to eat them. The Grants also foundthat the birds had actually rewritten their own DNA to produce these changes.According to Jonathan Weiner, author of The Beak of the Finch: A Story ofEvolution in Our Time, “Darwin . . . vastly underestimated the power of naturalselection. Its action is neither rare nor slow. It leads to evolution daily andhourly, all around us, and we can watch.”55[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en433] In 2009, ornithologists announcedanother discovery of rapid evolution in forest birds. Soon after the forestswere cut down, the birds’ wingtips became pointier—but if the forests expanded,their wing tips became more round.56 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en434]In 2009, National Geographic reported that a never-before-seen “monster fish”had been found in the Congo River, which moves through several countries inAfrica. Dr. Melanie Stiassny, a fish biologist at the American Museum of NaturalHistory, said, “What we’re seeing here is kind of evolution on steroids.”57[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en435]When we go out into the oceans, we find that the “immortal jellyfish” cancompletely rewrite its own DNA in the presence of starvation, physical damage orother types of crisis. According to Maria Pia Miglietta, a Pennsylvania StateUniversity researcher, “instead of sure death, [the immortal jellyfish]transforms all of its existing cells into a younger state.” The jellyfishconvert their own tissues and genetic material back to their earliest stage ofgrowth, and “the jellyfish’s cells are often completely transformed in theprocess. Muscle cells can become nerve cells or even sperm or eggs.” Anotherinteresting fact was that every jellyfish of this species they found, worldwide,was genetically identical—even though the tropical jellyfish had only eighttentacles, whereas those in cooler waters could have as many as twenty-four.Drifting ocean currents could not explain how this species ended up appearingidentically in so many different places around the world. Dr. Migliettaspeculated that the jellyfish must be hitching rides on long-distance cargoships.58 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en436]ENERGETIC EVOLUTION AND SPECIES TRANSFORMATIONIn 1997, another seemingly impossible genetic mystery was discovered in theoceans. In this case, Dr. Lingbao Chen and his associates found that fishes inthe Antarctic and several species of northern cods had evolved nearly identicalantifreeze proteins, even though there is abundant evidence from paleontology,paleoclimate research and the species’ own physical appearance that they musthave evolved separately. The conclusion was that these proteins had to haveappeared through what they called convergent evolution, where this seeminglyrandom process of Darwinian mutation is now doing the same exact thing—in twototally isolated environments.59 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en437]I was particularly amazed by a National Geographic news story that appeared onFebruary 15, 2009. The International Census of Marine Life is making a focusedeffort to identify and assess all species in the ocean—past, present andpotential future. In the process of assembling this vast body of data, thescientists found something astonishing—at least 235 different identical specieshave been discovered at the North and South Poles, and they do not existanywhere else on earth. This includes swimming snails, whales, worms andcrustaceans. There is simply no way that all these species could have beentransported from one pole to the other—there are no shipping routes that go thatway, and they could not survive a trip through warmer water. The scientistsadmitted that they were startled by this mystery.60[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en438]In 2002, Richard Pasichnyk released both volumes of The Vital Vastness— and Iwas particularly struck by his discussion of the so-called Lazarus Effect, whichshows how species can spontaneously reappear after millions of years ofextinction.A striking example is the time when virtually no insect fossils can be found formost of the entire Cretaceous period. After the end of the Cretaceous and thedemise of the dinosaur, insect fossils return in full force—along with astriking increase in flowering plants. . . . Are there times when conditionscause genetic material to revert to lost codes?61[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en439]A recently dead rodent with a long, fluffy tail called Laonastes was found forsale in a meat market in Laos. The only problem was that this creature had beenextinct for 11 million years. This was reported in Science journal in 2006.62[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en440] Mary Dawson of the Carnegie Museumof Natural History was quite surprised.It is an amazing discovery. . . . It’s the first time in the study of mammalsthat scientists have found a living fossil of a group that’s thought to beextinct for roughly 11 million years. That’s quite a gap. Previous mammals had agap of only a few thousand to just over a million years.63[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en441]Another example concerns a strange-looking elephant called a gompothere. Itstrunk and tusks point straight forward, and it also has two teeth that stick outfrom its lower jaw. They were believed to have gone extinct some 1.788 millionyears ago, but recently their fossils were found among ruins from early settlersof North America, known as the Clovis people. This was again referred to as theLazarus Effect in action, and the Houston Museum of Natural Science Web sitesaid, “This find has major implications.”64[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en442]I also found an MSNBC article discussing French scientists who found acrustacean from the Glyphea group (genus Neoglyphea) some four hundred metersdown in the Coral Sea, northwest of New Caledonia. Philippe Bouchet, a marinebiologist, described it as “halfway between a shrimp and a mud lobster.” Theproblem, again, is that according to the fossil record, this species has beenextinct for 60 million years.65 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en443] Andin 2005, a UPI press release reported the discovery of a Wollemi pine treewithin a small grove of trees in Australia. This tree can grow up to 120 feethigh and has a three-foot-wide trunk. The problem is that this tree went extinct200 million years ago—in the Jurassic period.66[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en444] Security is so high that even thescientists who are working on the site are blindfolded before they are flown in.Specimens have been taken from this secret location and are being sold byauction to insure the survival of the species. As we see in the other cases,there are no examples of this tree anywhere in the fossil record from 200million years ago until the present. According to UPI, “Sydney’s Royal BotanicGardens told the newspaper the discovery is ‘the equivalent of finding a smalldinosaur still alive.’ ”67 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en445]The Lazarus Effect may be caused by existing species rearranging into earlierversions on the DNA level, perhaps in the presence of unusual energeticstimulation—similar to what we saw in the Ciba-Geigy patent. Korean scientistDr. Dzang Kangeng published a remarkable discovery in 1993 that demonstrates howthis could happen. In this case, Kangeng found he could transfer the geneticcode from one species into another through nothing more than an energy wave.68[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en446] Kangeng placed a duck inside afive-sided, pentagon-shaped container, and covered it with a domed mirror roof.Each of the five sides of the container had a hole with a funnel mounted init—and then each funnel had a pipe that fed into a neighboring room, where therewas a pregnant mother hen. For five days, the duck was zapped with ahigh-frequency electrostatic generator. Amazingly, when the hen laid her eggs,what hatched out of them were not baby chicks—they were half-duck, half-chickenhybrids. Though they came from a chicken’s body, they had the typical featuresof a duck—a flat beak, a longer neck and larger internal organs—such as theheart, liver, stomach and bowels. After one year, the hybrid birds weighed 70percent more than a normal chicken.69[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en447]The experiment was repeated with a total of 500 eggs, of which 480 hatched andgrew. Of these 480 chicks, 80 percent had a flat, duck-shaped head. Ninetypercent had the eyes move to a position that was more like a duck’s than achicken’s. And 25 percent had webbing appear between their toes, which chickensdo not normally have.70 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en448] Thesehybrids were able to breed with each other, and their own offspring continued tobe half-duck, half-chicken hybrids rather than reverting to being ducks and/orchickens. Kangeng successfully applied for and was granted a patent for hisinvention as a “device for biological information-directed transfer,” though itobviously is not in common use.71 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en449] Hewas also able to zap peanuts and send their “wave information” into sunflowerseeds, and this created hybrid plants that now looked, tasted and smelledsimilar to peanuts. Their production increased by 180 percent—and again thechanges remained in place from one generation to another.72[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en450]Another little-known pioneer in this category is Italian scientist Pier LuigiIghina, who worked as a student of Marconi—the revered inventor of radio, alongwith many other technologies. According to an article by Leonardo Vintini in TheEpoch Times, a mainstream international newspaper, Ighina “harnessed the energythat passed between the earth and the sun,” and used it to rejuvenate diseasedcells. Another device he called Elios was allegedly able to purify any food hezapped with it. Given the effects we found in the Russian pyramid studies, thissounds quite familiar. In addition, Ighina apparently built practical, workingtechnologies that accomplished the same stupendous feats as the Russianpyramids. One device apparently neutralized earthquakes. Another device hecalled the magnetic stroboscope looked like a “strange propeller”—and when hepowered it up on a cloudy day, within a matter of minutes there would be acontinually growing hole opening up in the clouds above his home, revealing blueskies. This must have been quite a sight to see: “Ighina admitted that the mostsatisfying component of his unusual invention was the innocent smiles ofchildren as they watched the clouds retire, as if by magic.”73[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en451]This next excerpt contains the most interesting part of Ighina’s research as itrelates to our discussion.After years of arduous lab work, Ighina discovered the most profound nature ofmatter—that atoms do not oscillate but vibrate. This revelation led to one ofhis more curious and brilliant inventions—the magnetic field oscillator. Thescientist discovered that if he managed to change the vibratory state of a groupof particles, the material itself could transform. What followed was a series offantastic experiments in which the field oscillator played a leading role. Onone occasion, Ighina set up his apparatus before an apricot tree. He thenaltered the atomic vibration so that it gradually became the same as that of anapple tree. . . . After 16 days, he ascertained that the apricots had mutated,almost completely, into apples.74 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en452]This fits in very nicely with what Gariaev and Kangeng were both able to do—andthe more we see the same discoveries appearing, the more likely it is that theyare actually real. From here, Ighina’s story gets even more interesting.After this experience, Ighina ventured to investigate the reach of his inventionon animals. He altered the vibrational state of the tail of a rat to change it,in four days, into the tail of a cat. Even though the rat died after suchtreatment (perhaps its body was incapable of enduring such a rapid molecularchange), it prompted Ighina to try an experiment even more revelatory: Throughstudying the corresponding vibration of the healthy bone of a rabbit, he excitedthe atoms of another rabbit’s fractured feet until they were healed in recordtime. In this way, Ighina understood that sick cells (including cancerous ones)of any individual were possible to cure through a simple, gradual alternation intheir vibrational index, if this was correctly calculated.75[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en453]These are precisely the same results Gariaev and others have been able toindependently achieve—not to mention what we saw in the Russian pyramid studies.This genetic information transfer may be happening all the time, without anytechnology—just by two organisms being in close proximity to each other over aprolonged period. Noted psychologist Robert Zajonc helped establish scientificproof that when people live with each other for long periods of time, saytwenty-five years, they actually develop similar facial features. In this study,110 participants were shown individual photographs of people in their first yearof marriage and again after twenty-five years of marriage. The participants wereable to match up the faces after twenty-five years much more easily than theydid after a single year of marriage. This could not be explained by people alllooking the same as they got older, or other predictable factors.76[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en454]Getting back to our laboratory DNA research, generating hybrid creatures is onething—but is it possible to completely transform one species into another? Dr.Peter Gariaev sent a green nonburning laser through salamander eggs, and thenredirected the beam into frog eggs. Amazingly, the frog eggs completelytransformed into salamander eggs. Though these salamanders hatched from thegenetic material of a frog, they lived normal lives—and could breed with othersalamanders to produce healthy offspring.77[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en455]I heard about this breakthrough back in 2000—and it had a massive, life-changingeffect on me. This was the direct proof I was looking for that evolution couldbe totally spontaneous—and requires nothing more than a rearranging of the DNAmolecules within an existing species. As the years went by, I carefullycollected other examples of the same phenomenon—and it is a great pleasure tofinally put them all together while writing this book. Of course, I feelGariaev’s discovery has profound implications for all the ancient prophecies ofa coming Golden Age—beginning around the year 2012.Can we really be sure that we are at the pinnacle of human evolution? And how dowe know the human design is only unique to the earth? If our solar system isdipping up and down through the galactic plane in 64-million-year intervals, andthe fossil record is changing in 62-million-year intervals, then perhaps thegalaxy actually contains the “source code” for all life. Our movement throughthe galaxy may be transforming all life on earth in regular cycles. Almost everygrain of dust we see throughout the galaxy appears to be freeze-dried bacteria.This suggests that life is very, very abundant. Human life may well be agalactic design—naturally evolving on any planet that has the right conditions.Though we may find subtle differences in appearance from one planet to another,the overall look of these different species may be far, far less alien than wehave been led to believe by manipulative, fear-oriented Hollywood propaganda.And best of all, we may be in line for another cosmic upgrade very soon. Theproof that such sudden bursts of evolution can happen is already there in thefossil record—and we have direct proof of the mechanisms involved in Gariaev’sfrog-salamander study, and others just like it.DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THE SPEED OF EVOLUTIONIf this is really what the 2012 prophecies are about, it seems unlikely that anysweeping genetic changes would occur within a single person’s life span. Thereshould be gradual changes that we can track over time. We can therefore look forclues in our own genetic heritage to see if there is any DNA evidence for ourown evolution speeding up. This is precisely what was discovered by Universityof Madison–Wisconsin researcher Dr. John Hawks, and reported by the BBC News,Daily Galaxy and other mainstream media outlets. By studying various markers inhuman DNA, Hawks concluded that human evolution has been moving at asupercharged speed for the last forty thousand years. Even more stunningly, inthe last five thousand years, human evolution is now moving one hundred timesfaster than any other moment in recorded history.78[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en456] This timeframe only represents onehundred to two hundred generations. The other fascinating implication of this isthat according to Hawks, a person from 3000 B.C. is more similar to aNeanderthal than they are to you and me—on a direct, measurable DNA level.Approximately 1,800 genes, or 7 percent of all human genetics, have experiencedvery recent evolution.79 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en457]Another sign that we are experiencing rapid evolution is the so-called FlynnEffect. In the 1980s, a New Zealand political scientist named James Flynn foundthat IQ scores were consistently going up. An IQ of 100 is supposed to beaverage, but people were scoring better and better on the tests—thus forcingpsychologists to change the scoring systems. Since then, numerous studies haveconfirmed that we are seeing an average increase of over three IQ points perdecade. This increase appears in every single intelligence test being used,delivered to virtually every type of group, across twenty differentcountries—including some that are not literate in the traditional sense. Thereis also evidence that the speed of the increases is now accelerating. Flynnexamined one test called Raven’s Progressive Matrices, which has been given forover a century. Shockingly, a person who scored in the best 10 percent a hundredyears ago would now be among the weakest 5 percent. Furthermore, the number ofpeople whose scores would now rank them at the “genius” level have increased bymore than twenty times. These increases are not as likely to be seen on teststhat emphasize culture or traditional school knowledge. Instead, the mostdramatic increase is in tests that measure our ability to recognize abstract,nonverbal patterns. This should be leading to, as Flynn describes it, “acultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.”80[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en458]Humans are not the only ones who seem to be gaining intelligence. In 2008, U.K.Times Online revealed that naturalists were shocked to see orangutans swimming,which they never before have been observed doing—as well as using sticks to stunand capture fish, and in some cases even spearing them.81[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en459] This is another area ripe forinvestigation and further discovery.In 2009, Wired magazine revealed that the placebo effect has also becomesubstantially more powerful in a short time. This is causing big trouble for themajor pharmaceutical manufacturers, as in order for their drugs to pass clinicaltrials, they have to work better than placebos. From 2001 to 2006, 20 percentmore products were cut after less-demanding Phase II clinical trials, andanother 11 percent failed the more extensive Phase III trials. As one example, astartup stem-cell company called Osiris Therapeutics had to suspend trials for aCrohn’s disease pill in March 2009, and said the reason was that theirparticipants were getting an “unusually high” response to placebos. Just twodays later, Eli Lilly had to abandon a new drug to treat schizophrenia whentheir volunteers showed a 200-percent increase in their response to theplacebos.82 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en460]Existing drugs that are already on the market, like Prozac, are now also doingworse and worse when compared to placebos—to the point where they might not evenget approved if they were applying for a new release. Two differentcomprehensive investigations into antidepressants found that there has been aremarkable increase in our responsiveness to placebos since the 1980s. One ofthese studies concluded that placebos have nearly doubled in their effectivenessduring that time—across all these different trials. This is causing seriousfinancial pain to the pharmaceutical industry, which had become more profitablethan Big Oil—thanks to expensive, widespread drugs like Prozac. The “Big Pharma”companies say their drugs are not becoming weaker—instead, the placebo effect isgetting stronger, and no one can figure out why.83[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en461] This fits in perfectly with ournotion that the Source Field itself is changing—pushing us toward a highercoherence, if you will, and rearranging our genetic code in favorable ways. Theconnection between our level of intelligence and the influx of the Source Fieldinto our bodies now seems to be dramatically increasing in a relatively shorttime. The Source Field seems to appear in our DNA as virtual photons that arestored for usable energy.Another sign of possible human evolution is that overall happiness levels,worldwide, have significantly increased between 1981 and 2007 in forty-five outof fifty-two countries, which included several developing countries—not just theWest. Admittedly, the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research,which conducted this study, felt this rise in happiness was due to economicgrowth, greater democracy and increased social tolerance.84[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en462] Furthermore, in 2008, the Journal ofHappiness Studies reported that happiness protects our bodies from becomingsick—to the point where a consistent lack of happiness is as toxic as cigarettesmoking. This was the result of thirty different studies that were combinedtogether and analyzed to find a single, overall effect.85[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en463]Another interesting study was conducted by two economists from the University ofPennsylvania—Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers. They collected data every yearfrom 1972 to 2006 with the University of Chicago General Social Survey, and intheir findings, the overall level of happiness in America alone had notincreased—but fewer people are reporting very high scores and fewer people arereporting lower scores. It’s as if there were a normalizing factor at work insociety. Stevenson said, “It’s an interesting finding, because other researchshows increasing gaps in income, consumption and leisure time.”86[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en464]IS THE 25,920-YEAR PRECESSION A GENETIC EVOLUTION CYCLE?Many ancient myths suggest the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes cyclewill usher in a Golden Age. What happens if we examine our own historical recordwith this in mind? Is there any evidence that human evolution is following this25,920-year cycle in some measurable way? And if so, how would we know what wewere looking for, and where to find it? One obvious starting point would be tofind out when the Neanderthals died out. That would be a time where humanity wasrapidly evolving, and earlier species no longer survived. Sure enough, somewherebetween 28,000 and 24,000 years ago, roughly speaking, the Neanderthals wentextinct.87 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en465]Unless it all happened 24,000 years ago, which many scientists dispute, there isno climate shift event on earth that could help account for this change.Katerina Harvati, a paleoanthropologist from the Max Planck Institute forEvolutionary Anthropology, explained further.Our findings suggest that there was no single climatic event that caused theextinction of the Neanderthals. Only the controversial date of 24,000radiocarbon years for their disappearance, if proven correct, coincides with amajor environmental shift. Even in this case, however, the role of climate wouldhave been indirect—by promoting competition with other human groups.88[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en466]This “major environmental shift” from 24,000 years ago was clarified in anarticle from the BBC. During that time, sea surface temperatures were the lowestthey had been in the last 250,000 years—creating an Ice Age.89[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en467]If we go back another Great Year of 25,920 years into the past, we arrive atroughly fifty thousand years ago. This clearly corresponds with yet anothersudden jump in human evolution. Humans did not use any tools more sophisticatedthan a crude stone blade until about fifty thousand years ago.90[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en468] Suddenly, at this time, we beganmaking musical instruments, needles and other sophisticated tools, as well asdoing drawings. 91 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en469] According toanthropologist John Fleagle, we also see the carving of bone for religiousreasons. Harpoons, arrowheads, beaded jewelry and other forms of ornamentationall appear as a “coherent package about fifty thousand years ago.” Furthermore,“the first modern humans that left Africa between fifty thousand and fortythousand years ago seem to have had the full set.”92[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en470] Clear and undeniable religious artalso appeared abruptly, fifty thousand years ago, for totally unknown reasons.Graves of human beings were marked with red ochre and oriented to a single starin the night sky. James Lewis continued on this theme in a 2007 article he wrotefor American Thinker.All over the prehistoric world, physical symbols of power and devotion are laidin the ground, next to the honored dead; giant Neolithic stone works are foundall over the Old World, like Stonehenge but spread far and wide; and even theutilitarian stone hand axes that did not change over hundreds of thousands ofyears, are suddenly refined into ritual shapes too fragile for any practicaluse. Something very profound happened to human nature fifty or seventy millenniaago, and it has all the earmarks of what we inadequately call religion.93[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en471]Interestingly, another significant change occurred in our biosphere during thissame time that made the earth more comfortable for human life. As revealed byProfessor Peter Ward in 2004, giant mammals experienced a mass extinction fiftythousand years ago on every continent except Africa.94[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en472] Many of these giant mammals weredangerous to humans—so this appears to be another intelligent adaptation of theearth to be able to help our own evolution along.If we go even farther back in time, two human skulls found in Africa wererecently dated to be roughly 200,000 years old—and they are not fromNeanderthals. University of Utah geologist Frank Brown said, “It pushes back thebeginning of anatomically modern humans.” Since culture, religious art andcomplex tool-making didn’t appear until fifty thousand years ago, Brown saidthat this “would mean [we had] 150,000 years of Homo sapiens without culturalstuff.”95 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en473] Robert Roy Britt, writingfor LiveScience, said, “The finding suggests our ancestors spent a long, longtime wallowing in an uncultured era with no music, art or jewelry.”96[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en474]Now we have an incredible case for mass, energetically directed evolution. Dr.John Hawks genetically proved that mass human evolution has been speeding up forthe last forty thousand years, and began moving one hundred times faster in thelast five thousand years. We have compelling evidence that the precession of theequinoxes has an effect upon these evolutionary bursts, as we see in the dyingout of the Neanderthals roughly 25,000 years ago—and the sudden emergence ofcreativity and spiritual behavior in humans fifty thousand years ago. The trailof bread crumbs left by the wonders of the Great Pyramid have led us to acornucopia of remarkable new healing technologies, and the potential to save theearth from the cataclysms that now seem to be threatening us. That technology,if you will, is coherence—it is the energy of love. This is no longer somethingthat can be dismissed as a pseudoreligious burst of wishful thinking to belambasted by skeptics—it is an active, working presence that we could call theSource Field. The next stop in our investigation will reveal the stunning proofthat Time is a Source Field phenomenon as well—and can also be modified byvarious energetic processes. We will also explore compelling new evidence thatsome people considered everything in this book to be common knowledge—and leftus all the blueprints to reconstruct their lost science. This includes theability to create pyramids out of giant blocks of stone, as well as theunderstanding of how and why they work."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOTIME AND SPACE028 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_028_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENIt’s About TimeThe Source Field investigations give us hard scientific proof thatnonelectromagnetic Universal Energy can affect how we think, how fast we heal,and even the structure and function of our own DNA. Existing species can betransformed into entirely new creatures by strictly energetic means. Thisappears to be already happening in our own human evolution, making the ancientprophecies of a coming Golden Age all the more interesting. The 25,920-yearcycle is not just a number written into ancient myths and the dimensions of theGreat Pyramid—it is a physical, measurable wobble in the earth itself. Thissuggests that the movements of the earth—and the other planets—may be directlyaffecting the behavior of our minds and bodies in time.In order to find out if time can be measured, experienced and even driven by theenergy we move through—even if it is not visible to the naked eye—we may have tothrow away some of our deepest and most basic assumptions about what time reallyis. Once we do that, it may all very well make perfect sense . . . on aphysical, mathematical and logical level.Russian physicist Professor Simon Shnoll made truly civilizationchangingdiscoveries by studying a “wide range of physical, chemical, and biologicalprocesses, from radioactive decay to the rates of biochemical reactions” forwell over twenty years.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en475] This maysound dreadfully boring, but it ultimately means Shnoll studied the behavior ofevery single atom and energy wave on earth, looking for any common patterns inhow they were behaving—and when. What happens at the molecular level when youheat up water and turn it into steam? What happens when water freezes into ice?What happens when you mix two chemicals together? What happens when the cells inyour body exchange information and nutrition with each other? What happens whenradioactive isotopes slowly release energy? What happens to a burst ofelectricity as it flows through a conductor? These are very basic questions, andit’s all about “how stuff works.”Most scientists expect that all physical, chemical, biological and radioactiveprocesses will start small, steadily build up to a nice peak, and then glidenicely back down to zero—in a path that looks the same going down as it didgoing up. Any time the graph doesn’t fit into a smooth bell curve like this,scientists are trained to throw the data away—by a simple process they callrenormalization.Professor Shnoll decided not to throw the data away. It’s easy to understandwhy, because he found the graphs were not normal at all—they were very unusual.Sometimes these reactions would race up to maximum intensity, then plummetalmost all the way back down to zero. Then, just as quickly, they would rush allthe way back up to the peak again. They may even do this three times in a rowover a short period of time. That’s not a smooth flow at all. How can matter orenergy even stay stable if it’s actually doing this all the time?Just go take a walk—and think about how many physical, chemical and biologicalreactions there are. Electricity is humming along through the power lines.Sunlight is striking the paint on everything around you and gradually bleachingit out. The leaves on the trees convert that sunlight into food. Running waterdissolves salt crystals in the soil. Birds digest the seeds they peck off theground. The dry glue from a postage stamp turns into a weird-tasting goo on yourtongue as you walk up to your mailbox to drop in a letter. There are trillionsof these various reactions going on—just within the area your eyes can see.Shnoll found that every single atom and energy wave around you is doing the sameweird things at the same time—racing forward and backward in very specificpatterns. These patterns are almost as unique as a fingerprint. We’ll get backto why I said almost in a minute.Did you have any idea that the untold trillions of atoms and energy pulses thatare surrounding you right now are constantly rushing through this on-off, on-offbehavior at the tiniest level? That they are not having nice, smooth, normalreactions, but instead are constantly jumping back and forth in fits and starts?You’re not alone—hardly anyone knows about it, as Shnoll’s research is stillalmost completely obscure in both scientific and spiritual circles—even thoughhe published his findings in Russian scientific journals since at least 1985.Again, the most amazing part of the story is that everything around us worksperfectly, despite the fact that the reactions themselves are switching on andoff, on and off . . . all the time. Though this may seem like a gross leap inlogic, it’s almost as if energy waves and molecular reactions were behaving likethey were made up of individual frames within a strip of film—flickering in andout of our reality all the time.Perhaps the film only appears to be moving forward, creating the world we seeall around us—but it’s really just a collection of still frames. Either way, the“lucid dream,” if that’s what we’re all really experiencing in some sense, is avery convincing illusion. Matter and energy move along just fine, regardless ofhow strangely they may be acting down at the quantum level. We never worry aboutwhether our chair will suddenly dematerialize as we read this book.All this is just the setup for the really good stuff. Let’s say you mix twochemicals together, and chart out the unique zigzagging graph they make as theyreact. Now you have a friend in a lab, thousands of kilometers away, who graphsthe flow of radioactive energy decay at the exact same time—and he sends hischart to you. Naturally we would expect that when you compare these two chartsside by side, they would have absolutely nothing in common. If they did look thesame, then that defeats everything we thought we knew about mainstream science .. . but in the process, we may just discover an even deeper layer of the SourceField investigations.By the year 1985, Shnoll had discovered that any physical, chemical, biologicalor radioactive reactions do look the same, if you graph them out at the sametime—even when they were measured in areas that were thousands of kilometersapart.2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en476] Since distance does notappear to pose any barrier to this effect, it appears to be a worldwidephenomenon. This would mean that every single atom, every single molecule andevery burst of energy on earth is going through the exact same hiccups at thesame time—at the very tiny, or quantum, level. This is obviously not the sciencewe were taught to believe in school. These reactions are supposed to be separateand totally disconnected from each other—but they are not. Western quantumphysicists do not appear to know about Shnoll’s findings yet, though some oftheir discoveries lead us in this same direction.So what are the hiccups that are happening in matter and energy? How could wepossibly explain something like this? Professor Shnoll isn’t sure, but hebelieves that “a global change of space-time structure” could be causing it.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en477]In the simplest possible terms, this means that time itself is speeding up andslowing down at the quantum level. And this is apparently happening all over theworld, in the same way, at the same time. Space and time itself is doing thisbizarre dance, on a level at least as massive as the entire earth—since we’reall being affected by it. This creates distinctly measurable quantum effects—andyet somehow we continue to enjoy a nice, neat and linear experience of time.Remember—no matter how weird the graphs look, everything works fine. Thisflickering does not appear to have any detrimental effect on how energy flows,or how chemicals react. In fact, thanks to Einstein’s breakthrough discoveries,we know that if you could transport yourself down into the quantum level, andride around in a tiny spaceship, your clock would appear to move along justfine—no matter how much time was rushing forward and backward all around you.The trick is that whatever happens to you will also happen to your clock—sowithin your own “frame of reference,” you can’t tell that anything is going on.The apparently smooth flow of time may well be little more than a psychologicalexperience that keeps us from having severe mental disorientation. If these samequantum effects are somehow happening to us on a large-scale level as well, andwe just don’t realize it yet, then from another vantage point outside our owntime flow, we would appear to be frozen in place one minute and moving aroundreally quickly the next.LARGE-SCALE CHANGES IN THE FLOW OF TIMEAs bizarre as this must sound, some people appear to have developed technologiesthat use these principles on a scale much larger than the quantum world. Asreported in a 1977 issue of the Vancouver Sun Times, Toronto inventor SidHurwich apparently discovered a way to change the flow of time in a given“local” area—by a technological process.4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en478] Given the remarkably weird effectsthat would occur when he used the device, Hurwich realized his invention couldhave practical value—after a rash of bank robberies in 1969.Hurwich was friends with the police, and called a group of bank security staffand officers over to his house one night to demonstrate his new invention. TheSun Times article quoted the eyewitness testimony of Inspector Bill Bolton.“All I can recall,” says Bolton, “is that it was under the table—the device,whatever it was—and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my servicerevolver. You couldn’t pull the trigger, you couldn’t lift it up off the tableand even on the table, you couldn’t pull the trigger.” Hurwich continues: “Andthen I said, ‘Now take a look at your watches.’ I remember one of them said,‘When did this happen?’ and I said, ‘The minute you walked through that door.You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now look at your watches. You’re lateabout 25 minutes.’ As the security officers filed out of his home, Hurwich’swife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about thedevice. “That was the first time it ever entered my mind for war or armypurposes or anything like that,” Hurwich says. He went back to work in hisbasement. When he felt the device was ready, he contacted a brother living inIsrael . . . Hurwich received a visit shortly afterward from two high-rankingIsraeli officers. After a brief demonstration, they walked out with the workingmodel, and every plan and design Hurwich had.”5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en479]Imagine the defense implications of a technology like this. The December 1977article also alleges that earlier that June, Hurwich was given the “Protectorsof the State of Israel [award] on behalf of the Zionist Organization of Canadafor a secret military device he had given Israel seven years earlier.”6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en480] To me, the most interesting part ofthe article was this: “Hurwich insists his device is not really an invention. Hesays he simply ‘took one of the oldest BASIC principles of electricity and putit to a different use.’7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en481] How is itpossible that the police couldn’t pull the trigger on their revolvers—or evenpick them up off the table? Again, this forces us to think in an entirely newway, which most people would consider to be pure science fiction. As crazy asthis may sound, one explanation is that time was flowing so slowly in the worldaround them that any attempt to move the weapon may have taken place within meremicroseconds of normal time. The pressure they put on the gun may have seemedperfectly normal to them, but may not have lasted long enough in conventionaltime to overcome the normal inertia that would keep the weapon sitting on thetable. In their own frame of reference, everything appeared to be normal—butwhen they checked their watches, they were in for quite a surprise. They mayhave had to push on the gun for quite some time in order to get it to move atall, since conventional time had hardly changed in what they and their watchesmeasured as twenty-five minutes.IT’S ALL RELATIVEThis, of course, naturally offends our rational mind. We automatically take itfor granted that linear time is nice and stable. We are conditioned to believethere is no evidence that the rate of time could speed up or slow down. Webelieve it is a scientific fact that time must move forward at a constant speed.If you still think this is true, then you might want to check out AlbertEinstein. According to Discover magazine, “The trouble with time started acentury ago, when Einstein’s special and general theories of relativitydemolished the idea of time as a universal constant.”8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en482]What exactly does this mean? Einstein predicted that when you move throughspace, you’re not simply moving through something that is empty and has noeffect on you. Instead, as you move through space, you move through time aswell. Ultimately, that means that time doesn’t just happen on its own, as if bymagic. Time is actually being powered by some form of energy, or what’s called afabric, that exists throughout all of space. The faster we move through space,the faster we move through time. This was actually proven by Hafele and Keatingin October 1971. They flew four atomic clocks on commercial jet flights aroundthe world, both east and west, and compared them to clocks at the U.S. NavalObservatory in Washington, D.C. The flying clocks were predicted to lose about40 nanoseconds going east, and gain 275 nanoseconds going west. And believe itor not, it worked—within about 90 percent of what they expected.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en483] Further experiments in 1976 provedit worked to within 99 percent of Einstein’s original predictions.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en484]Would we experience any time at all if the earth were not moving? Maybe not.There are a variety of movements all happening at the same time that we have tothink about. The earth rotates on its own axis and revolves around the Sun.There are longer-terma cycles in the earth as well, including the 25,920-yearprecession. The Sun revolves around the center of the galaxy in about 250million years, and the galaxy is also moving toward the so-called GreatAttractor—a giant zone of gravitational pull in the constellation Virgo. All ofthese movements drive us through what Einstein called “space-time,” and what Iprefer to call the Source Field—the basic stuff the Universe is made of. Sincewe are moving along at a constant speed, more or less, our experience of timeremains stable and consistent.However, Einstein also concluded that once you begin traveling near the speed oflight, you are now traveling through time much faster than everyone else back onearth. You could take a simple two-week trip away from the earth and back, atnear–light speed, only to find out that five hundred years had gone by on earthwhile you were gone, let’s say. If you could somehow beam a television signalback to the earth from inside your ship, then as soon as you started travelingnear light speed, you would appear completely frozen to everyone who waswatching you.This is not speculation, crackpot science or foolishness—this is a commonlyaccepted fact within modern physics. Hurwich appears to have discovered a way toaccelerate the flow of time like this in a local area. Of course, mainstreamscience would strongly disagree with these amazing new concepts I’m sharing withyou. This started back in 1910, when Einstein rejected the idea that empty spaceactually had any actual energy in it, which most scientists of his day called“aether.” Einstein’s space-time was more of an abstract mathematical concept atthat time; he didn’t expect to see any actual energy appearing in space. This isstill what almost all Western scientists believe—namely, that Einsteincompletely ruled out the idea that there is an aether of energy out there inempty space. A typical attitude is expressed in Robert Youngson’s ScientificBlunders: “By 1930, younger physicists would smile in a supercilious fashion atany reference to the aether. All scientists now agree that, in the words of theAmerican homespun philosopher: ‘There ain’t no such critter.’ ”11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en485]All scientists now agree there is no aether in space? Then apparently Einsteinis not a scientist. You see, by 1918, Einstein contradicted his earlier opinion.[Any] part of space without matter and without electromagnetic fields seems tobe completely empty. . . . [But,] according to the general theory of relativity,even space that is empty in this sense has physical properties. This . . . canbe easily understood by speaking about an ether, whose state varies continuouslyfrom point to point.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en486]In 1920, Einstein said it even more strongly.According to the general theory of relativity, space without ether isunthinkable; for in such space, not only would there be no propagation of light,but also no . . . space-time intervals in the physical sense.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en487]What Einstein is saying here is that without some sort of aether in space, therecould be no “time intervals” as we now know them. Our clocks would appear to becompletely frozen—if their atoms could even hold together at all. Thus, inEinstein’s own words, time is powered by an energy in space. And this energy isnot all smooth and even wherever you go—it “varies continuously from point topoint.” The more space we move through, the more of this time energy we movethrough. And depending on how fast we go, the rate of time will speed up or slowdown along the way. If we can accelerate the flow of this energy in a givenlocal area, then we may well be able to create effects similar to thoseallegedly discovered by Sid Hurwich. Unfortunately, no additional information onHurwich or his discoveries can be found. Most likely, he was either paid verywell, ordered to keep his mouth shut, or permanently silenced.REPEATING CYCLES OF TIMEIf time is an energy in space that we move through, then how can we be so sureit only travels forward—into what we think of as the future? Einstein assumedthat time is one-dimensional, meaning it can only move forward—in a single,straight line. That may have been his single biggest mistake. Is it possiblethat when the earth returns to the same orbital position it had been in before,relative to the Sun, that it could be returning to an area of time—a structuredregion within the Source Field—that has similar properties and influences as ithad before?That’s exactly what Professor Shnoll discovered. Graph out any physical,chemical, biological or radioactive reaction and study the fingerprint you getfrom it. Now come back exactly one rotation of the earth—twenty-four hours—later. . . and your graph will be almost identical to the one you saw twenty-fourhours before. Then check again one year later—and a very similar fingerprintagain shows up.This means that the forward-and-backward racing movement of time that Shnolldiscovered is not random or haphazard. Though we don’t yet know exactly why thegraphs race forward and backward the way they do, we do know that the patternsrepeat themselves according to the earth’s basic cycles. In short, everymolecule on earth, down at the quantum level, is somehow being directly affectedby the earth’s movement through space—in repeating patterns. If this is reallytrue, then we have to rewrite almost every scientific law we now take forgranted. We’re already well on our way, thanks to our ancient inheritance—so Isay let’s go for it.Professor Shnoll found these repeating patterns in the following intervals: “atapproximately 24 hours, at 27.28 days [the Moon’s orbit around the earth’srelative to the center of the galaxy] . . . and at three time intervals close toa year: 364.4, 365.2 and 366.6 days.”14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en488] The earth takes 365.2422 days torevolve around the Sun, and one of Shnoll’s cycles was 365.2 days—so it’s avery, very close fit.Shnoll obviously didn’t have enough data to witness these cycles unfolding overmuch longer periods of time—like the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes.All he did was study the behavior of matter and energy, and found it was doingvery strange things—and these patterns repeated in cycles. Further research isnecessary to see if the movements of the other planets also create the sameeffects Shnoll discovered, but it seems very foolish to think it would only workwith the earth and the Moon. The flow of time is likely getting pushed andpulled by the movements of the earth, the Moon and the planets in reliable,consistent ways that will repeat, nicely and neatly, from one orbital cycle tothe next.Once we bring in the evidence from chapters 9 and 10, we realize that time mayhave cyclical effects. Time appears to have structure in it, and that structurein turn influences the biological cycles discovered by Burr and Popp, as well asour conscious minds—as we’re now seeing with the Flynn Effect and humanevolution as we head toward the end of the 25,920-year cycle. These time cyclesmay not be arbitrary—some are directly related to the earth’s movements throughspace. Now, thanks to the work of Professor Shnoll, we’re seeing that thisstructure in time is actually affecting the basic behavior of physical matter.SPACE AND TIMESkeptics might say that Shnoll’s discoveries are just “statistical noise,” andhave no real relevance to our large-scale world. Or, they may write it off assome interesting, little-known new effect in quantum physics. Maybe in anothertwenty-two years, enough scientists will believe Shnoll that his discovery isthen taught in schools. Either way, any reputable scientist would expect that ifall atoms, molecules and energy waves on earth were speeding up and slowingdown, then we would need to see it happening to normal-size objects aswell—speeding up or slowing down as they travel through space.It is common knowledge that satellite probes we’ve sent out into deep space aredoing just that—slowing down—even though they’re not supposed to. Gravity shouldget weaker, not stronger, as we head out of the solar system. In 2001, DavidWhitehouse of BBC News reported that four different space probes were slowingdown, including Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11—which are on opposite ends of thesolar system. This also included Galileo as it sped out to Jupiter, and Ulyssesas it orbited the Sun. Dr. John Anderson from NASA’s JPL said, “It is almost asif the probes were not behaving according to the known law of gravity. . . .We’ve been working on this problem for several years, and we have accounted foreverything we could think of.”15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en489]The plot thickened in 2008, when the same NASA scientist added three more spaceprobes to the puzzle—bringing it up to a total of seven. Galileo was againmentioned, but we also learned that the NEAR mission to the asteroid Eros, theCassini mission to Saturn and the Rosetta mission to rendezvous with a comet allexperienced changes in their traveling speed that could not be explained. Inthis case, as each of them flew past the earth in order to pick up speed fortheir trips into space, they would either slow down or speed up—depending on thedirection they were traveling in. Dr. Anderson, now working as a retiree, said,“I am feeling both humble and perplexed by this. . . . There is something verystrange going on with spacecraft motions. We have no convincing explanation foreither the Pioneer anomaly or the flyby anomaly.”16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en490]As one example, NEAR came toward the earth at 20 degrees South latitude and flewaway at 72 degrees South. This path caused it to fly 13 millimeters faster, persecond, than it was supposed to. That might not seem like very much, but it wasdefinitely real—the effect could be studied with extreme precision. NASA bouncedradio waves off of the probe and could measure its speed with an accuracy ofzero point one millimeters per second—so a 13-millimeter change was easy tospot.Does this mean that space probes always speed up or slow down as they swingaround the earth? Strangely not. The Messenger space probe made one pass thatwas symmetrical—coming in at about 31 degrees North latitude, and leaving at 32degrees South. In that case, its speed hardly changed at all. Dr. Anderson foundthat the more a space probe angled away from the earth’s equator as it passedby, the more its speed would change—and the more it made a nice, even patharound the earth’s equator like with Messenger, the less its speed changed. Thisled Dr. Anderson to conclude that the movement of the earth must somehow beresponsible for causing these changes in how fast the space probes aretraveling—but no one seems to know why this is happening.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en491] This is not something you canexplain with Einstein’s theories of relativity as they now stand—but they aredefinitely a great start.Even if this is nothing more than a mysterious gravitational effect, (althoughNASA said this is not explainable by any conventional means), it would stillforce us to rewrite the laws of physics. Then again, what if it has nothing todo with gravity? What if the flow of time itself is actually slowing down orspeeding up?In Einstein’s model, time isn’t expected to speed up or slow down in a givenarea of empty space, at least not by very much—it should essentially move at thesame speed wherever you go, other than a black hole. It’s really only how fastyou travel through space that determines the rate of time. The Pioneer and Flybyanomalies are different from that—because they actually suggest that the rate oftime can change in a given local area. And when we bring in Shnoll, we havestunning new evidence that this is happening all the time, and we just didn’tknow about it before. When our satellites speed up or slow down as they pass bythe earth, we’re only looking at a change of 13 millimeters per second—which isonly one-millionth of their normal traveling speed—so it is a subtle effect thatwas easily missed for many years.The rotation of the earth appears to be creating a ripple in the flow oftime—almost like a lawn sprinkler spraying out time flow as the earth spins,caused by the movement of what we are calling the Source Field. What if theSun’s energy could also give a nice little push to the flow of time—not a hugeamount, but more like the 13 millimeters per second we saw with our spaceprobes? If true, this would be most likely visible when the Sun’s energeticactivity suddenly peaked. Based on the worldwide changes Shnoll observed, we maydiscover that every atom and every energy wave on earth would be affected by theSun’s behavior. And furthermore, since our brains are electrical systems,perhaps a sudden, unexpected hiccup in the flow of time would cause somedisruptions in our brain wave patterns as well—which might make us feeluncomfortable, stressed out and overly emotional. If so, that might lead tooutbreaks of war, violence and economic collapse.SOLAR CYCLES AND CONSCIOUSNESS EFFECTSEnter A. L. Tchijevsky, a Russian scientist in the early twentieth century.Tchijevsky created an “Index of Mass Human Excitability” to study how chaoticand turbulent life on earth was in seventy-two different countries, for almost2,500 years—from 500 B.C. to A.D. 1922. He looked for any obvious signals thatpeople were really unhappy, such as wars, revolutions, riots, economic upsets,expeditions and migrations. He also ranked how severe these events were by howmany people were involved. To his amazement, “Tchijevsky found that fully 80percent of the most significant events occurred during the 5 years of maximumsunspot activity.”18 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en492] The sunspotcycle does not always run in an eleven-year interval—sometimes it comes sooner,sometimes later. Nonetheless, whenever solar activity was at its maximum, awhopping 80 percent of all the most negative events took place.029 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_029_r1.gif]The Institute of HeartMath’s reconstruction of Tchijevsky’s discovery of aprecise relationship between solar activity and civil unrest.Sadly, Tchijevsky served thirty years in Soviet prisons for merely pointing outthat the Russian Revolution of 1917 occurred during the height of the sunspotcycle. The Communists were adamant in their belief that there is no God. Thelast thing they wanted was to be accused of creating their revolution right whenthe Sun’s activity was influencing them into doing it.Now think back to what we learned in chapter 5. Seven thousand people were ableto reduce worldwide terrorism by 72 percent, simply by meditating. They alsoreduced random acts of violence, deaths and hostilities between nations. WithShnoll, we discovered that the movement of our planet around the Sun affectsevery atom on earth in very measurable ways. Now with Tchijevsky, we see thatsolar activity has a direct effect on how we feel. As the Sun’s activityincreases, we feel an increasing sense of stress—and violence breaks out allover the world. As the Sun’s activity decreases, we recover from the stress—andonly 20 percent of the most negative events take place. This effect held truefor the entire 2,500-year length of time that Tchijevsky studied.If our model is correct, then we can assume that these changes in solar activitywould also create changes in the flow of time. This, in turn, could interruptthe normally smooth flow of our brain wave patterns, causing us to feeluncomfortable without really knowing why. It would be very difficult for us tomeasure any changes in the flow of time with clocks based on earth, as theywould also speed up or slow down at the same rate as the flow of time itself.However, we could check the speed of the earth’s rotation, because the Sun is ata fixed position in the sky—so we have something stable, which is outside theearth, to compare it to.INTERPLANETARY CHANGES IN THE FLOW OF TIMEIn 1959, there was a huge solar storm—and the earth’s rotation slowed down atthe exact same time. This made the length of a typical day suddenly increase.Then an even greater storm occurred in August 1972—and according to John Gribbinand NASA scientist Stephen Plagemann in the prestigious journal Nature, “We haveindeed found a discontinuous change in the length of day . . . immediately afterthat event.”19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en493] The earth “hiccupped”in its orbit during a massive solar storm. Indeed, many scientists have foundclear connections between solar activity and the length of the day.20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en494] In fact, there is a perfectrelationship between the amount of solar activity and the speed of the earth’srotation throughout “much of the last forty years of the twentieth century”21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en495]—from 1960 onward. Bear in mind that1950 was the first year that we had really good data to track the exact lengthof a day, and prior to 1920 the available data is even worse.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en496] Solar activity also changes thespeed that our atmosphere is traveling around the earth—though there is a delaybetween the solar activity and the resulting change in the overall speed of theatmosphere.23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en497] According to Djurovicin 1990, “The physical mechanism of these phenomena is still unknown.”24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en498]Another possible example of a change in the flow of time occurs when the planetMercury starts moving backward, or retrograde, in its path through our nightsky. Almost every astrologer will tell you from personal and professionalexperience that during this time, mechanical devices seem more likely to breakdown—perhaps because of disruptions in the flow of electricity—and people seemmore likely to get into arguments with each other and have problems erupt. Evenmainstream media outlets like Wired magazine25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en499] and CNet26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en500] have commented on this curiousphenomenon, thanks to the brave journalism of Daniel Terdiman. Now that we knowabout Professor Shnoll’s work, we can speculate about whether the flow of timeitself gets disrupted when planets go into retrograde movement.In August 2010, researchers from Stanford and Purdue universities added evenmore new data to the mix. These scientists were studying the decay rates ofradioactive materials, just like Shnoll had done. As far as they knew, theserates were supposed to be constant and unchanging—but that’s not what happened.Instead, they found some new variations on what Shnoll had already been trackingfor years.Decay rates would slightly decrease during the summer and increase during thewinter. Experimental error and environmental conditions have all been ruled out.. . . And there seems to be only one answer. As the earth is closer to the sunduring the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere (our planet’s orbit isslightly eccentric, or elongated), could the sun be influencing decay rates? Inanother moment of weirdness, Purdue nuclear engineer Jere Jenkins noticed aninexplicable drop in the decay rate of manganese-54 when he was testing it onenight in 2006. It so happened that this drop occurred just over a day before alarge flare erupted on the sun. . . . The sun link was made even stronger whenPeter Sturrock, Stanford professor emeritus of applied physics, suggested thatthe Purdue scientists look for other recurring patterns in decay rates. As anexpert of the inner workings of the sun, Sturrock had a hunch that solarneutrinos might hold the key to this mystery. Sure enough, the researchersnoticed the decay rates vary repeatedly every 33 days—a period of time thatmatches the rotational period of the core of the sun.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en501]These changes in solar activity not only seem to alter the flow of time—theyalso accelerate the amount of negative events happening, or what Tchijevskycalled “Human Excitability.” Would it also have a similar effect on the strengthof our intuitive and psychic abilities? Dr. James Spottiswoode studied twentyyears’ worth of solid, scientific research into “anomalous cognition,” whereordinary people were tested to see how psychic they were. After exploringfifty-one different studies conducted from 1976 to 1996, which added up to atotal of 2,879 different individual trials, he found that solar activity had aclear and measurable influence on our psychic ability.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en502] In general, the more solar activitythere was, the less effective we were in these “anomalous cognition” tests.Now we have the strong suggestion that a burst of energy from the Sun can slowdown time. The earth then rotates more slowly—though no one seems to understandwhy. This may also create stress in the human mind, by disrupting the electricalactivity in our synapses—the level of coherence in our minds. This shock to thebrain could lead to an increase in violence, war and unrest. When the Sun wascalm, only 20 percent of these “Human Excitability” events took place—throughoutthe last 2,500 years. It may be that when the flow of time becomes smoother, thecoherence increases. Our brain waves mellow out, and everyone gets along betterwith each other. This smoothing-out of our brain wave patterns may also help usgo into deeper states of consciousness—thus increasing our performance on“anomalous cognition” tests.HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS CHANGING THE FLOW OF TIMEIf these cycles can push against us, and change the way we behave, then can wealso push back? If high solar activity makes the flow of time more choppy,creating disruptions that slow down time, and low solar activity makes the flowof time smoother, then can we affect the flow of time as well? If everyone onearth was suddenly shocked by a negative event, would that cause a suddenflickering in the passage of time—disrupting coherence on a worldwide level? Andif enough of us meditate, could we smooth out the flow of time—in a way thatShnoll would be able to concretely measure in his laboratory?This brings us to Dr. Roger Nelson’s work with the Global Consciousness Project.Beginning in 1979, Dr. Robert Jahn started the Princeton Engineering AnomaliesResearch laboratory to study “whether sensitive electronic devices . . . mightbe affected by special states of consciousness, including strong emotions anddirected intention.”29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en503] Dr. RogerNelson joined the team in 1980, and ultimately became the main force behind thisresearch. Early along, Jahn and Nelson decided to see if the human mind couldcreate any sort of measurable effect on “a well-developed commercial source ofelectronic white noise.”30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en504] Shnollwas studying the flow of electricity as well, as one of his physicalreactions—so now we have two different groups looking at the same thing.Jahn and Nelson wanted to turn that electrical noise into numbers they couldgraph out and measure. That way, if a person could actually affect the flow ofelectricity in some way, they could prove it mathematically. They decided thebest way to do this was to create a random-number generator. This measures howsmoothly electricity is flowing through a circuit: Any hiccups in the flow ofelectricity will create regular patterns in the numbers it generates. Once wesee a pattern, the numbers aren’t as random anymore. Of course, in conventionalscience, time isn’t supposed to slow down and speed up as electricity movesalong. However, if time did start slowing down and speeding up within a randomelectrical circuit, then the numbers would indeed begin developingpatterns—which you could then measure and graph out. Shnoll was also looking forthese exact sorts of patterns in physical, chemical, biological and radioactivereactions—but he never expected to find effects that could be caused by thehuman mind.Over the years, Dr. Nelson used three different kinds of random-numbergenerators that are either based on “thermal noise”—the natural rise and fall oftemperature within an electrical circuit—or “electron tunneling,” which is theflow of electrons through tiny pathways, such as what we find in a computerchip. The circuits were carefully shielded off so they could not be influencedby external electromagnetic fields or temperature changes, and he also insuredthat the aging of the components could not be a factor either. According toNelson, “Over more than a decade, this basic experiment yielded an enormousdatabase—with a bottom line indicating a small but significant effect of humanintention on [these] random data sequences.”31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en505]To put it plainly, Nelson found that ordinary people like you and me,particularly in larger groups, could actually change the numbers that came outof the computers—and create “patterns in chaos.”32[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en506] As Nelson said in a 2008 paper,For example, we took the REG [Random Event Generator], connected to a laptop orpalmtop computer, to concerts, rituals, religious ceremonies, sporting events,board meetings, and various other events that might create a state of “groupconsciousness” . . . over several years we accumulated more than 100 datasetsfrom “resonant” situations, and a smaller but substantial number of “mundane”locations [such as shopping centers, busy street corners and academic meetings].. . . In a nutshell . . . the largest or most reliable effects seem to involveritual, or some other influence that is designed to bring people to a sharedstate of mind.33 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en507]A GLOBAL CONSCIOUSNESSIn 1995, two different random-number generators, twelve miles apart, showed ameasurable change during the exact time that millions of people were watchingthe Academy Awards on television.34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en508]Dr. Dean Radin found strong spikes at the most critical moments of the O. J.Simpson trial in 1997, across five different REGs in five separate locations—andthis was one of the most highly watched events in television history.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en509] During Princess Diana’s funeral in1998, twelve different REGs in the United States and Europe also showed“statistically significant departures” from the normal levels “at the mostcritical or poignant times.”36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en510]In late 1997, they began building a worldwide network that could run twenty-fourhours a day, seven days a week, to look for these patterns. All this data wastransferred by the Internet to a central location at Princeton University whereit could be analyzed. By the year 2001, the Global Consciousness Project hadexpanded to the point where there were thirty-seven computers around the worldgenerating these numbers, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Right as9/11 started happening, and the news began spreading across the world, they gotresults.We find that over a period of 3 months, one date is associated with astatistical anomaly: September 11, 2001. On this date, the time range appearingmost often [among the 37 computers] is 6 AM—10 AM, peaking around 9:00—10:00 AM,and the location primarily the East Coast of the USA.37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en511]Indeed, the closer the computers were to New York, the stronger the effect. Ascore this high would only occur about once in a million seconds by randomchance alone, which is roughly a two-week period. According to Dr. Dean Radin in2001, “These effects are the most strikingly persuasive evidence I’ve seen sofar that mass-mind attention/intention affects the physical world—perhapsbecause this event has also been the most horrific.”38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en512]030 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_030_r1.gif]The Global Consciousness Project discovered that random-number generatorsdisplay curious patterns of order that emerge during major, worldwide events.Science is about prediction. You can’t just sit there and wait for things tohappen, and then analyze them afterward. In this case, when a major event iscoming up in the world, you write down what you expect will happen in advance,and then see if your prediction comes true. As of 2008, Nelson reported thatthey had picked out “over 250 rigorously vetted, pre-specified events” ahead oftime, so they could indeed predict whether something might happen—rather thanjust looking for “spikes in the data” like 9/11, and analyzing them afterward.These 250 events included “tragedies and celebrations, natural and human causeddisasters, [and] planned and spontaneous gatherings of great numbers.” In eachof these 250 cases, a noticeable worldwide effect occurred—creating what theycalled “moments of global consciousness.” The odds that all 250 of these eventscould have been caused by something other than our collective consciousness werecalculated at ten million to one.39 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en513]Let’s go back to September 11, 2001—the most striking effect they had everobserved at the time. If thirty-seven different computers all over the worldrecorded a noticeable change that peaked between nine and ten A.M., then thatimplies that every power line, every electrical circuit worldwide wasexperiencing a hiccup during this time—somehow caused by our global unrest. Nowwe’re right back to Shnoll’s effects again—except that this time, we are causingthe same things to happen by our own collective consciousness.If the combined power of our thoughts can create measurable effects inrandom-number generators all over the world, creating flickers in the flow ofelectricity, what about the earth’s magnetic field? Geologist Gregg Bradenrevealed these effects in his book Fractal Time.In September 2001, two geosynchronous operational environmental satellites(GOES) orbiting the earth detected a rise in the magnetic field of the earththat forever changed the way scientists view our world and us. The GOES 8 andGOES 10 each showed a powerful spike of earth’s magnetic field strength . . .that topped out at nearly 50 units (nano-Teslas) higher than any that had beentypical for the same time previously. The time was 9:00 A.M. Eastern standardtime; 15 minutes after the first plane hit the World Trade Center and about 15minutes before the second impact. The correlation between the events and thereadings was undeniable.40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en514]On September 14, 2001, there was a worldwide prayer for peace that involved manybeloved public figures, and was broadcast on all major television stationsaround the world. Millions and millions of people participated in this globalmeditation. Amazingly, during this exact time, the graphs showed a huge effectin the opposite direction from where they went in 9/11.On the 14th of September, there was a special emphasis on such collectivespiritual moments, including major organized periods of silence in Europe andAmerica. . . . The picture is compelling . . . the trend shows a marginallysignificant decrease . . . steadily opposite to the [usual] direction.41[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en515]This clearly implies that we can push the flow in both directions—either intomore chaos and flickering in the case of a great tragedy, or greater coherencein the case of a worldwide prayer vigil for peace. When we are at peace, therandomness of the computer circuits becomes even more perfect—perhaps becausethe flow of electricity is much smoother and more coherent than usual. Theseeffects are completely consistent with the Source Field data we’ve discovered inprevious chapters, including the Russian pyramid studies.When Obama won the 2008 presidential election, the electrical effects were atleast as strong as 9/11—if not stronger: “The figure speaks for itself . . . itappears that the election shows at least as strong an effect as the terrorattacks.”42 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en516] When Obama wasinaugurated, millions of people focused their attention on thoughts of peace—andonce again, the graphs decreased substantially, just like they did in theworldwide peace meditation of September 14, 2001.The result is graphically quite striking, with no trend for the first 4 hours ofthe period, then a very steady trend showing smaller than expected networkvariance [i.e., network change] for about 12 hours. . . . [These decreases in]network variance [are] often associated with occasions that are meditative andcelebratory.43 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en517]Dr. Nelson made formal predictions for seventeen different global meditationsand found a “strong positive effect,” saying that “overall, the odds againstsuch a persistent departure from expectation are about 300 to 1.”44[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en518] Brian Williams later added in anadditional thirty-nine global meditations to the original body of data they werestudying, and although the effect was somewhat smaller, it was still there: “theresult remains consistent with the hypothesis of a positive significanteffect.”45 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en519]My friend Dr. Claude Swanson, an MIT graduate and former applied-physicsconsultant for a variety of government, military and private corporations,summed it up very nicely in his excellent book The Synchronized Universe.Our Western culture has taught us that thoughts don’t matter. If each one of usgoes around each day carrying anger and resentment, the Western belief is thatit has no direct effect on the world. As long as we refrain from overt violentactions, the present belief is that no harm will be done to others. But in viewof the present evidence, this can no longer be maintained. We are truly tied toone another, and even our thoughts affect one another. James Twyman has ledseveral worldwide synchronized group prayers for peace. Those prayers hadmeasurable effects, and even altered the physics of the quantum background andthe level of chaos worldwide for a time [as discovered in the GlobalConsciousness Project.] . . . He observes the following: “. . . conflict in theworld is the result of conflict within us. We project that feeling into theworld because we are not ready to accept that we are the cause, and thereforethe solution, to that conflict. Thus wars have raged in the world since thebeginning of time, because we are not ready to deal with the conflict where itreally is—within us.”46 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en520]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEThe Gravity of the Source FieldIn life, afterlife and reincarnation, we have a continuing consciousness that isunified with the greater Mind of this Cosmos. Pyramid technology appears to havebeen built to concentrate this intelligent Source Field energy for biological,psychological and even spiritual healing. Thanks to the Global ConsciousnessProject, we now have compelling evidence that our own minds can also create adirect, measurable effect on how electricity flows throughout wires, componentsand computer chips all over the world. It appears that in moments of greattragedy, or times when many of us focus on the same event, our minds createworldwide hiccups in the flow of energy. Our thoughts do seem to create anenergy that directly affects the behavior of others.Einstein was ultimately looking for a unified field that he could build theentire Universe from—all space, all time, all matter, all energy, all life, andof course all of consciousness. In the famous “E equals mc squared” equation,you have Energy on one side and Matter on the other—which means that Matter mustultimately be made of Energy. Einstein hoped to prove that electromagneticenergy was the unified field—which would mean that the flow of time, as well asgravity, was an electromagnetic effect. He was never able to prove this wastrue—nor has anyone else since then. Einstein did, however, acknowledge thatthere had to be an energy in empty space that could make time speed up or slowdown—depending on how fast you moved through it. Indeed, many scientists arelooking for the unified field, and they have created a variety of differentnames for it: zero-point energy, virtual particles, quantum foam, dark matter,dark energy, and others. If anyone does solve the puzzle, the payoff is huge—asonce you understand how to access the unified field, you could theoreticallycontrol gravity and time. The Source Field we’ve already talked about seems tofit these concepts perfectly—we just have to learn to think in an entirely newand unexpected way.If there is a unified field—and most physicists are convinced there must be—itwould automatically, by design, be responsible for creating all matter in theUniverse. We’re not just looking at an energy that drives the flow of time—we’relooking at the Source of all space, time, matter, energy and life in theUniverse. It does not appear that the Source Field created the Universe in asingle, spontaneous Big Bang, in which all atoms then keep on running forinfinity—with no new energy input. By design, the Source Field is activelyresponsible for keeping matter going—moment by moment.Scientists normally assume that atoms and molecules will just keep on spinningand spinning forever, without ever running out of energy. Dr. Hal Puthoff1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en521] suggested they must be drawing offof an energy field in order to exist—just like a candle flame must burn oxygenand wax in order to stay lit. Since most single atoms are nice, round spheres,the Source Field will flow into atoms equally from all directions. The flow intothe earth would obviously behave the same way. We would see a spherical currentof Source Field energy flowing into it, moment by moment, to keep all thecountless atoms and molecules that make up the earth humming along. The SourceField also needs to flow into all living creatures on earth. We now have seenvery strong evidence that all life-forms on earth must continually absorbphotons of light, and store them in their DNA in order to survive. The SourceField apparently creates these virtual photons when there is rotating, vortexmovement within the field itself. For biological life, the most importantfrequency is 380 nanometers. If this frequency gets scrambled, our DNA can’tabsorb and store the light it needs—and we develop cancer.It appears that gravity is actually caused by a massive current of energyflowing into the earth. The earth is obviously made of atoms, and my friend andcolleague Dr. Nassim Haramein made a strong argument that atoms aregravity-powered. Haramein studied the energy fields and behaviors around a blackhole, and found that they looked exactly the same as what we see around thenucleus of an atom. In Haramein’s model, an atom is “a mini black hole, whereprotons are attracted to each other by gravitation rather than some mysterious,undefined ‘strong force.’”2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en522] Anotherpaper that convincingly argues that atoms are gravity-powered is CentralOscillator and Space-Quanta Medium.3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en523]Haramein has also concluded that space-time is fluidlike—which is a veryimportant point, as we will see. In July 2010, a respected physicist concludedthat gravity is “a side effect of something going on at deeper levels ofreality” and “there is something more basic, from which gravity ‘emerges’ ”—andthis may explain mysteries such as “dark energy” and “dark matter.”4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en524]Obviously, if atoms are gravity powered, then every object will have the sameflow going through it that the earth does—but on a much smaller scale. Objectson the earth’s surface would then get caught up in the much greater river ofenergy that is flowing down into the earth. Gravity may therefore be pushing usdown—not unlike mosquitoes being blown against a screen window by a gust ofwind. Most people still talk about the pull of gravity, as if it were somehowreaching up from the ground and pulling us down. It seems to make much moresense to consider the idea that “gravity is a push”—as Walter Wright suggestedin his 1979 book of the same title.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en525]The specific details of Wright’s model may not all be correct, but he does seemto be on the right track. Again, this would mean that Gravity is the SourceField. The Source Field is Gravity. These may well be two different names forthe same thing—we just didn’t understand what Gravity really was.PYRAMID TECHNOLOGY EXPLAINEDWhen we have a perfect sphere, the flow of the Source Field into that objectwould obviously be spherical. Now here is a significant question: How would theSource Field flow into the shape of a pyramid? Would it be equally assymmetrical? Obviously, if the object is not symmetrical, the flow will not besymmetrical either. The pyramid shape apparently acts like a funnel, and causesa vortex to form in the Source Field as it flows in—just like water swirlingdown the drain. This appears to be one of the single most important physicsprinciples we have missed—but the ancients were seemingly well aware of it. Somepeople might think that each atom would act like an individual, separateunit—where the flow never spills over into its neighbors. Instead, the SourceField appears to be flowing through the entire object, with all of its atoms, asa single, large vortex. The shape of the object then determines how thefluidlike energy flows. Some shapes could create powerful currents just bysitting there—causing them to act like machines that run with no moving parts.In 1995, Dr. Harold Aspden discovered a remarkable “swirling effect” inside amagnetic rotor—the central, rotating part of an engine. Aspden’s experimentinvolved an eight-hundred-gram rotor that was spun up to a cruising speed of3,250 revolutions per minute, from a dead stop. Normally it took three hundredjoules of energy to get this to happen. However, if you run the rotor for fiveminutes or more and then bring it to a complete stop, it only takes thirtyjoules of energy to get it going again—if you do it within sixty seconds. It nowtakes ten times less energy to get the motor up to speed. The overall effecttakes several minutes to wear off completely. This implies that once thespinning rotor comes to a complete stop, there is still some form of energyswirling around inside of it—which Dr. Aspden called “virtual inertia.”The experimental evidence is that there is something spinning of an etherealnature coextensive with the machine rotor . . . [it] can spin independently andtake several minutes to decay, whereas the motor comes to rest in a few seconds.Two machines of different rotor size and composition reveal the phenomenon—andtests indicate variations with time of day, and compass orientation . . . thisdiscovery was unexpected as it has crept in loud and clear in a project aimed attesting a motor principle totally unrelated to “vacuum spin.” It has appearedobtrusively and I do not yet know whether, in adapting to its presence, it canserve in improving machine performance or become detrimental.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en526]I propose that gravity is what pushes on the rotor to get it spinning again withten times less energy. You create a flowing current in the Source Field and itwill still be there for a while—it doesn’t immediately disappear. The pyramidstructure appears to operate on the same basic principles—a solid-state machine,with no moving parts, that creates a stable, ongoing vortex in the Source Fieldsimply due to its shape. The flowing pyramid current doesn’t seem to have anynoticeable effect on the downward force of gravity, which is a much larger riverof energy moving through the whole area—but the pyramid shape does create adramatic increase in the coherence and structure of its surroundings, apparentlyby creating a measurable spin in the fluidlike flow of gravity. This, in turn,generates greater crystallization and organization within physical matter—anddramatically improves the health of biological life.Of course, other shapes would create Source Field currents as well—such as conesand cylinders. Let’s think back to Lyall Watson’s quotes from his bookSupernature that we shared earlier. A French firm patented a specially shapedcontainer because it made better yogurt, claiming it somehow improved themicrobial action. Czechoslovakian beer makers got better fermentation when theyused round barrels instead of angular ones. A German researcher found that micewould heal faster in spherical cages. And Canadian architects discovered thatschizophrenic patients showed a “sudden improvement” once they were relocated toa trapezoid-shaped hospital ward.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en527]We are now concentrating and focusing the energy of Mind just like we might workwith water or electricity—and the results are impressive.Dr. Viktor Grebennikov made many breakthroughs with these same principles,studying what he called the Cavity Structural Effect. He initially discoveredthe effect from bee honeycombs. There was a noticeable tingling and burningsensation in his hand over certain types of honeycombs. He also noticed thatwhen bees got lost on the way back to their hives late at night, they wouldstart trying to ram themselves right through the brick wall of the building—asif they could feel the energy of their hive, which was directly on the otherside of the wall. Grebennikov also speculated that bees were naturally attractedto the shape of flowers by this same effect. By simply creating a chair withhoneycombs or a stack of egg cartons suspended over the top of it, he gotnoticeable healing effects—and was granted Russian patent number 2061509 forthis invention.8 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en528]Einstein discovered that space and time were completely indivisible—twomanifestations of the same underlying energy. This suggests that as the SourceField (gravity) flows into an atom, it drives the flow of time within the atomas well. The speed of time would then be determined by the speed of the motioninside the atom. As the flow inside the atom becomes more coherent, time beginsmoving faster inside of it as well. This is an extremely important concept—as itsuggests that there could be much more variation in the flow of time from onelocal area to another than we ever imagined. Sid Hurwich may have independentlydiscovered the Aspden effect—the swirling energy we just found inside amagnet—and found a way to drive that flow into a current, not unlike a propellercreating a powerful vortex in water. This appears to be how he created such amassive change in the flow of time within a local area. Pier Luigi Ighina mayhave discovered the same thing with his magnetic stroboscope, shaped like astrange propeller, which was able to immediately open a hole in the clouds overhis lab.We already have a great start on a working model, but if this is really howthings work, then we need to find more evidence. We need to invent some way toobserve the flow of time in the laboratory—on a very sensitive mechanical level.(Precise digital clocks are built on the component level with a form ofshielding that stops them from being able to detect these fluctuations easily—aswe will discuss.) Once we find an appropriate system to detect the flow, wecould potentially catch time in the act of speeding up and slowing down. We mayeven find ways to change that speed on our own, just like Sid Hurwich apparentlydiscovered. This would obviously require innovative new designs that mostscientists had never thought of. So what are the options?Let’s think back to the rotation of the earth on its axis. When the Sun givesoff a burst of energy, the earth’s rotation slows down. The rotation of theSun’s inner core changes the speed of radioactive decay rates. These effects maybe caused by a change in the flow of time. What if we used a spinning gyroscopeto give us a much smaller model of the earth’s rotation in the laboratory? If wecould change the flow of time in a small local area, wouldn’t the speed of thegyroscope also change in that same spot?This is exactly what Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev discovered in the 1950s.KOZYREV’S STUNNING BREAKTHROUGHSKozyrev started out as a bright, gifted Russian scientist with a great futureahead of him. He was the first to propose that there may be ice on the moon wecould use for water, so we could eventually live on bases up there. Tragedystruck when the fascist policies of Stalin condemned him and many otherscientists to spend years in concentration camps. Stalin knew scientists weremore apt to be freethinkers who would oppose his hard-line Communist policies.While suffering through the horrors of the concentration camp, Kozyrev workedout the concept of a changing flow of time—and he began conducting experimentsto prove his ideas once he got free in the 1950s.An incredible scientific revolution was triggered—leading to over ten thousandpapers being published as of 1996.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en529]More than half of these papers were written by Russian scientists, though othershave explored these areas as well. This research has awesome implications,including a variety of usable new technologies. Since the flow of time canultimately affect gravity, weather, electromagnetic devices and the human mind,any nation that knew how to control it would have a clear tactical advantage.Thus, the Soviet government kept much of this research classified for “nationalsecurity.” It wasn’t until after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 that more ofthis groundbreaking information became available to the generalpublic—ultimately thanks to the Internet—but most of the scientific community isstill unaware of it. If it wasn’t for this robust, largely classified scientificbackground, Dr. Alexander Golod would probably never have spent the money tobuild his pyramids.The problem with keeping all this information secret is that this sciencecontains many of the blueprints for a Golden Age. We’ve already seen how it cancreate miraculous healing effects—including completely regrowing human teeth, aswell as dead or diseased organs. Ordinary water becomes a miracle cure that cansave premature babies that would otherwise almost certainly die. Anythingharmful to the human body becomes transformed into a nontoxic substance.Radioactivity is alleviated. Earthquakes, atmospheric disturbances and all otherpotential calamities are greatly reduced. Our overall level of intelligence andinsight appears to increase—perhaps because the energy in our holographic brainis moving faster. This faster “vibrational speed” in the holographic brain maybe causing our thoughts to move faster, making our overall IQ steadily increase.DNA can be seen like a jigsaw puzzle with more than one solution—so we cantransform into a higher level of what it means to be human. And now, we’re alsofinding out that we may even be able to control time.So now we have a gyroscope in a laboratory. If we can change the flow of time inthat local area, then perhaps the gyroscope will speed up or slow down. Here’sthe problem: The flow of time in the rest of our laboratory must not change.Otherwise, the clocks, the instruments, the energy fields and even our ownbodies would all speed up or slow down at the same time the gyroscope did—andthere would be no way for us to know that anything was happening. Einsteinthought the flow of time could not change in a local area like a science lab—itwas “locally invariant.” However, Kozyrev’s discoveries, along with the otherswe’ve already been discussing, throw that idea right out the window.A spinning gyroscope has a slow, circular wobble called precession, just likethe earth’s. When the flow of time slows down or speeds up, a small butnoticeable change will appear in the speed of a gyroscope’s precession—if youset it up according to Kozyrev’s instructions. These gyroscopes wereelectrically powered, so they would continue to run perfectly for long periodsof time. That meant any hiccups we might see in the rotation were not the resultof the gyroscope running out of energy and naturally slowing down.The changes Dr. Anderson found in the speeds that various NASA probes traveledthrough space were very small—only about thirteen millimeters per second.Kozyrev’s effects were also very small. According to A. P. Levich, who wrote anincredible summary of Kozyrev’s work that I will reference throughout thischapter, the amount of change in Kozyrev’s gyroscopes, or other mechanicaldetectors, could be as little as ten to the minus six, or ten to the minusseven, of the overall amount of movement in the object.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en530] This is comparable in size to thevery small changes NASA found in the speed their space probes were traveling.Therefore, Kozyrev needed to develop extremely sensitive methods in order todetect changes in the flow of time.Another mechanical detector that gave Kozyrev results was a beam balance, whichis just a bar dangling horizontally on a string, or filament, so it remainsperfectly level from left to right. Kozyrev found it was important that the beamweighed much more on one side than the other—in fact ten times as much—as thismade it much more sensitive to tiny little movements. However, the real “secretingredient” was to vibrate the hook the beam was hanging from at a high speed.Once you did this, the beam would move very suddenly and noticeably—even fromtouching it with the most delicate puff of air. For this very reason, you had tokeep it sealed under a glass dome, and suck all the air out of the inside. Thatway you could guarantee that air would not cause it to move. You then let thebeam come to a perfect state of rest, so it doesn’t appear to move at all.However, when there is a flicker in the flow of time, the vibrating speed of thehook at the top will make a subtle but delicate change. The beam is soprecariously balanced that this little change in vibrational speed actuallycauses it to move—noticeably.Kozyrev found a variety of things that would cause a change in the flow of time,as we will discuss in a minute. However, the greatest surprise of his life camewhen he was reading Goethe’s classic Faust, in which the hero is approached bythe devil, Mephistopheles, and offered the greatest riches of the world inexchange for his immortal soul. Don’t forget that Kozyrev went through grindinghunger, poverty and hard labor in the concentration camp. It’s easy to see howmany temptations he must have felt to steal food, shoes, clothing, blankets orsoap, or to find a way to avoid working. Thus, the story had a very personalfeeling. He sat there reading the book in his lab, near the balance-beamdetector. As the story reached its climax, he had a sudden emotional surge.Right at that very same moment, the beam suddenly turned and pointed at him.This was when he first realized that he had not merely discovered the flow oftime. It was not just an energy that flowed in and out of physical matter. Itwas the energy of Mind as well. The Source Field. With this discovery, Kozyrevcould now prove that our thoughts were not locked away privately in our ownbrains—they created measurable signals that his detectors could pick up. Manymore tests confirmed that this effect was real—and in the Global ConsciousnessProject, we find that when enough people think the same way, it creates aworldwide effect we can measure electronically. Kozyrev’s discovery fitsperfectly with everything we discovered in the early chapters—from Backster,Braud and so on. We do appear to be sharing the same Mind—at least to somedegree. That energy is all around us—and it actually has fluidlike flowpatterns.Some people might attack Kozyrev’s work and say that it had to be caused bymagnetic fields, or static electricity. He prevented this by also placing hisdetectors inside a Faraday cage, which screens out all electromagnetic fields.Keeping his detectors in a vacuum under glass insured that air couldn’t movethem either. If his detector started moving, he was now observing the flow oftime directly—a ripple in the Source Field.Another effective mechanical detector Kozyrev developed was a swinging pendulum,which was also electrically powered like the gyroscope. Once again, if hevibrated the hook it was hanging on, the pendulum responded to the time flowmuch more noticeably—just like we saw with the balance beam and the gyroscope.In this case, the actual direction of the pendulum’s swing would change. Ofcourse, he also had to keep it sealed in a vacuum and shielded fromelectromagnetic fields.CREATING AND ABSORBING TIMESo now what? We have three different choices of detectors, but now we have tofigure out what we can do to speed up or slow down the flow of time. Kozyrevfound that “ice melting, liquid evaporation, dissolution of substances in waterand even plant withering” would speed up the flow of time, or create time, asKozyrev called it. Furthermore, “the contrary processes, such as cooling ofbodies and water freezing, [will] absorb time,” thus causing the flow of time toslow down in a tiny but measurable way.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en531]This gives even more proof for the idea that the flow of time is actuallyresponsible for building and maintaining physical matter. When matter startsbreaking apart—when a piece of ice melts, a liquid evaporates, a substancedissolves in water or a plant dies—it gives off some of the energy stored withinit. We already saw Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp strike living DNA with a chemical thatmade it unwind and die, and in the process it released a burst of photons. Ialso suggested that the photons were not the only energy we should be lookingat; currents in the Source Field are also being released at the same time,causing effects Kozyrev could measure in the laboratory.This is such a central point that it does require more explanation. When matterbreaks down, the tight little circuits of coherent energy that have beenspinning along on the quantum level suddenly burst free. This creates a ripple—asudden release of energy and movement—in the Source Field. Then, as Kozyrevdiscovered, time speeds up in that immediate area as all that energy flows out.On the other hand, when the Source Field is spiraling into an area to increasecoherence, making matter more organized, time slows down in the surrounding,outside region. The flow in that outside area now behaves like the outer edge ofa whirlpool—where the water moves more slowly than it normally would if thevortex wasn’t there. In the case of Burlakov’s fish-egg experiment, where olderfish eggs seemed to be sucking the life force out of the younger ones, we cannow see that there is no cruelty involved by the hand of Nature. The older eggsare simply absorbing more Source Field energy than the weaker eggs, by theirnature—creating a stronger, faster vortex. This naturally draws energy away fromthe slower, weaker vortex of energy flowing into the younger eggs.As Kozyrev discovered, this temporary slowdown in the flow of time startshappening when an object cools down (thus making its quantum movement lesschaotic and more coherent, which in turn draws in more Source Field energy),water freezes (causing more coherent crystals to form), a life form such as aplant grows (increasing the coherence as new cells are formed), or crystals formout of a liquid solution. So again, any time we’re seeing crystallization andgrowth, these processes absorb energy from the Source Field—and time moves moreslowly in the surrounding area. This is obviously a whole new way of thinkingabout things. It’s strange to think of a decrease in heat as actually drawing anincrease in the flow of the Source Field, since we’re used to thinking of anincrease in heat as an increase in energy. In this case, there appears to be aninverse relationship between the level of heat and the amount of Source Fieldflow—or at least the amount of coherence we find in the Source Field. Heatdestroys coherence by increasing the amount of random, chaotic movement at thequantum level.Here are some of the things Kozyrev found that could change the flow of time inhis laboratory, one way or the other—creating measurable ripples in the SourceField, much like waves moving through a body of water:• the bending, breaking or deforming of a physical object• shooting a burst of air at an object• operating an hourglass filled with sand• friction• burning• any object or surface absorbing light• heating or cooling an object• phase transitions in substances (frozen to liquid, liquid to vapor, etc.)• dissolving and mixing substances• running electrical current through a wire• the actions of an observer, such as a movement of the head• the fading death of plants• sudden changes in human consciousnessIn one case, simply lifting a ten-kilogram weight up and down would create aripple in the flow of time—a wave—that could be measured two to three metersaway. This is just like what we would see if we were raising and lowering theweight underwater—there would be ripples we could then measure at a distance.Some time after I first read about this in 1999, I realized that this meant theSource Field, which exists all throughout space and time, must behave like afluid—and this became the key to solving the mysteries of sacred geometry, as wewill soon see—not to mention the pyramids.Kozyrev found that these ripples could travel right through solid brick walls asif they weren’t even there.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en532] Thishas led most Russian scientists to conclude that the flow of time has a muchcloser relationship with gravity than it does electromagnetism—as I said before.Electromagnetic energy can be shielded—but the force of gravity holds you downequally as well inside a brick building, or a lead-lined cage, as it doesoutside.NONMECHANICAL DETECTORSSo far, we’ve only studied the mechanical detectors Kozyrev developed. He alsofound other nonmechanical ways to study the flow of time as well—meaning thesewere methods that did not use any moving parts as we would normally think ofthem. The simplest of these detectors was heat.Every atom is filled with a constant frenzy of whirling movement, whichscientists call spin. When an object heats up, there is an increasing amount ofchaotic, unpredictable movement in the atom—which eventually causes it to giveoff a glowing red, yellow or white light. Heat creates random, unpredictable,chaotic movements that disrupt the free flow of the Source Field at the quantumlevel—reducing coherence. On the other hand, when an object cools down, there isless resistance to the quantum flow, and it will move faster and more smoothly.This explains why superconductors need to be kept at super-cool temperatures.The lack of heat creates a lack of movement that would interrupt the flow ofelectrical current. Kozyrev thus realized he could measure changes in time withan ordinary mercury thermometer—kept in an environment where the temperature wasotherwise being held constant.Kozyrev also found that his experiments worked best in the first half of thewinter. In the summer, the heat in the surrounding area seemed to have ascrambling effect on the overall flow of time—and this made it difficult or evenimpossible for any of his experiments to work properly. The increase in heatreduced the coherence in the Source Field.Kozyrev also found that the flow of electricity could be affected by changes inthe flow of time—and this was the same effect that the Global ConsciousnessProject was apparently detecting. Professor Simon Shnoll also used electricalcurrent as one of his tools to detect changes in the flow of time. Kozyrev foundthat tungsten metal was extremely responsive to the flow of time. Tungsten’selectrical conductivity could be permanently changed if you zapped it with astrong enough time flow. Another time flow detector was a quartz crystal. Whenyou see the word quartz on a watch, that means there is a crystal inside of itwith electricity running through it. The flow of electricity causes the quartzcrystal to resonate at a speed that is steady enough to keep solid time. Thecrystal in a watch is shielded from Source Field influence, on a componentlevel, by methods we will discuss below. For that reason, we normally do not seeany changes in how a quartz watch keeps time—and the scientists who built themthat way probably never realized what they were actually doing. However, if youblast a nonshielded quartz crystal with a strong enough time flow, its vibratingspeed will change—and Kozyrev could measure this in the laboratory. Again, thischange can be permanent—showing that the molecular structure has actuallychanged.Yet another interesting nonmechanical detector of the time flow was thethickness or viscosity of water. When the flow of time slows down in water,there is less coherence. Random movements interrupt the water’s ability to flow.As a result, the water becomes thicker, or more viscous, meaning it will notflow as quickly or easily. When the flow of time speeds up in water, coherenceincreases—and it flows faster. This can easily be measured. Chemical reactionsalso speed up and slow down, just like we saw in Shnoll’s research. And lastly,Kozyrev found that living things such as bacteria and plants will grow faster orslower depending upon how fast the flow of time is moving through them—and theirown local area. This should sound very familiar by now. Kozyrev was anotherearly pioneer who discovered that our own health could be directly affected bythe flow of time as it moves through our cells.SPIRALING CURRENTS OF TIMEKozyrev also found that the flow of time does not push through space in astraight line—it spins, or twists, as it moves along: “time possesses not onlyenergy but also a rotation . . . which it can transmit to a system.”13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en533] This means the flow will manifest asa rotating movement once you see it affecting a gyroscope, beam balance,pendulum or any other system—just like what we saw in Dr. Aspden’s experimentwith the magnetic rotor. A scientific word for “spinning” or “twisting” istorsion. For this reason, many Russian scientists call these “waves of time”torsion fields. I prefer to use the term Source Field, because I feel it givesus a much better sense of how this energy is ultimately responsible for creatingeverything in the Universe. Nonetheless, this twist in gravity is where we findall the magic of the Source Field in our model.Some molecules, such as sugar, are considered right-handed, meaning that theirmolecules predominantly spiral together in a clockwise fashion. Others, such asturpentine or salt, are left-handed, where the molecules are mostlycounterclockwise. Kozyrev found that right-handed molecules absorb the flow oftime and slow it down. Similarly, left-handed molecules strengthen the flow oftime—and speed it up. As Kozyrev and others discovered, the more this SourceField energy flows into your body, the healthier you will be—so if you eat toomany sweets, you are causing the Source Field to be absorbed by the sugar,rather than by your DNA—which needs to store light to maintain itself. A greatway to test how well you’re doing is by checking your pH balance, which can bedone with little strips of paper you hold in your mouth for a few minutes.Sugars, saturated fats, meats, dairy, sweet fruits, white flour, prepackagedfoods, alcohol and drugs all bring you closer to the acid side of the scale, andhealthy, natural foods like fresh organic vegetables, nuts, seeds, andless-sweet fruits bring you closer to the alkaline side. You do need both sides,to some degree. Although Kozyrev found that salt strengthens the flow of time,too much is very bad, because of its effect on your blood pressure—and the workyour body has to do to clean it out of your bloodstream. In some rare cases,people can become too alkaline—but in general it’s very, very hard to overdoseon fresh vegetables. Either way, it’s all about balance.So, the flow of time can actually speed up in left-handed molecules and slowdown in right-handed molecules. These same principles led Kozyrev to discoverthat common polyethylene film, like PVC plastic, could actually shield thespinning currents in the Source Field. Aluminum is also a very effective shield.This makes it a very bad idea to live inside an aluminum trailer, as you areshielding off the very fields that will keep you healthy. They will still getin, but the spin is disrupted. The amount of coherence within those spaces willbe lower. Gravity will still push you down, but the level of spin, or torsion,within it will be reduced—and in our model, the genetic information in theSource Field is hidden in these spiraling forces. Aluminum is used inelectronics at the component level due to its extremely light weight—and manycomponents are also then coated in plastic. Therefore, digital watches andhighly accurate laboratory clocks are not likely to respond to changes in theflow of time in a noticeable way. However, in 1993 Dr. Bruce DePalma found thatthe Accutron watch, which runs on a metallic tuning fork, does speed up and slowdown in the presence of these fields.14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en534]In 2001, Dr. Hartmut Müller15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en535] usedthe spin fields within gravity to make a telephone call from the ToezlerMedientage building in Germany to Saint Petersburg in Russia. No electromagneticfields were ever used to make this call—just as Backster’s plants, bacteria,insects, animals and human cells could “talk” to each other while they were inshielded rooms. You can call from deep inside a concrete parking garage, at thebottom of the ocean or halfway across the galaxy, and you will always get aperfect real-time signal. Müller’s discovery also does not create“electromagnetic smog” that can cause cancer, headaches and other problems,16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en536] and this technology could be easilyadapted for wireless Internet access—using the same systems preferred bybiological life.ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATIONSSome scientists who have studied Kozyrev’s material are willing to consider thatsomething significant is going on, but they’re not comfortable with the ideathat these effects are actually caused by the flow of time. This brings us toone of the most fascinating areas Kozyrev studied—namely astronomy. Kozyrevbelieved that “stars are machines” that get their energy from the time flow—andhe found very compelling evidence to prove it. As Levich wrote in 1996, most ofKozyrev’s experiments in the later years of his life were “dedicated to directdetection . . . of non-electromagnetic [energy] flows from planets, stars,galaxies, stellar clusters and nebulae.”17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en537]What exactly does this mean? Beginning in the mid-1950s, Kozyrev designed aspecial type of telescope that had one of his time flow detectors located rightat the focal point. As strange as this sounds, he could put a metal plate infront of the telescope—blocking out all visible light and all electromagneticradiation—but the time-flow detector still picked up a measurable signal when heaimed the telescope at a star, or any other celestial object. This could not bepossible unless he was detecting an energy that was not electromagnetic—and hadnothing to do with visible light.The light from a star can take many millions of years to reach us—and in themeantime, the real position of the star has actually drifted somewhere else. Sowhen we look at the night sky, we are looking at the past. Kozyrev found that ifhe aimed his telescope at the true position of a star, which could be estimatedthrough various means, the signal was much stronger.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en538] This suggested that the waves withinthe Source Field traveled much, much faster than the speed of light—effectivelyinstantaneously.And if that isn’t already confusing enough, Kozyrev could then look at where thestar would likely end up in the future, and he detected energy coming from thatposition as well. I know—it sounds totally crazy, but when you get new data thatis strange, that doesn’t mean we throw it away. Instead, we try to understandwhat the heck is going on, and explain the data. Obviously, as I’m sure you cansee, the comfortable, old-fashioned notion of linear time simply can’t hold upin light of this new evidence, if Kozyrev is actually right.Indeed, the strongest energy from a star or celestial object came from its trueposition—defeating Einstein’s belief that no energy field could ever travelfaster than the speed of light. A star’s energy then got steadily weaker whenyou moved toward its position in the past, and weaker when you moved thetelescope toward its position in the future. The overall change of intensitywould graph out the same way in both directions. 19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en539] It’s as if the star were spread outin time, like a wave—and you could detect its position in the past, present andfuture all at once, just by observing the Source Field instead of theelectromagnetic light waves. The closer you were to the star’s current position,the more of its energy you could detect.TIME MUST BE THREE-DIMENSIONALThis is a very significant discovery, as it shows that the Source Field is notconfined to linear time. As mind-boggling as it must seem, everything is allthere at once. The past, present and future positions of the star all give offmeasurable energy, and only the strength of the energy changes—in time. This mayexplain how Dr. Hartmut Müller’s cell-phone technology created phone calls thatwere instantaneous, regardless of the distance involved. We take it for grantedthat the past is forever behind us and the future cannot be known, but inKozyrev’s science, the future actually casts a shadow into the past—which we cansee and measure with relatively simple technology. Time could not behave likethis if it was only one-dimensional. In some very real sense, time must bethree-dimensional in order for this effect to work—and we will explore that ideain the next chapter.Doesn’t this all sound familiar, though? Remote viewers rigorously demonstratedtheir ability to see events in the future before they actually happened. Dr.Daryl J. Bem, an emeritus professor at Cornell University, got a study publishedin The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that rigorously demonstratedthe ability of ordinary people to predict the future. Many people haveexperienced prophetic events in their own lives, but often write them off ascoincidence. Remember our discussion about the energetic duplicate that youleave behind in your chair every time you get up? Remember how some part of youis still sitting there in the chair, capturing light into photons, for up tothirty days? Kozyrev’s astonishing observations finally help us explain the DNAPhantom Effect. Once DNA has been kept in a certain area for a period of time,its energy will still be there when the physical molecules are moved away.Gravity provides the force to hold the photons in place—on the quantum level.Gariaev did not detect any effect from the future position of DNA, but this maysimply require new experiments with these concepts in mind. We definitely see aphantom effect happening in stars, thanks to Kozyrev’s work.Kozyrev didn’t live to see how his observations of the nonlocal behavior ofstars may have extended into our own DNA—but as we remember, he did find thathis own thoughts could generate a time flow that the detectors would pick up.Given all the wavelike effects Kozyrev discovered, it is clear that the energyof our DNA Phantom and energetic duplicate is rippling into our surroundings—itis not just stuck within our own bodies, even from one moment to the next as weare sitting still. In fact, it may very well be that all the thoughts we haveare rippling through the entire Source Field in some way—instantaneously. Brainwaves may be much more than just electrical signals—they apparently createcurrents that we constantly release into our surroundings. This was rigorouslydemonstrated in the first five chapters—and our pineal gland may well be themost important part of the brain for sending and receiving these thoughts.Obviously, the closer we are to the source of the thoughts, the stronger thesignal will be. In the Global Consciousness Project, the closer any one computerwas to New York during 9/11, the stronger the effects became. Our thoughts arenot confined to our own brains and bodies—they have measurable effects on ourenvironment.Kozyrev realized that stars are sending energy through the Universe atinstantaneous speeds. He then had a remarkable insight—this instantaneous energyexchange could explain the often-overlooked problem of binary stars inconventional astronomy. A surprising number of stars we see in the night skyshow up in pairs. You have two stars sitting right next to each other withsimilar size, brightness and light emissions. It is as if they were talking toeach other—there is an energetic connection between them that allows them tosynchronize. From where we look, they seem so close to each other that ordinaryelectromagnetic fields could explain this effect. However, according to Kozyrev,the speed of light is actually much too slow to account for thiscommunication—the actual distances involved are far too great. In 1966, at ameeting of the International Astronomical Union, Kozyrev proposed that binarystars were caused by two stars energetically harmonizing with each other throughthe flow of time—at speeds much faster than light.20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en540]So again, Kozyrev discovered that there was energy emerging from the past,present and future positions of a star. We have also seen our own DNA leavingbehind a measurable energetic blueprint from where it had been in the past. Evenwhen the DNA is no longer there, our DNA Phantom can still capture and storephotons of light—it has very real, measurable energetic effects. Now that we arearmed with all this knowledge, we have a practical model for how solar,planetary and other astronomical cycles, perhaps including the 25,920-yearprecession, may be affecting us. As earth traces its orbit around the Sun, itwill leave a measurable energy behind in its position from the past. Once wecome back around to the same position again, a year later, that energy is stillthere. That means if the energy has measurable effects on how we think and feel,those consciousness effects will also return once more. This may also behappening as earth’s axis changes position while it drifts through theprecession.With Kozyrev’s discoveries under our belt, we now have definite, provable signsof action at a distance, as Einstein called it. The position of every planet,moon, asteroid and comet in our solar system now has the potential to affect allthe others in measurable ways—just as Shnoll’s discoveries strongly implied.Energy appears to be exchanged instantaneously as these celestial objects dancearound—pushing and pulling on the flow of time. Our own solar system appears tobe moving into an area of greater coherence—which is creating a short-term,rapid evolution of human DNA and consciousness, as we’ve discussed. The Mayacalendar end-date, the expected arrival date for the Age of Aquarius and theexact time window for the coming Golden Age in Hindu scriptures all highlightthe same, small window of time—circa 2012—as a key watermark for when thesechanges will occur. Humans gained a massive burst of intelligence fifty thousandyears ago, and the Neanderthals phased out of the evolutionary cycle sometwenty-five thousand years ago—right on schedule with the end of each GreatYear. Our DNA has been evolving one hundred times faster in the last fivethousand years than in all human history. More and more, it seems that ourancient ancestors knew what they were talking about.HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE THE FLOW OF TIME?The strangest and most amazing part of Kozyrev’s work was in finding out thatour own minds can actually change the flow of time. This also appears to be whatthe Global Consciousness Project discovered. If the human mind really can makethe flow of time speed up or slow down, then what about highly gifted people?Could they possibly do things that were much more extraordinary and dramaticthan what Kozyrev has discovered?In his book China’s Super Psychics, Paul Dong wrote about children who are“Extra High Functioning,” or EHF. In 1992, China held an official meeting forU.S. oil executives at the Tianjin City Human Body Science Institute. This wasconsidered a high honor for the visiting dignitaries, as they were permitted towitness something that very few Westerners have ever been allowed to see. Ayoung girl named Yao Zheng was seated in front of a series of flower buds thatwere days or even weeks away from opening. The dignitaries watched her in goodlighting, from several different angles. After she prayed for about fifteenminutes, she was able to speed up time within the buds—and they suddenly bloomedin front of everyone’s own eyes. Another child sitting next to her was able toteleport pills out of a sealed glass bottle, without ever opening it, and neverbrought any part of her body closer than one or two feet away from the bottle.Paul Dong revealed just how far this phenomenon really can go.There are many people with the ability to open flowers in China, and Yao Zhengis only one example. Of course, there are others whose powers are stronger. Onthe evening of April 1, 1994, in the Beijing Signal Corps auditorium, Colonel FuSongshan was able to open all of the flower buds in the hands of an audience ofover a thousand people within thirty minutes. . . . However, Fu Songshan is notthe top man. There is one mysterious woman who, facing thousands upon thousandsof flower buds, can make them all bloom instantly by saying, “I want you all toopen,” and waving her hand.”21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en541]In The Synchronized Universe, Dr. Claude Swanson discusses experiments in Chinain which a tiny, battery-powered radio transmitter was allegedly teleported fromthe pocket of one individual, through a wall and into a sealed container held byanother person. The transmitter broadcast a steady frequency of electromagneticsignals, allowing for a precise measurement of time to be calculated. Theseimpressive feats were witnessed by Hartwig Hausdorf and discussed in his 1998book The Chinese Roswell.As the teleportation occurred, the frequency of the transmitter . . . sloweddown and actually stopped for a brief moment during the transmission, thengradually returned to the original frequency. This suggests that time itself mayhave been affected by the teleportation, since frequency is a measure of time.This behavior is reminiscent of what happens in quantum mechanics. If anelementary particle, such as an electron, stops in space, its frequency becomesvery low and its position becomes spread out over a large area. This is aconsequence of the Uncertainty Principle. If this is [what happened in] theChinese experiment, it suggests that the teleportation process involves aquantumlike delocalization of the object.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en542]Swanson also mentions Tara Bey, an Indian yogi who could slow time to almost astandstill within his own body. His helpers actually covered his eyes, ears,nose and mouth with wax to prevent insects from entering his body—and if he wasgoing to do it for weeks or more, he instructed his helpers to seal his entirebody in wax. That’s right—he never even drew a single breath. The yogi explainedto Paul Brunton how it works.People, when confronted with the phenomena which I can produce, think it eithersome kind of conjuring, or else something entirely supernatural. In both casesthey are wrong. They do not seem to grasp the fact that these things areperfectly scientific, obeying the laws of nature herself. It is true that I amusing psychic laws which are little understood—but nevertheless, they are laws.Nothing that I do is arbitrary, supernatural, or against such laws.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en543]The ancient prophecies of a Golden Age suggest that spectacular abilities likethis will not remain in the hands of a small number of extremely talentedpeople—they will become commonplace. And if human beings can create suchremarkable changes in the flow of time, then we should ultimately be able toaccomplish the same feats with technology—just as Sid Hurwich apparentlydiscovered. Indeed, Kozyrev’s work may well be just the very beginning of awhole new world that we will soon have at our fingertips."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENWhat’s the Matter—Dematerialization, Teleportation and Time TravelDr. Nikolai Kozyrev’s most astonishing discovery was that stars give offmeasurable energy—from their past, present and future positions. The energy isthe strongest in the current, actual position of the star, and decreases in asmooth, even curve as you look at either its past or its future position. We doalso know there is a very similar effect occurring in quantum physics—thoughonly a handful of scientists seem to understand what is actually going on. Everyquantum physicist knows you can look at a subatomic particle and measure it asif it were perfectly solid and stable—but then when you use other measuringtechniques, the particle turns into a wave—and it becomes nonlocal. This seemsto defy our intuition completely, and has led to the so-called UncertaintyPrinciple—which is a fancy way of saying, “We just don’t know what the heck isgoing on down at the quantum level. Nothing seems to exist in any stable,rational, logical way down there. It’s not a particle, it’s not a wave—it’ssomething we can never understand. It’s both at the same time.”Since Einstein proved that space and time are interconnected, particles are notmerely spreading out in space when they turn into waves—they are also nonlocalin time.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en544] That means some of theparticle now appears in the past, some of it is still there in the present, andsome of it has moved into the future. As mind-boggling as this must sound,“wave-particle duality” has been observed in protons, neutrons, electrons andeven entire atoms2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en545]—and that’s allthere is down there. This means everything in the quantum realm pops in and outof existence all the time. We do have all the evidence we need to understandthis, but we’re just not used to thinking this way. Conventional scientistscannot explain what is going on, and therefore have concluded that the mysterywill never be solved. We simply live in a universe of uncertainty. Thankfully,this is not true. There is an answer, as we will see—it just hasn’t gotten verypopular yet.If this idea of entire atoms dematerializing isn’t strange enough, the mysterygot even greater in 1999, thanks to Dr. Olaf Nairz and his colleagues. Nairz andhis crew were able to transform a soccer-ball-shaped cluster of 60 carbonmolecules—known as a fullerene or buckyball—directly into a wave. (This hollow,geometric sphere of carbon atoms was first devised by Buckminster Fuller, so itwas named after him.) Bear in mind that buckyballs are solid objects. They caneven be used to store other materials inside of them. Each buckyball has a massof 720 atomic units, built from 60 different carbon atoms that are tightly boundtogether. And yet, by simply bumping the buckyball against a wall with a seriesof tiny slits in it, Nairz was able to transform it into a wave—and it poppedthrough more than one slit at the same time.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en546]If you and I had this ability, a locked door would never be able to stop us. Allwe’d have to do is run toward it at top speed and collide with it. As soon as wehit the door, instead of having a terribly painful injury, we’d pop into a wave.Then, as a wave, we would slip through the cracks along one or more of the foursides of the door—only to immediately pop back into our normal, solid physicalform on the other side. That’s what these little geometric objects are doing.This experiment is ridiculously simple, and its full implications havedefinitely not yet become a part of our common knowledge—even though it waspublished in the prestigious journal Nature.4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en547] Then in 2001, this same groupdiscovered they did not need to slam the buckyballs against a wall—all theyneeded was laser light, which is coherent light, to transform these solidobjects into waves.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en548] This waspublished in Physics Review Letters, a respected science journal.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en549]Faced with these paradoxes, some scientists have already started to “think theunthinkable.” What if these particles are not actually doing something that isseemingly impossible? What if they are simply flip-flopping in and out of areality where they have some room to stretch out and relax, because time is notlinear? Tim Folger discussed a similar concept in a Discover magazine articlefrom 2007.Some four decades ago, the renowned physicist John Wheeler, then at Princeton,and the late Bryce DeWitt, then at the University of North Carolina, developedan extraordinary equation that provides a possible framework for unifyingrelativity and quantum mechanics. But the Wheeler-DeWitt equation has alwaysbeen controversial. . . . “One finds that time just disappears from theWheeler-DeWitt equation,” says Carlo Rovelli, a physicist at the University ofthe Mediterranean in Marseilles, France. . . . “It may be that the best way tothink about quantum reality is to give up the notion of time—that thefundamental description of the universe must be timeless.”7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en550]Ever since relativity and quantum mechanics emerged, dealing with the very largeand the very small, scientists have struggled to unify them. Einstein’s dreamwas that ultimately everything would be made from the unified field—meaningthere are no protons, no neutrons, no electrons—just rotations of the Fielditself. The problem, of course, is that these weird time-bending properties ofquantum mechanics don’t seem to allow us to build a working model like that.However, according to Discover, we may be able to solve all these problems bychanging how we think about time.A sizable minority of physicists, Rovelli included, believe that any successfulmerger of the two great masterpieces of twentieth-century physics willinevitably describe a universe in which, ultimately, there is no time. . . .[Even better,] all the laws—whether Newton’s, Einstein’s, or the quirky quantumrules—would work equally well if time ran backward.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en551]Therefore, these radical new concepts about the nature of time cannot be shotdown by skeptics who use science as a weapon—they are already on the verge ofbeing accepted as scientific facts. We don’t need time to be linear in order toexplain the laws of physics. It is unfortunate that Kozyrev’s research is notcommonly known outside of Russian scientific circles, as it provides dramaticnew evidence to help us understand that when the particle turns into a wave,it’s still a particle. Only now, it’s a particle in time.DEWEY LARSON AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL TIMEIn our own reality, time keeps moving forward at a steady rate—barring a fewlittle hiccups and glitches. That’s why Einstein assumed it was onlyone-dimensional. However, if we want to solve the biggest scientific mysteries,all we have to do is allow time to have three dimensions. The idea of anythingin nature being one-dimensional is nothing more than a mathematical concept—notunlike the idea that the earth could be flat. Dr. Dewey Larson built a verysuccessful model of our Universe, beginning in the 1950s, by assuming time hasthree dimensions—but mainstream scientists wouldn’t accept it. Nonetheless,Larson was able to solve many of the greatest quantum physics problems, as wellas many perplexing issues in astronomy, with this model. Larson concluded therewas a three-dimensional Time Region, or what I and others now like to calltime-space—which is constantly interacting with our own three dimensions ofspace-time. Larson’s other big concept was that the entire Universe is formed bynothing more than motion—and what’s moving, in my opinion, is the Source Field.Gravity, electromagnetic energy, and all the other forces normally associatedwith quantum mechanics are just different ways of talking about the same thing.The entire Universe is built from nothing more than fluidlike, swirling vortexeswithin the Source Field. Einstein’s greatest dream—of a Unified Field—wascorrect.Here’s a more technical way of saying the same thing from K. Nehru, a scientistdeveloping Larson’s theory.Larson asserts that the atom is without parts, that it is a unit of compoundmotion—[with] motion being the basic constituent of the physical universe. Thismeans that both the nucleus and the so-called orbital electrons arenon-existent. Secondly, he argues that there is no electrical force either,involved in the atomic structure. This, therefore, leaves gravitation and thespace-time progression as the only two motions (forces) that operate inside theTime Region . . . .9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en552]Based on all the available evidence, gravitation and the “space-timeprogression” are the exact same thing—which is ultimately what Larson is sayingby concluding that “All is Motion.” It’s a very mind-expanding concept toconsider that gravity is powering physical matter. That’s all there is. Nothingelse. Just a flowing vortex within a mysterious force we usually call gravity.Without the flow of gravity doing its work, there would be no matter—at leastnot anything that was visible in our own space-time.According to Nehru, this same theory, which Larson calls the Reciprocal System,also does an excellent job of clarifying astrophysics observations.Besides other things, the concept of coordinate [three-dimensional] time in theReciprocal System explains and derives the characteristics of supernovae, thewhite dwarfs, the pulsars, the quasars, the compact X-ray sources and the cosmicrays—without taking recourse to concepts like degenerate matter, the curvatureof space-time, etc. . . . All [Einstein’s] so-called Relativistic effects comeout, in the Reciprocal System, of the existence of this additional timecomponent.10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en553]Better yet, Larson predicted the existence of quasars in 1959, even though theyweren’t officially discovered until 1963 by Maarten Schmidt.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en554]A computer programmer named Dave Ashley12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en555] read Larson’s books after hearing metalk about them in my videos, and then was brave enough to start a discussion onthe James Randi skeptics’ forum about it.[Larson’s physics] makes obsolete the last 100 years or so of conventionalwisdom as regards the physics of everything. As such it is not acceptable to themainstream scientific communities. It can’t get accepted into peer-reviewedjournals because it essentially is debunking all of current theory. . . .[Larson’s model] makes a huge number of accurate predictions about atoms,chemicals, spacing between atoms in compounds, and such. The numbers add up. . .. If [Larson] is right, a whole lot of professors and graduate students are outof a job. There goes the gravy train of government grants. If the underlyingphysics is really much simpler, it won’t take years of painstaking study to “getit.” It could be taught in high school. So there is a very strong vestedinterest in maintaining the status quo.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en556]SPACE AND TIME ARE EXACT OPPOSITES OF EACH OTHERLarson named his theory the Reciprocal System because he felt that space andtime were in a perfectly opposite relationship to each other . . . a reciprocalrelationship. Though most people believe space and time couldn’t be moredifferent, Larson said that’s only because we’ve been conditioned to think thatway. Instead, Larson now invites us to envision a parallel reality, all aroundus, which is just like the space we now see—in almost every way. This parallelreality would have solid objects and livable areas just like our own—made fromthe same atoms and molecules we see all around us. Our scientists would normallythink these atoms exist only as waves in this stage of their existence.Remember—a wave over here is a solid particle over there.We might even enter this parallel reality and walk around in it by certain meanswe will soon discuss. The only difference is that from our perspective, thisparallel reality would all exist in a higher dimension—or more correctly, threeparallel dimensions. Theoretically, we are surrounded by this parallelreality—by time-space—right now. It’s where the energetic duplicate of ourphysical body and brain would be found. It’s very likely where we go in dreams,out-of-body experiences, remote-viewing sessions or the so-called afterlife. Andthe main way we can measure this parallel reality is by tracking its effects onthe flow of time.One of the most mind-expanding concepts Larson raises is that the space we seearound us, the Known Universe, isn’t strictly real at all. The parallel realityof time-space isn’t actually real either. The only thing that does genuinelyexist is the three real dimensions that they both are a part of. Within thesethree real dimensions, energy constantly flows between the two realities so theycan both continue to exist. (Technically, Larson would call this motion, notenergy, but I believe we are still talking about the same thing.)Simply put, all the energy that makes space in our reality is the same energythat powers time in the parallel reality. And all the energy that makes space inthe parallel reality is the energy that powers time in our reality. Althoughthis seems totally impossible to visualize at first, the reason why it works isthat this flowing exchange between space and time is constantly happening withinevery single atom and molecule of our visible Universe. That means both of theserealities are stable locations we can visit—and they are totally interconnectedwith each other. Neither of these two realities can exist separately. They areintimately and totally dependent upon each other for their own survival. It isutterly impossible to separate them. We can watch atoms and molecules winkinginto and out of this parallel reality all the time—but up until now we have hadno idea what we’re really seeing. This also means the space we see is actuallyan illusion and every point is ultimately the center of the universe.A PARALLEL REALITY—IN TIMEAgain, theoretically this means everything you see around you has an energeticduplicate—not just your own body. In this parallel reality, your room wouldstill look like your room. More precisely, your room would at least be the mostobvious area you would see, because your room would be the closest point in timeto the moment you entered into this parallel reality. You might also see dimmer,ghostlike images where your house didn’t exist yet—because there was anotherbuilding there. Or there was no building at all—just an open field. Under theright circumstances, you may even be able to see back into prehistoric times,where there were dinosaurs around. Or perhaps you see glorious hints of acrystal city that might be there in the future. Nonetheless, these would be likeshadows or phantoms in most cases—and may be far too weak to even be visible.Another strange outcome of this theory is that simply walking around in thisparallel reality will have an effect much like fast-forwarding or rewinding avideotape, in terms of what you actually see. How can you know whether you willwalk into the future or stroll into the past? You have to stretch yourimagination even more to get the answer, but this does seem to be how theUniverse really works.If you stay perfectly still when you go into this parallel reality, you won’ttravel in time. It’s only when you start moving around that you either go intothe future or the past. Let’s be clear that even though you could walk aroundand explore things, no one here in our reality would be able to see you. Larsonsaid that from our normal perspective on earth, you would be stuck in space.From a quantum physics perspective, you would appear to have turned into a wave.If anyone could see you at all, you might look like the typical description of aghost. Even though you are free to move around in this parallel universe, andyou certainly can, all you’re actually doing is moving around in time. “Onlymotion in time can take place in the time region.”14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en557] That means moving from one locationto another in this parallel reality is actually time travel.TIME TRAVEL EXPLAINEDHowever, saying you are totally stuck in space isn’t strictly correct either.The evidence we will investigate in later chapters tells us that if you pop inat one point, walk to another location and pop back out, you will indeedteleport between those two locations here on earth. Even better, if you walkedfar enough in the parallel reality, you would have noticeably time-traveled whenyou return. This is called a time slip, and we will review solid evidence thatvortexes naturally appear on earth that can cause this to happen. Such vortexexperiences are often misrepresented as “UFO abductions” with “missing time.”Skeptics have thrown a wealth of scientific data in the garbage because theyjust can’t stretch their imagination far enough to recognize the truth. As wewill see, even a decent walk in time-space won’t typically buy you more thanfive days of travel through time—at least under typical circumstances. Thedistance you travel over there by walking doesn’t really add up to a whole lotof time.How do you know which way you’re going, in time, if all you’re doing is walkingaround? Here’s the secret: If you go ahead of where the earth was when you gotthere, you will go into the future. If you go behind where the earth was, youwill go into the past. The trick, of course, is that the earth is rotating onits axis and revolving around the Sun. The Sun in turn is revolving around thegalaxy, and the galaxy is drifting toward the Virgo cluster. Thankfully, thelaws of the Universe don’t leave us stranded out in our absolute position inspace when we move into time-space. Even as we move forward and backward intime, we stay with the earth. The earth rotates from west to east—so that meansif you head east, you will start seeing the future, and if you head west, youwill start seeing the past. (If you want to get really technical about it, youcould say that you will see more of the future, or more of the past, since timeis all spread out.)Gravity is also pushing you down, and that’s powering time as well. The flow ofgravity is the flow of time—just like gravity is the flow that makes matter.Therefore, if you go up in time-space, you will move into the past—before themoment of time gravity had pushed you into when you started. If you go down, youwill move into the future—after the moment of time gravity had pushed you into.The amount of time you shift through in these cases may not be very much, but incertain circumstances the effects can be measured precisely.THE NATIONAL AIRLINES 727 “TIME SLIP”A plane obviously heads down on the way into an airport. What if it then hits arelatively small vortex into time-space? In 1974, Charles Berlitz wrote atantalizing three-paragraph summary of an event just like this in his classicbook The Bermuda Triangle. In this account, Berlitz says the plane wasapproaching from the northeast, meaning it would be traveling southwest—but aswe will see, Martin Caidin interviewed many more eyewitnesses and said the planewas coming in west of Miami International, meaning it was traveling east—makingit even more likely to be heading into the future if it did hit such a vortex.An incident involving time lapse occurred at the Miami airport about five yearsago, which has never been satisfactorily explained. It concerned a NationalAirlines 727 passenger plane which, on approach to landing from the northeast,and being tracked on radar by the Air Control Center, suddenly disappeared fromthe radar screen for about ten minutes and then reappeared. The plane landedwithout incident, and the pilot and crew evinced some surprise over theexpressed concern of the ground crew since, as far as the crew was concerned,nothing unusual had happened. By way of an explanation, one of the Air Controlstaff said to one of the pilots, “Man, for ten minutes you just did not exist.”It was at this point that the crew checked their watches and the various timeindicators in the plane, and discovered that they were uniformly ten minutesslow according to real time. This was especially remarkable, as the plane hadmade a routine time check twenty minutes before the incident, and at that timethere was no time discrepancy.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en558]There seems to be much missing from this story, if it is really true. You havean entire plane full of people who spontaneously popped ten minutes into thefuture. If they were at 8:50 P.M. when they went in, they were still at 8:50P.M. when they came back out—even though everyone else’s watch now said 9:00P.M.. Thankfully, a pilot and researcher named Martin Caidin did a much morethorough investigation of this incident, and reported his results in his 1991book Ghosts of the Air. Caidin didn’t just read books about it.I spoke to some of the people involved. Airline captains, friends of mine whoaided in research, officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, a literalhost of investigators, all pooled their information to bring it together beforeI put this down on paper.16 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en559]Caidin writes that the 727 was coming in for a landing at Miami with all theirequipment working just fine. The pilots followed the air traffic controllers’instructions and turned the plane when they were asked to—heading in on theinvisible corridors they were assigned. Then, without warning, their blip on theradar disappeared. Of course, this could be caused by electrical failures, radarglitches, or a crew member switching off the transponder system—but it alsomeant the 727 could have crashed into “the swampy ground far to the west ofMiami International.”Now, by necessity, there was a real panic.Immediately the alarms sounded. The reactions are automatic. The word goes outfrom Miami Approach and Departure, and the tower, for all aircraft in thatsector to “look for a Seven Two Seven that’s gone off the scope.” Pilots strainto see any signs; a reflection of sunlight from metal, a flashing strobe, brightflames, rising smoke—anything.Nothing. She was gone.Miami Approach hit the alarm signals to the coast guard and other rescue forces.Choppers bolted from the ground and raced to the last-known position of theNational 727.Nothing.Then, precisely ten minutes after the radar blip vanished from the set scopes inMiami Approach, the blip reappeared before the astonished eyes of the people nowcrowded around that radar position.Reappearance was strange enough. But this was ten minutes after the 727 haddisappeared, and now it had reappeared in exactly the same position it held inflight when it vanished—both on radar and in flight. [It may have movedslightly, but only enough to cause a ten-minute time slip.]The 727 pilot continued talking with Miami Approach, and then Miami Tower, in anabsolutely calm voice. Nothing unusual could be discerned from his tone or hiswords. The still-astounded radar operator worked the 727 in closer, and thenhanded off the airliner to the tower for final landing instructions. The 727slid in, flaps extended and gear down, and made an absolutely normal landing.The airliner was directed to park in an area separate from the terminal gate.When it stopped and the doors opened, federal investigators and officials ofNational couldn’t get into that jetliner fast enough. The crew regarded withsome astonishment of their own this unexpected and unexplained flurry ofactivity and barrage of questions. Then they were told what had happened. “Youdisappeared from the scope on your descent. For ten minutes there was no radarpicture of you people. When you came back on the scope, your position wasexactly where it had been. Not only that, but several airliners flew through thespace you had occupied in those ten minutes. What happened up there?”The crew—and the passengers who were questioned—were in a different situation.Something incredible had happened to them, and they didn’t know the first thingabout it. “Nothing happened,” the captain insisted. “Nothing out of theordinary, that is. We were on approach, and we came in, and we got tower, and welanded. Period.”“No break in communications?”“None.”17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en560]Caidin goes on to say that one of the flight crew checked his watch, compared itwith everyone else’s in the flight crew, and then checked it against all theother clocks throughout the aircraft. Every one of their own clocks told thesame time—but they were all ten minutes behind.The Bermuda Triangle was a classic book I read at the beginning of my quest, butit took me years to understand and explain what actually happened. Since this isa very technical discussion, I deliberately have not presented all the evidencefor how Larson solved the mysteries of quantum mechanics and astrophysics. Ifyou really want to roll up your sleeves and get the specifics, there is atremendous amount of written material available to read, and it’s all beenposted for free online. My colleague Dr. Bruce Peret, who runs the RS Theory Website,18 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en561] his associate Dr. K. Nehruand others in the International Society for Unified Science are activelydeveloping the model past the point Larson started with. Eric Julienindependently rediscovered some of the same concepts, as well as others that arenot in Larson’s model, in The Science of Extraterrestrials, which is also verytechnical and has gained the appreciation of respected Russian scientists.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en562]MASS DECREASES AS WE REACH THE SPEED OF LIGHTHere’s the burning question that immediately pops into my mind: “If time-spacereally exists, then how do we get there?” Once we have that answer, we may verywell be able to dematerialize, teleport and travel in time—which would certainlymake for a very interesting and fun-filled Golden Age. The first big clue Ifound for how we could directly enter into time-space came from Dr. VladimirGinzburg.In his books and technical papers, Ginzburg reveals another mistake Einsteinmade in the Theory of Relativity. (In my opinion, Einstein did a great job—wejust need to fix up a few things.) As you may already know, conventionalrelativity theory says nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.Einstein’s equations suggested that as you approach the speed of light, you gainmass. You can never actually reach the speed of light, because theoretically atthe speed of light you are now as massive as the entire Universe. Ginzburg,however, made a revolutionary discovery: You could turn that same relativityequation upside down. In the process, everything still works—you don’t violateany laws of physics, but there is one major difference: As you approach thespeed of light, you lose mass instead of gaining it. This means that once youreach light speed, you have no mass left—at least not in space-time. This simplechange to one Einstein equation has absolutely stunning implications for humancivilization.Here’s how Ginzburg explains it on his Web site.You may not be prepared to abandon immediately the century-old relativisticequations. But once you are ready to do so, you will discover many amazingthings: Only when a particle is at rest, it may be considered as pure matter. Assoon as the particle begins to move, its gravitational mass and electricalcharge will start to decrease . . . so a part of [that] matter will be convertedinto a field. When the particle velocity V becomes equal to the ultimate spiralfield velocity C [the speed of light], its gravitational mass and electriccharge become equal to zero. At this point, matter will be completely convertedinto a “pure” field.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en563]Now we’re onto something. If we can push the whirling movement inside an atompast the speed of light, then we’ve just popped that atom over into time-space.It wasn’t until very recently that I realized there was an even more importantconcept hiding behind this: The motion inside the atom is already going at thespeed of light, or very close to it—so it doesn’t take much to finish the job.Right then, years and years of weird little scientific facts I had beencollecting in my mind all came together—and I had one of the finest Eurekamoments of my entire life.JUST A LITTLE PUSHPhysical matter is always right on the edge between these two realities. All weneed to do is give it a little push to get it over the boundary—and flip it intotime-space. This is how our buckyballs were able to turn into a wave just byslamming against a wall. Protons, neutrons, electrons and atoms in the quantumrealm are flip-flopping all the time. You can’t necessarily see the atomsdisappear out of a solid object when they flip into waves, but once I realizedthis is what they were doing, it became clear that others had observed andmeasured it happening.For example, Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev found that simply smashing an object against ahard surface would cause its weight to decrease. In one case, he smashed a ballbearing against a lead plate, and weighed it before and after the collision. Inanother case, he dropped a piece of lead against a stone basement floor. Some ofthe atoms popped over into time-space just from being bumped—and the objectsweighed less. Even better, “These experiments showed that the weight defect doesnot disappear immediately after a collision, but decreases gradually—withrelaxation times of about 15-20 minutes.”21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en564] That means that the missing weightslowly comes back as those atoms quiet back down. They don’t immediately returnto light or sub-light speeds—there is a fifteen to twenty-minute delay involved.This again suggests we are dealing with a fluidlike flow between our two“parallel realities” of space-time and time-space.Smashing the objects with violence wasn’t necessary either. In anotherexperiment, Kozyrev found that simply shaking a weight up and down thirty timesby hand was enough to cause its weight to go down.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en565] The strangest part of all was thatthe weight did not all come back in a nice, smooth curve—it came back in suddenlittle quantized jumps over time. Each time the weight suddenly changed, itsnewest increase in mass was proportional to the others. Each weight change wasalso proportional to the total amount of mass that disappeared in the firstplace.If this is confusing, the easiest way I can explain it is by using ahypothetical example. If you smash a weight and it loses a hundred milligrams,let’s say, it might initially gain back ten milligrams. Then you wait . . . butnothing happens. Then, suddenly, it gets ten milligrams heavier. Then nothinghappens for a while. Then ten more milligrams appear. This keeps on happeningover the course of fifteen to twenty minutes. According to Kozyrev, “Wesucceeded in obtaining fivefold and even tenfold effects.” He also found outthat this so-called effect quantization actually “takes place in almost all theexperiments.”23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en566] So again, we arelooking at a basic property of physical matter. As the atoms pop back in fromtime-space, they don’t do so in a nice, smooth, even fashion—it’s as if therewere layers within each atom. Each layer only pops in once it has slowed backdown enough to cross over the light-speed boundary. That means individual atomscould be both in and out of our reality at the same time, depending on whichlayer you’re looking at. This will make much more sense once we discuss thelayers of geometry you will find within each atom—but that comes later.So again, the basic idea is that by smashing, bumping or even just shaking anobject, some of its atoms pop over into time-space and its weight goes down.This also explains Dr. Bruce DePalma’s mysterious Spinning Ball Experiment.DePalma was working for Polaroid in photographic sciences, and lectured parttime at MIT. One of his students wanted to see if there was a difference betweenthe effect of gravity on a rotating object and a nonrotating object. DePalmadesigned an experiment to help find the answer. Two one-inch-wide ball bearingswere given a “precisely measured thrust” that should normally cause them to riseand fall in exactly the same arc. The only difference between the two was thatDePalma used a hand router to get one of them spinning at 18,000 revolutions perminute, or 300 revolutions per second, first—so this is obviously a very fastspin. He then launched them off in the dark, and photographed the results with asixty-cycle strobe light. The results were explained on the official BruceDePalma Web site.Repeating this numerous times, and analyzing the parallel trajectories of theball bearings as documented photographically, . . . the rotating ball . . . wentto a higher point in its trajectory, fell faster, and hit the bottom of itstrajectory before the non-rotating ball bearing.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en567]Since the spinning ball traveled higher, that obviously meant it had becomelighter. And since it plunged faster than ordinary gravity should allow, thatalso suggested it was then moving slightly faster in time as well. DePalmadidn’t know exactly what was causing the ball to fly higher—but once I figuredit out, many other pieces fit together. Nairz saw the same thing when he slammeda buckyball against the wall, and Kozyrev saw it by smashing ball bearings andvigorously shaking weights. Then when we add in Ginzburg, we now have atheoretical framework: as soon as a particle begins to move, part of it willtransform into pure Field.DePalma found that you didn’t even need to shoot the balls through theair—simply dropping two ball bearings straight down, from a height of only sixfeet, “repeatedly demonstrated a small but significant and clearly perceptibleeffect” if one of them was rotating at a fast speed.25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en568] DePalma got his results published inthe British Scientific Research Association Journal in 1976. He also explainedit to Dr. Edward Purcell, one of Harvard’s top experimental physicists. Dr.Purcell definitely realized what the implications of this really were:“According to DePalma, Purcell, after contemplating the experiment for severalminutes, remarked, ‘This will change everything.’”26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en569] In his 1977 paper on the SpinningBall Experiment, DePalma revealed he had the same basic idea as Kozyrev.“Time as a manifestation of a much deeper and basic force is what we have aconcern for here. The point of connection I want to make is the inertia ofobjects relates to the time energy flowing through them.”27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en570] Sounds familiar.So far, all we’ve done is create a small effect that you need special laboratoryequipment to even notice. That’s not very exciting. How do we get the reallygood stuff to happen on a larger scale? In order to find the answer, we have togo back and take another look at gravity. Remember that in Larson’s model,gravity is all there is. Atoms and molecules are nothing more than vortexeswithin an energy field we call gravity."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENThe Gravity—and Levity—of the SituationProtons, neutrons, electrons, whole atoms and even clusters of sixty or moreatoms called buckyballs have all been found to pop in and out of a wavelikestate, where they no longer appear to exist. With the help of Larson’s newphysics model, we now see that these particles are popping into a parallelreality called time-space, where time is three-dimensional. Dr. VladimirGinzburg turned a classic Einstein equation upside down and found that atoms andmolecules lose mass as they are accelerated to the speed of light and beyond.Then we discovered that by simply smashing or shaking an object, as in Kozyrev’sexperiments, or rapidly rotating an object, as in DePalma’s Spinning BallExperiment, we can apparently accelerate the internal movement in an atom pastlight speed—and measurably reduce its weight. Kozyrev also found that it tookabout fifteen to twenty minutes for the missing mass to return, and it did so insudden jumps—rather than a smooth, gradual change as we might expect. In thisnew science, gravity and time are interconnected. Ultimately, all atoms arevortexes of motion within an energy most people call gravity, and which we arecalling the Source Field.Let’s look at a whirlpool in a stream of water for a minute. Does any of thatwater actually disappear when it goes into the whirlpool? What happens to thewater after it shoots through the vortex? Does it shift into some parallelreality, never to return? Of course not. The water is obviously still there inthe stream, and it keeps right on flowing along. How does this apply to theearth? Simply put, the energy flowing into the earth must also flow back out ofthe earth. Gravity, as a downward force, must also have an upward force—and myfavorite name for gravity’s counterpart is levity. The Source Field, or gravity,rushes into our planet to create all the atoms and molecules on earthsimultaneously—but it still has to keep moving. Once this same flow of energystreams back out of our planet, it has now lost some of its momentum—so it wouldbe traveling a little more slowly than it went in. Once you understand this, youwill see there may be an upward-pushing force from the earth that is in aconstant tug-of-war with the downward-pushing force—and the downward force onlywins by a very small amount. If we did not have the upward-pushing force tobalance everything out, we would very likely be instantaneously crushed flat bythe pressure of gravity.Atoms and molecules are nothing more than vortexes within gravity. In Larson’smodel, there are only three real dimensions—and in this absolute reality, spaceand time are one and the same. You then have two parallel realities where thespace in one reality creates the time in the other reality, and vice versa.There is a constant, flowing exchange between these two realities going onwithin every atom. When an atom pops over into time-space, its spinning momentumis transferred over into the fluidlike energy within the parallel reality—and itis no longer affected by gravity in our own space-time. Gravity now moves rightthrough that area without pushing on the atom anymore. However, if the atom (orvortex in time-space) starts losing its speed and momentum, gravity pulls itback over into space-time. The full transition can take fifteen to twentyminutes in a larger object with many atoms, as we saw in Kozyrev’s experiments.Interestingly, the renowned mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose said in a1997 issue of Scientific American that gravity triggers the transition between aparticle and a wave at the quantum level.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en571] Dr. Hal Puthoff calculated thatthere was a direct relationship between gravity and the trembling motion withinall particles the Germans dubbed Zitterbewegung.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en572]Back in 1982, Princeton scientists had discovered that electrons becomefluidlike when kept at super-cold temperatures and zapped with the world’s mostpowerful magnet. This fits very nicely with our model.The electrons . . . seemed to “cooperate” and work together to form whatscientists call a “quantum fluid,” an extremely rare situation where electronsact identically, in lockstep, more like soup than as individually spinningunits.3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en573]LEVITY CREATES THRUSTAnd here’s my favorite part of all. Theoretically, an atom in space-time getspushed on by gravity—but once an atom pops over into time-space, it gets pushedon by levity. This means that within our reality, that atom now has thrust . . .as long as it is still bound together with other atoms that have not yet poppedover. Therefore, if you want to get an object to levitate, you would need tobring its molecules to a point where they are half in and half out of our ownthree-dimensional reality of space-time. That way, the levity force can thenbalance out against gravity—not unlike how you can float perfectly stillunderwater by controlling how much air you hold in your lungs. If you push anobject too far over into time-space, it will dematerialize. Then the same forcethat was causing it to rise up in our reality will now make it fall down in theparallel reality. Gravity takes over—but in a totally parallel reality. This maywork in a manner similar to a Möbius loop as you pass between realities.Nature uses these principles all the time. The DNA molecule stores photons oflight, and it appears that this same flip-flopping at the lightspeed boundary iswhat allows DNA to easily exchange energy and information between space-time andtime-space—between our physical body and our energetic duplicate. In theremaining part of this chapter, we will explore gravity-shielding effectsoccurring in air vortexes (tornado levitation), water vortexes (trout risingthrough vertical waterfalls), plant fibers (the secret ingredient involved insap flow) and insect wings (to keep certain large insects airborne and preventcollisions with other insects)—not to mention the flow of electromagneticenergy, once properly understood. And that’s not all.TORNADO ANOMALIES EXPLAINEDLet’s start with tornadoes. The conventional explanation is that the levitationinside a tornado is caused by air suction—and that certainly should account forsome of what we’re seeing. However, once you add in other curious effects thathave been documented, even on government NOAA Web sites, we can no longer be sosure that this is the only cause of the levitation—or even the main cause of it.There are many cases of people, animals, objects, even entire homes ending upinside a whirling tornado and transported large distances without being damaged4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en574]—where the fiercely rotating airshould have torn them to pieces. Many matter-blending effects have beendocumented as well. The first time I read about this was in a technical paper byDr. Alexei Dmitriev. The story that jumped out at me the most was of a cloverleaf that had been found pushed into a stucco wall, during a tornado—as if thewall had become soft and spongy.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en575] Atthe time, this was a mystery to me—but now it all makes sense. Another goodexample was of an Oklahoma tornado in 1942 that tore one of the wheels off of acar, while leaving the rest of the car undamaged.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en576] I realized that if the lug nuts onthe wheels had become soft and liquidlike, the levity force could then pull thetire off the car and lift it into the air quite easily.Dmitriev’s paper also presents evidence of complete dematerialization cases,where the matter is then blended together with other objects once it pops backover into space-time. An old, charred wooden board that was brittle and porouswent through a wooden house wall without breaking—and an inch-and-a-half-thickgate frame was punctured by a piece of wood.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en577] I realized if these stories weretrue, there should be many more examples. I later found an official NOAAgovernment Web site that collected eyewitness reports from a tornado outbreak inGrand Rapids, Michigan, on April 3, 1956. NOAA said that “in the interest ofhistorical accuracy, these statements have not been edited for content, but arepresented as they were submitted to the National Weather Service.” The reportsincluded a living room window that was embedded with sand, but did not break. Afarm machine had several leaky holes in the oil pan from pieces of straw thathad shot through. Straw was found embedded into the brick wall of a house. Athree-inch twig blended into a wall without breaking or cracking the twig or thewall. Blades of grass were driven into tree trunks, and a cow became embedded ina tree.8 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en578]In her WeatherBug blog, Stephanie Blozy alluded to stories of a coat hangerblended into a wooden board, and wood splinters stuck into a brick, though nodirect references were given. In the comments section, Russell L. DeGarmoclaimed he saw a two-by-four driven through both the front and back walls of atwo-story brick home, where the entry hole was smaller than the size of theplank. His parents had driven him to see this odd event in Pennsylvania in theearly 1940s. Another commenter claimed to have seen a banana embedded halfwayinto a telephone pole. And Jim Mims claimed that NASA’s Marshall Space FlightCenter in Huntsville, Alabama, has a display of a section of telephone pole witha drinking straw embedded into it.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en579]Stephanie was brave enough to offer an opinion about what causes these events,which now seems fairly accurate.Another theory based on quantum physics states that the piece of straw iselectrically charged super fast as it spins in the center of the tornado,allowing it to exist on a “higher energy density.” When it flies out of thetornado and comes in contact with something of a lower energy density, it passesthrough that object like a ghost—until the energy levels are equal, and thestraw is frozen in the object.10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en580]Of course, numerous commenters attacked her for even stating this as a potentialexplanation.In Freaks of the Storm, climatologist Dr. Randy Cerveny shared additionalexamples. A Minnesota tornado “split open a tree, jammed in an automobile, andclamped the tree shut again” in 1919.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en581] A tornado in India from 1838 causeda long stalk of bamboo to be completely embedded through a five-foot-thick wallwith bricks on both sides.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en582] In1896, a tornado in St. Louis, Missouri, drove a two-by-four plank of pine woodthrough solid iron, five eighths of an inch thick, on the Eads Bridge—and thereis an excellent picture of it in the book from NOAA.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en583]031 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_031_r1.jpg]This tree branch was pushed through the thick metal of an iron bridge during themassive St. Louis tornado of 1896.In Mount Carmel, Illinois, a tornado in 1877 drove a brick through the outerwall of a house, the interior wood, the plaster wall, twenty-seven more feetbetween two rooms, and lodged it into a rear wall, without ever breaking anycorners off the brick.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en584] In 1951, abean was blended halfway into a fresh chicken egg—without ever cracking theshell—in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Cerveny found a photograph of this peculiarincident, though there is not enough detail to really see what the egg lookslike up close.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en585]Washburn University has a Web site discussing the June 8, 1966, tornado inTopeka, Kansas. This includes a report from Jan Griffin that describes how whenher car was dug out from the wreckage two days later, items from her bathroomhad somehow appeared in the trunk—though she obviously did not put them there,and apparently saw no sign of the trunk ever having opened.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en586] Another Web site features aphotograph of glass pieces that had been embedded into an aluminum pipe—in atornado on the Isle of Wight on June 19, 1985.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en587] In 2004, the Boonshoft Museum ofDiscovery displayed “bizarre artifacts that historical societies like to keepunder wraps” in Dayton, Ohio, as reported in an AP press release. This exhibitincluded a gas meter that had been speared by a stick of wood in the Xeniatornado from 1974.18 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en588]032 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_032_r1.jpg]This wooden board was driven through a vertical wooden post during the infamousTristate tornado of 1925.In some cases, strange orbs are seen. The NOAA Web site reported eerieyellow-colored “giant puff balls” in one tornado. Fred Schmidt reported seeingwhat looked like greenish “glassy marbles on a plate glass window” that werebeing “pushed across the sky.” There was no rain, thunder or lightning as he sawthis. He also reported what now appears to be a classic case where he was poppedover into time-space—thus causing all the normal sounds within space-time todisappear.The quietness was eerie. There were no birds singing, which there usually were.In fact there were no sounds from any animals at all. . . . I also [later] sawwhat appeared to be a straw embedded in a telephone pole about halfway in, justas perfect as could be.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en589]NATURAL ANTIGRAVITY IN WATER, TREES AND INSECTSA simple case of rotating air is enough to cause effects that fit our modelnicely. What about rotating water? Let’s not forget that in our new model,gravity has spin currents in it—because it is caused by a fluidlike energy. Ifthese spin currents get strong enough—by rotating vortex motion within theSource Field—they can create their own gravitational force. They seem to work ina sideways direction, creating rotating currents—such as tornadoes, hurricanes,ocean currents, and mantle currents below the continental plates—but in somecases this force can directly counteract the normal downward push of gravity. AsOlof Alexandersson described in the classic Living Water, Viktor Schaubergerallegedly discovered a gravity-shielding effect in nature by studying how troutcould jump straight up, through high waterfalls, with seemingly very littleeffort.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en590] For decades, he observedthat the fish would first “dance in a wild spinning movement” and then “floatmotionlessly upward” through the waterfall, even at unusually large heights.Even more surprisingly, on a late winter night with bright moonlight, hewitnessed this same effect happening with egg-shaped rocks. He was looking intoa mountain pool, within a rushing stream, when an egg-shaped stone almost as bigas a human head started doing a spinning dance just like the trout would do. Itthen rose to the surface of the water—and a circle of ice quickly formed aroundit. (Such bizarre and sudden changes in temperature are also consistent withmatter popping into time-space. Remember—we might think that a gateway intotime-space would increase temperature, but Kozyrev actually proved it makesthings colder.) Eventually, Schauberger saw several egg-shaped stones all do thesame thing in sequence. He analyzed them and found that besides the egg shape,they all contained metals.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en591]How do giant trees actually pull sap all the way up their trunks? Physicist Dr.Orvin E. Wagner, who worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, taught physics atCalifornia State Polytechnic University and conducted research in condensedmatter physics at Lockheed Research Laboratory in Palo Alto, California,researched this subject. He did biophysics research since 1966 that led him todiscover a wave effect in plants as of 1988, wherein he began devoting himselffull-time to studying these mysteries.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en592] In 1992 and 1994, he publishedpapers in mainstream journals outlining his discovery that plants and trees areusing a gravity-shielding effect to create sap flow.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en593] Although some of the flow could becaused by suction from the evaporation in the leaves, that cannot account foreverything Wagner observed. It appears that the branches of trees create avortex effect not unlike what we see in the pyramids. They may create a rotatingspin current of gravitational force that is sufficient to push the sap up thetree.Wagner cut small holes into the xylem tissue of trees and used tinyaccelerometers to confirm that gravity was not as strong inside those areas.Tiny hanging weights recorded a decrease of up to 22 percent of the force ofgravity inside vertical holes of slightly leaning trees. He also found similarforces in a hole within a horizontal root—creating thrust in the direction theroot was pointing. Wagner believes that “inside the plant tissue itself, likelythe forces are much larger.” He also found consistent evidence that plantbranches tend to grow at angles that are always multiples of five degrees,suggesting they are somehow harnessing a spiraling, geometric wave componentthat naturally exists within gravity.Wagner also claims to have demonstrated the existence of these waves by simplyrotating glass tubes filled with particles of dust. The waves appeared in howthe particles arranged themselves. Wagner has an interesting theory of how allthis works.A growing plant stem acts like a tuned wave guide. . . . A stem growing at acertain angle to the gravitational field adjusts its cell sizes, internodalspacings and other structures to conform to the [geometric] wavelengthsassociated with that particular angle.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en594]Dr. Viktor Grebennikov was an entomologist (insect scientist) who discovered theCavity Structural Effect, as we previously discussed—but this also led to arealization that certain insects appear to be naturally using gravity-shieldingtechnology as well.I was examining the chitin shells of insects under my microscope in the summerof 1988 along with their pinnate antennae, the fish-scale microstructure ofbutterfly wings, iridescent colors, and other inventions of nature. I becameinterested in an amazingly rhythmical microstructure of one large insect [wingcasing]. . . . It was an extremely well-ordered composition, as though stampedout by factory equipment according to special blueprints and calculations. As Isaw it, the intricate sponginess was clearly unnecessary either for the strengthof the part, or for its decoration. I have never observed anything like thisunusual micro-ornament either in nature, in technology, or in art. Because itsstructure is three-dimensional, I have been unable to capture it in a drawing sofar, or a photograph. . . . Was it perhaps a wave emitter using “my” multiplecavity structures effect? That truly lucky summer, there were very many insectsof this species, and I would capture them at night. . . .I placed the small, concave chitin plate on the microscope stage in order toagain examine its strangely star-shaped cells under strong magnification. Iagain admired this masterpiece jewel work of nature. I was about to place asecond identical plate with the same unusual cell structure on its underside,almost purposelessly on top of the first one. But then. The little plate cameloose from my tweezers, hung suspended above the other plate on the microscopestage for a few seconds, then turned a few degrees clockwise and slid to theright, then turned counterclockwise and swung—and only then it abruptly fell onthe desk.You can imagine what I felt at that moment. When I came to my senses, I tied afew panels together with a wire and it wasn’t an easy thing to do. I succeededonly when I positioned them vertically. What I got was a multi-layered chitinblock and I placed it on the desk. Even a relatively large object, such as athumbtack, would not fall on it. Something pushed it up and aside. When Iattached the tack on top of the “block,” I witnessed incredible, impossiblethings. The tack would disappear from sight for a few moments. That was when Irealized that this was no “beacon,” but something entirely different.And I became again so excited that all the objects around me became foggy andshaky. I managed to pull myself together with huge effort in a couple of hours,and I continued working. This is how it all started. Of course, much stillremains to be understood, verified, and tested.25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en595]These results are spectacular to a conventional mind-set, leading most toconclude Dr. Grebennikov must be lying—but already we are seeing an effectconsistent with our model. When he put the tack in the direct center of thevortex current created by the insect’s wing casing, the tack’s atoms all poppedover into time-space and it seemingly disappeared. In a 2005 issue of New EnergyTechnologies, we find out that although Grebennikov never disclosed the exactgenus and species of the insect he discovered this effect with, he does makemultiple mentions in his book about the remarkable properties of the wing casesfor scarabaeus, bronze poplar borer and particularly Cetonia. There are fivespecies of bronze poplar borer that have an unusual honeycomb pattern on theinside of their wing cases, similar to his description.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en596]So if you really love Mother Nature, you just might learn something. Some folkshere on earth have apparently been aware of these dueling gravitational forcesfor thousands and thousands of years—and the techniques to overcome normaldownward gravitational flow by understanding how to speed up the spiralingmotion within the Source Field—to create currents that push in a differentdirection. This appears to be the great secret of how the Pyramids were built.However, we still haven’t really answered our deeper question: How do we popenough atoms over into time-space to actually make an object levitate? Onceagain, an old friend comes to the rescue: coherence. We need to bring thefrequency inside the atom to a point that is faster than light speed—so it thenpops over into time-space. This can be done by creating a harmonic pulsation inthe Source Field—in gravity. So, if we want the magic to happen, all we have todo is start vibrating an object, or a given area, with the right frequencies.Then, by creating coherence in that area, some of the atoms will start poppingover the light-speed boundary—where they then get pushed on by what we calllevity.TIBETAN ACOUSTIC LEVITATIONThis might sound complicated, but the actual techniques are easy once you knowwhat you’re doing—and hardly any technology is required to create the coherence.The most intriguing example I’ve ever discovered is called Tibetan AcousticLevitation, and this is another piece of weird science that I struggled foryears to understand. This comes to us from Henry Kjellson, a Swedish aircraftdesigner, who described the whole story to a journalist who then published it ina German magazine. A truly groundbreaking New Zealand researcher named BruceCathie then wrote a detailed analysis of it in David Hatcher Childress’sAnti-Gravity and the World Grid.Henry Kjellson was a close friend and colleague of a medical doctor, also fromSweden, who chose to be identified only as Dr. Jarl. According to Kjellson, Dr.Jarl befriended a young Tibetan student while he studied at Oxford. When Dr.Jarl was later paid to visit Egypt by a scientific society in England, hisTibetan friend found out—and sent a messenger to find him. The message was verygood. Dr. Jarl’s friend had become a trusted member of the monastery, and now ahigh Tibetan lama said he wanted to meet Dr. Jarl—urgently. Apparently Dr. Jarlthen got permission to stay in Tibet for a fairly long time, take notes, andreport back on what he found. While he was there, Dr. Jarl got to see a varietyof things that few Westerners had ever been allowed to witness before. Thegreatest secret of all, according to Swedish engineer Olaf Alexanderson, wasthat “a vibrating and condensed sound field can nullify the power ofgravitation.” Other experts on Tibet, including Linaver, Spalding and Hue, hadheard about the Tibetans using sound to levitate gigantic stones, and Dr. Jarlhad also heard about these legends—but he was the first Westerner to witness it.Dr. Jarl was led into a sloping meadow that was surrounded by high cliffs to thenorthwest. One of the cliffs had a ledge that led into a cave, some 250 metersabove the ground. The Tibetans were in the process of building a wall out ofhuge stone blocks up on this ledge—but there was no way to get there, except byclimbing straight up on a rope. About 250 meters away from the cliff, there wasa polished rock slab that had a bowl-shaped area carved out of the middle of it.The slab was a meter wide and the bowl area was fifteen centimeters deep. Then,a team of yak oxen hauled a giant stone block into the bowl. The stone wasincredibly huge—it was a full meter high, and a meter and a half long.Here’s the weird part. A perfect quarter-circle arc (90 degrees) was set up withthirteen drums and six trumpets all aiming at the stone. All the drums were madeof three-millimeter-thick sheet iron, and instead of any type of animal skin fora head, there was metal on the end that the monks beat with leather clubs. Theother end was left open. The six trumpets were all quite long—3.12 meters to beexact—with 0.3-meter openings. The monks carefully measured the distance fromthe stone to this quarter-circle of instruments, and it came out to 63 meters.Eight of the thirteen drums were exactly the same size as the stone—a meter wideand a meter and a half long. Four of the drums were smaller in size, but wereexactly one third the volume of the larger drum, at 0.7 meters wide and onemeter long. One additional drum was the smallest, at 0.2 meters wide and 0.3meters long—again in perfect harmonic proportion. You could fit 41 of the smalldrums into the medium drum, in volume, and 125 into the larger drum.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en597]All the instruments were fixed on mounts that allowed you to precisely aim them.And finally, you needed another key ingredient to make it work—a total of nearlytwo hundred monks who lined up in rows, about eight or ten deep, behind each ofthe nineteen instruments. Most people wouldn’t think the monks could add anymeasurable energy to the mix, but with what we now know about the Source Field,all that has changed. It seemed that the instruments were tools that helpedfocus and concentrate the energy that was being consciously generated by themonks. (This is also why the experiment might not work if the people lining upbehind each instrument were not properly trained in generating coherence withinthemselves, through meditation.)033 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_033_r1.gif]Swedish aircraft designer Henry Kjellson’s sketch of Tibetan AcousticLevitation—where 200 monks with drums and trumpets somehow levitated massivestones.Now, let’s hear directly from Bruce Cathie about what happened next.When the stone was in position, the monk behind the small drum gave a signal tostart the concert. The small drum had a very sharp sound, and could be heardeven with the other instruments making a terrible din. All the monks weresinging and chanting a prayer, slowly increasing the tempo of this unbelievablenoise. During the first four minutes nothing happened; then as the speed of thedrumming, and the noise, increased, the big stone block started to rock andsway, and suddenly it took off into the air with an increasing speed in thedirection of the platform in front of the cave hole 250 meters high. After threeminutes of ascent, it landed on the platform.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en598]Incredible. We’re watching a gigantic stone, as big as some of the ones used tobuild the Great Pyramid, making a long, slow, lumbering three-minute trip upthrough the air in a 500-meter arc. Obviously, the power of the drums, trumpetsand chanting is nowhere near enough to cause an object to levitate by anyconventional means—but if they were creating the right coherence in the block,they could resonate atoms inside the rock over the light-speed boundary. Theythen enter into time-space, and provide thrust as they get pushed on by thelevity force. If you touched the rock during this time, it would have almostcertainly become spongy, since as many as half of the molecules are no longer inour reality. This appears to be how the gigantic stone blocks in Peru, atSacsayhuaman, were able to be fitted together with cracks so tight you can’teven fit a razor blade between them. The rocks become soft and malleable, likeclay, as their builders popped more and more of the atoms into time-space. As wealready saw in the tornado anomalies, there are many examples of solid materialsbecoming soft and spongy when they become coherent.Some of the stones split from the intensity, and the monks moved them away.Nonetheless, they were able to keep the production line going and transport atotal of five or six blocks an hour with this method. Now here’s the incrediblepart. Dr. Jarl thought he was either being hypnotized or going through some sortof mass psychosis, so he actually set up a movie camera and filmed the wholeprocess—two different times. When he played the films back later on, they showedexactly the same thing he had witnessed. Dr. Jarl was astonished, and obviouslyfelt this discovery would shake the very foundations of the world as we knowit—maybe even literally. When the scientific society that had been sponsoringDr. Jarl heard about these films, disaster struck. They swooped in andconfiscated the originals, declaring them classified—which Dr. Jarl felt was“hard to explain, or understand.” They tried to appease him by saying the filmswould be released in the year 1990—but this obviously never happened.BUILDING A CRAFT YOU CAN FLY INThis form of levitation still seems to be a cumbersome process, and may requirea level of consciousness that most of us do not now possess. What if we buildsomething where the propulsion system is inside a craft we can actually fly in?Let’s go back to Dr. Viktor Schauberger, who found levitation effects occurringwith trout and rocks in water. He built structures with the same egg shape hesaw in the rocks, and built special turbines that rotated water at a high speedinside them—creating the same vortex shapes he had carefully observed in nature.There is a great wealth of reading material on how he succeeded in building aworking gravity-shielding craft by using this process.29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en599]Researchers such as Nick Cook and Joseph Farrell have written about how this andother technologies came into the hands of Nazi Germany—though there is clearevidence that Schauberger resisted cooperating with them, and only ended upparticipating because of dire threats to him and his family. In Nick Cook’s TheHunt for Zero Point, he explains that the Nazi code word for thisgravity-shielding project was Chronos—which means “time.” As our model predicts,the Nazis apparently found that a movement through space creates a movementthrough time.If you generate a torsion field of sufficient magnitude, the theory says you canbend the . . . space around [Schauberger’s] generator. The more torsion yougenerate, the more space you perturb. . . . When you bend space, you also bendtime.Later, Cook goes into more detail.If a whirling torsion field, with or without an electromagnetic component, wasbinding with gravity to produce a levitational effect—an antigravity effect—itwasn’t doing so in the four dimensions of this world, but somewhere else. Itexplained why the Germans had attempted to use a torsion field to act upon thefourth dimension of time. Time, like gravity, the theorists said, was simplyanother variable stemming from the hyperspace.30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en600]Dr. Viktor Grebennikov, who discovered a gravity-shielding effect in insectwings, was also able to use this discovery to build a working craft that was bigenough for him to fly in. He organized multiple wing cases together on layersthat could open and close like Venetian blinds, designed to spread open like anoriental fan. The lifting power of the wings would dramatically increase whenyou crossed them over the tops of each other, and this mechanical system allowedhim to control that process. When they were all stacked on top of each other, heachieved plenty of vertical lift. He then built this mechanism into a small,rectangular wooden box: “I chose a rectangular design because it is easier tofold and once folded, it may resemble a suitcase, or a painter’s case, and itcan be therefore disguised and not arouse any suspicions. I have naturallychosen a painter’s case.”31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en601] He wouldride it standing up, like a scooter. The vertical thrust was controlled by abicycle brake caliper that could open and close the fanlike layers of wingcases. His forward speed was controlled by a second brake caliper thatdetermined the tilt angle of the wings. He steered by leaning his body, andbelted himself to the metal pole that held the handlebars for the bicyclecalipers. Grebennikov’s account of what actually happened when he used thisdevice fits with our model so perfectly well that this seems very unlikely to bea hoax.First of all, since he popped over into time-space, once he reached a certainheight he looked more like a wave to viewers on the ground.[When in flight,] I can’t be seen from the ground—and not just because of thedistance. I cast almost no shadow even in a very low flight. Yet, as I found outlater, people sometimes see something where I am in the sky. I appear to themeither as a light sphere, a disk, or something like a slanted cloud with sharpedges, which moves strangely according to them, not exactly the way a real cloudwould.32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en602]He also experienced time distortions, such as the inability to close his camerashutter: “I could see but couldn’t take photographs. . . . My camera shutterwouldn’t close, and both rolls of film I had with me, one in the camera and theother in my pocket, got light-struck.”33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en603] This reminds me of Sid Hurwich’sdevice—where his experience of time became so much faster than the time flow inGrebennikov’s camera that his pressure on the button did not last long enough toactually open the shutter. If he were patient enough, it might work, but he’dprobably have to wait awhile.Best of all, he found out that by simply traveling through space using gravityshielding, he also automatically traveled through time.By the way, besides the camera, I have experienced sometimes trouble with mywatch and possibly also with the calendar. While descending onto a familiarglade, I would occasionally find it slightly “out of season,” with about atwo-week deviation. . . . Thus, it may be possible to fly not just in space butalso, or so it seems, in time. I cannot make the latter claim with a 100 percentguarantee, except perhaps that in flight, particularly at its beginning, a watchruns erratically, now too slow and then too fast. But, the watch is at itsaccurate time and speed at the end of the excursions. Nevertheless, this is oneof the reasons why I stay away from people during my journeys. If timemanipulation is involved alongside the manipulation of gravitation, I might,perhaps, accidentally disrupt cause-and-effect of relations and someone mightget hurt. This is where my fears were coming from.34[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en604]Grebennikov also tried to bring insects back, only to have them disappear fromthe tube. However, in one case, a captured adult insect reverted to a livingchrysalis stage when he brought it back—showing an undeniable time-traveleffect.Insects captured “there” disappear from my test tubes, boxes and otherreceptacles. They disappear mostly without a trace. Once I had a test tubecrushed to tiny bits in my pocket, another time there was an oval hole in thetube glass with brown [edges], as though [it was] chitin-colored. . . . I didfeel a kind of burning or an electric shock inside my pocket on many occasions,perhaps at the moment of my prisoner’s disappearance. I found the capturedinsect in my test tube only once, but it wasn’t the adult ichneumon with whiterings on its feelers, but its chrysalis, i.e., its earlier stage. It was aliveand it moved its belly when touched but, much to my dismay, it has died a weeklater.35 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en605]Before he takes off, he is in our space-time. When he lands, he fully returns tospace-time once more—only now he has traveled in time. When he tried to bringinsects back, they often didn’t make it—but in the case of the ichneumon, heactually saw the adult body revert to its larval stage in the tube.According to the New Energy Technologies article, Dr. Grebennikov sent a patentapplication to Russia with Professor V. Zolotarev for this stunning invention.He got nothing but resistance from the scientific community. A Russian newspaperpublished a prerelease of Grebennikov’s book about his invention in 1992,complete with a photograph allegedly showing him levitating about two or threefeet off the ground on his platform.36[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en606]034 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_034_r1.jpg]Dr. Viktor Grebennikov allegedly levitating on a device he built. Insect wingcasings, which apparently could shield gravity, were used as a power source.There are also a variety of close-up photographs of the platform itself. ARussian magazine, Technika Molodezhi, also published the photographs—andmentioned that he had publicly demonstrated the device at the Siberian ResearchInstitute of Agriculture and Agricultural Chemistry. His book was originallygoing to be five hundred pages, with four hundred color images, and the originalnewspaper article said he would give all the precise details of exactly how tobuild his device. He was then told by his publishers and editor that it wasforbidden to publish this information—clearly suggesting they were warned by theRussian government not to release the data for matters of “national security.”Two photos of Grebennikov in flight were left in the book since they had alreadyleaked—but the page count dropped to just over three hundred, and he had torewrite the entire manuscript.37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en607]Gordon Novel, who claims to have had access to classified technologies, alsoreported the connection between gravity shielding and time travel in aninterview with Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot.A UFO is probably very much like the cars back in “Back to the Future,” a flyingtime machine. They’re capable of going backwards and forwards in time. . . . Tonegate gravity, you’ve got to negate time. So time is the power . . . of thebird. . . . We don’t believe [its power] comes from space or zero point. Webelieve it comes from time, purely and simply, and that energy and time are thesame thing.38 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en608]TESLA TECHNOLOGYNikola Tesla also allegedly developed a working gravity-shielding technology—andhe may have even had some help. Sidney Kirkpatrick was the first person allowedfull access to the Cayce archives, including all the original names—and that’show we now know that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison both had professionalinteraction with Edgar Cayce from 1905 to 1907.39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en609] This almost certainly meant Teslahad at least one reading. Later, a series of Cayce readings were done that wentinto extreme technical detail with an inventor who was working on agravity-shielding prototype called the No-Fuel Motor. Specifically, in reading195-54, question 13, Cayce’s source says that gravity is the result of twoforces—one going down and one going back up. It also explains that this is afairly crude way to explain it, because there is an ongoing amount of circular,spiraling vortex movement occurring in both directions as well.40[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en610] Unfortunately, two separate fires atCayce’s photography studio destroyed all the records from Cayce’s early years,including any readings he may have done for Tesla. Additional correspondencebetween Tesla, Thomas Edison and Cayce was “also later destroyed by awell-meaning but short-sighted volunteer at the Edgar Cayce archive in VirginiaBeach.”41 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en611]Regardless of whether Tesla had any help from Cayce, just four years after theybegan corresponding with each other, Tesla made some provocative statements inan interview with The New York Herald.The flying machine of the future—my flying machine—will be heavier than air, butit will not be an aeroplane. It will have no wings. . . . Yet it will be able tomove at will through the air in any direction with perfect safety, [and at]higher speeds than have yet been reached. . . . It can remain absolutelystationary in the air, even in a wind, for great lengths of time. . . . Itslifting power will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird has toemploy, but upon positive mechanical action.”When asked by the Herald journalist to clarify what he meant by “mechanicalaction,” Tesla said:“Through gyroscopic action of my engine—assisted by some devices I am not yetprepared to talk about. . . . My airship will have neither gas bag, wings norpropellers.”42 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en612]In Lost Science, Gerry Vassilatos gives testimony from alleged eyewitnesses toTesla actually using this technology.Tesla was seen standing on a platform, surrounded by a purplish corona, somethirty feet above the ground. The contrivance had a small coil [on top], and wasentirely covered underneath with a smooth surface of sheet copper. The platformwas perhaps two feet in total depth, being crammed with components. Tesla strodeover to the platform, stood before a control panel, and whisked aloft in a crownof white sparks. The excessive sparks subsided with increased distance from theground, often arcing to metal fencing. Tesla went out of his way to avoid thenumerous metallic ranch fencing beneath his aerial course. . . . It was saidthat Tesla often delighted in soaring through the night air for hours eachnight.43 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en613]RALPH RING, OTIS CARR AND TESLA’S “UTRON”In August 2006, Project Camelot interviewed Ralph Ring, a seventy-one-year-oldtechnician who worked with Otis T. Carr—inventor of the Otis elevator system—inthe late 1950s and early 1960s. Carr had studied under Nikola Tesla, and wasallegedly given the secret to his gravity-shielding technology. Carr finisheddeveloping a working saucer-shaped craft in 1947, and built a number of them—butinitially it did not generate any official interest. In 2006, Ralph Ring finallycame forward with an impressive barrage of technical documents, includingdetailed blueprints, from Carr’s OTC Enterprises company.Major Wayne Aho, a former Army Combat Intelligence Officer during World War II,announced that he would take the craft to the moon on December 7, 1959, that thetrip would take 5 hours, and that he would remain in orbit for 7 days beforereturning. The 45 diameter craft he was to use weighed 30 tons, and “was poweredby the Utron engine.”44 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en614]The Utron engine was obviously Tesla’s invention—and there was a key emphasisplaced on the fact that it was round from the top-down view and a perfect squarefrom the side view. This caused it to be shaped like a top—or two conesconnected base to base. Ring did not gain any financial benefits from comingforward, and had clear and extensive documentation, including photographs ofCarr with the device, and detailed technical blueprints he obviously would nothave spent money faking. When you read what Ring actually says, the case becomesvery compelling.035 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_035_r1.jpg]Otis Carr’s promotional illustration of a gravity-shielding turbine originallyinvented by Nikola Tesla. Otis Carr was also the inventor of the elevator.First of all, we see solid metal becoming flexible—in this case like Jell-O.When recalling the heady events of the late 1950s working day and night withCarr, Ring again and again stressed that the key was working with nature.“Resonance,” he would emphasize repeatedly. “You have to work with nature, notagainst her.” He described how when the model disks were powered up and reacheda particular rotational speed, . . . “the metal turned to Jell-O. You could pushyour finger right into it. It ceased to be solid. It turned into another form ofmatter, which was as if it was not entirely here in this reality. . . . It wasuncanny, one of the weirdest sensations I’ve ever felt.”45[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en615]The craft also traveled through time while also traveling through space.Did the craft fly? “Fly is not the right word. It traversed distance. It seemedto take no time. I was with two other engineers when we piloted theforty-five-foot craft about ten miles. I thought it hadn’t moved—I thought ithad failed. I was completely astonished when we realized that we had returnedwith samples of rocks and plants from our destination. It was a dramaticsuccess. It was more like a kind of teleportation. What’s more, time wasdistorted somehow. We felt we were in the craft about fifteen or twenty minutes.We were told afterwards that we’d been carefully timed as having been in thecraft no longer than three or four minutes.46[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en616]Perhaps even more interesting is the direct, conscious interaction that tookplace with the Source Field in this process.The Utron was the key to it all. Carr said it accumulated energy because of itsshape, and focused it, and also responded to our conscious intentions. When weoperated the machine, we didn’t work any controls. We went into a kind ofmeditative state, and all three of us focused our intentions on the effect wewanted to achieve. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But that’s what we did, andthat’s what worked. Carr had tapped into some principle which is not understood,in which consciousness melds with engineering to create an effect. You can’twrite that into equations. I have no idea how he knew it would work. But itdid.47 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en617]Carr told everyone to stuff their pockets with rocks, clumps of dirt and grassfrom their destination. Otherwise, when they returned, they wouldn’t have anyconscious memory of going anywhere, and would think the whole thing was afailure—not unlike Backster’s roommate waking up from hypnosis and thinkingnothing had happened. Sure enough, when Ring came back from the trip, heremembered nothing—but his pockets were stuffed with grass. He was absolutelystunned—and only later remembered the trip, as if waking up from a dream. Whenhe asked Carr how it worked, this is what he said.Otis Carr’s illustration of how the Tesla turbines fit into the saucer-shapedgravity-shielding craft he developed.036 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_036_r1.jpg]Your brain is there to operate your body. You’re in a vessel here. It’s anillusionary vessel that people don’t realize, because we’re creating it inmicroseconds. From one second to the other, these shutters are opening andshutting, creating all this reality you see around you, but it doesn’t reallyexist. It’s all spirit. It’s all energy, but we’re creating it. . . . Peopledon’t realize that Man in a sense created time. Time doesn’t exist, in essence.It does when we create it, and we have a beginning and an end to something. Wecall that time. But in a greater reality, there is no time.48[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en618]The “shutters opening and closing” sounds just like the fluctuations inphysical, chemical, biological and radioactive reactions that Shnoll discoveredare happening all over the world.Unfortunately, agents working within classified projects swooped in on Carr in1961, and they wouldn’t take no for an answer.They came over with all their bells and whistles and said, “You’re shuttin’ downright now.” And we asked them why, and they said, “Because of your threat tooverthrow the monetary system of the United States of America.” That was theirploy. . . . “And we’re confiscating everything.” They went into the offices andthey went into the lab, and they started just confiscating everything. Then theydebriefed us and told us, in essence, “You guys are wrong. You’re attempting tooverthrow the monetary system.”49 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en619]This secrecy has gone on for quite some time—a “Cosmic Watergate,” as Dr.Stanton Friedman referred to it in an article that circulated through mainstreammedia while I was writing this book.50[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en620] This may be an outgrowth of the samesecrecy the founding fathers kept around the meaning of the Great Seal of theUnited States—putting a message out there for those who would bother to find it,but never explaining it in any direct, open way. I hope it has become clear bynow that there is an obvious, uniform system of principles behind thesetechnologies. Once we fix the mistakes we’ve made in science, we can explain allthe observations—and realize how these same forces already appear in nature.Right for now, no one has made a definite breakthrough with a technology likethis that has gone mainstream—though similar discoveries were made by ThomasTownsend Brown (the Biefield-Brown effect), Professor John Searl (the SearlLevity Disc) and others. Brown decided to cooperate with the security apparatusand his work became classified, whereas Searl fought against it and wasruined—but their results are also consistent with everything we’ve beendiscussing here. Two Russian scientists, Roschin and Godin, independentlyrebuilt Searl’s technology and got a very strong lift, though their device hadto be bolted to the laboratory table for safety.51[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en621] Searl and his associates haverecently released videos online showing his unique turbine in action, whichskeptics previously attacked him about and had said was impossible.52[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en622] Searl’s team is allegedly working todevelop a fully operational prototype of their device, as is Ralph Ring.DO IT YOURSELF—WITH LUNG-GOMAt the time I write this book, none of us have open access to thesetechnologies—but perhaps this shift into the Golden Age represents a time wherewe won’t need them. Is it possible to generate enough coherence that you couldactually levitate your own body—without any technology at all? The Tibetansappear to have inherited the secrets to this amazing trick as well. Thetechnique is called lung-gom, and it was witnessed by Alexandra David-Neel andwritten up in her 1931 classic With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet.53[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en623] In this case, the monks are able togo into a deep trance state where they can run along in huge leaps at aremarkably fast speed—using their bodies in a way that completely defies gravityas we now understand it.Lung-gom may have originally been used to travel vast distances much morequickly than walking or riding a yak. Each time one of their feet hits theground, they launch off again in another huge leap. Though this may be anexaggeration from one too many movies, each leap may lead to them traveling asmuch as thirty feet high and one hundred feet forward, if not more. David-Neelhad heard stories about this practice, but finally one day she witnessed ithappening, at a distance, through binoculars. Her Tibetan traveling partnerscould see the image of the monk with their naked eye, and confirmed that it was,indeed, a lung-gom-pa —a monk skilled in this fascinating art.She wanted to go to the man, witness it up close and ask him questions, but shewas sternly warned.Your Reverence will not stop the lama, nor speak to him. This would certainlykill him. These lamas when traveling must not break their meditation. The godwho is in them escapes if they cease to repeat the ngags [mantras], and whenthus leaving them before the proper time, he shakes them so hard that theydie.54 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en624]To me, this sounds like a mythical legend that was created to explain somethingwe now can understand scientifically. Based on these new laws of physics we arenow rediscovering, we can assume that in order for the monk to accomplish thepractice of lung-gom, he would have to be able to bring roughly half the atomsand molecules in his body into time-space. He would then be half-in, half-out.How exactly did they learn this practice? Does this require some sort of “pinealgland awakening” process? That may be part of it. David-Neel explained that inorder to train for this ability, you must first spend several years practicingvarious types of breathing exercises. Eventually, your teacher gives you amantra that you repeat in a rhythmic fashion. Your breathing and your footstepsall have to keep time with the syllables of the mantra while you do thepractice.To me, there is a remarkable amount of data in this report that is consistentwith what we have been learning so far—which David-Neel obviously had no ideaabout at the time. Heat disrupts the coherence in the Source Field—and duringthe hottest times of day, lung-gom doesn’t work very well. Also, the shape of anarea determines the structure of the Source Field, just like the pyramideffect—so uneven ground, narrow valleys and trees all create influences that candisrupt the path of a lung-gom-pa, whereas flat land and wide desert spaces makeit much easier. And lastly, your normal state of mind shifts into a deep trance,where most of your awareness is no longer here in space-time. Your pineal glandis probably quite active, as most of your awareness has now transferred overinto your astral body or energetic duplicate in time-space, as Gariaev andothers have shown in the DNA Phantom. Interestingly, David-Neel also reportsthat if the monks did this practice too often, they could become stuck in ahalfway point—and then actually have to weigh themselves down with chains inorder to be able to stay on the ground.Although there are many well-documented cases of human levitation that could nothave been faked, including Christian saints, yogis and the exceptional abilitiesof Daniel Dunglas Hume in the 1800s, witnessed by scientists, scholars,governmental figures and other luminaries,55[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en625] one story of levitation, in Dr.Claude Swanson’s The Synchronized Universe, stood out to me. This involves PeterSugleris, a young Greek boy in the 1980s who could move objects, bend spoons andother metal utensils without even touching them—as witnessed by many people.These spoon-bending feats can now be explained by the atoms flipping over intotime-space, so the material actually starts to be bendable. And yes—Sugleris wasalso able to levitate. In 1986, his wife photographed him as he hovered eighteeninches off the kitchen floor and stayed up there for forty-seven seconds. Theexertion appeared on his face as a frightening grimace, and he broke out in acold sweat and was exhausted afterward. It took him ten or fifteen seconds toregain normal consciousness. In order to do it, he “required immenseconcentration and a purification vegetarian diet for several weeks before theevent.”56 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en626]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENGeometry Class Just Got Much More InterestingOur quest to recover the lost secrets of the ancients appears to be nearlycomplete. Our biggest discovery has been that the three dimensions of space wesee all around us—as the real world—is only half of the picture. The other halfis a parallel reality, in which all the rules are basically the same—but spaceover there is time over here, and vice versa. These two realities are intimatelyand totally dependent upon each other for survival—their swirling movementsblend together within every atom. Nature was never told that gravity shieldingwas impossible—it seemingly happens all the time in tornadoes, waterfalls, thestems of plants and trees, and certain insects’ wing cases. Gravity appears tohave much more structure in it than merely being a tug-of-war between thedownward-pushing gravity force and the upward-pushing levity force. There arespiraling motions within gravity as well, which push in other directions besidesstrictly down. In order to cancel out gravity, achieve coherence and enter intotime-space, we have to know how to create the proper vortex currents in theSource Field—so we can levitate, teleport and travel in time, which may be a keypart of the predicted Golden Age. Geometry appears to be the key to creating thevortex currents we need to achieve these stunning results.GEOMETRIC VORTEX POINTSIt is entirely possible that certain areas on earth could have greater coherencethan other areas—thus making levitation, teleportation and time travel mucheasier in those spots. Gravity may take on a spiraling, sideways push in theseareas—creating circular or oval-shaped flow patterns in air, water, magneticfields or the mantle. Ivan T. Sanderson was searching for just such vortexpoints in the 1960s with his Society for Investigation of the Unexplained.Charles Berlitz actually made extensive use of Sanderson’s library when he wroteThe Bermuda Triangle in 1974. From 1945 to 1975, fully 67 different ships andboats, and 192 aircraft of all different types, disappeared in the BermudaTriangle. As a result of these events, 1,700 different people vanished. Theseincidents do not include many other disappearances that were later givenconventional explanations. 1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en627] In2004, Gian Quasar revealed that in the preceding twenty-five years, 75 aircraftand hundreds of pleasure yachts vanished in the Bermuda Triangle without atrace—and on the cover of his book, he indicates that more than 1,075 peopledisappeared as a result.2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en628]The Bermuda Triangle was only one of a series of locations Sanderson had foundwhere strange things were happening. By the late 1960s, Sanderson had clearlydetermined that there were ten areas on earth, approximately equidistant, whereships and planes kept disappearing, strange phenomena were seen in the sea andin the air, and/or equipment malfunctioned. 3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en629]Five of these areas were on the same northern tropical latitude, and each onewas 72 degrees of longitude apart from the next. Five others had the same basiclayout in the southern hemisphere, but they were all shifted 20 degrees to theeast of the ones in the north. Almost all of Sanderson’s network televisionappearances in the early 1970s discussed these vortex points, which created agreat deal of mystery and intrigue. Well over one thousand people haddisappeared in the Bermuda Triangle alone, though Sanderson said there wasnothing triangular about it. As a result of his popularity, military andcommercial pilots began supplying him with even more interesting data. Thepilots said that in these same ten spots, or immediately near them, they wereexperiencing time anomalies—arriving at their destinations either “much tooearly” or “much too late.” This could be confirmed with their own instruments aswell as ground records.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en630]The Dick Cavett Show was extremely popular on ABC in the late 1960s and early1970s. Arthur Godfrey was a frequent guest—a seasoned pilot who enjoyed thirtyyears as a television personality, often representing the view of the biggestaviation companies. A debate was set for March 16, 1971, between Godfrey andSanderson about these ten vortex points. Although they were old friends, in twoearlier appearances Godfrey skeptically dismissed Sanderson’s idea as “a lot ofbloody nonsense,” or something to that effect. Nonetheless, when Sandersonbrought out the globe with the points clearly marked, and laid out all theevidence, Godfrey was blown away. He’d had three different experiences, in thosesame areas, that directly confirmed what Sanderson was saying.In one case, Godfrey lost all radio and instrument contact for an hour and ahalf while flying through the Devil’s Sea, south of Japan, with only four hoursof gas to go—and he was clearly terrified. He also said that when pilots headstraight down the East Coast over the ocean, which is faster than sticking closeto the land, they have to keep a very watchful eye on their instruments. Otherpilots had already said the same thing, including Bob Durant on Barry Farber’sradio show. When Dick Cavett finally asked Godfrey, flat out, if this phenomenonwarranted proper scientific investigation, he looked straight into the camera,and with total, deadpan seriousness, simply said yes.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en631]This triggered a wave of new interest from scientists and engineers. One of thempointed out that the North and South Poles should also be included, as they fitthe same geometric relationships very nicely. Sanderson published a diagram ofthese twelve “vile vortices,” as he called them, in the April 1971 issue ofPursuit, his journal. He then got a huge new burst of publicity when his classicarticle “The Twelve Devil’s Graveyards Around the World” appeared in a 1972issue of Saga magazine. This triggered a scientific investigation by threeSoviet researchers—Nikolai Goncharov, Vyacheslav Morozov and Valery Makarov—whopublished a paper about it in the USSR Academy of Sciences’ popular journalKhimiya i Zhizn, or Chemistry and Life. Their paper came out in 1973, and wastitled “Is the Earth a Large Crystal?” These three guys represented aninteresting mix of talent—Goncharov was a historian, Morozov was a constructionengineer and Makarov was an electronics specialist. Together, they realized thatSanderson’s twelve vortexes created an icosahedron when you connected the dotsin three-dimensional space. This, again, is a roughly spherical geometric objectthat has twenty sides, each of which is a perfect equilateral triangle. Theyfelt this was an energetic crystal structure of some kind that existed withinthe earth.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en632] They referred to it as a“matrix of cosmic energy.”7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en633]037 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_037_r1.gif]Ivan T. Sanderson discovered that most ship and plane disappearances occurred intwelve equidistant locations around the world, forming this geometric pattern.038 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_038_r1.jpg]The icosahedron, discovered in earth’s vortex points by Sanderson, can begeometrically inverted to form a dodecahedron, as we see here.They also knew that when you turn the icosahedron inside out, you get itsgeometric opposite, called the dodecahedron—a twelve-sided object that lookslike a soccer ball, where each of the twelve faces is a five-sided pentagon.They drew all the lines for where these geometries appeared over the surface ofthe earth, based on Sanderson’s twelve original points, and found a wealth ofhidden treasures.Many of the greatest earthquake-prone seismic fracture lines were directly onthis grid. Undersea volcanic mountain ridges often lined up perfectly with thegrid, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge—as well as above-ground mountain ranges.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en634] All of these effects could be theresult of natural spin currents in the mantle, where this sideways force ofgravity pushes the molten material into cyclical flow patterns. The highest andlowest atmospheric pressure zones also appeared in some of the areas where anythree lines crossed—of which there were a total of sixty-two places. Again, thiscould be caused by gravitational force affecting the behavior of theatmosphere—via spiraling currents not yet acknowledged in mainstream science.These vortex areas formed the center points for major ocean currents andwhirlpools as well—showing the gravitational effects upon the flow patterns ofwater. The areas of highest and lowest geomagnetic gauss strength fit neatlywithin this geometry.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en635] Significantconcentrations of ores and petroleum also appeared in these areas. Animalsnaturally followed these paths in their migrations. Unique wildlife appeared inthese areas—and anomalies in the gravitational field.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en636]039 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_039_r1.jpg]Once the dodecahedron was added to Sanderson’s original discovery, Russianscientists discovered that over 3,300 different ancient sites were built on thisgrid.Best of all, advanced prehistoric cultures and ancient civilizations also showedup in these spots. In fact, fully 3,300 different sacred complexes and ancientmonuments, often built out of massive stones, appeared on this grid. Thisincluded the Great Pyramid in Egypt, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe in centralAfrica, Stonehenge and Avebury in England, the pyramids of China in the Xianprovince, the Kunoonda stone circle complex in Australia, the ruins of Nan Madolat Pohnpei, the mysterious stone heads of Easter Island, Machu Picchu in Peru,the pyramids of the Sun and Moon at Teotihuacan in Mexico, the Four Corners areaof the Hopi in the American Southwest including Sedona, Arizona, and manymore.11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en637] This is very compellingevidence that the ancients built their gigantic stone monuments in the placeswhere it was the easiest and also the most coherent, thereby making it mucheasier to shield gravity—and also get much more powerful healing effects aswell. It may even have been possible to use these points for time travel if youknew when the right planetary alignments would occur.William Becker and Bethe Hagens further refined and enhanced the work of theRussian scientists, drawing lines that connected more of the geometric pointstogether—and created what may be the most advanced visualization of the GlobalGrid yet. In their classic work The Planetary Grid: A New Synthesis, twodifferent grid-related aircraft cases were given, where sudden and unpredictablecourse changes occurred without the pilots’ control that fit the structure ofthe grid lines.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en638] The first involvedKAL 007, out of Anchorage, Alaska, on September 1, 1983. The second was KAL 902,heading from Paris to Anchorage on April 20, 1978. Both these flights occurredduring significant holidays in two different cultures : KAL 007 happened duringa major Hindu feast for Vishnu, and KAL 902 took place during GoodFriday/Passover.13 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en639] It is possiblethat certain ancient holidays were chosen for a reason—the earth’s alignment, aswe move through the seasons, may have given atoms and molecules on earth alittle extra kick to get over the light-speed boundary on these special days.Obviously, much more research is needed to confirm this speculation—and someholidays do not appear on the same day from one year to the next—but it’s aninteresting possibility.LEY LINES AND BEYONDIn the twentieth century, Sir Alfred Watkins found that a huge number ofarchitectural sites, from all different historical periods, appeared throughoutEngland on straight-lined paths called ley lines. One in particular cut almosthorizontally across southern England.I was delighted to find a BBC article in 2005 that soberly discussed thesemysteries.“[Ley lines are] alignments and patterns of powerful, invisible earth energysaid to connect various sacred sites, such as churches, temples, stone circles,megaliths, holy wells, burial sites, and other locations of spiritual or magicalimportance.” (Harper’s Encyclopaedia of Mystical and Paranormal Experience) . .. It is true that more “paranormal” activity is evidenced in these areas[including hauntings] . . . effects of this type of energy are said to besimilar to those of static electricity: feelings of “tingling” on the skin andhairs standing on end. . . . A phenomenon often reported during investigationsis that of technical equipment behaving erratically. . . . Major prehistoricstructures of higher importance can frequently be found to occupy locationswhere two or more leys intersect with each other.14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en640]At the end of this article, there is a disclaimer saying it is “usergeneratedcontent” that does not represent the views of BBC Gloucestershire—just so thereis no confusion. All of the effects they mentioned are a perfect match with whatwe’ve been learning about the Source Field.I was also greatly inspired by an article from Joseph Jochmans entitled “Earth:A Crystal Planet?,” which appeared in a 1996 issue of Atlantis Rising, andfeatures some of the points I’ve already mentioned above. Jochmans revealed thatmany ancient cultures around the world had a unique focus on these ancient,straight lines. The Irish called them fairy paths. The Germans called them holylines. The Greeks referred to them as the Sacred Roads of Hermes. The ancientEgyptians called them the Pathways of Min. The Chinese called them lung mei, ordragon currents—and believed that placing stones, trees, temples, houses andpagodas along these lines would directly help the earth, as part of the ancientpractice of Feng-shui. The earth was treated in much the same way as the bodywould be healed—through the acupuncture lines. The idea of the axis mundi alsofits in very nicely. If you have a major energy vortex in a particular land,that obviously would become the focal point for everyone—if enough people knewabout it and could make use of its benefits.The Australian Aborigines called them dream paths—and would do seasonalwalkabouts along these lines to reenergize the life force in those regions. Theywould map out the dream lines on boards called Turingas, and could locate gameanimals and predict the approach of storms by meditating on the lines. AncientPolynesians called them te lapa, or “lines of light,” and could apparently seethem as visible, luminous lines in the ocean that they used for navigation. Theresidents of Easter Island and Hawaii called them aka threads, and built thestone heads and sacred Ahu platforms in Hawaii to harness the mane, or “lifepower,” from these lines. The Incas organized their entire civilization alongceque lines, building wacas or sacred centers along the way—all of whichconverged at the Pyramid of the Sun in Cuzco.The Maya built raised white roadways called Sacbes that followed the lines withperfect straightness, going right through the swamps, to connect their pyramidcomplexes together. Medicine wheels and kiva circles in western North Americaare also found in straight-line arrangements, and the Mound Builders in theMidwest and East Coast regions of what is now the United States also left theirstructures in curious alignments—again seemingly to harness the powers of thisgrid, and the coherence it produces. Jochmans also said that Native Americanshamans often speak of healing energies from the earth they call Orenda, Manitouand other such names. Interestingly, Jochmans also claimed that the Hopi elderssaid the earth was like the back of a spotted fawn. As the fawn gets older, thespots change positions—and new points appear.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en641]GEOMETRIC EXPANSION OF EARTHA NOAA scientist named Dr. Athelstan Spilhaus published a paper in 1976 provingthe Hopi may have been absolutely right. Spilhaus, who passed away in 1998, wasa highly decorated scientist, a genius inventor and the author of a syndicatedcomic strip. He developed the “bathythermograph,” a device for submarinedetection that was vital in helping crush Hitler in World War II.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en642] Spilhaus also was the inventor andresearch director of the top-secret Project MOGUL weather balloon project, whichwas officially said (in 1994) to have been what really crashed at Roswell.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en643] Therefore, Spilhaus’s credibility isessential to the alleged UFO cover-up.The story begins with Dr. Hanshou Liu, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center,who was the first to discover that when the original supercontinent Pangaeabroke up 220 million years ago, it did so along equidistant lines—forming theedges of a pyramid-shaped geometry called a tetrahedron. In this case, you havea pyramid shape with an equilateral triangle on the bottom, and three moreequilateral triangles making the sides.In a discussion with Spilhaus, who was highly talented at creating unique mapprojections, they realized that the continents, volcanic ridges and seismicfault lines then moved into a shape that was a combination of a cube and anoctahedron. An octahedron looks like two Egyptian pyramids base to base, whereeach face is again an equilateral triangle. From this phase, the earth againshifted—into the exact same pattern that was rediscovered by Sanderson in 1971and the Russians in 1973. Spilhaus then created a special map projection wherehe took a single point in the Pacific Ocean and stretched it out into a greatcircle, so that everything on earth was inside this circle. From thatperspective, the geometry became very, very obvious—covering the vast majorityof all seismic and volcanic ridges with astonishing precision.040 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_040_r1.gif]Earth’s continents, mountain ranges and undersea volcanic ridges later expandedinto this icosa-dodeca geometry. A single point in the Pacific Ocean was widenedto form the edge of the entire circle in this map projection by Spilhaus.I personally contacted Dr. Hanshou Liu in June 2004 to see if this remarkablescientific story was true—and he gave me permission to publish the followingstatement.Dear Mr. Wilcock: Dr. Athelstan Spilhaus visited me at NASA Goddard Space FlightCenter in 1976, and asked for reprints of my three papers: Deformation andInstability of Underthrusting Lithospheric Plates, Dynamical Model for theDetachment of Descending Lithosphere, and On the Breakup of Tectonic Plates byPolar Wandering. . . . In 1976, I pointed out such a [geometric] pattern to Dr.Spilhaus in my office from my work. He was heartened to see that the breakup [ofthe earth] occurred along equidistant points and lines which formed a geometricsolid known as a tetrahedron. . . . We had [also] discussed the possiblecuboctahedron and icosadodecahedron stages of the lithospheric expansion. BeforeDr. Spilhaus left my office, he commented [on] my work: “Now, your ideas aboutthe breakup of the tectonic plates can be stated without mathematics, in a formthat people without a scientific education can understand. Your combination ofboldness, insight and courage has enabled you to produce ideas that havetransformed our understanding of the dynamics of the earth.” As a mathematicalphysicist by training, I felt that I was honored.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en644]Obviously, geometry now appears to have a much more significant role in thegrowth and development of the earth than we thought. The conventionally acceptedmodel of plate tectonics, or what used to be called continental drift, can betraced all the way back to Dr. Alfred Wegener in 1912—and has remained largelyunchanged for almost a century. 19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en645]However, both Karl W. Luckert, professor emeritus of the University of SouthernMinnesota,20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en646] and James Maxlow21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en647] -22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en648] have demonstrated clear scientificcases that the earth has been expanding from within since at least 220 millionyears ago—when the mega-continent Pangaea first separated. Maxlow simplysubtracted each stage of expansion that the seafloor went through, worldwide,from the overall volume of the earth’s surface. The results are quite striking,as it appears that all the continents fit perfectly together if you shrink theearth down to 55 to 60 percent of its current size. Maxlow’s work is being takenseriously in certain scientific circles—for example, it was discussed in a 2007issue of the New Concepts in Global Tectonics newsletter.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en649] Maxlow and Luckert are just two ofmany scientists now promoting such models.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en650] Very few scientists have wanted totouch the Earth Expansion Theory, because it suggests that a massive amount ofnew matter is being generated within the earth itself. Yet, at the same time,most of them have no problem supporting the Big Bang theory—where allegedly allthe matter in the Universe was created in a single, gigantic explosion . . . outof nothing. Maxlow, Luckert and others have conclusively shown that the platetectonics model is loaded with problems. If we allow the earth to be expandingfrom within, by a process of continuous matter creation, we have a much moreperfect fit with the real-world data that is available. This, of course, meansthat matter can be spontaneously generated from the Source Field. And best ofall, we see that the earth has been expanding through geometric phases along theway.GLOBAL EXPANSION TECTONICS:Exponential Earth expansion from Early Jurassic to the Present.041 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_041_r1.gif]Dr. James Maxlow’s model of the earth’s expansion. Undersea volcanic ridgesgenerate new crust as earth increases in size.EARTH’S CRYSTAL CORESo far, this geometry has appeared as either hidden energy patterns or outlinesalong the surface of the earth, which we can measure by the location of seismicfault lines, mountain ranges and undersea volcanic ridges—all of which could becaused by gravitational stress currents. What about a real, honest-to-Godcrystal in the earth that is shaped like this? On the Pittsburgh SupercomputingCenter Web site, a division of Carnegie Mellon/University of Pittsburgh, I foundthe following revealing quote.There’s a giant crystal buried deep within the earth, at the very center, morethan three thousand miles down. It may sound like the latest fantasy adventuregame or a new Indiana Jones movie, but it happens to be what scientistsdiscovered in 1995 with a sophisticated computer model of earth’s inner core.25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en651]I was delighted to discover that indeed, the Glatzmaier-Roberts model26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en652] of the earth’s core had a very cleargeometric shape—which some scientists called a “hexagonal” pattern.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en653]042 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_042_r1.jpg]NASA’s Glatzmaier-Roberts model revealed a geometric “crystal” pattern in theearth’s core that fits perfectly into a dodecahedron, as illustrated on theright.However, if you pop in a dodecahedron and then tilt it slightly (about 10degrees), it fits perfectly. No other geometry we have been discussing matchesthis well. We can also clearly see a spiraling, fluidlike vortex moving throughthe center of the geometry as well. One study has concluded that some of theearth’s inner core is behaving like a liquid, despite its geometric structure .. . exactly as we might expect, given the fluidlike qualities of the SourceField.28 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en654] The American GeophysicalUnion has openly stated that the angular tilt of the geometric core is notaligned with the earth’s rotation.29 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en655]As reported in another mainstream study, “even more surprisingly, [the core] isrotating faster than the rest of the earth.”30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en656] We’ll come back to that point later.Scientists even have admitted that current models cannot fully explain this“crystal” in the center of the earth. As reported in Physics Today Online, “The[geometric] alignment [of the earth’s core] may not result from a single force,such as that due to the electromagnetic stresses, but a combination of forcespresent in the inner core.”31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en657]I struggled for years to understand what could be causing all this geometry toappear so obviously in the actual structure and behavior of the earth—not tomention the “tetrahedral geometry” Richard C. Hoagland pointed out on the Sun(sunspot patterns that do not go above 19.5 degrees north or south), Mars (theOlympus Mons shield volcano, three times higher than Mount Everest, at 19.5),Venus (two volcanoes at roughly 19.5), earth (the Hawaiian Islands at 19.5),Jupiter (the Great Red Spot at 19.5) and Neptune (the Great Dark Spot at19.5).32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en658] -33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en659] Straight lines aren’t supposed toappear in nature—at least not in any conventional mind-set. It took quite sometime for me to figure out that gravity was actually responsible for creatingthese cyclones in the atmosphere and/or volcanic upwellings in the mantle.043 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_043_r1.jpg]The swirling winds of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot appear to be driven bygravitational forces that naturally circulate in the shape of a tetrahedron. Onsolid planets, the mantle surges up to form volcanoes at these same vortexpoints.GEOMETRY NATURALLY OCCURS IN A VIBRATING FLUIDI was greatly relieved when I found the work of Dr. Hans Jenny (pronounced“yenny”), who found that this geometry appears quite naturally in a fluid—bysimply vibrating it. Almost immediately, I realized this was the big piece I hadbeen missing, and I was thrilled.In his Cymatics research,34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en660] Dr.Jenny took ordinary water and filled it with tiny, free-floating particles knownas colloids. These particles will not sink because they are so small—they are insuspension. When Dr. Jenny then vibrated the water at different frequencies, theparticles immediately assembled themselves into clear and beautifulthree-dimensional geometries. Each pattern stayed nice and still, maintainingthe same shape—but there was a great deal of rotational movement within theshape itself. The particles were always on the move. Long, curving loops werealso seen emerging from each point of the geometry, showing a constant particleflow from one area to another—and a curving pattern to contrast with thestraight lines in the geometry itself. As long as he didn’t change the shape ofthe fluid, the same geometric pattern would again reappear each time he played acertain frequency of sound. Thus, you could have the same fluid, with the sameparticles, show a number of different geometric patterns. Every time you playeda certain frequency, the same geometry would return—almost as if by magic.Higher-frequency sounds created more complex geometry, and vice versa.Furthermore, when Dr. Jenny vibrated a larger area of water, instead of justseeing one shape emerge, he got multiple copies of the same pattern—all lined upin nice, neat, organized rows. These patterns seemed to resemble a group ofatoms forming a larger structure. Was this the big secret to how all of physicalmatter really formed? It certainly looked that way. It appears that as thefrequency of the energy streaming into the earth increases, the complexity ofthe geometry that is structuring the continents, fault lines and volcanic ridgesincreases as well—moving from tetrahedron, to cuboctahedron, to our currentpattern.044 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_044_r1.jpg]Dr. Hans Jenny found that particles floating in a liquid naturally arranged intodifferent geometric patterns depending on the frequency of vibration heintroduced.By 1996, I had already realized that geometry must be the big secret tounderstanding energy, matter, the mechanisms responsible for biological life,and even consciousness—although I didn’t find the proof in Jenny’s work untillater on. If we want to find out exactly what coherence looks like in a fluid,we look no further than these five basic Platonic solids—the tetrahedron, cube,octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron. Mathematicians already know theseshapes have more symmetry, as in more coherence, than any others. Simply put,each of them will fit perfectly in a sphere, and each point is equidistant fromits neighbors. Each side of the geometry has the same shape, and every internalangle will also be the same.QUANTUM GEOMETRY: THE BIG SECRETPhysicists were always looking for the missing link that could unify the verylarge with the very small. Now that there were clear and obvious geometricpatterns in the earth, it seemed very likely that if we are truly dealing with aunified field model, the patterns we see on a larger scale would also appear inquantum mechanics. Atoms, rather than being a bunch of seemingly solid particleswhirling around a nucleus, could now be reimagined as geometric patterns offlow—within the fluidlike energy of the Source Field. When you increase thefrequency of vibration, the geometry becomes more complex. Once we understandhow this principle really works, it might also lead to the transmutation ofelements—such as the classic alchemist’s dream of turning lead into gold.Where do we start, then? In Larson’s model, if we’re looking for geometry withinthe atom, all we have to do is study the nucleus—as he feels the nucleus is theatom: “In The Case against the Nuclear Atom, Larson . . . points out that, infact, the ‘size’ of the nucleus . . . is rather the size of the atom itself.”35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en661] Larson’s model did not have geometryin it—but Nehru also admits they haven’t worked all the kinks out yet.It is certain that there is a lot more to be done toward enlarging theapplication of the Reciprocal System to the intrinsic structure of the atom.Perhaps it is time to break new ground in the exploration of the mechanics ofthe Time Region. . . . Breaking new ground involves some fresh thinking, andleaving no stone unturned.36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en662]The first scientist I found who had a working quantum physics model, basedentirely on geometry, was Rod Johnson—who posted intriguing concepts on RichardC. Hoagland’s discussion forum back in 1996. In the ensuing years, I haveinterviewed him extensively and published the results on my Web site, DivineCosmos—and unfortunately he passed away in 2010. I was stunned at how manymysteries of quantum mechanics he could explain with geometry—including Planck’sConstant, the Fine Structure Constant, the ratio between the weak force and thestrong force, the structure of the photon, and others.37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en663] Without ever knowing about Larson’smodel, Johnson independently developed a similar concept. In Johnson’s model,there was indeed a parallel reality that is constantly intersecting with our ownin every atom, at the tiniest level. Every atom had one geometry in our reality,and an opposite, inverse geometry in the parallel reality. The two geometriesthen counter-rotated inside of each other. Each stage of this process carriedyou through the different elements. Clearly, Johnson had a great model, althoughhe didn’t have enough specifics to resolve the entire Periodic Table yet—but hefelt all the answers could be found in James Carter’s theory of circlons.38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en664]Later on I found Dr. Robert Moon, who could explain everything in the PeriodicTable with geometry. He was one of the key scientists involved in the ManhattanProject, which developed the world’s first controlled thermonuclear fissionreaction. He was the second scientist ever to build a cyclotron in the 1930s,and significantly improved the first—which had been built by E. O. Lawrence. Inthe Manhattan Project, Dr. Moon solved critical problems to make the firstatomic pile possible, and built the first scanning X-ray microscope after WorldWar II. From 1974 until his death in 1989, he was a key collaborator with LyndonH. LaRouche, Jr.39 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en665] A variety ofarticles on his new quantum physics model can be found at LaRouche’s 21stCentury Science and Technology Web site.40[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en666]In 1986, Dr. Moon finally realized that geometry was the key to understandingquantum physics—and it was a geometry in time as well as in space. That meansthat when you move through space, or time, you must move through geometry. Youcan’t just move in a nice, smooth, even curve—you have to pop through onequantity of space, or one quantity of time, before you can go to the next one.The scientific word for this kind of movement is that it would be quantized. Dr.Moon outlined his concept that space and time are quantized in a lecture from1987.One interpretation . . . [is] that we have two kinds of time, and [laughs] thesecret is that we should have quantization of time for this quantum potential towork. . . . In other words, you have both the quantization of space . . . [and]time. . . . That just struck like a bolt of lightning. Then, the next thing thatstruck was: Well, if space is going to be quantized, it should be quantized withthe highest degree of symmetry. And so that immediately said, well, those arethe Platonic solids. And [laughs], so I was pondering over that until the Suncame up. . . . It seemed very obvious how these solids should fit.41[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en667]The Platonic solids, of course, are all the same geometries we’ve beendiscussing here—the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron.The details are quite technical, but here’s the gist of what Dr. Moon found: Thesame geometric shapes we see in the expansion of the earth also appear withinthe nucleus of the atom. Furthermore, in Moon’s model, more than one geometricform can nest within the nucleus at the same time—each one inside the next. Thisgeometry actually determines how many protons our scientists will find in anyone atom. The trick is to count the number of points on each of the so-calledPlatonic solids. There are eight points on a cube, six on an octahedron, twelveon an icosahedron and twenty on a dodecahedron, for a total of forty-six. InMoon’s model, that’s the first half of the naturally occurring elements in thePeriodic Table. Moon knew there are a total of ninety-two elements that appearin nature, or two times forty-six—so he believed that every atom with an atomicweight of forty-seven or higher was a combination of two nests of geometryconnected side by side, growing increasingly unstable along the way.42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en668]You may have noticed Dr. Moon did not include the tetrahedron in this grouping.He feels that since the geometric opposite of the tetrahedron is still atetrahedron, it plays a different role. Indeed, in Rod Johnson’s model as wellas Buckminster Fuller’s earlier model, a photon appears as two tetrahedronsback-to-back—and we have the solid data to prove it in Planck’s Constant.43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en669]Anyway, some very cool things happen when you use Moon’s model. The firstcompleted shell in the nucleus is the cube, with eight protons. This correspondsto oxygen, which is highly stable—and makes up 62.55 percent of all the atoms inthe earth’s crust. It is also interesting that oxygen is one of the single mostimportant elements to sustain life. The second completed shell is theoctahedron, with fourteen protons—and now you have silicon, which comes in at21.22 percent. Although we are considered carbon-based life-forms, silicon isalso very important for biological life—and seems to be the key ingredient inthe spontaneous generation experiments, such as Dr. Ignacio Pacheco’s work withthe silicon in beach sand.045 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_045_r1.gif]Dr. Robert Moon discovered that the protons of atoms naturally assemble into thePlatonic solids, as seen here. Each proton corresponds to a vertex of thegeometry.So, between these first two shells alone—oxygen with a cubical nucleus andsilicon with an octahedron-shaped nucleus—you have 84 percent of all the atomsin the earth’s crust. Then, when you move up to complete the next shape, theicosahedron, you now have twenty-six protons. This is the iron atom, which isthe best metal we have for creating naturally occurring magnetic fields. Thishidden geometric symmetry may very well be responsible for iron’s magneticproperties—by acting as a conduit for the Source Field, as we will discuss. Ofall the atoms in the earth’s crust, 1.20 percent are iron, but they add up to 5percent of the total weight. Then, the dodecahedron fills up at forty-sixprotons, and you now have palladium—which is an unusually symmetrical atom thatwas used in all the cold fusion experiments. And in case you think cold fusionwas all just a waste of time, don’t forget that Dr. Eugene Mallove resigned fromhis position as the chief editor of MIT’s technical newsletter when he allegedlydiscovered they were falsifying their own data on cold fusion—as if to say therewas no effect.44 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en670]According to a paper by Laurence Hecht, Moon’s model satisfies all sorts ofquantum puzzles—including the processes of fission and fusion, the mysteryperiod of fourteen for the rare earth elements, the exact number of elements ineach row of the Periodic Table, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer’s Magic Numbers, inwhich the properties of the nucleus tend to suddenly change at certain numbersthat curiously reappear—whether you’re looking at protons, neutrons or the massnumber. 45 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en671] Hecht has continueddeveloping and refining Moon’s model ever since Moon’s death in 1989.46[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en672]MICROCLUSTERS AND QUASI-CRYSTALSI was even more impressed when I found out that atoms naturally gather togetherinto these exact same geometric patterns when they are set loose, one at a time,in a given area. These are called microclusters, and they are completelybaffling to mainstream scientists. The microcrystals floating in the pinealgland may be similar—albeit larger. A 1989 issue of Scientific American revealedthat microclusters do not have characteristics like liquids or gases.They belong instead to a new phase of matter, the microcluster. . . . They posequestions that lie at the heart of solid-state physics and chemistry. . . . Howmight the atoms reconfigure if freed from the influence of the matter thatsurrounds them?47 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en673]I then found the college textbook Microcluster Physics by Satoru Sugano andHiroyasu Koizumi, which revealed even more—including compelling images of thegeometry.48 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en674]Microclusters can be anywhere between ten to a thousand atoms. The strangestthing about them is that the electrons appear to orbit the center of thecluster, rather than the center of each individual atom. Of course, this weirdbehavior suggests there are no electrons. Instead, what scientists actually seeis geometrically arranged electron clouds, which appear to be where thefluidlike flow of the Source Field enters into the atom. Once some of thisstored energy is released from the atom, it turns into a photon—which then lookslike a particle. Microclusters are also called “monatomic elements” or “ORMUSelements” in various sources—elegantly summarized in Lawrence Gardner’s LostSecrets of the Sacred Ark.49 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en675]Microclusters appear to display gravitational anomalies, including levitation,under certain circumstances—as well as superconductivity. Ancient peoplesbelieved that ingesting microcluster gold would awaken their pineal glands—andthe Egyptians even stored it in cone-shaped cakes.50[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en676]Yet another tantalizing clue that atoms are geometric patterns within afluidlike energy flow is the phenomenon of quasi-crystals. In this case, youhave crystals that look just like the Platonic solids we’ve been discussing,including the dodecahedron—along with other forms. They are created bysupercooling certain combinations of molten metals at a very fastspeed—apparently capturing the molecules while they are flip-flopping betweenspace-time and time-space, and freezing them into a half-in, half-out crystalpattern. The problem is that these crystals destroy all the known rules ofcrystal formation—they should not be able to exist, because you cannot buildperfect five-sided crystals out of atoms that are made of particles.51[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en677]According to Edgar Fouche, who claims to have worked at the semi-mythical GroomLake/Area 51, quasi-crystals were found in wreckage recovered from the Roswellcrash and eight other similar incidents. They were found to be extremely strong,extremely heat-resistant, and would not conduct electricity—even though themetals within them normally did. Fouche also said they were found to be veryuseful.I’ve discovered that the classified research has shown that quasi-crystals arepromising candidates for high energy storage materials, metal matrix components,thermal barriers, exotic coatings, infrared sensors, high power laserapplications and electro-magnetics. Some high strength alloys and surgical toolsare already on the market.52 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en678]Here, he’s obviously referring to Kevlar and Teflon, which some insiders saywere “reverse-engineered” from crashed extraterrestrial craft. Fouche also saidthese crystals were baffling to the scientists working in these projects.The lattice of hydrogen quasi-crystals, and another material not named, formedthe basis for the plasma shield propulsion of the Roswell craft, and was anintegral part of the biochemically engineered vehicle. A myriad of advancedcrystallography undreamed of by scientists were discovered by the scientists andengineers who evaluated, analyzed and attempted to reverse-engineer thetechnology presented with the Roswell vehicle, and eight more vehicles whichhave crashed since then. Arguably after 35 years of secret research on theRoswell hardware, those who had recovered these technologies still had hundredsif not thousands of unanswered questions about what they had found—and it wasdeemed “safe” to quietly introduce “quasi-crystals” to the non-initiatedscientific world.53 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en679]Obviously, with our new quantum mechanics model in place, we are now much closerto understanding how these crystals may have formed—and it seems that ourvisitors know much more about this science than we do.ROCKS WITH NATURALLY OCCURRING QUASI-CRYSTALSIn Lost Science by Gerry Vassilatos, I found the intriguing suggestion thatcertain rocks may have naturally occurring quasi-crystals in them. ApparentlyDr. Charles Brush, an American physical chemist who studied gravity in theVictorian era, found certain rocks known as Lintz Basalts, which actually fellmore slowly than other materials—by a tiny but measurable amount. As he studiedthem further, he also found they had an unusual amount of “excess heat.” Whilethis would obviously sound crazy to most people, it makes perfect sense when weremember that if you have the right coherence—which we now know means the rightgeometry—you can indeed get a gravity-shielding effect and may also be able topull in energy directly from time-space.54[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en680]Dr. Thomas Townsend Brown got samples of these rocks and found that they wouldspontaneously give off surprisingly high voltages. Just putting wires on therocks could give you several millivolts—and if you sliced them up into multiplepieces, you could get a full volt of free energy when you put them all together.Brown also found that the rock batteries would get stronger at six P.M., andweaker again at seven A.M.—showing that the light and heat of the Sun had ade-cohering effect on the energy they were pulling in. They also worked betterat higher elevations, possibly thanks to a pyramid effect from mountains. Otherinventors, such as Hodowanec, independently duplicated and verified these sameresults.55 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en681]According to Vassilatos, certain researchers traveled to the Andes and got up to1.8-volt surges from a single rock. The more graphite was in the rocks, the morevoltage they put out. Best of all, Brown found that they gave off two differentelectrical signals. One was steady, but the other would fluctuate with solaractivity and the positions and configurations between the Sun and the Moon. Healso found that distant pulses of gravity in space caused small electricalbursts in the rocks. Other rocks that were rich in silica also produced thesecharges. Brown was able to spot pulsar activity and supernovas long before theywere announced by radio astronomers, as well as solar flares—even though therocks were shielded from radioactivity, heat and light.56[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en682]In the same book, Vassilatos reveals the work of Dr. Thomas Henry Moray, anothersuppressed scientist who apparently found an even more powerful rock with thesame properties. Moray only referred to it as the “Swedish Stone,” and did notsay where exactly it came from. It was a soft, silvery white material he foundin two different areas—one from a rock outcropping in crystalline form, andanother from a smooth white powder he scraped off of a railroad car. When hetried to use the crystal as a piezoelectric detector for radio waves, the signalcame out with such power that it destroyed his headphones. Even a very largeloudspeaker would blast at an extremely high volume whenever he tuned in to agiven radio station. Moray was able to use this material to create an extremelypowerful free energy device—and even his first prototype, which only used awristwatch-size piece of “Swedish Stone,” could simultaneously run a 100-wattlight bulb and a 655-watt electric heater. The deeper he drove his groundingrods into the ground, the brighter the light became. In 1925, he demonstratedthis technology to the Salt Lake City General Electric Company, as well asseveral qualified witnesses from Brigham Young University. They tried everythingthey could to prove it was a fraud, and were allowed to disassemble the entiresetup—but they could find nothing. Later, Moray developed prototypes that couldpump out fifty kilowatts of energy—enough to power a small factory all day,every day, without ever running out or needing to pay for energy.Moray began trying to secure a patent in 1931, but was continually refused. Andin 1939, the Rural Electrification Association sent a “scientific expert” alongwith others for a meeting with Moray. It turned out they were carrying guns andintended to kill him—but Moray had his own firearm and shot back, driving themoff. As a result, Moray replaced all the windows on his car with bulletproofglass, and felt he had to constantly carry a revolver. He was never botheredagain, but his breakthrough technology also never saw the light of day.Later, he found that the Swedish Stone was doing other strange things. Forexample, he found that by using a standard radio receiver, he was tuning in thesounds of people’s conversations and other day-to-day activities at longdistances away—even though there were no microphones in those areas. He was ableto travel to the exact sources of the sounds and confirm that he was pickingthem up. He also found that significant healing effects occurred from thesestones as well. Then, by 1961, Moray found he could direct the energy fields hisdevices generated to grow micro-crystals (sound familiar?) of gold, silver andplatinum—from otherwise worthless soil that came from where these elements weremined. Soil that initially only had 0.18 ounces of gold per ton could be used toproduce as much as 100 ounces of gold and 225 ounces of silver. He had achievedthe alchemist’s dream of transmutation—in this case by starting with tinycrystals of gold, silver or platinum that were already in the soil, and causingthem to grow much, much larger—like seeds. Through similar techniques, he wasable to manufacture lead that was impossible to melt below 2,000 degreesFahrenheit, and copper that was extremely strong and heat-resistant—which heused as bearings in high-speed motors. Another alloy he developed could beheated to 12,000 degrees Fahrenheit without melting.57[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en683] According to Vassilatos, Morayattempted to synthesize more of the Swedish Stone on his own, and submitted itto a comprehensive microanalytical profile. From these results, we now know themain ingredient was ultra-pure Germanium, which does contain a small, relativelyharmless amount of radioactivity that can easily be shielded.Arthur L. Adams, a retired electrical engineer, found a smooth, silvery graymaterial in Wales in the 1950s that also created extraordinary amounts of poweron its own. When a special battery made from slices of these stones was dippedin water, the power became far more substantial—and when the stones were takenout, the water continued to produce electrical power for hours . . . not unlikethe DNA Phantom Effect.58 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en684] Britishauthorities seized all Adams’s research papers and materials, claiming this wasbeing done for “future social distribution.” That time obviously has not yetarrived.GENETIC GEOMETRYAmino acids fit together to make proteins. These rules are complex—andscientists really don’t understand why certain amino acids fit together andothers do not. Dr. Mark White analyzed these relationships and found thateverything makes sense if you map out the amino acids over the surface of adodecahedron.59 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en685]046 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_046_r1.gif]Dr. Mark White discovered that all the perplexing relationships of hownucleotides fit together in the genetic code can be solved by mapping them on adodecahedron.What is the ideal form of a DNA molecule? It is a double helix. What is theideal form of the double helix? It is a dodecahedron . What is the ideal form ofthe genetic code? It is also a dodecahedron. As important as the double helixwas toward understanding DNA, the dodecahedron is equally important towardunderstanding the genetic code. Perhaps more so.60[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en686]The same geometric laws seem to appear in quantum mechanics, planetarygeodynamics and life itself—thanks to the fact that the Source Field isfluidlike, and geometry naturally appears when a fluid is pulsated. Pyramids andother funnel-shaped structures harness this flow and generate coherence in agiven area, creating increasingly refined geometric patterns—and thus healingbiological life, improving our mental health, regularizing the flow of currentsin the mantle, the oceans, the atmosphere and the ionosphere to protect us fromcataclysms, and improving the hardness and purity of crystalline structures.This science may also pave the way for a wealth of free energy technologies thatcould permanently end our crippling dependence on oil—and usher in a new era ofpeace, freedom and prosperity that we may never have dreamed possible before."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENThe Maya Calendar and the Gateway to Intelligent InfinityEvery astronomer owes Johannes Kepler a debt of gratitude for working out thebasic laws of planetary motion. Sadly, they’ve all abandoned his greater vision:namely that the spacing of planetary orbits in our solar system could beprecisely defined by the Platonic solids. Where did he get this idea from? Wasit strictly an original thought, or had he been “tipped off ” by the mysteryschools? Just as I was finishing this book, I found solid proof, from a truemaster of geometry, that Kepler was right. The orbits of the planets do indeedhold the same three-dimensional geometric relationships that we see in theearth’s grid, in DNA and protein synthesis, and all throughout quantummechanics—namely, the Platonic solids.I was taught in school that Kepler’s concept of interplanetary geometry was ahilarious wrong turn in science, and certainly had never been proven. Yearslater, I came to feel he might have been right—but I didn’t have the proof.Then, by a seemingly “random chance,” I “just so happened” to “stumble over”what I was looking for. A friend handed me a book and said, “You might want toread this.” And the best part was the title: A Little Book of Coincidence, byJohn Martineau.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en687] Within minutes, Irealized I’d been handed the final key I needed to unlock the mysteries of theancients.047 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_047_r1.jpg]Johannes Kepler worked out the basic laws of planetary motion. He also believedthe planets were spaced apart by geometric relationships, as he illustratedhere.GEOMETRIC FORCES IN PLANETARY ORBITSI already knew there were impressive harmonic relationships in the orbits of theplanets. I wrote about them extensively in all three of my earlier scientificbooks, which you can go back to my Web site and read for all the details. I alsosaw some compelling suggestions of a hidden geometry in the planetary orbitswhen I read Time Stands Still by Keith Critchlow, now considered rare and hardto find. (My copy cost me 150 dollars.) Critchlow’s book also features stunningimages of Platonic solids carved into Neolithic stone spheres that were dug up,by the hundreds, all throughout Scotland. Martineau’s book had the final piece Iwas looking for: Geometry is the key to unlock the mysteries of the solarsystem. The planets are apparently being held in place and driven through theirorbits by the same geometric forces that very likely create atoms andmolecules—as well as the global grid. This, of course, makes it much moreinteresting to chart planetary alignments. We can now reimagine these alignmentsas moments when the gears in a giant, invisible clock line up with geometricprecision. However, instead of flat, circular wheels with teeth on them, thesegears are the Platonic solids. And when they line up, we may have the key tostargate travel, far beyond the reach of our solar system—and perhaps acrossmuch larger chunks of time than just a few days here and there.In November 2010, Prince Charles released his new book Harmony: A New Way ofLooking at Our World—in which he uses Martineau’s groundbreaking research toargue that the Universe displays evidence of a “grammar of harmony.”I was captivated when I came across the work of a young geometer called JohnMartineau while he was studying at my School of Traditional Arts some years ago.He decided to make a close study of how the orbits of the planets relate to eachother and how the patterns that can be drawn from them fit so precisely withthings made down here on earth. He found many rather beautiful relationships. .. . This is all pretty remarkable evidence that there is a mysterious unity [in]the patterns found throughout the whole of creation. From the smallest ofmolecules to the biggest of the planetary “particles” revolving around the Sun,everything depends for its stability upon an incredibly simple, very elegantgeometric patterning—the grammar of harmony.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en688]Kepler’s vision of the planets is first discussed on page 12 of Martineau’sbook.Looking for a geometric or musical solution to the orbits, Kepler observed thatsix heliocentric planets meant five intervals. The famous geometric solution hetried was to fit the five Platonic solids between their spheres.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en689]On page 14, things get much more interesting: “Kepler . . . particularly noticedthat the ratios between planets’ extreme angular velocities were all harmonicintervals.” Then, Martineau begins delivering the goods.Two nested pentagons define Mercury’s orbital shell (99.4%), the empty spacebetween Mercury and Venus (99.2%), Earth’s and Mars’s relative mean orbits(99.7%), and the space between Mars and Ceres (99.8%). Three nested pentagonsdefine the space between Venus and Mars (99.6%) or Ceres’ and Jupiter’s meanorbits (99.6%). A hidden pattern?4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en690]Absolutely yes. The five-sided pentagon is found in both the dodecahedron, withits five-sided faces, and the icosahedron, with groups of five triangles sharingcommon points—so we’re definitely on to something.On page 20, Martineau makes the intriguing suggestion that even though theplanetary orbits are elliptical, we can still study the basic proportions thathold them in place as if they were spherical. This is probably because theirnaturally spherical energy fields are being squeezed by the pressure andmomentum of their movement through clouds of gas and dust in the galaxy.I was stunned to see that if you draw one circle for the average orbit ofMercury, and put three of these circles together to make a triangle, then whenyou draw a circle around them, you get the orbit of Venus—within 99.9 percent.Of course, since these are actually spheres, it’s not a triangle at all—it’s ourclassic three-sided tetrahedron, the simplest of all the Platonic solids.Then, on page 24, Martineau produces a remarkable geometric diagram of therelationship between Earth, Venus and the Sun. Every eight Earth years, orthirteen Venusian years, they line up to form the next corner of a perfectpentagon—with 99.9 percent precision. Even better, when we work in the nearestand farthest points Venus reaches during this eight-year dance, another pentagonis formed that is even larger—and in perfect proportion to the others. This verylikely is the result of Platonic geometries within spheres of energy that areprecisely structuring where the planets travel—again, in this case, thanks tothe dodecahedron and icosahedron with their five-sided symmetry.048 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_048_r1.jpg]John Martineau illustrates a perfect triangular relationship between the orbitsof Mercury and Venus. This triangle forms a tetrahedron in three dimensions.On page 32, we find out that there is geometric precision between earth and theMoon—thanks to the work of Robin Heath. There are between twelve and thirteenfull moons in a year. If we then draw a circle (again, a sphere) with a diameterof thirteen units, and inscribe a perfect, five-sided star inside it, each armof the star will measure 12.364 units. This is the exact number of full moons ina year—to a 99.95-percent level of accuracy. This again suggests there is asphere of force between earth and the Moon—where the Moon’s movements are beingprecisely driven by the rotating vortex currents of gravity within thedodecahedron geometry, which is all based on five-fold symmetry.I was amazed when I saw pages 34 and 35, as Martineau shows that therelationships between the spacing of Venus, Earth and Mars are all perfectlydefined by the icosahedron and dodecahedron. In this case, Martineau directlynames and illustrates these two geometries. Mars is obviously the farthest awayof these three planets, and if you make that orbit into a perfect sphere, youcan then put the sphere of Venus’s orbit inside of it. The distance between thesphere of Venus and the sphere of Mars is precisely defined by thedodecahedron—with 99.98-percent perfection. Then, if you flip this samedodecahedron inside out to get the icosahedron, you can fit a larger sphereinside of it—and that happens to be the exact distance of Earth’s orbit, within99.9-percent accuracy. If the details seem confusing, you can go read the bookand get into all the specifics—but these are very clear geometric relationshipsbetween the planets, just like the geometry we see in quantum mechanics and theglobal grid.The magic continues to happen as we go farther out. When we draw a circle forthe orbit of Mars, we can then put it in the middle of a group of four largercircles that touch each other perfectly. Each of these four larger circles isprecisely the size of Jupiter’s average orbit, with 99.98-percent perfection.This obviously forms a square, which becomes a cube—so there appears to be ahidden, cubical energy field between these two planets, determining the exactdistance and timing of their orbits from each other. Martineau also shows abeautiful cubical relationship between Jupiter’s two largest moons, Ganymede andCallisto—and also reveals a perfect cubical relationship (within 99.9 percent)by comparing the orbit of Earth and Mars.One of the biggest dead giveaways that there is geometry in the solar system isin the Trojans, which are clusters of asteroids that orbit in front of andbehind Jupiter in the same loop. One cluster is always precisely sixty degreesahead of Jupiter, and the other cluster is always sixty degrees behind Jupiter.There has never been a compelling scientific explanation of why this ishappening. Obviously, this sixty-degree spacing allows you to start drawinggeometric patterns if you represent Jupiter’s orbit as a perfect sphere. I wasstunned to see that if you take the sphere of Jupiter’s orbit and nest threecubes, three octahedrons or any other combination of these two shapes together,one inside the other, you get a sphere in the center that is exactly the size ofearth’s orbit—with 99.8 percent perfection.Then, Jupiter and Saturn have a very close five-to-two relationship betweentheir orbital periods. They make a conjunction every twenty years, but eachconjunction appears at a new point within the great circle of their sharedorbits. If you plot out six of these conjunctions within that shared circle andconnect the dots, you get a perfect Star of David. This is the geometry of thestar tetrahedron or merkabah—where you have one tetrahedron pointing up andanother one pointing down, blended together. Again, the Platonic solids areworking their magic.Lastly, on pages 48 and 49, we find another triangle, or tetrahedron, in therelationship between the orbit of Uranus and Saturn. I was also intrigued thatthe radius of Saturn’s orbit is equal to the circumference of Mars’s orbit, to99.9-percent accuracy—and the circumference of Saturn’s orbit is the same as thediameter of Neptune’s orbit. Just so Pluto doesn’t feel left out, we discover onpage 50 that “Neptune’s orbital period is twice that of Uranus, and Uranus’s istwo-thirds that of Pluto.” That means our entire solar system is being governedby a series of absolutely perfect geometric relationships, many of which can bedirectly associated with the Platonic solids. As Prince Charles said, “This may,of course, all be a coincidence, but such is their precision it does begin tochallenge the popular notion that we live in an accidental universe. . . .” 5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en691]I was absolutely stunned. I had felt for fifteen years that this must be theanswer, but other books I’d read on sacred geometry seemed to suggest thatKepler’s dream was ultimately a failure. Now I realized they simply hadn’tworked hard enough to see the truth—but John Martineau had done his homework andfigured everything out. I did already know that galaxies gathered into massivesuperclusters, and those superclusters mysteriously arrange into gigantic,diamond-shaped octahedrons. 6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en692] Theoctahedrons form a matrix—repeating over and over again across vast distances.7[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en693] -8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en694] -9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en695]The background dust and gas at the farthest reaches of the Universe alsoclusters into the shape of an octahedron.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en696] Further analysis revealed adodecahedron pattern in the dust as well.11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en697] These laws truly do extendthroughout the entire Universe, at all levels of size.If you’re scratching your head at this point and wondering why I even botheredto mention all this, let me make myself clear. We’ve already seen evidence thatSanderson’s twelve main vortex points create direct gateways into time-space. Ahuge number of ships and planes have seen strange lights appear in the sea or inthe sky, had bizarre equipment malfunctions, spontaneously moved forward orbackward in time, warped through space from one place to another, or simplydematerialized entirely—making a complete crossover into time-space. The key, asthe ancients obviously knew, is in the geometry. Or, as the old saying goes, “Xmarks the spot.”CONJUNCTIONS BECOME STARGATE PORTALSI now had the proof that these same three-dimensional geometric relationshipsexisted in the planetary orbits. This meant planetary conjunctions were muchmore interesting than just dates on a calendar. During these alignments,gigantic interplanetary geometry is lining up as well—creating greater coherencehere on earth as all that energy multiplies. The more of an alignment you havebetween these hidden geometric energy patterns in the solar system, the morecoherence you have—and the more likely you are to be able to directly travelthrough time-space.The ancients may have been very aware that at certain times, a particulargeometric node on earth would come into alignment with other geometry in thesolar system—and this is when the magic happens. Then, if you’ve built apyramid, or even a stone circle, you can generate even more coherence—as we sawwith the Russian pyramid experiments. (Don’t forget that when the Russianscharged rocks in the pyramid, and then arranged them around a growing crop, theygot much more coherence in the area inside the rocks. So if you charged up therocks that made Stonehenge, you now would get the same effect. And even if youdidn’t charge them up first, simply arranging them in a circle should be enoughto harness and concentrate the earth’s energy—by creating a circular vortexpattern.) I’ve also heard from insider sources that these alignments are thesecret to alchemy. Lead will turn into gold in certain methods, but you have toknow when to do it. Only when the earth and solar system produces the propercoherence will this ancient science of Al-Kemit—literally “the Science ofEgypt”—actually work.A NEW VIEW OF THE MAYA CALENDARThe Maya were obviously a pyramid-building culture, or at least inherited alltheir traditions from a pyramid-building culture. I do not believe that humansacrifice had anything to do with the original founding of the Mayacivilization—this represented the end result of a long period of decay, movingever-increasingly farther away from where it once started. It may well be thatthe ancient founders of the Maya civilization were, in fact, aware that youcould levitate large stone blocks, teleport through space, and even travelthrough time when the geometry of the earth lined up with the geometry of thesolar system. It is very likely that one of the main reasons they built thepyramids was to have a coherence generator—so that when these special alignmentsopened up, they could harness them. Obviously, if this were true, they would bevery interested in tracking the orbits of the planets—with great precision.I’ve seen many, many skeptics stridently attack the Maya calendar as if it werea bunch of meaningless nonsense. And even when people write about it in afavorable way, suggesting that the end date of 2012 is truly a significantevent, hardly anyone actually crunches the numbers within the calendar to see ifthey mean something. More specifically, why were the Maya counting all thesedifferent cycles that mesh together with each other so perfectly? Why not justcount earth days, lunar months and earth years, and leave it at that? Isuspected that if I actually did the homework, I might find that the Maya werecounting these cycles for a reason—and I struck gold.The Maya, and many other indigenous Mesoamerican cultures, gave every day aname—for a total of twenty days. This twenty-day period was called a veintena inmany pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. It was also referred to as a winal inthe Maya calendar, as well as in the Zapotec and Mixtec cultures. It seemed toserve the same basic function as a month does in our own calendar system.Eighteen winals of twenty days each were counted up to get 360 days, or a tun.Then an additional five “nameless days,” called nemontemi in many cultures andwayeb in the Maya calendar, were added in to get our typical 365-day earthyear—so you had eighteen twenty-day months in a year, plus the five namelessdays added in.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en698] This whole systemof counting the earth year was collectively known as the Haab. Interestingly,the nameless days were considered to be a dangerous time, where the boundariesbetween the mortal realm and the underworld dissolved. Allegedly, rambunctiousspirits could get through during this time and cause disasters to occur.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en699] This might be the result of athinning of the veil between space-time and time-space—given a more supernaturalexplanation. It is also interesting that if the 360 days represent a perfectsphere—a harmonic geometry—then perhaps those five days are where we losesymmetry . . . and the coherence is broken.The twenty-day cycle was considered to be an astrology system, where each ofthese days had a particular character or quality to it. Their counting systemalso went one through twenty—unlike our own, which only goes one through ten.And despite their meticulous tracking of the Haab, or solar year, they alsofollowed other cycles at the same time. Even though they counted twenty days asthe veintena or winal, they also gave each day a number, which they called thetrecena cycle. Strangely, these numbers only count up to thirteen—and then onthe fourteenth day you start on the number one again. That means that thetwenty-day and thirteen-day cycles don’t line up until 260 days—or thirteentimes twenty. This 260-day cycle was known as the tzolkin— and it is consideredthe oldest and most important timing system throughout all Mesoamerican regions,appearing earlier than the very first Maya inscriptions that ever featured it.14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en700]DECODING THE 260-DAY TZOLKIN CYCLEIt took years of detective work for me to track down the answer of why theancients were so interested in these cycles—and I only found the answer late in2009, while I was putting the research together for this book. Professor RobertPeden, from Deakin University’s School of Sciences in Australia, crunched thenumbers and wrote up his discoveries in 1981—but never published the results. Itdidn’t actually appear online until 2004—but it answered all my questionsbeautifully.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en701] In short, the tzolkinis nothing less than the ultimate cycle that links all the planetary orbits, andtheir geometry, together with one single common denominator—or at the very leastVenus, earth, the Moon, Mars and Jupiter. Furthermore, it is the only cycle thatis under a hundred years in length that can do this—with an accuracy better thanone day in one hundred years.If this sounds confusing, let me explain how it works. Take fifty-nine tzolkincycles and add them up. This is almost exactly the same length of time as fortyearth years, with 99.6 percent precision. Forty-six tzolkins equals 405 lunarmonths, at 99.7 percent accuracy. Sixty-one Venus years is 137 tzolkins, with99.2 percent precision. Three tzolkins give you one Mars year—at 97.2 percentaccuracy. And lastly, 135 tzolkins add up to eighty-eight Jupiter years—with99.7 percent perfection. I was really blown away when I saw this—and hardlyanyone who writes and lectures about the Maya calendar knows about it. Inregards to this counting system, Peden quotes Coe in 1966.How such a period of time ever came into being remains an enigma, but the use towhich it was put is clear. Every single day had its own omens and associations,and the inexorable march of the twenty days acted as a kind of fortunetellingmachine, guiding the destinies of the Maya and all peoples of Mexico.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en702]Peden explains this further in his own words.Two hundred sixty was more accurate than 360 days in tracking the moon. [It] wasable to satisfactorily track Venus and Mars. [It] is the best choice to trackJupiter and is the only choice that can simultaneously track all five cycles . .. these factual astronomical derivations are ipso facto sufficient todemonstrate the astronomical base for the Mesoamerican calendrical system.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en703]THE TWENTY-YEAR KATUN CYCLEThe next cycle the Maya tracked was called the katun, made up of twenty 360-daytuns, for a total of 7,200 days. This is a little less than twenty years inlength—and only fifty-four days less than a Jupiter-Saturn conjunction. One ofthe first books I read about ancient mysteries was Our Ancestors Came from OuterSpace by Maurice Chatelain18 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en704]—and hefound that the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction also tied in with a variety of cyclesin our solar system. He felt that the correct katun should be 7,254 days, tomatch the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction perfectly, which I do not think is true—butit doesn’t appear to be an accident that they are so close. There is a definiteresonance there. When you consider that earth’s orbit is only a little over fivedays away from being a perfect 360 days per year, the precession of theequinoxes is a little less than the ideal harmonic value of 25,920 years, andthe Jupiter-Saturn conjunction is only fifty-four days away from being a perfect7,200 earth days, this may all be the result of a catastrophic planetaryexplosion in what is now the Asteroid Belt—as Dr. Tom Van Flandren hascompellingly argued.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en705] The solarsystem would still be harmonic in the aftermath of such an event, but perhapsnot as perfect as it once was. It may be that all these cycles are ultimatelybeing driven by galactic energy fields, as we will see—and the solar system mayhave fallen a bit out of sync with the galaxy . . . at least for now.Here’s what Chatelain had to say about this cycle.For the Mayas the katun of 7,254 days was not only a measure of time but also anastronomical unit to express the synodic periods of revolution of planets—or thecount of days needed for each planet to be realigned with the Sun and Earth. Forexample, 5 katuns were equal to 313 revolutions of Mercury, 13 katuns were equalto 121 revolutions of Mars, or 27 katuns were equal to 7 returns of Halley’scomet.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en706]Notice that Mercury was not present in Peden’s analysis, and Mars was theweakest of the cycle connections—but here Chatelain found very nice alignments.It’s important to point out that Chatelain was director of communications forNASA’s Apollo program, and very familiar with complex calculations like this. Ishould also mention that at least three different insiders I spoke to—each ofwhom made a compelling case that he had worked in classified top-secretprojects—told me earth has a natural twenty-year cycle that forms a directconduit between different periods of time.THE FOUR-HUNDRED-YEAR BAKTUN CYCLENext we take twenty katuns of 7,200 days to get the baktun, which weighs in at144,000 days—or 394.3 years. In Beyond 2012, Geoff Stray pointed out that thisis very close to the time it takes earth’s inner core to make one completerotation. Let’s not forget that earth’s core appears to be a dodecahedron, basedon the most accurate modeling we now have available. In modern times, it wasn’tuntil 1996 that we found out the core is rotating slightly faster than the restof earth—and takes about four hundred years to complete one cycle.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en707] Specifically, Drs. Xiaodong Song andPaul G. Richards, from Lamont-Doherty, the earth sciences division of ColumbiaUniversity, discovered there was a nearly vertical line in earth’s core—whereseismic waves moved faster through this area than anywhere else. The line wastilted about ten degrees off of earth’s rotational axis—which led them toconclude earth’s core was actually on a slightly different axis than theexterior. After studying thirty-eight earthquakes between 1967 and 1995, as wellas other seismic data, Columbia made its official press release.Dr. Song and Dr. Richards calculated that over a year, the inner core rotatesabout one longitudinal degree more than the Earth’s mantle and crust. The innercore makes a complete revolution inside the Earth in about 400 years.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en708]Could this be what the Maya calendar was tracking? Think about it—the core is adodecahedron. It’s three-quarters the size of the Moon, and is almost thirteentimes denser than water—meaning it has 30 percent more mass than the Moon.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en709] When we think about how much of aneffect the Moon has on our oceans, creating the tides, it’s clear that the coreexerts a powerful force. And since the core is a perfect dodecahedron, thatmeans it may also be creating its own time portals. “Natural stargates” may bemore likely to occur when geometric vortex points on earth’s surface line upwith this geometry in the core. If it takes four hundred years for this geometryto make a full circuit inside earth, then every day within thatfour-hundred-year cycle will be different in terms of the alignments. That maybe why the Maya used the baktun as their largest cycle—other than the fullcalendar itself. It is a compelling idea—but if it’s really true, then I wouldalso expect this four-hundred-year cycle should be doing something else that wecan measure. Then we could make an even greater case for why the ancients wouldbe so interested in tracking this cycle. I found a study by Takesi Yukutake,from 1971, that clearly spelled it out.Periods of Earth warming and cooling occur in cycles. This is well understood,as is the fact that small-scale cycles of about 40 years exist withinlarger-scale cycles of 400 years, which in turn exist inside still larger scalecycles of twenty thousand years, and so on.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en710]The small-scale cycles of forty years are, of course, exactly two katuns inlength—again forming a very nice fit with the Maya calendar cycles. And even in1971, Yukutake was aware that not only was there a four-hundred-year warming andcooling cycle on earth, there were also small changes in the rotational speed ofearth’s core that took about four hundred years to cycle through. (This wasrigorously proven in 1996, as we said, but obviously there had been some leadingevidence well before then.) In general terms, the Medieval Warm Period ran from1000 to 1400, the Little Ice Age ran from 1400 to 1900, but the up-trend beganin 1800—right in tune with the cycle. That also means we are now at the exacthalfway point. It’s been two hundred years since earth began warming up again.That should also mean the temperatures will start going down again, since we’reabout to pass the top of the wave—and we may already be seeing that happening.I found even more supporting evidence when I read the work of Finnish scientistTimo Niroma, who explores the idea that solar activity is, in some way, directlyrelated to planetary cycles. For example, Jupiter has an 11.86-year cycle, andthe generally accepted average value for the sunspot cycle is 11.1 years.25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en711] Naroma often uses “the Elatinadata”—meaning he tracks the year-to-year variations in the amount of radiationwe find in a 680-million-year-old rock sample from Elatina, South Australia, in1982. There are 9.4 meters of laminations that span a total of nineteen thousandyears of time.26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en712] It isn’t until wehead into the fifth large Web page of his analysis that we find multiplereferences to a two-hundred-year sunspot cycle that has been found in Elatinaand other sources. The solar activity is believed to be responsible for thecyclical changes in earth’s temperature.The historical data seem to show that the 200-year oscillation has been there atleast since A.D. 200. The even centuries seem to be have been cold, odd oneswarm—not to the accuracy of a year, but in the average anyway.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en713]Naroma quotes at least five different scientific studies that found atwo-hundred-year cycle in the amount of solar radiation reaching earth. Onething we do have to keep in mind is that this may not actually be a solar cycle.It is possible that the rotation of earth’s geometric core determines how muchsolar radiation, or how little, can actually get through earth’s protectiveshield at any one time. The geometric relationships of the core may be causingthe solar radiation levels and the overall temperature levels on earth to riseand fall in an obvious two-hundred-year pattern of change—perhaps by changingthe permeability of the magnetosphere.It is utterly fascinating to realize that the Maya appear to have been trackingthis exact same earth cycle for thousands of years. I don’t think they’d be veryinterested in long-term warming and cooling cycles, if that’s all it was.However, if this system also controls when the time portals open, then thatcycle becomes much more interesting. Let’s not forget that in this new physicsmodel, there are multiple geometries that we have to look at—and they all nesttogether. So earth’s core is only one of the geometries we have to look at.There could very well be others, appearing in the different spherical layerswithin earth, that would be even more difficult for our scientists to detect atthis point. Each of them would probably have a different rotational period.There may, however, be a way to locate them—by studying their effects.THE “TEMPORARY LOCAL RISK” FACTORIs there any additional proof that the Maya calendar may have been used to tracktime portals? There certainly appears to be. Two German scientists, GraznyaFosar and Franz Bludorf, made a stunning discovery in 1998. They found whatappears to be a vertical line in the earth’s energy fields, which rotates alongat 1.86 degrees of longitude per day—for a total of about 194 days. Two of thesecycles add up to 388 days. The reason why this line is so important is that ifyou happen to be in the wrong place on earth when it crosses over you (or theright place, depending on what you’re trying to do), a portal into time-spaceapparently opens.Fosar and Bludorf first found out about this cycle by noticing that fourdifferent aircraft incidents occurred in the same basic area. The infamous TWA800 crash happened over the ocean, south of Long Island, on July 17, 1996.Several eyewitnesses, including a National Guard helicopter crew, reportedseeing a bright object fly toward the jet and collide with it—where it thenexploded in midair, killing everyone. Conspiracy theories were concocted that itwas a missile or projectile, but it may actually have been a spherical portal ofenergy released by the earth—as we will discuss. On August 9, 1997, Swissair 127nearly collided with another unidentified bright object in the same area—off ofLong Island. There were 388 days between TWA 800 and Swissair 127.Fosar and Bludorf had already been tracking two other airline incidents thatboth happened near Peggy’s Cove, off the east coast of Canada—not too farnortheast of Long Island. Swissair 111 detected smoke in the cabin, tried tomake an emergency landing but crashed, killing all 229 people aboard onSeptember 2, 1998. Only five days later, BALAIR 188 experienced smoke in thekitchen and had to make an emergency landing—and this incident happened just ashort distance east of the Swissair 111 event less than a week before. It wasthese two events, happening in the same area in such a short time, that firstconvinced Fosar and Bludorf that something might be going on. Then they noticedthe 388-day interval between TWA 800 and Swissair 127—and were even moresurprised to discover that there were 389 days between Swissair 111 and Swissair127.From this beginning, they were able to calculate that a straight, vertical lineof invisible energy may be slowly crawling across the northern hemisphere at1.86 degrees of longitude per day—for a 194-day cycle. By tracking this line,and calculating exactly where it was at any one time, they found fully ninedifferent airplane crashes that were directly correlated with its position. Theycalled this the Temporary Local Risk factor, or TLR. They admitted they did notknow what was actually causing this.28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en714]I was surprised that Fosar and Bludorf didn’t crunch the numbers any further—butI was also delighted, because it gave me the opportunity to rediscover thingsthat we haven’t known about for a long, long time. I believe that with furtheranalysis, we will discover a spherical layer within the earth that is slowlyrotating in a 194-day orbit—and it will have a geometric structure, such as thedodecahedron, that we can track to know when these portals will open. There mayeven be ways to make these Source Field currents visible—as the ancientsappeared to possess.If our model is correct, then the TLR cycle should also be a perfect subdivisionof the earth’s own orbit. As soon as I did the numbers, I found that in 17 earthyears (of 365.2422 days), there were 16 cycles of 388 days—and 32 cycles of 194days. A 17-to-16 cycle ratio definitely looks like a long-term geometricrelationship between the orbit of the TLR cycle and the rotation of the earth.But what about the Maya calendar? It didn’t take long for me to find an evengreater surprise. The baktun in the Maya calendar is 144,000 days long—and thereare almost exactly 742 TLR cycles in that same period of time. It becomes exactif you round up the TLR cycle to just over 194.07 days, which is probably a moreaccurate measurement of the cycle. This also meant there were 37.1 of theseTemporary Local Risk cycles in every 20-year katun, and 371 of them within tenkatuns—or roughly 200 years.The greater implications are that this is one of a series of geometric energypatterns, nested inside the earth, that combine together at various times andcreate powerful effects—including portals into time-space. This cycle has directeffects on physical matter, precisely lines up with the earth’s orbit afterseventeen years, and fits perfectly into the Maya calendar. It was identified bystudying equipment malfunctions and strange aerial phenomena. This also suggeststhe Maya may have been tracking time portals with their calendar, at least inthe early days—given that the giant dodecahedron inside the earth completes afull rotation every time the Maya calendar reaches the end of a baktun.I think this is just the beginning of what we can discover once we really begindoing our homework. We do not yet know the exact geometric pattern that iscausing these effects to occur, but that is obviously an important quest topursue. Given the potential dangers involved with random accidents, it isimportant that this knowledge not be covered up or suppressed. Innocent livescan be saved by tracking the TLR cycle, learning more about it, and reroutingflight pathways around potential trouble spots—particularly when it fires up avortex point on the grid.INVESTIGATING THE MAYA CALENDAR CYCLE OF 5,125 YEARSThe last Maya calendar cycle we need to look at is the length of the calendaritself. In order to obtain this number, you take thirteen baktuns, for a totalof 1,872,000 days—or approximately 5,125 years. Five Maya calendar cycles add upto approximately 25,627 years—which is remarkably close to the precession of theequinoxes or Great Year. As of 2000, the International Astronomical Union fixedthe precession at 25,771.5 years29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en715]—slightly over 144 years longer thanfive cycles of the Maya calendar. That is certainly interesting, but does itmean anything? I believe it is definitely important—but we’ll get to that. Isthere anything interesting and measurable that is directly related to the5,125-year cycle?Lonnie Thompson, a glaciologist from Ohio State University, found that there wasa significant climate change on earth, not unlike the one we’re now having,about 5,200 years ago. He determined this number from “the mountains of datadrawn by analyzing countless ice cores, and a meticulous review of sometimesobscure historic records.” The press release sums it up nicely.A professor of geological sciences at Ohio State and a researcher with the ByrdPolar Research Center, Thompson points to markers in numerous records suggestingthat the climate was altered suddenly some 5,200 years ago, with severeimpacts.30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en716]The press release also strongly implies that this is a cycle, since the titleincludes the line, “Evidence suggests that history could repeat itself.” We’reobviously seeing climate change events happening now that are very similar tothe ones that happened 5,200 years ago. Thompson believes this was caused bysolar activity.Evidence shows that around 5,200 years ago, solar output first droppedprecipitously and then surged over a short period. It is this huge solar energyoscillation that Thompson believes may have triggered the climate change he seesin all those records . . . “Any prudent person would agree that we don’t yetunderstand the complexities with the climate system and, since we don’t, weshould be extremely cautious in how much we tweak the system,” [Thompson] said.“The evidence is clear that a major climate change is under way.”31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en717]I find it very interesting that the amount of solar radiation first made a hugedrop and then had a massive surge in such a short time. If the Maya calendar istracking a natural, long-term earth cycle, then perhaps what was changing wasthe permeability of the earth’s own energy fields, such as the Van Allenbelts—rather than the Sun. I already suggested the same idea for why we see a400-year cycle in solar radiation on earth, which seems to correspond perfectlyto the baktun in the Maya calendar and the rotation of the earth’s core. Now,Dr. Thompson has discovered that a massive, worldwide climate change eventoccurred only about 75 years away from when the Maya calendar/“Long Count” cyclebegan. The entire cycle itself appears to be the exact same length as the Mayacalendar. This is extremely interesting—but such a connection would never evenbe imagined by a mainstream scientist. If he even dared to make such asuggestion, he could suffer ridicule at the very least, and financial and careerruin at the worst. I haven’t seen any other scholar who writes or lectures aboutthe Maya calendar ever point out this correlation, but it is a very strongargument that this ancient system is not just “a bunch of nonsense”—it actuallyis tracking very real changes in our solar system. Furthermore, if Thompson’sfigure is correct, and the actual value is closer to 5,200 years, then five ofthe climate-change cycles he discovered will add up to exactly 26,000years—which is only 80 years more than the ideal cycle of 25,920 years.We may well be rediscovering the hidden mechanism behind this wobble in theearth’s axis that was so interesting to the ancients. It may be that this suddendrop in solar activity, followed by the massive surge, has direct energeticeffects upon our consciousness and even biological evolution—as we’ve arguedearlier. Is this something that is strictly a product of cycles within theearth, or is there yet another pattern that we can definitely identify with theSun? Maurice Cotterell may have found the answer.MAURICE COTTERELL’S SUNSPOT CYCLEMaurice Cotterell noticed that the Sun rotates faster at the equator—at a rateof about twenty-six days—than the thirty-seven days it takes to rotate at thepoles. He crunched these numbers in a supercomputer and found that we need18,139 years for those two cycles to line up. He thus discovered a long-termsolar cycle that no one else had found in modern times. As he shows in hisclassic book The Mayan Prophecies, co-authored with Adrian Gilbert, there isvery compelling evidence that the Maya were almost certainly aware of this samelong-term cycle in the Sun—and tracked it with extreme precision. I wrote aboutthis in detail in my first free online book, The Shift of the Ages.32[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en718] Since 18,139 years is quite a longtime, I was immediately drawn to investigate that number—and see if it had anyconnection with the precession of the equinoxes. If so, it could show that theprecession was part of a greater cycle happening throughout the entire solarsystem, possibly being driven by the Sun itself—or maybe even by the galaxyworking through the Sun.Was there a connection between the precession and Cotterell’s solar cycle? Ifound the answer by considering the importance of the number fifty-two—as itappears over and over again in the Maya system. It’s twice the numbertwenty-six, and of course there are 260 days in the tzolkin cycle. Furthermore,it takes exactly fifty-two years for the tzolkin and the 365-day Haab to lineup. This fifty-two-year cycle was called a Calendar Round,33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en719] and the Maya considered its endingto be a period of chaos and unrest. They would wait in anticipation to see ifthe gods would grant them another fifty-two years to live each time it camealong.34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en720] When you’re dealing withcycles, you get harmonics. One example is that you can add extra zeroes to aparticular cycle and it will still have the same underlying vibrationalquality—so fifty-two Calendar Round years can harmonize with 5,200 years. This,again, is the exact cycle Lonnie Thompson discovered for when the last majorclimate change happened on earth—and it’s also very close to the length of theMaya calendar Long Count of 5,125 years.What does this have to do with Cotterell’s cycle? Just add up four of them, at18,139 years each—and you get 72,556 years. Then, if you add on another 5,200years at that point, you get 77,756 years—which is almost exactly three cyclesof 25,920 years. (It comes out to three cycles of 25,918.6 years—just 1.4 yearsaway from being absolutely perfect.) The 5,200-year cycle is the approximatelength of the Maya calendar and shows up as a cycle of massive climate change inthe earth. The number fifty-two appears repeatedly in the Maya countingsystems—and the Maya systems synchronize very nicely with the harmonics of thesolar system. This 5,200-year unit of time may be a shift cycle for an evenlarger system, which only lines up in even longer periods of time. Such alarge-scale cycle may well be driven by the galaxy itself. The precession of theequinoxes, far from being a random wobble in the earth’s orbit, may be part of aGreat Clock throughout the entire solar system—powered by geometric energyfields.TRACKING THE PORTALSThe Maya seemed to be very interested in tracking these cycles. The TLR cyclecaused weird electrical problems, making planes either explode, crash-land orhave major equipment malfunctions. In at least two different cases, brightpoints of light were seen during these events—and that may be our first clueabout what a vortex between these “parallel realities” of space-time andtime-space will actually look like. The Maya may have been levitating stones tobuild their countless numbers of pyramids by creating coherence—like we saw inthe fascinating case of Tibetan Acoustic Levitation. Perhaps the Maya also hadto wait for the right alignments between the geometry of the Sun, the planets,and earth’s own internal energy patterns for this process to work the best.If the TLR effect moves along by 1.86 degrees of longitude per day, that comesout to about 128.4 miles of drift every twenty-four hours, or about 5.3 milesper hour—if we use earth’s circumference from pole to pole as a guide. If wethen say the overall vortex itself is about twenty miles wide (and this iscompletely arbitrary—I haven’t figured out the actual size at this point), thatmeans you’d only have about four hours where you could potentially open agateway into time-space and actually travel in time. It may be that if youwanted to practice this science, you would have to time it precisely—as yourpeople could get stuck out there if they didn’t return within those same fourhours.Then again, if you simply return at the exact same spot you left, then no timewould have elapsed. It’s only if you return at a different location that youwill either pop into the future or slide back into the past—depending on whereyou go. Furthermore, if you had a large group of people gathered around thepyramid for a ceremony, to help contribute their own energy, the effect might beeven more powerful—and you may have even greater success in actually getting aportal to open. Remember, this is a science of coherence—causing a greateramount of crystallization and spin to appear in the Source Field—and our ownthoughts have a direct effect on that process.EVIDENCE OF “NATURAL STARGATES” THROUGH SPACEIn 2008, NASA announced that about every eight minutes, a portal forms betweenthe Sun and earth that allows solar particles to flow through. Each magneticportal, or “flux transfer event,” is as wide as earth—and scientists did notbelieve they even existed until recently. Dr. David Sibeck of Goddard SpaceFlight Center explained the mysterious new discovery.We used to think the connection [between the earth and the Sun] was permanentand that solar wind could trickle into the near-earth environment anytime thewind was active. . . . We were wrong. The connections are not steady at all.They are often brief, bursty and very dynamic. . . . Ten years ago I was prettysure they didn’t exist, but now the evidence is incontrovertible.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en721]In 2008, scientists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ran a computersimulation that found “numerous . . . streams of dark matter within the halo ofthe Milky Way, and more substructure appears within each subhalo. . . . Everysubstructure has its own sub-substructure, and so on.”36[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en722] These “streams of dark matter” couldrepresent the visible energetic signatures of natural stargate portals that passbetween stars. Also in 2008, scientists in Switzerland, France and the UnitedStates found unexpected plasma flow between neighboring objects in the galaxyusing X-ray satellite imagery. They found this phenomenon quite by accident, asPhysOrg explained.Researchers have recently discovered the phenomenon of funneling hot plasma.Flowing plasma may funnel from one region to another through empty space,connecting otherwise isolated clouds and clusters throughout the galaxy. . . .[The scientists found] a million-degree plasma flowing from the [Orion] nebulainto the adjacent interstellar medium, and then into the neighboring superbubbleEridanus.37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en723]We now have very good evidence that this system really works. There is excellentscience to support the idea of a global grid. This same geometry likely appearsin quantum mechanics, the genetic code, the solar system, the distribution ofgalaxies at the largest level, and the gas and dust at the far reaches of theUniverse. As we head into the next chapter, we will explore some of the mostfascinating information of all—where we go face-to-face with natural vortexevents, and find out what they look like and what they do."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENTime Slips, Time Warps and Vortex PhenomenaThe Source Field is the master key—a fluidlike energy that ultimately createsspace, time, matter, energy, biology and consciousness. The ancients appeared toknow vastly more about the Source Field than we ever gave them credit for. Theybuilt stone structures that may well have created enough coherence to harness“natural stargates” that appear in the earth—when the geometry inside the earthaligns with the geometry in the solar system. When I found out that the TLRcycle nested in perfectly with the baktun, I really knew I was on to something.The Maya may very well have been tracking cycles they could use to openportals—for travel through time and space. The flowing geometric currentsdiscovered by Hans Jenny could be truly galaxy-wide—and lead to traversablewormholes, or stargates, where all you have to do is go in one side and thecurrent will naturally carry you out to the other side—which may be quite somedistance away.If all this is true, and this system really works, then there should be avariety of examples where these portals into time-space naturally andspontaneously appear on earth—causing mysterious disappearances, timedisplacements and other anomalies. What would one of these portals look like?Since the Source Field is fluidlike, we can expect that a vortex within theField will appear as a spherical bubble. The surrounding pressure of the SourceField would push in equally on it from all sides, just like the atmospherepushes on a soap bubble. Furthermore, since matter is being transformed into awave function inside this vortex, including the atmosphere, we would no longersee solid objects—we would see photons of light in a foggy and misty sphere.Witness reports confirm this foggy sphere could be gray, white, yellow, green,red or even other colors. It would also shield gravity—much like a tornado, orthe vortexes Schauberger discovered in water that caused levitation effects tooccur. Anything or anyone that goes inside such a vortex could then pop overinto time-space—and if you didn’t know what you were doing, you might not comeback. Living or nonliving matter that gets captured into this vortex woulddisappear from our reality and move over into the parallel reality, at leasttemporarily. These vortexes could theoretically travel in any direction—there isno reason to assume they would remain stationary, since these geometries haveflowing currents moving through them all the time.Some vortexes may start on the surface of the earth, capture materials or livingorganisms in them, and then rise. Once they reach a certain height, they maylose the momentum that keeps their internal vortex activity moving faster thanthe speed of light. Then, the material inside of them pops back over intospace-time—and everything inside of them suddenly falls—seemingly out of thinair. Let’s say one of these vortexes first appeared inside a lake filled withfish. The fish would temporarily pop over into time-space, get captured insidethe gravitational force created within this sphere of energy, levitate into theair, pop back into space-time, return in what may be an entirely different time,and fall out of the sky.FALLING OUT OF TIMEBefore we get to fish falls, our first example involves rocks. This eventcontains many obvious signs of the effects from time-space—although it isconsidered a classic poltergeist case.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en724] W. G. Grotten-Dieck awoke one nightin September 1903 to the sight of black stones, no bigger than three-quarters ofan inch, warping directly through his roof and ceiling as they fell in a smooth,even curve—in “slow motion.” They landed on the floor near his pillow. In a 1906letter to the British Society for Psychical Research, he explained some of thestrange things that happened.I . . . tried to catch the stones while they were falling through the air towardme, but I could never catch them. . . . It seemed to me that they changed theirdirection in the air as soon as I tried to get hold of them.2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en725]This indicates the stones still had a levity effect, and were being repelled bymatter in space-time—such as his own body. They also were very likely not fullymaterialized yet—explaining why he was never able to catch one of them. They mayhave moved right through his hand like it wasn’t even there.To me, the most interesting part was that the stones appeared to be fallingslower than they should have been—but according to Grotten-Dieck, “The soundthey made in falling down on the floor was also abnormal, because consideringtheir slow motion, the bang was much too loud.”3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en726] It would appear that time was movingmore slowly within the stones themselves, and their own immediate area.Everything outside that area was still moving at the normal time—and the stonesstill had the same amount of inertia. So, once the sound of the stones hittingthe floor moved out of the region where time was passing more slowly, it spedback up and sounded perfectly normal—because Grotten-Dieck was not standingwithin that slower zone of time himself. He also found the stones were warmerthan usual when he picked them up—which is another frequently reported elementof poltergeist cases. This effect seems to be due to the stress they experiencedin popping back over to space-time, causing them to lose coherence.On October 16, 1997, a “Civil War–type” cannonball blasted through Leonard andKathy Mickelson’s mobile home in House Springs, Missouri, going through a windowand two walls. The police investigated the idea that someone was using a CivilWar reenactment cannon, and that may be all it was—but this seems like a prettystrange crime, not to mention expensive . . . and one that could be easilytraced to the perpetrator. Can you honestly imagine some guy setting up a CivilWar cannon and firing it at someone’s home in the middle of a trailer park?Okay, maybe if there was enough alcohol involved—but it certainly doesn’t seemvery likely. There is at least a possibility that this was caused by a portalinto time-space that had opened up in a Civil War battlefield, allowing a muchlonger duration to be traversed.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en727]Just like in the cases of hauntings where someone’s murder seems to keep beingreplayed for people who stay in the house, it could be that the deaths andtrauma on the battlefield created a strong-enough disturbance in the SourceField to open up a portal—literally a rift in time.FISH FALLSThe most classic example of a vortex capturing various items, levitating andthen dropping them is the many cases of live fish falling from the air. Thephenomenon is real, though unexplained—and was even written up in theprestigious Natural History magazine in 1921 with complete seriousness.5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en728] There are many, many documentedexamples of this phenomenon, but the case that jumped out at me the mostoccurred near Calcutta in 1839. In this case, a single variety of fish, aboutthree inches in length, fell in a perfectly straight line within a greater rainshower. The line was “not more than a cubit in breadth”—and this is compellingevidence that the fish were falling directly out of a single vortex in the sky.The author points out the staggering number of documented cases from all overthe world, by people who were unaware of the phenomenon—and he ultimately makesa bold conclusion.To proclaim disbelief in the phenomenon of rains of fishes, to refuse credenceto accounts so widespread in time and space, so thoroughly corroborative, wouldin the mind of the writer be indicative of an inability properly to evaluateevidence.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en729]Now, that’s Natural History magazine—not the National Enquirer.“I don’t buy it,” the skeptic says. “None of this stuff happens anymore. Peoplewere crazy back then. That’s all it is.” In March 2010 the UPI published anarticle describing how hundreds of small white fish known as spangled perch,many of which were still alive, fell over a remote Australian desert town fortwo days. The nearest river was 326 miles away—and similar phenomena occurred inthe same town in 1974 and 2004.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en730]OOPARTSFish falls and other such Fortean events may well be caused by a vortex thatcaptures matter, rises into the air, potentially moves into a different time,and then collapses back into space-time—thereby dropping its contents. Whatabout a vortex that captures items from the surface and then sinks down into theearth while it is in time-space, passing right through the earth’s crust as ifit weren’t even there? As one potential example, there is a great body of dataon Out of Place Artifacts, or OOPARTS, that have been found in deep layers ofrock—much earlier than any intelligent human habitations would be expected onearth. The most scientifically rigorous collection of this data is in ForbiddenArcheology by Michael Cremo and Richard Thompson.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en731]One collection of possible OOPART examples includes an ornately carvedcandlestick holder in rocks estimated to be 100,000 years old, though thepicture is believed to be a hoax, a metal medallion with carved figures and astrange form of writing from 100,000-year-old rock, a copper hook and a ringfrom a 150,000-year-old sand layer, a curious mechanical object resembling aspark plug in 500,000-year-old rock, a perfect modern nail in a piece ofmillion-year-old quartz, a nail found in rock estimated to be 75,000 to 100,000years old in Peru from 1572, a nail found in British sandstone estimated to beat least 40 million years old, a two-inch metal screw in 21-million-year-oldfeldspar found in a Nevada mine, a cast-iron cube found in 60-million-year-oldbrown coal that was studied in scientific journals in 1886, a gold chain in300-million-year-old Pennsylvanian coal, an iron pot in coal from 300 to 325million years ago, an ornately carved brass bell found in West Virginia coal,and stone spheres found in California rock estimated to be billions of yearsold.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en732]“TOAD IN THE HOLE”An even more interesting phenomenon involves cases where living frogs or toadsare found embedded in rocks, lumps of coal, or within the trunks of large trees.Over 210 cases of this have been documented in Europe, the United States,Canada, Africa, New Zealand and the West Indies—dating from the late fifteenthcentury to the early 1980s. In many cases, multiple witnesses independentlyreported what they saw.10 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en733] The famoussurgeon Ambroise Paré ordered workmen to break up two large stones at hisvineyard in 1575, and a large living toad was found inside one of them—with novisible opening to the outside. The miner said this was not the first time hehad found toads as well as other types of animals inside stone.In 1686, Professor Robert Plot described three different cases of “Toad in theHole.” In one case, a large limestone block had been recently placed as astepping-stone to help people cross a stream. Croaking sounds were heard insidethe stone, and after a long discussion, they decided to break it open—and aliving toad came out. Plot also reported a case where the very top stone in thespire of a church tower had fallen and broken open. A living toad was foundinside the stone, and it died quickly after it was exposed to the air—which Plotsaid was a common occurrence for these unfortunate creatures. Another live toadwas found in the stone wall of France’s Le Raincy castle in September 1770,which created a new wave of interest in the phenomenon. M. Jean Guéttard, fromthe French National Academy of Sciences, said this was one of the most bafflingmysteries in all of natural history, and urged his colleagues to spare noexpense in solving the problem—which was known and documented for more than twohundred years.11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en734] The reason why thisis less likely to be seen in today’s world may simply be that we usually crushany stones we quarry. With the advent of pourable concrete and lightweight,sturdy building materials, we usually do not quarry stone blocks directly out ofthe earth.In June 1851, French miners were digging a well near Blois, and split open alarge flint stone with a pickaxe. A large, living toad jumped out of a hole inthe stone. The stone had a perfect impression of the toad’s body in it, and ateam of experts from the French Academy of Sciences were perplexed by how wellit fit. They concluded they could not find any evidence of fraud, and the toadhad apparently been alive and well in the rock for some time.Another strange detail from many of these cases is that the toads’ mouths oftenseem to be covered with a thick membrane, their skin is unusually dark, andthere is a mysterious bright shining glow from their eyes.12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en735] A living toad was found in a blockof magnesium limestone in Hartlepool, England, on April 7, 1865. Again, thecavity fit the toad’s body perfectly—and the Hartlepool Free Press reported that“the toad’s eyes shone with unusual brilliancy.” The toad was extremely palewhen it was first found—with a color very similar to the surrounding stone—butit soon darkened to an olive-brown color.13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en736] Its mouth was sealed shut, forcingit to breathe through its nostrils with a loud barking sound—and it also seemedto be a more prehistoric creature as well. As reported by the Hartlepool FreePress, “The claws of its fore feet are turned inward, and its hind ones are ofextraordinary length and unlike the present English toad.”14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en737]In another case, an inch-and-a-quarter-long lizard was found by a stonemasonnamed David Virture. It was brownish yellow in color with “bright sparklingprojecting eyes.” Although it seemed dead at first, it showed signs of lifeafter about five minutes. It was found in rock that was twenty-two feetunderground, and the rock cavity had again formed perfectly around the lizard’sbody. Even though the stone was very hard, about half an inch of the area aroundthe lizard was soft and sandy—and had become the same color as the lizard. Therewere no cracks or fissures that could have allowed it to get in. This waswritten up in an 1821 edition of Tilloch’s Philosophical Magazine.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en738]A British soldier found a large toad and a nine-inch-long lizard side-by-side instone that was being quarried in Algeria—to make roads and refill bomb cratersduring World War II. Both were alive, and the rock was twenty feet below the topof the quarry. An 1890 issue of Scientific American reported that “manywell-authenticated stories of the finding of live toads and frogs in solid rockare on record.”16 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en739] Like we saw in thetornado cases, it could well be that some of the material within their bodieshas blended with the stone, causing the change in color—but somehow this effectdoes not cause instant death. The glowing eyes may well be caused by some oftheir bodies not fully collapsing back into space-time, thus appearing bright—asa part of them still exists as a wave. This light may be the most visible inparts of the body that are watery by nature—such as the eyes.049 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_049_r1.gif]This living frog was found inside a giant boulder from a Swedish sandstonequarry, more than 10 feet below the surface, by Johan Gråberg and his men in1733.Why haven’t other living animals been found inside rocks? My guess is that thisis because amphibians and some reptiles can indeed go into a state ofhibernation—and survive for long periods of time without food, air or water.When the “Toad in the Hole” story became popular in the 1700s, many amateurEnglish naturalists tried burying live toads in flowerpots sealed with plasteror mortar—and they were still alive once freed. Zoologist Edward Jesse kept atoad buried for twenty years in a flowerpot, and it jumped out vigorously whenthe pot was opened.17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en740] In 1825, aprofessor of geology at Oxford named Dr. William Buckland set up a series ofrigorous experiments to prove or disprove whether toads could in fact survivewithin rocks. After one year of burial, toads in a sandstone block had died, aswell as small toads within a solid limestone block. However, toads that had beenburied in a porous limestone block were still alive—and two of them had evengained weight. He then reburied them in the same block and checked themperiodically during a second year. Each time he looked in on them they wereawake, but increasingly emaciated—and finally they all died.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en741] This led Buckland and otherscientists to conclude that toads could not survive in rocks for an extendedperiod of time, and thus the whole phenomenon was written off as a hoax.It could be that once these amphibians have passed into a vortex, they move intoa state of suspended animation as long as they stay still—neither fully inspace-time nor in time-space, and therefore outside of time as we now think ofit. Then, once the rock is disturbed, such as by quarrying, it “collapses thewave function”—as a quantum physicist might say. Then the unfortunate creaturepops fully over into space-time. At this point, most animals would probably dieof asphyxiation almost immediately—but toads and lizards seem to be durableenough to survive for some time once this has happened, possibly even for years.THE RUSSIAN SCIENCE OF VACUUM DOMAINSDr. Alexei Dmitriev has conducted detailed investigations of naturally occurringvortex phenomena that have many of the qualities we’ve been discussing—includingthe gravity-shielding capabilities. He believes tornadoes are one of a varietyof examples of these types of vortexes in action, which he calls vacuum domains.Other examples include ball lightning, “natural self-luminous objects,”poltergeists, a curious phenomenon known as “small comets” or “atmosphericholes,” glowing forms associated with earthquakes and volcanoes, “sprites” and“elves” in the upper atmosphere, and kimberlite pipes in the earth’s crust,which I will explain. Dmitriev cites the ongoing increase of tornado and otherrelated activities throughout the twentieth century as evidence that the overallamount of these vortexes entering into our solar system, and thereby the earth,has gone up dramatically.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en742]In Dmitriev’s model, which is partly based on the physics work of Terletskiy,these vortexes are directly transforming “gravi-spin” energy (gravitation andthe spin force within it) into electromagnetic energy—which appears as photonsemerging from these spherical areas. Obviously, if we could create such eventson a reliable basis, we’d be able to permanently free ourselves from the need topay for energy—or damage the environment to power our civilization. Gravitywould supply us with more energy than we could ever possibly need. This may verywell be happening already in natural materials such as the “Swedish Stone”discovered by T. Henry Moray—thanks to its quasi-crystal properties.The properties of these vortexes include the ability to penetrate matter, theemission and absorption of light and other electromagnetic radiation, thedisruption of electrical systems leading to breakdowns, strong magnetic fields,significant increases or decreases in the weight of objects, the rotation of airand dust inside them, explosions which often do not change their size or shape,a spherical outline, and a very substantial increase in the number of reportedsightings during years of high solar activity. Dmitriev also claims that “almostall” earthquakes and volcanic eruptions feature these luminous forms at somepoint before, after and/ or during the events.Historical and contemporary poltergeist episodes also occurred during suddenincreases in geomagnetic activity.20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en743]This data implies that poltergeist events are not random, but can be clearlytraced back to energetic vortexes rising out of the earth. Sudden increases inearth’s magnetic field strength, possibly triggered by surges in solar activity,appear with the creation of vacuum domains, or portals into time-space, in thecore—which then rise to the surface through certain areas. A 1992 article in theSociety for Psychical Research journal revealed Guy Lambert’s discovery thatpoltergeist sightings clustered around the course of a river—and when it rainedthere were many more reports. Anne Arnold Silk plotted “large numbers ofreported cases of sightings of ghostly figures, balls of light and suchlike” andfound that they all clustered very strongly around geological fault lines.Furthermore, sightings of anomalous lights occurred at the ends of these linesas well.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en744]The explosions occur when there is a collapse inside the object—and sinceDmitriev believes these vortexes are being created by the Sun and then flow intothe earth, he feels these collapses release “captured solar energy.” Theseexplosions can occur in the atmosphere, the water or the earth’s crust. Suchexplosions in the earth may be the real cause of volcanic eruptions andearthquakes—and in our Source Field model, the lack of coherence on the surfaceof the earth creates imbalances in the Field, which create a low-pressure zone.Our own state of consciousness, on a collective level, is directly responsiblefor creating this lack of coherence. Once we have a low-pressure zone, it maydraw a large vortex of energy out of the earth’s core, which then rises andeventually explodes inside the earth as it collapses back down intospace-time—causing an earthquake or volcanic eruption. In other cases, thesevortexes rise all the way up into the atmosphere—creating hurricanes, tornadoes,severe weather systems or “poltergeists.” Dmitriev has also gathered compellingevidence that tornadoes are much more likely to form over areas with geologicalfaults, such as seismically active regions.KIMBERLITE PIPESDmitriev also believes these explosions inside the earth’s crust are responsiblefor creating kimberlite pipes. These are elongated tube-shaped formations thatwere named after where they were originally discovered—in Kimberley, SouthAfrica. The fun starts when an explosion is seismically detected in the earth,normally associated with volcanic activity. A narrow, dome-shaped ring thenappears on the surface, barely detectable—but once you dig down to where thetube is found, it is filled with diamonds.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en745] Conventional geologists believediamonds only form at depths below 150 kilometers in the earth, and can takemany millions of years to crystallize. Their theory is that strong volcanicactivity then lifts the diamonds to the surface after they are formed, anddeposits them in the kimberlite pipes within a mixture of magma and transportedrock. The theory also states that the explosive force from deep within the earthshoots dissolved gas, magma, rock and diamonds through the mantle at a veryrapid speed, which can reach several hundred kilometers per hour—and the rapidexpansion of the gas cools the whole area so the diamonds are not disturbed.Typically kimberlite pipes form in several clusters simultaneously, and can betens of kilometers apart from each other.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en746]This is the prevailing model, and it may well be correct—but Dmitriev believesthese diamond-laced pipes are the result of the “intrusion, movement andexplosion of a vacuum domain in the earth’s crust.” Dmitriev points out thestrange fact that the neighboring rocks do not seem to be affected by these“self-localized” explosions.24 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en747]Another interesting possibility that Dmitriev may not have considered is thatthe flow of time may be dramatically accelerated within these explosions,causing crystals that normally should form over millions of years to develop invery short periods of time—at least by our standards. Dmitriev also alleges tohave found “vigorous relations” between the origin, existence and disappearanceof these vortexes and the “energetic discontinuities in the lithosphere andionosphere”—namely, the crust and the charged particles in our upperatmosphere.25 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en748]THE CONSCIOUSNESS CONNECTIONInterestingly, Dmitriev also suggests a direct connection between the appearanceof these vortexes and the overall level of human consciousness in a given area.His classic 1997 paper “Planetophysical State of the Earth and Life” had atremendous impact on me when I found it in December 2000. One of his centralstatements has become a major theme in this book.There are reasons favoring, or pointing to, the fact that a growth in theethical, or spiritual quality, of humanity would decrease the number andintensity of complex catastrophes.26 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en749]I would absolutely agree—and the Russian pyramid studies certainly give valuableevidence that this may indeed be true. Dmitriev made his opinion very clear—butno one in the mainstream is listening.It has become vitally important that a world chart be prepared, setting forththe favorable, and the catastrophic, regions on earth—taking into account thequality of the geologic-geophysical environment, the variety and intensity ofcosmic influences, and the real level of spiritual-ethical development of thepeople occupying those areas.27 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en750]In light of the 2012 prophecies we’ve inherited, other quotes from Dmitriev areeven more interesting.The multitude of such [vortex] phenomena, which is rich in its quality andvariety, is already growing quickly. Hundreds of thousands of these naturalself-luminous formations are exerting an increasing influence upon earth’sgeophysical fields and biosphere. We suggest that the presence of theseformations is the mainstream precedent to the transformation of earth; an earthwhich becomes more and more subject to the transitional physical processes whichexist within the borderland between the physical vacuum [i.e., time-space] andour material world.28 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en751]TIME STORMSDmitriev’s model has almost everything we’ve been looking for—except that I havenot yet found a paper from him that associates these luminous, sphericalvortexes with any time-related anomalies. However, in her vast, encyclopedic andwonderful book Time Storms, veteran paranormal researcher Jenny Randlesindependently validates everything in Dmitriev’s model.29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en752] The main difference is that she isreporting what happens to people who enter into these vortexes—and cites a trulystaggering number of different, documented cases where time slips, typically ofup to five days, occur.I was thrilled to find this book, because it was a prodigious research effortthat tied together many cases—some of which had been written off as “UFOabductions” with missing time. There is far too much data in her book to coverit all here, but she has definitely broken new ground in identifying many commonelements of “time slip” cases that other researchers had not noticed. Theseinclude glowing mist, spherical vortexes on the move, strong tingling sensationsin the people near them, and in some cases, aching in the joints and/or painfulskin rashes after exposure—as well as longer-term nausea, muscle pains andsignificant loss of motor coordination, where people cannot even grab a doorhandle and open it properly. Some people also emerge from these experiencescovered in water—even though there was no visible water in the area they leftfrom. So yes—it probably rains in time-space just like it does here sometimes.Other characteristics include the powering-down of running cars and theirbatteries, strange increases in heat—as in the case of the falling rocks—and avery curious series of changes in human consciousness Randles calls the “OzFactor.” Typically this involves an eerie silence, as if the entire world hasstopped. One witness said it felt as if her mind had been “sucked out.” Othersreport numbness, heaviness, a sense of being caught in slow motion, and veryreal time distortions.TIME DISTORTIONSIn one case from Kent, U.K., in 1966, a witness named David reported a varietyof these effects all at once. As he reached a bridge over a stream, in a woodedarea near his girlfriend’s house, he saw a group of teenage boys running interror from something that seemed to be chasing them. David then felt everythingbecome very quiet, as if his ears had become closed off. There was numbness anda strange depression, accompanied with a sense of heaviness and moving his headin slow motion. His girlfriend felt giddy, and the voices of the teenagers nowsounded like they were coming through an echo. A white mist then swirled aroundthem, and time seemed to slow down. When David tried to move his body, it seemedto “take forever”—and his cigarette smoke spiraled upward far too slowly. Soundstraveled too slowly and seemed hollow. His girlfriend clung to him in hysterics,and the teenage motorcycle gang now appeared to be moving in slow motion. Theheaviness eventually left, causing their ears to pop—like in an airplane thatwas landing. Even though the whole process seemed to take hours, his cigarettehad not burned down any farther when it finally stopped.30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en753] Obviously, it would seem that theancients learned how to manage and control these experiences—so as not to havesuch unpleasant effects. However, if you can’t create coherence within your ownmind, body and energetic duplicate, then you may have a bit of a rough ride.GRAVITY SHIELDING/LEVITATION EFFECTSIn chapter 7, Randles then goes on to report that many of these cases alsofeature gravity-shielding effects—as we’ve already discussed in cases likeTibetan Acoustic Levitation, tornado anomalies, fish falls, allegedtechnological breakthroughs that have been suppressed, and Dmitriev’s scientificmodel of vacuum domains. On pages 51–52, there is a case of hay levitating outof a field. It condenses into a lens shape, then hovers at 150 feet—where itbegins moving across the sky slowly, easily mistakable as a “flying saucer” bythis point. As it passed over the heads of the crowd, the witness reportedfeeling a soft pressure on his shoulders—and some of the children felt tinglingsensations. Eventually the cloud thinned out and separated into pieces thatlooked like a spiral galaxy. Much of the hay fell at this point and was droppedon a golf course, while the rest drifted away in a “strange cloud.” Thisoccurred on June 15, 1988, in Marple Ridge, Peak District, U.K., and a varietyof strange events have been reported in this area—including a car thatmysteriously lost electrical power and stopped running in 1968, and many locallegends of strange glowing lights—including blue glows that caused tinglingsensations.31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en754]In a 1971 event in Cuers, France, a man’s car was levitated fifteen feet off theroad inside an orange glow, after the engine failed and the radio filled withstatic. Once he realized he was levitating and became astonished, the glowdisappeared and his car smashed to the road—causing heavy damage. He also foundthat he somehow had jumped three hours forward in time. (This may have beencaused by the car drifting east while it was levitating.) The event happened atabout one thirty A.M., and it should have been no later than three A.M. when thetow truck brought him home—but it was actually six A.M. when he arrived.32[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en755] Beginning on page 70, Randlesreports a case from the Isle of Mull, U.K., in 1987, where a mist “appeared outof nowhere” and attached itself to a car. It caused a heavy feeling of downwardpressure and a vibrating sensation, which made it feel like the car was movingsideways and upward. The fog was now too thick to see through, though it had aswirling movement within it. When the mist disappeared, they found their cartrunk had popped open, even though it had been locked—and all of its contentswere now scattered across the road. Randles says this is a frequently recurringtheme in many cases. As I have said before in our tornado discussion, this couldbe caused by a temporary softening of the metal in the lock that opened thetrunk—followed by gravity-shielding effects that emptied out its contents.33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en756]In another example, Peter Williamson experienced an event like this on July 28,1974, in Somerset, U.K. A heavy electrical storm moved through and caused theirdog to cower under a tree. As Peter went to rescue the dog, there was a hugeflash—and as far as everyone else was concerned, Peter had vanished. Policeexplained away the disappearance as simply a lightning flash. Peter was foundthree days later in a nearby locked garden at eight A.M.—and there was no way hecould have gotten in, as the gardener had the only key. He spent several daysrecovering in a hospital, and began having dreams where he remembered standingin an unfamiliar garden—covered in water. In his dreams, he wandered around in adaze and was eventually found and taken to a hospital. He could remember thenames of a doctor, a sister and various nurses, as well as the name of theward—though he did not know any of these details in his waking life. He begansuspecting the dreams might be real, because they were long and mundane.He noticed that the hospital would sometimes “shimmer” around him in thesememories, and furniture appeared where it hadn’t been before—only to have theward then snap back to its usual state. All of this fits with the idea that thistook place in time-space, not space-time. He also noticed that when he tried tospeak, his voice sounded like it was in “slow motion.” As he improved, he wasallowed to walk the grounds, and he began to feel normal again as he walked downa lane outside. This was the last of his memories before waking up in thegarden. A researcher named Colin Parsons stayed with the family for three days,and was able to confirm that a nearby cottage infirmary had a ward with thatname—as well as the doctor and the sister with the same names. However, thedoctor did not recognize Peter—and there were no records of him having stayedthere.34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en757]THREE ASTONISHING CASESThree cases jumped out at me when I read Time Stories. In the first example, avideotape from Florida was submitted anonymously to a TV station in 1996.Several investigators explored this case, including psychiatrist John Carpenter,physical scientist Ted Phillips, criminologist Dr. William Schneid and DanAhrens, a computer analysis expert—most of whom worked for the Mutual UFONetwork (MUFON). They all felt this was a genuine video recording of somethingthat really happened, and could not have been a hoax. The tape was from thesecurity camera footage of a small factory in Florida, showing multiple camerafeeds all together. In one frame, at 11:16 P.M., a worker walks toward the reargate, apparently to look at something. A fuzzy white glow arrives in the areawhere the man is standing, while electromagnetic interference briefly disruptsthe picture.The glow lasts a few seconds, and when it goes away, the cameras are all workingnormally but the man has disappeared. When the film was analyzed one frame at atime, the man is seen to vanish almost instantly. The glow came back at 1:06A.M., after a search for the man had found nothing. The factory lights all wentout, and the man was again seen within the light—in only a fraction of a second.He was now in distress, on all fours, and began throwing up. The security guardrushed out to help him, but he could remember nothing of what happened—he hadlost those two hours. He went home in shock, said he was too sick to work thenext day, and never returned to the factory.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en758]The second case is very intriguing. A man named Bernard, from the north ofEngland, reported a bizarre incident that occurred in Pennines, U.K., on a hilleast of Manchester in the summer of 1942, while he was a child. Later on, he wasconcerned about reporting this case, as he was happily married and had risen toa prominent level in his work as a nurse. He described his experience to severalpsychologists at work, but no one could explain what had happened to him. Onthat day in 1942, he and a female friend felt a sudden, overwhelming sense ofcalm and quiet on the hill. They felt like their minds were drifting off. Theysat by a tree and enjoyed the strange sense of deep relaxation. Gradually, theybegan hearing two voices, and when they sat up to see what was going on, two menwere now standing over them—discussing their observations as if they did notexpect the children to be able to hear them. One man said, “Here they are.” Theother man held some sort of device in his hand, and kept reading off numbersfrom it. The men were discussing time as if it were a landscape that you couldnavigate through—and they occasionally paused to say something positive aboutthe children.The two men were entirely human-looking and were wearing unusual, bright suitsthat looked synthetic—totally out of place for wartime Britain. Eventually thetwo men started talking to the children directly, and described events that weregoing to happen in their lives as if they had already happened. When Bernardasked them who they were and where they were from, one of them smiled, looked upat the sky and said, “From a long way away.” They also told the children not tosay anything, as it was a secret. When the children then went to the foot of thehill, they were greeted by a farmer who asked them who they were. When they toldhim their names, he said they should rush home as soon as possible. Once theyarrived, their relatives had gathered and were very worried about them. Thechildren felt like the experience had only lasted two hours, when in fact theyhad been gone for more than a day. Although they said they had been on the hillthe whole time, it had been thoroughly searched and no one could find them.36[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en759]The third and final case I want to discuss from Time Storms opens up a whole newarea of investigation. It concerns an area on the M56 motorway in the U.K.,between Dodleston and Altrincham, known as Helsby Hill—a quartz-rich outcroppingof sandstone. A remarkable number of unusual events have occurred in thisarea—including green glows, curtains of light, poltergeists, missing time, carblackouts with spontaneous travel through time and space, an odd white powderscattered on the ground after a white glow and high-pitched humming noise filledthe area, as well as the disappearance of a one-hour block of time—and therewere also six other cases of glowing lights with similar distortions of time andspace. A woman who was driving on the slip road off the M56 between PrestonBrook and Daresbury lost six hours of time in March 1988 after seeing a glowoverhead.Three months later, Randles discovered that at the exact same time this six-hourtime slip happened, two TV reporters, Steve Winstanley and Fred Talbot, werefilming a local news story about canal barges when they heard a strange noise.Then, to their amazement, two tin cans rose up off the boat, hovered for a shorttime and then fell into the water. They were actually passing under the verysame vortex where the other time slip case had just occurred. The owner of theland, Bill Whitlow, described many cases of people hearing strange noises in thecanal, which created the legend that it was haunted. Then, in August 1990, acrop circle appeared on Whitlow’s land within a hundred yards of where theprevious event had occurred two years earlier. Witnesses heard a high-pitchedwailing noise on the night the circle appeared—and Randles photographed itbefore Whitlow harvested the crop. Then, while she stood there takingphotographs, a car lost control on the road. The driver claimed he was pulledacross the road toward the field—even though he could not see the crop circle.Police could find nothing wrong with his car, even though he felt it was from aflat tire—and no evidence of dangerous driving. Sadly, Randles’s parents hadparked their brand-new car off the side of the road, and this stray car slammedinto them—causing serious injury to Randles’s mother, who had to be cut freefrom the wreckage. Other events occurred in this same area since this time.37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en760]CROP CIRCLES AND MYSTICAL BEINGSThat brings us to the mystery of crop circles, which have been reported since atleast A.D. 815—when Agobard, the Archbishop of Lyons, in France, had to issue aformal decree prohibiting the locals from taking crops out of circles that hadformed in the fields. The locals wanted to use them for fertilityrituals—probably because of the exceptional energetic effects they felt fromthem. The farmers were clearly upset by this loss. The interesting part aboutthis story is that Agobard never denied the circles existed—he only went afterthe townspeople because they were removing all the crops inside of them. In hisbook Dimensions, Jacques Vallée draws from a ninth-century French text thatgives further detail behind this story.Supposedly, three men and a woman were witnessed emerging from “aerial ships”that were powered by beings called sylphs, who showed them many great wonders.They were told the human-looking beings came from “Magonia.” The fearful localsturned on them and felt they were now evil magicians. The witnesses were aboutto be burned alive when Agobard saved their lives by denying that sylphsexisted—as well as the idea that anyone could be a magician. Agobard’s writtennotes from the event reveal the same level of sarcasm we would come to expectfrom skeptics 1,200 years later.We have seen and heard many men plunged in such great stupidity, sunk in suchdepths of folly, as to believe that there is a certain region, which they callMagonia, whence ships sail in the clouds—in order to carry back to that regionthose fruits of the earth which are destroyed by hail and tempests. . . .38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en761]In Richard Thompson’s epic research work Alien Identities: Ancient Insights intoModern UFO Phenomena, we hear about the traditional European legends of fairyrings, which appear to be crop circles.39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en762] In these legends, however, these arenot merely interesting patterns in the crops—they also feature direct portalsinto time-space. In one traditional Celtic story, a hero named Ossian wasenticed into a mystical land by a beautiful fairy princess. He married her andspent three hundred years living in the mystical land of Tir na nog. When heeventually felt like he wanted to return to Ireland, he traveled back on thesame horse—and his wife warned him not to ever set foot on the ground. All ofhis friends had long since passed away once he came back, and the country seemedquite different. He eventually had an incident that caused him to get off of hishorse and touch the ground, and he immediately turned into a blind and feebleold man.40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en763]In another case from the early 1800s, two farm workers named Rhys and Llewellynwere walking home in the Vale of Neath, Wales. Rhys heard strange music alongthe way and decided to stay back and explore it, but Llewellyn couldn’t hearanything. Rhys never returned, and Llewellyn was thrown in jail on suspicion ofmurder after an investigation. Two weeks later, a man familiar with fairylegends felt there might be an explanation. He advised them to return to thearea where Rhys was last seen, and look for a fairy ring. Indeed, Llewellynfound such a circle in the grass—and when his foot touched the circle, he couldhear the music of harps. As each man in the party put his foot on Llewellyn’s,they were all able to hear the music—and they saw a variety of short butotherwise human-looking people dancing in a circle. Rhys was dancing with theselittle people at his normal height, and Llewellyn pulled him out. Rhys then saidhe’d only been in there for five minutes—but when he found out how long he hadapparently been missing, he went into a depression, took on an illness and soonpassed away.41 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en764]Thompson went into detail about this parallel reality in Celtic lore.The otherworld of the Celts has various names, such as Avalon, Tir na nog (Landof Youth), and Plain of Delight. Examination of the stories makes it clear thatthis realm would have to exist in a higher dimension. To reach it, one must goto the right place in three-dimensional space, and then one must travel in amystical fashion that we do not understand.42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en765]050 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_050_r1.jpg]France, Germany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, Scandinavia and thePhilippines all have legends of “fairy rings”—crop circles that marked portalsinto parallel realities inhabited by small humans with mystical abilities.At least not until now.Thompson also notes that the harvest of grain was often associated withfairies—and pulls a quote from Robert Rickard, who says, “Throughout the rangeof Indo-European cultures, the fairies were given their tithes of corn and milkat harvesting, over which they presided.”43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en766] This raises the possibility thatsome people actually live in this parallel reality of time-space as their normalexistence, rather than here in spacetime—and may well have their own traditionsand customs. Over time, these reports have become mythologized, and the storiesget stranger and stranger—but there may well be a seed of truth in them.TIME-TRAVELING DINOSAURSCould these time portals occasionally create a bridge that spans millions ofyears of time—and allow living creatures to pass through? Maybe so. We alreadydiscussed the Lazarus Effect, in which extinct species suddenly reappear in thefossil record—sometimes after millions of years. This may be the result of aDNA-wave effect that rearranges existing organisms into earlier forms, orcreates life out of inanimate matter—but it may also be the result of portalsthat allow these creatures to pass directly from one time to another.There have been many reports of lake monsters that have long necks, long tailsand flippers instead of legs. The anatomical details of these sightings arealmost identical to fossil records of the plesiosaurus. The most popular exampleis the Loch Ness Monster, a legend that originated in the seventh century withSaint Columba. There are many eyewitness reports—some estimate over threethousand just since 1933.44 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en767] In 2010,The Times in the U.K. published an article asserting that William Fraser, one ofScotland’s most senior police officers, considered the existence of Nessie to be“beyond doubt” in the 1930s.45 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en768]George Spicer and his wife saw a dinosaur-type creature cross the road in frontof their car on July 22, 1933. It was about twenty-five feet long, with a longneck that was a little thicker than an elephant’s trunk. They did not see anylower limbs. It lurched across the road toward the loch some twenty metersaway.46 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en769] Intriguing photographic andvideo evidence has been extensively scrutinized. 47[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en770] Loch Ness is also situated directlyabove a major geological fault line known as The Great Glen48[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en771]—and we have already seen poltergeistcases and vortex activity associated with seismically active regions.In 1993, Professor P. LeBlond of the University of British Columbia reported onmany different sightings of “Caddy”—short for Cadborosaurus—off the coast ofBritish Columbia, going as far south as Oregon. A whale allegedly swallowed athree-meter juvenile Caddy and the remains were found in its stomach. This storywas covered in Science Frontiers and New Scientist.49[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en772] In 2010, Russian fishermen demandedan investigation into a creature that looked identical to descriptions of theLoch Ness Monster, but kept appearing in a remote Siberian lake—which is one ofthe largest in all of Russia. This hungry monster has apparently beenresponsible for nineteen deaths from 2007 to 2010 alone.50[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en773] In February 2011, The Daily Mailreported eight sightings in the past five years of a long, humpbacked creatureknown as “Bownessie” in the U.K.’s Lake Windermere—and revealed new photographicevidence.51 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en774]There are many documented sightings and/or local eyewitness reports ofMokele-Mbembe in the Congo—a four-legged dinosaur-type creature, similar to abrontosaurus but much smaller, known as a sauropod.52[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en775] Most of the sightings occur in theLikouala Swamp, which has been officially declared 80 percent unexplored, and ismostly inhabited by indigenous pygmies. Similar sightings have been reported inother nations near the Congo, including Equatorial Guinea, Central AfricanRepublic, Gabon and Cameroon.53 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en776]Similar or identical creatures have also been spotted in Papua New Guinea, aboveAustralia.54 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en777]- 55[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en778]Nine people saw a dinosaur-typecreature on Umbungi Island in West New Britain.56[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en779] One of the main vortex points on theglobal grid is in this same area—directly below Papua New Guinea. In 1993, ChinaToday reported that more than one thousand people saw a dinosaur-like monsteraround Sayram Lake in Xinjang.57 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en780] Andin Canada, a young Inuit Eskimo working with scientists from Memorial Universityin Newfoundland found a fresh bone on Bylot Island that was identified asbelonging to part of the lower jaw of a duckbill dinosaur.58[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en781] The Geological Society of Americaand The Journal of Paleontology both reported on fresh bones found in Alaskathat were identified, twenty years later, as belonging to horned dinosaurs,duckbill dinosaurs, and small carnivorous dinosaurs.59[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en782]Marco Polo’s own written records from his expeditions in China in the late 1200sreveal that the royal house kept living dragons in captivity for specialceremonies, and dragons were also hunted for meat and medicine in the provinceof Karazan. Polo reported seeing these menacing creatures himself.60[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en783] Herodotus, a Greek historian, andJosephus, a Jewish historian, both describe flying reptiles in ancient Egypt andArabia. Many ancient legends, including Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology,describe heroes killing these creatures.Dinosaur-like creatures are featured on Babylonian landmarks, Roman mosaics,Asian pottery and royal robes, Egyptian burial shrouds and government seals,Peruvian burial stones and tapestries, Mayan sculptures, Aboriginal and NativeAmerican petroglyphs (carved rock drawings), and many other pieces of ceremonialart throughout ancient cultures.61 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en784]Dragons appear in literature from England, Ireland, Denmark, Norway,Scandinavia, Germany, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Babylon, as well as in AmericanIndian legends, including the Cree, Algonquin, Onandaga, Ojibway, Huron,Chinook, Shoshone and Alaskan Eskimoes.62[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en785] Another interesting lead is thatmaps from as recent as the 1600s feature drawings of dragon-like monsters inunknown regions.63 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en786]There are a surprisingly large number of credible eyewitness sightings of whatappear to be pterodactyls or pterosaurs in modern times.64[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en787] 65[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en788] 66[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en789] Traditional Native American legendsof the Thunderbird bear remarkable similarity to modern pterosaur sightings aswell. Forensic videographer Jonathan Whitcomb concluded that at least 1,400Americans have seen what appear to be living pterosaurs between the early 1980sand the end of 2008. Whitcomb interviewed witnesses from nineteen differentstates across America. The statistical average estimate of the wingspan waseight to ten feet, but 27 percent of the estimates were over eighteen feet—muchtoo large to be any form of bird in today’s world.67[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en790] Whitcomb also conducted extensiveinvestigations of pterosaur sightings in Papua New Guinea, where they are calledRopens, and published the results on numerous Web sites as well as his bookSearching for Ropens.68 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en791]Witnesses such as David Woetzel reported seeing a Ropen that had a reddishorange glow when it first appeared—and others have confirmed sightings of such a“bioluminescent glow.” In 2007, Whitcomb issued a press release claiming thatPaul Nation captured two pterosaurs on video in 2006, for fourteen seconds.Further analysis of the videotape revealed two tiny spots that were indeedglowing and slowly flickering. Cliff Paiva, a missile defense physicist workingin Southern California, could not find any common explanation for what thefootage showed.69 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en792] This slowly movingreddish orange glow could be easily interpreted by ancient cultures as fire—andthis may very well be the root cause of the firebreathing dragon legends.Apparently, as these creatures first appear in our reality out of time-space,they haven’t fully solidified yet—and their bodies glow because they stillpartially exist in a wave state.The Egyptians may have seen pterosaurs as well—and created their legends of theBennu bird of fire, or phoenix, from these events. The Was staff is a verypopular Egyptian symbol of power and authority—held by the gods and featured inhundreds of examples of ancient Egyptian art. The head at the top of each Wasstaff is nearly identical to a pterosaur in its shape and structure, and itcannot be associated with any other known living creature due to the uniquespike that projects from the back of the head.70[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en793]051 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_051_r1.jpg]Many Egyptian gods carried the Was staff, symbolizing power and guidance throughthe afterlife. The head on the Was staff bears remarkable similarity to apterosaur—and may have been modeled from actual sightings.In 1993, Russian scientists found remains of dwarf mammoths that had been aliveonly 3,700 years ago on Wrangel Island, off the coast of Siberia.71[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en794] That same year, British explorerColonel John Blashford-Snell photographed what appeared to be living mammoths,or stegodons, believed to be extinct, taken in an isolated valley in Nepal—asreported in the United Kingdom’s The Mail on Sunday.72[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en795] Admiral William Byrd fueled thehollow-earth theory when he reported seeing green pastures and mastodons as heflew over the South Pole in the 1930s—but this may have been an example of himpeering through a vortex into the past, as the South Pole is one of Sanderson’stwelve main vortices.The Ta Prohm temple in Cambodia was finished and dedicated in 1186—and manypeople believe there is a perfect image of a stegosaurus carved into theexterior of the temple. This is but one of a variety of illustrations of livingcreatures that are framed in the same circular design—but all the othercreatures are very conventional by comparison. The most comprehensive analysisof this enigmatic formation was written by a creationist, but nonetheless raisesinteresting points—including the fact that the original patina from 1186 canstill be seen in the cracks, even though the exterior of the temple was slightlypolished more recently.73 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en796]052 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_052_r1.jpg]This carving appears on the outside wall of the Ta Prohm temple in Cambodia,dedicated in 1186. Other similar carvings depict conventional animals, such asbirds, fish, buffalo, monkeys, deer and lizards—but this looks like astegosaurus.Lastly, on March 21, 1922, the Boston Transcript revealed that “During a heavysnowstorm in the Alps recently, thousands of exotic insects resembling spiders,caterpillars, and huge ants fell on the slopes and quickly died. Localnaturalists are unable to explain the phenomenon.”74[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en797]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENThe Galactic Clock Strikes the HourWe’ve now seen geometry in the quantum realm, in biology, in the earth and inthe solar system—as well as on the very large levels of superclusters and thebackground gas and dust at the farthest reaches of the Universe. What aboutgeometry within the galaxy itself? By simple logic, the geometric laws we see atwork in the solar system should extend well beyond just one star and itsplanets. If the galaxy also has geometric force fields, we could potentiallycross millions of years in an instant—once we know how to access them. Manyscientists estimate that the galaxy takes about 250 million years to completeone rotation.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en798] If life appeared onearth roughly 3.5 billion years ago, as our micro-fossil records of bacteriasuggest,2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en799] then the entire history oflife on earth only appeared during the last fourteen galactic rotations.3[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en800] That makes it seem much faster thanwe usually would think. The earth itself didn’t exist prior to 4.54 billionyears ago,4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en801] which is just overeighteen rotations into the past. Even the origin of the Universe, estimated atno more than 13.9 billion years ago,5[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en802] is only about fifty-five rotationsaway. If all life on earth is only fourteen galactic years old, it becomes mucheasier to imagine how all these rotations could blend together intime-space—forming one giant repeating cycle. Each time you’re at the same placein the galaxy you were at before, the same energetic conditions might againprevail.Let’s think back for a minute to the evolution cycle discovered by Muller andRohde. Every 62 million years, we see massive bursts of evolution appear onearth—and this is directly correlated with an up-and-down motion of our solarsystem through the galaxy, which is believed to take 64 million years tocomplete. Richard C. Hoagland was the first to point out to me, in privateconversation, that if you set the rotation of the galaxy at roughly 250 millionyears, you find exactly four of these 62-million year cycles in one galacticrotation. Four equidistant points in a circle form a square—so we may very wellbe looking at an octahedron in the galaxy (or a cube) that is actually drivingevolution on earth. This was a stunning development. Our solar system’sup-and-down movement through the galactic plane could be the direct result ofthe gravitational flow around each corner of the geometry, since Hans Jennyshowed there is a constant, flowing movement in, around and through thesegeometric vortexes when they appear in a fluid. So as we head toward one corner,we’re on an upswing—and then when we pass that corner, we shift into anothercurrent, and get pulled into a downswing.What about other geometry in the galaxy? Remember that Sanderson’s icosahedronon earth created ten vortex points that were near the Tropic of Cancer and theTropic of Capricorn—all evenly spaced apart. If you divide the galaxy’s250-million-year orbit into ten equal parts, you have 25 million yearseach—which is reasonably close to the 26-million-year cycle Raup and Sepkoskioriginally discovered. In fact, if the level of solar radiation increased in ameasurable way once this new sphere of geometry kicked in, that could increasethe amount of radiation being stored in the fossil record—and thus make it lookmore like 26 million years had gone by each time, when it was really closer to25 million.Soon afterward, I realized that the double tetrahedron has six equidistantpoints along the equator, just like the Star of David in two dimensions, butthere are six more equidistant points in the interior. This means you get atotal of twelve equidistant points along the equator, within one sphere ofenergy. This now potentially explained the basis of the Moon’s twelve orbitalcycles for every earth year, as well as the deeper meaning of the twelve signsand houses in the Zodiac. Furthermore, the twelve Ages of the Zodiac couldrepresent a larger double-tetrahedron geometry that takes us 25,920 years tomove through. We may now have a geometric basis for why the number twelveappears so repeatedly in these cycles.We know that based on the behavior of these unseen energy fields, both thegalactic octahedron and the galactic icosahedron should also have spheres ofenergy that surround them and travel along with them. And we also know that amore complex geometry would be vibrating at a higher frequency, just like Liuand Spilhaus observed in the growth of the earth. Therefore, it would appearthat during the 62-million-year cycle, a lower-frequency sphere of galacticenergy was moving through the solar system. This sphere would have the geometryof an octahedron or cube in time. Each sphere appears to be rippling away fromthe center of the galaxy at a slow, even speed. Once the galactic octahedronpassed us by, we came under the influence of the galactic icosahedron—though theshadows of the octahedron still are tugging on us a bit, as Muller and Rohdediscovered.A higher-frequency sphere of energy then flooded into our solar system—and thismay have created enough of an increase in solar radiation that it made thefossil record appear to have a 26-million-year cycle rather than a25-million-year pattern. Carbon dating is based on a smooth, unchanging flow ofsolar radiation in order to produce the results we see. The new 25-million-yearcycle started appearing in the fossil record some 250 million years ago—meaningwe’ve now had ten cycles, or one complete revolution of the galaxy, since itstarted. Since we’ve now completed a full circle, that may very well mean thatwe’re now moving into the next big bubble of energy—with an even higher level ofcoherence. Also, let’s not forget that the original solid crust of the earthbegan breaking up along equidistant points that formed a tetrahedron by about220 million years ago—perhaps showing the gradual, long-term earth effects thatkicked in once this new sphere of energy arrived. The grid may very well beshifting into a new configuration at this time—which could explain why honeybeesand other migratory animals are getting increasingly lost and confused.GALACTIC ENERGY SPHERES OUTSIDE THE MILKY WAYIf this is truly a universal, harmonic system we’re dealing with, then theseexpanding spheres should be detectable in other galaxies. We remember that theSource Field often flows into our space-time through nonvisible electromagneticfrequencies, such as ultraviolet. So, we could look for changes in theelectromagnetic spectrum of galaxies—in rippling, circular, concentric layerslike an onion. And that is exactly what we find. This amazing story was coveredin an April 1993 issue of Discover magazine.6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en803]053 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_053_r1.jpg]Hypothetical illustration of zones of microwave energy in the Milky Way, basedon Dr. William Tifft’s discoveries of these patterns in many other galaxies.Dr. William Tifft was studying redshift, which is electromagnetic radiation fromspace—outside the visible spectrum in the microwave range. Normally, astronomersassume these frequencies indicate how far away something is. Tifft’s discoveriesseriously challenged that preciously guarded model, because he found thatredshift did not stay the same in one galaxy—it was separated into concentriclayers. The frequency grew increasingly higher as you moved toward thecenter—and it always changed by the same amount. Again, he used the wordquantized to describe these separate layers. The Discover article compared thisgalactic phenomenon to the “energy states of an atom”—and let’s not forget thatKozyrev also discovered a quantized change in the weight of an object after hebumped some of its atoms over into time-space. The atoms seemed to be poppingback in through layers of geometry that would reappear, one at a time, overfifteen to twenty minutes.Best of all, Tifft found that these spheres of energy were on the move, just aswe would expect, based on the fossil record.More recently Tifft has also claimed to have evidence, from observing the samegalaxies over a period of ten years, that their redshifts change over time. Wemay be seeing some form of galactic evolution taking place before our very eyes,he says.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en804]Despite the fact that this is considered rogue astronomy, because it slaughtersthe sacred cow of redshift, a variety of credible investigations have concludedthat the quantized-redshift effect is genuine. One 2006 study detected one ofTifft’s redshift values at a 95 percent confidence level.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en805] A 2007 study reviewed the history ofall these investigations from the 1970s up until the time they published, andconcluded that the effect really could be genuine.9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en806] In 2003, Bell and Comeau found thesame quantized layers of energy, like concentric spheres within an onion, infully ninety-one different galaxies.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en807] A different study from the Journalof Astrophysics and Astronomy in 1997 examined over 250 different galaxies, andfound these same layers of energy in every single one of them. The effect was soobvious that it could be “easily seen by eye” in maps of the frequencies, andthey said the confidence levels were “extremely high.”11[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en808]INDEPENDENT PROOF—FROM DR. HAROLD ASPDENDr. Harold Aspden has created an incredible, encyclopedic body of work on hisEnergy Science Web site. Since the 1960s, he has explored the idea that allmatter is created from an aether—and he concluded that it has different levelsof density, or thickness. These discoveries were generated by a reshuffling ofthe Maxwell equations, which are still used in calculations to design andconstruct electrical equipment. Maxwell’s equations automatically assume thereis an aether—and because it works, no one questions it. Aspden was the first tofind out that he could rearrange these equations, all in logical ways, andconclude that this aether had to have different levels of density. Theseequations also revealed what the exact electromagnetic frequencies would be whenthese layers of aether flowed into our own reality. Aspden was utterly shockedto discover that the numbers he had generated theoretically, in these equations,were identical to the actual frequencies Tifft had measured in his spherical,concentric layers—or “space domains”—which have been seen in over 250 differentgalaxies.12 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en809]The conclusion one reaches from this remarkable result is that galaxies can, sofar as the different space domain origins of their primary radiation sources areconcerned, lock into slightly different sets of fundamental physical constants.. . . The author recognized the need to accept the existence of such “spacedomains” even within our local galactic system in Chapter 16 of his 1972 book. .. . Such domains have bearing on geological events, such as geomagnetic fieldreversals occurring as the solar system transits through boundaries separatingadjacent space domains.13 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en810]This is direct confirmation of what I expected—namely, that we can prove thereare layers of energy in the galaxy that can completely transform the earth andsolar system as they sweep through, causing measurable changes. Geomagnetic polereversals are not what we’re looking for—it’s the effects on life that seem tobe jumping out at us, since many evolutionary events did not involve anycataclysmic activity.TAU SPACETifft himself also theorized about what was creating these strange effects—andgiven everything we’ve been discussing, the results are astonishing. Tifft hasobviously never read Dewey Larson’s physics, but he came up with the exact samething to explain what he was seeing: “In summary, we have examined a model basedupon two coexisting 3-D spaces, one of time, one of space.”14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en811] I was thrilled when I realized Tiffthad independently discovered this on his own. Let’s read a little more.Quantum physics resides in tau-space and conventional dynamics operates in .Although there as yet exists no formal mathematical framework linking thesespaces [at least none Tifft was aware of at the time], there is a wealth ofempirical consistency with observations. This includes properties ranging fromthe masses and forces at the fundamental particle level, through redshiftquantization, to cosmological effects on the largest scale. Time as a3-dimensional quantity appears to be a promising subject for investigation.15[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en812]The word tau means “time”—so Tifft is almost using the exact same language asthe term time-space, only with the Greek letter for time instead. In this samepaper, he says, “At a given cosmic radius in tau space, a galaxy occupies aspecific temporal state. It must change that temporal state in discretesteps.”16 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en813] I was amazed at how wellall of this fit together. The model is extremely elegant. When we combine Tifftand Aspden’s conclusions, we know that at least at some point, we could enterinto a new space domain of tau space, where matter and energy as we know it“locks into a slightly different set of fundamental physical constants,” and“changes its temporal state” in a “discrete step.” Neither of these greatscientists seem to be aware of how well their model extends to explain the 26-and 62-million-year cycles that were found in the fossil record—showing thatthese changes in the flow of time also affect biological life as well as the“fundamental physical constants” of matter and energy.CHANGES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEMWe’ve almost got a perfect model at this point. The last thing we need to findout is whether our solar system is already going through a change in itstemporal state where we indeed enter into a new space domain that will lock in aslightly different set of fundamental physical constants. In simple terms, ifwe’re at the boundary of one of these domains right now, complete with all thecoherence-increasing, DNA-evolving properties that come along with it, we shouldexpect to see measurable changes in the Sun and planets. This would provide“smoking gun” proof that the ancient prophecies were indeed correct. As Dmitrievalready suggested, these changes would be the direct result of an increasingflow of time through the solar system—or as he put it, an increase in the numberof vacuum domains, or vortexes into time-space, coming in. And, lo and behold,once we begin seeking evidence for interplanetary climate change, we find manysolid data points from reputable NASA and ESA scientists.THE SUNSince at least the late 1970s, the Sun’s overall radiation emissions haveincreased by 0.5 percent per decade.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en814] Between 1901 and 2000, the Sun’smagnetic field increased in size and strength by 230 percent.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en815] As of 1999, high increases in theamount of helium and heavier charged particles coming out of the Sun wereobserved.19 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en816] One NASA scientist saidin 2003 that the Sun was “more active than in living memory.”20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en817] A mainstream geophysical teamrecently proved that the Sun has been more active since the 1940s than in theprevious 1,150 years combined.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en818] Thenew brightening all started in the last 150 years.22[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en819] As of November 2004, this same groupproved that the Sun is more energetic than it has been in at least eightthousand years.23 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en820]Then in 2006, NASA announced that the Sun’s “great conveyor belt,” a massivecirculating current of hot plasma, had slowed down from a normal walking speedof 1.0 meters per second to 0.75 meters per second in the north—and only 0.25meters per second in the south.24 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en821]Prior to recent times, the speed had stayed consistent since the nineteenthcentury, and it took about forty years—two katuns—to complete a circuit. Thismay be a sign that the “flow of time” within the Sun is changing, as wediscussed earlier. In 2008, NASA said this was a “substantial . . . historic andimportant” change—“the sun’s surface flows have slowed dramatically.”25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en822] In 2009, NASA reported that “this isthe quietest sun we’ve seen in almost a century” due to the surprising lack ofsunspots and flares on the surface.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en823]- 27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en824] BBC News admitted that astronomerswere baffled by this—particularly because, as Dr. Mike Lockwood explained, theSun’s overall activity peaked in about 1985 and has been on a noticeabledowntrend since then, even as overall global temperatures have risen: “If theSun’s dimming were to have a cooling effect, we’d have seen it by now.”28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en825] At the same time, scientists alsofear there might be a massive new peak of solar activity that could potentiallyfry electronics on earth—and gave a surprisingly familiar-sounding target dateof September 2012 for when this may happen.29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en826] A LiveScience article in 2007seriously considered the social anthropologist Dr. Benny Peiser’s suggestionthat the Sun could be responsible for measurable “global warming” on Mars,Jupiter, Neptune’s moon Triton and Pluto, as well as the earth.30[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en827] Surprisingly, this is one of veryfew mainstream media articles to have ever made this obvious connection—but thedata in Peiser’s analysis is only a small part of the story.MERCURYDespite supposedly high surface temperatures, Mercury seems to have ice in itspolar regions.31 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en828] It also has anunexpectedly dense core and strong magnetic field. Scientists would like to knowhow these anomalies are possible.32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en829]In 2008, Mercury was found to have “several signatures indicating significantpressure within the magnetosphere” that it didn’t have in the 1970s.33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en830] By 2009, it had gotten much moreintense—the Messenger probe was now seeing “magnetic twisters,” and thescientists were surprised at how strongly it changed.34[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en831] These tornadoes were ten times asstrong as any ever seen on earth.35 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en832]VENUSThe amount of sulfur in Venus’s atmosphere decreased dramatically between 1978and 1983.36 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en833] Venus’s overallnight-side brightness increased by a whopping 2,500 percent between 1975 and2001.37 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en834] Scientists cannot explainthis sudden change in brightness, though it suggests that the oxygen content ofVenus’s atmosphere may have substantially increased.38[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en835] 39[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en836] A tail of charged plasma trailingbehind Venus was measured to be 60,000 percent longer in 1997 than in the late1970s.40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en837] Both the northern andsouthern hemispheres of Venus dramatically brightened in January 2007, and astrange, unusual and mysterious bright spot appeared in July 2009.41[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en838] Regarding this sudden new brightspot, Dr. Sanjay Lamaye said, “It’s fair to say something unusual happened onVenus. Unfortunately, we don’t know what happened.”42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en839]MARSBetween the mid-1970s and 1995, Mars developed clouds, had an overall reductionin atmospheric dust content, and revealed a “surprise . . . abundance” of ozonein its atmosphere.43 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en840] The MarsSurveyor probe was damaged in 1997 by an unexpected 200 percent increase in thedensity of Mars’s atmosphere.44 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en841] In1999, a hurricane appeared on Mars for the first time in more than twenty years,and was 300 percent larger than any previously seen.45[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en842] The biggest global dust storm in“several decades” engulfed the entire planet very rapidly in 2001, “somethingquite unheard of in previous experience.”46[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en843]Interestingly, this storm peaked directly before 9/11—suggesting thepossibility, however remote, that the massive stress everyone felt on earth fromthat event actually reflected back through time-space and had profound energeticeffects upon our nearest neighboring planet. In 2001, mainstream media announcedglobal warming on Mars, including dramatic year-to-year losses of snow at thesouth pole and rapid erosion of ice features at the south pole.47[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en844] NASA described this as “recentglobal climate change” in 2003. In 2005, European astronomers noticed a glow onthe night side of Mars for the first time.48[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en845]054 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_054_r1.gif]The atmosphere of Mars erupted into an unprecedented global dust storm betweenJuly and September 2001, shocking NASA scientists.JUPITER AND ITS MOONSHot plasma was observed in Jupiter’s magnetic field in 1979, though it was notvisible in 1974.49 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en846] Jupiter’satmosphere was discovered by NASA scientists to be hundreds of degrees hotterthan anticipated.50 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en847] The amount ofheavy elements (such as oxygen) in Jupiter’s atmosphere decreased by a stunning10 percent between 1979 and 1995, which is equivalent to twenty earth-masses ofoxygen “embarrassingly” disappearing in sixteen years.51[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en848] 52[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en849] Radiation emissions from Jupiterincreased by about 25 percent between 1973 and 1995.53[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en850] In April 2004, a major new studyannounced the surprise merging of three different oval formations in Jupiter’satmosphere, two of which were quite large. Without these vortexes in place, heatwould not be released as efficiently and Jupiter might experience substantialglobal warming within the following ten years—a whopping temperature increase of18 degrees Fahrenheit, or 10°C.54 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en851]The same scientist also notes that the Great Red Spot has changed from itstraditional red to “something more like salmon,” and that this color change maybe due to an overall increase in temperature.55[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en852] These changes are theorized to bepart of a seventy-year cycle, which is believed to have started when the threelargest ovals first appeared in 1939.In 2006, the three ovals that had merged together in 2004 were now becoming ahuge storm rivaling the Great Red Spot, further indicating a “global change” inJupiter’s climate.56 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en853] In 2008, twomassive new storms emerged in Jupiter’s atmosphere that were hotter than anyever observed before. NASA announced that this was part of a “dramatic,planet-wide disturbance on Jupiter that is ongoing. The cause of the disturbancehas yet to be explained.”57 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en854] In orderto properly model this “global upheaval” in computer simulations, NASAscientists had to increase the water vapor in Jupiter’s atmosphere to “very highlevels—about three hundred times that measured by the Galileo spacecraft . . .in 1995.”58 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en855]In 1995, Jupiter’s moon Io had a huge, bright, two-hundred-mile-wide featureshow up in only sixteen months, which was a “more dramatic change than any seenin the previous fifteen years.”59 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en856]Io’s ionosphere became 1,000 percent higher between 1973 and 1996.60[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en857] Io’s entire surface became over 200percent hotter between 1979 and 1998.61[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en858] New colors were seen in Io’s auroraein 1998.62 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en859] Yet additional new colorswere discovered in 2001.63 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en860] Adoughnut-shaped tube of glowing plasma energy fills the entire path of Io’sorbit of Jupiter. Scientists think this tube is caused by charged particlesspewing from Io’s volcanoes. The charged particles in this tube became 50percent denser between 1979 and 1995.64[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en861] The overall density of the tubeincreased by 200 percent between 1979 and 1995.65[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en862] A ribbon-like cold portion separatedout and significantly brightened between 1999 and 2000.66[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en863]Confounding the mainstream models, another “surprisingly dense” plasma tube wasdiscovered in 2003, this time sharing the orbit of the moon Europa. In this casethere are no volcanoes to account for where the charged particles are comingfrom.67 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en864] As of about 2003, Europa’saurora was observed to be substantially brighter than it was expected to be in a1998 model.68 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en865] The third large moon,Ganymede, has an aurora that became over 200 percent brighter between 1979 andthe mid-1990s.69 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en866] This increase inbrightness is believed to be caused by a 1,000 percent increase in the densityof Ganymede’s atmosphere since 1979.70[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en867] Ganymede also has its own magneticfield, in defiance of all conventional expectations.71[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en868] The fourth large moon, Callisto, wasrecently observed to have an aurora that is fully 100,000 percent higher inintensity than Jupiter’s own magnetic field in that area.72[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en869] A third plasma tube, bigger thanIo’s tube and the one in Europa’s orbit, was discovered in 1998. In defiance ofall mainstream thought, it rotates in the opposite direction of Jupiteritself.73 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en870] Counter-rotating fieldsare a basic aspect of the flowing interaction between the spin fields ofspace-time and time-space, as I have described in my other books on the DivineCosmos Web site. Similarly, in 2007, Italian scientists discovered that ourentire galaxy has two different halos, composed of different types of stars,which are counter-rotating inside of each other. Our Sun is part of oneflattened halo of stars traveling at about twenty kilometers per second. Aspherical halo of stars with a different chemical composition iscounter-rotating at seventy kilometers per second.74[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en871]SATURNSaturn’s own tube-shaped cloud of plasma energy became 1,000 percent denser thanexpected between 1981 and 1993.75 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en872]Bright aurorae were seen at Saturn’s poles for the first time in 1995.76[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en873] In 2008, NASA announced a “brightaurora” at Saturn’s north pole, which “covers an enormous area. . . . Ourcurrent ideas . . . predict that this region should be empty, so finding such abright aurora here is a fantastic surprise.”77[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en874] Clouds at Saturn’s equator sloweddown by 58.2 percent between 1980 and 199678[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en875]—again suggesting a reduction in the“flow of time” similar to what we are seeing in the Sun. “Massive” emissions ofX-rays from Saturn’s equatorial region were detected for the first time in2004.79 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en876] Such changes suggest that afundamental shift has occurred within Saturn. In addition, curious dark areasnamed “spoke” formations were first observed in Saturn’s rings in 1980, and wereseen to rotate faster than the rings themselves.80[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en877] By December of 2003, scientistsworking with the Cassini probe—the first probe to return to Saturn since theVoyager missions in 1980–1981—were already getting excited about seeing thespoke formations in the rings again.81[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en878] However, by February, 2004, thescientists acknowledged that the spokes were no longer visible.82[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en879] A “gigantic storm” with lightningbolts a thousand times stronger than any seen on Earth was announced in 2006.83[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en880]Saturn’s moon Titan appears to have had a 10–15 percent increase in the size ofits atmosphere between 1980 and 2004.84[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en881] However, if NASA’s moreconservative, published estimates of Titan’s former atmosphere size at 250kilometers are correct,85 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en882] thenTitan’s atmosphere may have actually expanded by as much as 200 percent in itsoverall height. Fast-moving, bright clouds have now been seen in Titan’ssouthern hemisphere, which are inexplicable in mainstream models.86[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en883] Ozone atoms, again a sign of ionizedplasma, were detected on Saturn’s moons Dione and Rhea in 1997.87[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en884] A “severe storm” was seen for thefirst time near Titan’s equator in April 2008, blatantly contradicting NASA’smodels and leaving scientists feeling puzzled.88[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en885]URANUSThough Uranus “appeared as featureless as a cue ball” in 1986,89[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en886] remarkably bright clouds began toappear as of at least 1996. By 1998, Hubble had discovered nearly as many cloudsin a short time as had ever before been observed in the entire history ofUranus.90 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en887] By 1999, NASA articleswere referring to Uranus as being “hit” by “huge storms,” making it “a dynamicworld with the brightest clouds in the outer solar system.”91[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en888] -92[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en889] The head NASA scientist referred tothese increasingly bright and active clouds as “really big, big changes” onUranus. In October 2000, a NASA briefing admits that “long-term ground-basedobservations [of Uranus are showing] seasonal brightness changes whose originsare not well understood.”93 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en890]In November 2004, Uranus again made headlines: thirty distinct, large cloudswere now visible—more than the entire amount of clouds ever counted prior to2000—and these clouds were brighter than ever before.94[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en891] According to one NASA scientist fromBerkeley, “We have never seen such vigorous . . . activity in the southernhemisphere before. . . . Penetration of these clouds’ activity to higheraltitudes is unprecedented.”95 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en892]Additionally, carbon monoxide gas was detected in Uranus’s atmosphere for thefirst time in December 2003, and the scientists feel that this gas comes fromdust flowing throughout the solar system.96[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en893] “Dramatic changes” in Uranus’s ringswere announced in 2007, including brightness increases, a potentially new ringand a cloud of dust particles pervading the entire ring system.97[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en894]NEPTUNEBy June 1994, Neptune’s Great Dark Spot, a circular feature in the southernhemisphere like the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, had disappeared. By March orApril 1995, it had reappeared in the northern hemisphere. NASA said that thisnew spot was a “near-mirror image of the first spot previously imaged by Voyager2.” This also led NASA scientists to say that “Neptune has changed radicallysince 1989.”98 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en895] Two years later, NASAwrote of “a looming mystery”: The newly migrated spot “appears to be trapped ata fixed latitude” in its new position in the northern hemisphere. 99[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en896] This appears to have been caused bya perfect geometric shift in the grid, as the new northern latitude was the sameas the southern. By 1996, less than a year after the “hyperdimensional poleshift,” Dr. Lawrence Sromovsky noticed an increase in Neptune’s overallbrightness—which continued dramatically increasing through to 2002. Blue lightbecame 3.2 percent brighter, red light 5.6 percent brighter and near-infraredlight intensified by a whopping 40 percent. Some areas of latitude became fully100 percent brighter.100 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en897]055 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_055_r1.gif]Between 1996 and 2002, Neptune’s brightness increased by 40 percent in thenear-infrared range. The images on the far right are composites.The physics to explain such a change in brightness are just not there in theconventional models, since Neptune “seems to run on almost no energy.”101[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en898] Neptune’s south pole was found to be18 degrees warmer than the rest of the planet in 2007.102[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en899]Neptune’s moon, Triton, experienced a “very large” 5 percent temperatureincrease between 1989 and 1998. This is comparable with earth’s atmosphereheating up by twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit in only nine years.103[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en900] It is believed that Triton’satmospheric pressure has “at least doubled in bulk since the time of the Voyagerencounter (in 1989).”104 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en901]PLUTOEven though Pluto has been drifting away from the Sun since 1989, itsatmospheric pressure increased by 300 percent between 1989 and 2002, causing anoticeable rise in surface temperatures. Again, this is attributed to “seasonalchange.”105 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en902] According to one leadingNASA scientist, “The changes observed in Pluto’s atmosphere are much more severe[than in Triton’s]. . . . We just don’t know what is causing these effects.”106[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en903] “These changes are not subtle.”107[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en904] Indeed, the idea of “seasonalchanges” being responsible for such a “severe” increase is said to be“counterintuitive.”108 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en905] The NASA teamacknowledges this unexpected “global warming” of Pluto, but says that it is“likely not connected with that of the Earth” since the “Sun’s output is muchtoo steady.”109 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en906] The scientistssuggest “some longer-term change, analogous to long-term climatic changes onEarth” could be responsible for the massive global warming of Pluto.110[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en907] The Associated Press revealed inFebruary 2010 that Pluto’s colors did not change between 1954 and 2000, but thenthe red levels became 20 to 30 percent stronger by 2002.111[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en908] In addition, “Nitrogen ice [is]shifting in size and density in surprising ways.”112[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en909]EARTH CHANGES NOT RELATED TO INDUSTRIAL POLLUTIONSome Earth Changes cannot be attributed to human industrial pollution. Accordingto NASA scientists, “Activity in [earth’s] two known Van Allen radiation beltsgrew so intense in May, 1998, that a new belt was created . . . generatingexcitement and awe in the scientific community.”113[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en910] This new belt contains mostlyionized nitrogen, neon, and oxygen particles, which are new and unexpected sincethe inner Van Allen radiation belt itself consists mostly of protons.114[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en911] The original source of the atoms isbelieved to be the local interstellar medium; i.e., the gas, dust and energybetween the stars.115 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en912] In February1996, NASA’s “Tethered Satellite” experiment hoped to harness 3,500 volts ofelectricity from space, using a superstrong cable to stretch a satellite outaway from the space shuttle and hold it there while the cable gathered energy.However, the satellite appeared to have encountered vastly more energy in theearth’s upper atmosphere than NASA had expected. First, it encountered a varietyof mysterious problems; its “computer and two of its four gyroscopes had stoppedworking. In addition, both thrusters mysteriously had opened and spewed outnitrogen gas.”116 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en913] These problemscaused the experiment to be delayed—and are totally consistent with the observedelectrical effects of what appears to be a vortex into time-space. When thesatellite was finally deployed, the supposedly foolproof tether actually broke,sending the satellite reeling off into space—and NASA was unwilling to speculateas to the cause of the break,117 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en914] orwhether the earlier computer/gyroscope/thruster problems were related to thebreak itself.118 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en915] Astronauts diddescribe that the tether’s “outer coating of nylon and Teflon looked charred andmelted.”119 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en916] Thus there appears tohave been vastly more energy in earth’s upper atmosphere than earliermeasurements had shown.As of the mid-to-late 1990s, fully 5,060 percent more ozone was being detectedin earth’s middle atmosphere than was expected, even though pollution isexpected to reduce ozone, not increase it.120[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en917] This area is above where the “ozoneholes” are located. There are also more hydroxyl (OH) molecules appearing inearth’s upper atmosphere than conventional scientists can explain.121[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en918] Furthermore, “strong emissions fromatomic neon, argon and xenon” were seen in earth’s aurora, apparently for thefirst time, in 2001.122 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en919] Overall,earth has been losing 3 percent of its sunlight per decade since the 1950s.There has been a 10 percent decrease in sunlight reaching earth’s surface in thelast thirty years, and 15 percent over the last fifty years, showing that theeffect is accelerating.123 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en920] Thissuggests that the atmosphere itself has become noticeably denser. Mostscientists would expect the earth to cool down as a result of a thickeratmosphere, not warm up, so this “shocking” finding “went against all scientificthinking” and was “ignored” as a result. “The first reaction has always beenthat the effect is much too big, I don’t believe it and if it’s true then whyhas nobody reported it before.”124 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en921]NASA announced in 2009 that over the last twenty-five years, noctilucent cloudsin earth’s upper atmosphere are becoming more and more frequent, migrating downfrom the poles, and shining brighter than ever before.125[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en922] This cannot be attributed to achange in temperature, and atmospheric scientist Dr. Vincent Wickwar said, “Isuspect, as many of us feel, that it is global change, but I fear we don’tunderstand it. . . . It’s not as simple as a temperature change.”126[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en923]The oceans of the world have warmed significantly since the late 1940s, andinterestingly, slightly less than half of the increase in heat content isoccurring below three hundred meters (roughly nine hundred feet).127[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en924] These rapid, unpredictable changesin temperature were previously thought impossible, since sunlight cannotpenetrate to these depths.128 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en925] Thesesubsurface temperature changes can predict the behavior of surface weatherseveral months later.129 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en926] 130[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en927] 131[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en928] There are temperature anomalies inthe deepest levels of the Pacific Ocean that exhibit a slow, clockwisecirculating movement, 132 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en929] and thesedeep temperature anomalies are neatly correlated with variations in solar energyoutput. This has allowed for the creation of a successful model to predict ElNiño and La Niña events in advance.133[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en930]Earthquake activity also appears to have increased. A worldwide database systemfor reliably cataloging earthquakes was established by the United StatesGeological Service as of January 1, 1973.134[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en931] According to the USGS, 98 percent ofearthquakes are less than a magnitude 3 on the richter scale135[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en932] and “earthquakes greater than aboutmagnitude 3 usually can be felt by people near the source area,”136[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en933] and thus are easily detectable. Forthis same reason it is unlikely that improvements in the technology or number ofdetection stations would cause a significant increase in the actual number ofearthquakes that are reported above 3.0. Nonetheless, in 1973 there were 4,517earthquakes above 3.0 on the Richter scale worldwide, and by 2003 there were17,443. This represents a total of a 386 percent increase in earthquake activityabove 3.0 between 1973 and 2003.137 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en934]Despite this significant, steadily increasing trend in earthquake activity,there is the obligatory USGS Web page that attempts to blame this on increasesin the number of detection stations.138[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en935] However, a careful read reveals thatthis “disclaimer” document only discusses earthquakes larger than 7.0, creatinga more easily manipulated dataset of less than twenty events per year. If youhave an eye for the politics, you can see how the USGS did not actually admitnor deny an overall increasing trend in earthquakes—all they truly said is that“earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater have remained fairly constant.” (Thisis actually good, because it means that the most damaging earthquakes are notincreasing in frequency.) Furthermore, an increase in our ability to locateearthquakes is only offered as “a partial explanation” for the public’s frequentperception that earthquake activity is on the rise.139[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en936]Prior to 1998, earth was gradually getting narrower at the equator and longer atthe poles. However, from 1998 onward, this trend has reversed itself—earth isbulging out at the equator and contracting in at the poles. Estimates of theweight loss caused by melting icecaps and glaciers are far too small to accountfor the magnitude of the effect.140 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en937]Anomalies in earth’s magnetic field suggest that a magnetic pole shift isalready under way, and the models have no clear way of predicting exactly howsoon this will complete itself.141[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en938]142[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en939] Interestingly, in March 2004, ahurricane was detected for the first time in the earth’s southern hemisphere.143[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en940]GLOBAL WARMINGThe effects of “climate change” have become so obvious that the U.N. WorldMeteorological Association feels that the world must be made aware of thesechanges immediately, as “the increase in temperature in the twentieth century islikely to have been the largest in any century during the past 1,000 years.”144[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en941] In addition, the 1990s are likely tohave been the warmest decade of the last 1,000 years.145[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en942] The amount of water vapor in theatmosphere of the northern hemisphere has increased in the last 25 years.146[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en943] The average thickness of summerArctic Sea ice has decreased by 40 percent in the last 30 years.147[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en944] The average lake or river in thenorthern hemisphere will now have about two less weeks of ice cover per yearthan one hundred years ago.148 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en945] Since1966, the overall snow cover in the northern hemisphere has decreased by about10 percent.149 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en946] Glaciers in theArgentina/Chile region are melting fully 200 percent faster in 2003 than in1975.150 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en947] Even NASA has admitted that“the (Antarctic) peninsula has warmed 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degreesFahrenheit) over the past 50 years, causing rapid thinning, enhanced melting andrapid disintegration of its ice shelves.”151[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en948] Lastly, “since 1950, according toone estimate, some 600,000 plant and animal species have disappeared, andcurrently nearly 40,000 more are threatened. This is the fastest rate ofextinction since the dinosaurs disappeared.”152[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en949] Forty percent of all known specieson earth are now at risk of extinction. Somewhere between 2.7 and 270 speciesdisappear every day. The most conservative estimate is that the current rate ofextinction is one hundred times greater than the background rate, but Harvardbiologist Edward O. Wilson has calculated that the true rate may be as high asten thousand times above the background level. Wilson predicts that half of allplant and animal species will be extinct by 2100.153[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en950]THE LOCAL INTERSTELLAR MEDIUMNow, thanks to our study of the fossil record, combined with Tifft’s andAspden’s models, it may be that all of the changes we have listed are caused bythe solar system moving into a more highly charged area of energy in the galaxy.This appears to be directly affecting the behavior of our planets and theirmoons—showing an overall energetic increase as matter itself goes through achange of state, and the flow of time speeds up at the quantum level. If we areindeed moving into such a new zone in the galaxy, then we would expect to see anincrease in the amount of dust and energized particles in our local interstellarmedium—which is the area of the galaxy immediately surrounding our Sun’smagnetic field. Dr. Don Shemansky, a NASA scientist, reveals that NASA has had a“persistent, pernicious bias” against anyone trying to do research on possiblechanges in the local interstellar medium.154[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en951] Does NASA know something that theywould like to keep a secret from the public? Have they been quietly documentingthis interplanetary climate change, and putting the pieces together? Have theydecided that humanity is too immature to handle the big picture? It is certainlypossible.However, some of these studies have made it through the cracks. In 1993, a NASAprobe detected ionized helium and extreme ultraviolet radiation in the localinterstellar medium for the first time. This led astronomers to realize that“the hot, ionized gas of the local interstellar medium extends much farther thanpreviously thought.”155 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en952] In 2000 ESA/NASA reported steady increases in the density and temperature of helium in theouter areas of the Sun’s magnetic field. One scientist said, “It’s not yet clearthat the source of the helium is [from the local] interstellar [medium]. Butwe’ve done everything we can to remove sources within the [Sun’s own magneticfield] and the density’s still going up. . . .”156[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en953] He goes on to say, “A continuedelevation would raise interesting questions about what’s going on immediatelyoutside our Sun’s sphere of influence.”By 2003, the Ulysses probe measured dust in the interstellar medium at a “factorof 4 to 5 larger” (i.e., 400–500 percent more dust) than what had previouslybeen seen in ground-based observations, leading NASA/ JPL to suggest that theremay be “an enhancement of interstellar dust in the local interstellarmedium.”157 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en954] As of August 2003, anESA/NASA experiment called DUST, launched with the Ulysses satellite in 1990,discovered that 300 percent more galactic dust streamed into the solar systembetween 2000 and 2003 than occurred throughout all of the 1990s.158[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en955] In 2009, NASA made a startlingannouncement about these ongoing changes in the “Local Fluff” outside our solarsystem.The solar system is passing through an interstellar cloud that physics saysshould not exist. . . . Using data from Voyager, we have discovered a strongmagnetic field just outside the solar system . . . [it] is much more stronglymagnetized than anyone had previously suspected—between 4 and 5 microgauss.159[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en956]NASA scientist Richard Mewaldt announced that “in 2009, [galactic] cosmic rayintensities [from outside the solar system] have increased 19 percent beyondanything we’ve seen in the past fifty years. . . . The increase issignificant.”160 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en957] In 2008, NASAannounced that the Sun’s magnetic field, which extends well beyond Pluto’sorbit, had shrunk by 25 percent in the last decade and was now at its lowestlevel since the beginning of the space race fifty years ago.161[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en958]NASA scientists were baffled by this, but if we are moving into a zone of higherpressure in the local interstellar medium, this could obviously compress theSun’s magnetic field. Lastly, although scientists think it is “purelycoincidental,” not part of any natural law, all the energy and dust clouds inthe local interstellar medium are expanding outwardly . . . away from the centerof the galaxy: “For an observer at the Sun, the interstellar wind seems to flow[out] from the central part of the galaxy (the Sagittarius area).”162[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en959]This incoming energy does appear to have bioactive properties. In 2007,scientists from Arizona State University announced that salmonella bacteriabecame 300 percent stronger after being flown in NASA’s space shuttle Atlantis.Fully 167 different genes changed—making it three times more likely to causedisease.163 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en960] In 2008, it wasannounced that the Chinese were growing fruits and vegetables that were massivein size, such as twenty-one-pound tomatoes—simply by flying the seeds throughspace first.164 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en961] Dr. JamesSpottiswoode found that the earth’s alignment with the galaxy could create up toa 450 percent increase in psychic accuracy each day—within one hour of 13:30local sidereal time—and the effect held true over twenty years’ worth oftrials.165 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en962]The Darwinian model of evolution has been proven incorrect at every turn. Whatthe fossil record shows is sudden, spontaneous changes from one form to another,like simple shellfish with external skeletons into complex bony fish withinternal skeletons. No transitional fossils have been found for this and manyother similar examples, like the transition from finned to limbed creatures.Furthermore, Drs. David Raup and John Sepkoski have discovered that these massevolution events occur, like clockwork, every 26 million years in the fossilrecord—while Muller and Rohde found a 62-million-year cycle. This appears to becaused by geometric forces in the galaxy, as we said. How could the simplepresence of a higher frequency of galactic energy affect DNA? As we said inchapter 10, Dr. Peter Gariaev was able to completely transform a frog embryointo a salamander embryo, causing a complete, fast-processing mutation, withoutconventional gene splicing of any kind . . . using nothing more than a laserbeam. In Gariaev’s experiment, all that was required to transform DNA was asufficient source of energy—in this case a laser light. Now, in our entire solarsystem, a similarly great source of energy appears to be streaming in from thegalaxy’s own natural energy fields. It may be actively transforming earth, thesun, the planets and their moons. Since we are living on the earth, we mightalso be feeling the effects of this transformation—through a transformation ofconsciousness as well as biology and physical matter. Dr. John Hawks revealedgenetic proof that human evolution is now moving 100 times faster than it wasfive thousand years ago, with fully 7 percent of our genetic material havingtransformed during this time—and the rate is continually accelerating.166[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en963]THE NINEVEH CONSTANTI’ve saved the best for last. Maurice Chatelain, the director of communicationsfor NASA’s Apollo program while working for North American, a major defense andaerospace contractor, published some incredible cycle research in his classicbook Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space. What do you get when you mix together240 cycles of the 25,920-year precession? And who might have known about it?Chatelain studied the Sumerian clay tablets, which were apparently written in700 B.C., and described events that took place three thousand years before theywere imprinted. The Sumerian tablets were first translated in 1872 by GeorgeSmith, a young English Assyriologist. Chatelain explained how he found atremendous new cycle on these same tablets.Among the tablets translated by Smith was a certain quantity that containednothing but numbers, fantastically huge numbers, apparently derived from verycomplicated calculations. . . . The translation into our decimal system wasfinally published a few years ago, and one number stood out. It consisted offifteen digits: 195,955,200,000,000. . . . Many specialists in differentcountries tried to find out what this fantastic number could have meant threethousand years ago to the Assyrians, who were not known to be greatmathematicians or astronomers. It seemed that [Assyrian king] Assurbanipal musthave found this number somewhere, probably in Egypt, or Chaldea, or even inPersia.I personally discovered the existence of the number in 1955, when I had justarrived in California. . . . Then in 1963 in Paris, when I was told about thecalendar of the Mayas, who also calculated with enormously high numbers, Iremembered this number from Nineveh, and began suspecting that it could somehowprove there was a tie between the Assyrian and the Maya civilizations. At thattime I made some calculations, which showed that the Nineveh number could alsobe expressed as 70 multiplied seven times by 60. Then one day I remembered thatthe Sumerians . . . used calculations based on multiples of sixty, more thanthree thousand years ago. We still do not know for sure who the Sumerians wereand where they came from, but we have found out that they were truly greatastronomers who knew the revolution periods of all the planets of the solarsystem, including Uranus and Neptune. They were the ones who divided the day of86,400 seconds into 24 hours of 60 minutes with 60 seconds each.Immediately, the realization came to me that the number of Nineveh representedthe value of a very, very long period of time . . . expressed in seconds. It didnot take long to calculate that the number of Nineveh with its fifteen digitswas equal to [exactly] 2,268 million days of 86,400 seconds each. That was agood start, but did not answer the main question—what did this huge time span ofmore than 6 million years [about 6.2 million, to be exact] stand for?167[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en964]Did you catch that? The Sumerian cycle is 6.2 million years long. Ten of thosecycles are 62 million years long—which is exactly the length of time Muller andRohde discovered as a cycle of sudden species evolution in the fossil record.Now we may be seeing yet additional information suggesting that the ancientsknew about these cycles—even on a galactic level. I was truly astonished when Ifirst realized how this Sumerian cycle fit in with the evolution we see withinthe fossil record. It really does demonstrate how knowledgeable our ancientancestors were—and how much of a story there is behind the 2012 prophecies.Let’s continue with Chatelain, as this isn’t even half of what he discoveredwith this cycle.[This 6.2-million-year cycle] was certainly longer than the age of man on earth.Then the thought flashed in my mind that the clever Sumerians were familiarwith, among other things astronomical, the precession of the equinoxes.168[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en965]When I first read this part in 1993, I didn’t understand what the precessionwas, and I found it all highly frustrating. But now I know. And it is veryexciting.This movement [of the precession] has a cycle of about 26,000 years, or 9.450million days of 86,400 seconds each. When I divided the Nineveh number by thecycle of the precession of the equinoxes, also called the Big Year, I had thegreatest surprise of my life. The sacred number of Nineveh divided exactly into240 Big Years of 9.450 million days each.The Sumerians—an ancient culture—were tracking a cycle that is a directsubdivision of the 62-million-year cycle in the fossil record. This62-million-year cycle also shows up as a galactic octahedron, or cube, that oursolar system see-saws through as we travel along. Better yet, this same Sumeriancycle—one-tenth of the 62-million-year fossil cycle—can directly subdivide intothe precession of the equinoxes by a factor of 240. Knock off the zero and youhave twenty-four, which is two times twelve—and we’ve already seen how prevalenttwelve-sided geometry is. We may now have a unified model that directly linksthe precession to the 62-million-year evolution cycle.How did the Sumerians figure this out? And let’s not forget that this number wasexpressed not in years, not in months, not in weeks, not in days, not in hours,not in minutes, but in seconds. The complexity is astonishing, and yet it allfits together. And that’s just the beginning of all the goodies that are hidingin this cycle.THE GREAT CONSTANT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMChatelain had done enough research to know that the ancients were after a holygrail of their own—the true Master Number that all other cycles, including everyorbit of every planet, were being driven by.Then came my conclusion that this enormous number of Nineveh could very well bethe long-lost magic number called the “Great Constant of the solar system,” thenumber that alchemists, astrologers, and astronomers had been looking for for avery long time, while their ancestors were familiar with it more than 3,000years ago. . . .169 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en966]Now he sets up the rules for how this Great Constant works.If the number of Nineveh really was the Great Constant of the solar system, ithad to be an exact multiple of any revolution or conjunction period of anyplanet, comet, or satellite of the solar system. It took some time to do thiswork and lots of numbers, but just as I had thought and expected, every periodof revolution or conjunction of all the solar system bodies calculated by theConstant of Nineveh corresponded exactly, down to several decimal points, withthe values given in the modern tables of United States astronomers—and nearly sowith the French tables, which give slightly different numbers for the planetsUranus, Neptune and Pluto.I have not been able to find even a single period of revolution or conjunctionof a solar system planet or satellite that would not be an exact fraction, downto the fourth decimal point, of the Great Constant of the solar system. For methat is a sufficient proof that the Nineveh Constant is a true solar constant,and has full validity today—as it had when it was calculated many thousands ofyears ago.170 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en967]Even Pluto, way out at the far edge of the solar system, moving so slowly, fitsthis cycle perfectly with only a very small tweak.The sidereal year of Pluto has been estimated by American astronomers to be90,727 solar days. But sometimes, as in the case of the comet Kohoutek in 1975,astronomers too make some mistakes. Since its discovery, Pluto has made onlyabout one fifth of its voyage around the sun, so a slight mistake inobservations is possible. A negligible error of only seven days in thecalculated long year of Pluto would be perfectly excusable. So let’s supposethat the true year of Pluto is, in reality, 90,720 solar days. Now the Constantof Nineveh represents exactly 25,000 revolutions of Pluto—and this can be nomore a coincidence than the fact that it also represents exactly 240 cycles ofprecession of the equinoxes.171 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en968]TYING IT ALL TOGETHERPluto goes through 25,000 cycles every time this 6.2-million-year NinevehConstant happens. Four of these Nineveh cycles add up to 24.8 million years,which seems close to Raup and Sepkoski’s 25-to-26-million-year cycle in thefossil record. Forty of these Nineveh cycles harmonize with the 250-million-yearorbit of the galaxy, if the exact value is 248 million years. It really doesseem that everything fits. The Maya calendar may have used the 260-day tzolkinas a much smaller version of this master cycle to serve a similar purpose.Elsewhere in the same book, Chatelain gives stunning proof that the ancient Mayacivilization also had a number that allows us to calculate the Great Constant ofthe solar system.172 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en969] The Mayacalendar cycles have therefore been clearly correlated with geometric phenomenathat begin at the quantum level, extend through into the behavior of the earthand the rotation of its dodecahedron-shaped core, move on through therelationships of the solar system, and now appear to extend through the entiregalaxy. These geometries create coherence, and since they are structures intime, they may allow for seemingly enormous blocks of time to be traversedinstantaneously—and allows dinosaurs to appear in the present-day earth. Thisalso suggests that when we finally move into a new sphere of galactic energy,many more portals of time will open up to us. The transformations in the solarsystem, as well as the enigmas of rapidly increasing human evolution, suggestthat major changes are under way.Were the American founding fathers quoting an accurate prophecy when theyreferred us to the Sibylline mystery texts from Virgil’s FourthEclogue—predicting a Golden Age in which “heroes and gods comingle” and we allgain these supernatural abilities, so that “the Golden One shall arise again inthe whole earth?” Are we being led through a galactic evolution, and have notyet seen the full extent of who and what we will become? I will now share a bitmore of the ancient traditions with you and let you decide for yourself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENNot Just a Golden AgeThroughout this book, we’ve been trying to discover whether the 2012 propheciesof a Golden Age are genuine—and we’ve come up with a very clear case for DNA andconsciousness evolution, as well as the possibility that some sort ofdimensional shift may be going on as well. So let’s finish our quest tounderstand the legends of a Golden Age. If we want to know how the tradition gotstarted in Western culture, we need to go back to the oldest literature in theWestern world that described it—the classical literature of Greek and Romantimes—and search for clues to reveal the even more archaic roots of these GoldenAge prophecies.In 1952, H. C. Baldry wrote “Who Invented the Golden Age?” for the ClassicalQuarterly journal—a truly heavy-duty piece of scholarship, showing completefluency in multiple languages, often without even offering any translations. Youhave to be a major scholar to get through this paper without the help of atranslator, including the ability to read the Greek alphabet and language. Amidall this intellectual chest-thumping, Baldry gives a remarkably thoroughanalysis of how the idea of a Golden Age came into being.There are many passages in ancient literature which depict an imaginaryexistence different from the hardships of real life—an existence blessed withNature’s bounty, untroubled by strife or want. Naturally this happy state isalways placed somewhere or sometime outside normal human experience, whether offthe map in some remote quarter of the world, or in Elysium after death, or inthe dim future or the distant past. Such an imaginary time of bliss in the pastor the future has become known as the golden age. . . .[We know that] (i) the picture of a happy existence remote from ordinary life .. . came from sources earlier than any extant classical literature; (ii) thistraditional picture was normally known in antiquity before the Roman Empire asthe age of Kronos [Time] or Saturnus; [and] (iii) gold and the use of gold hadno place in the traditional picture. . . . When first mentioned in [Hesiod’s]Works and Days (42-46) it is not explained, but briefly alluded to as the statewhich men would now enjoy if the gods had not hidden the means of life fromthem. . . .1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en970]Hesiod is believed to have lived around 800 B.C.—and this is a particularlyfascinating quote. It implies that we, as humans, once lived in a state that wasfar better than what we experience now. Baldry’s research is implying thatduring the Golden Age—the age of Time—we experience a state of being that hasnow been “hidden from us” by the gods. Bear in mind that since this is amythological retelling of ancient information, in this case the gods mayrepresent nothing more than natural cycles of earth, Sun and galaxy that affectour state of being and our level of evolution.References in later literature show an even greater variety of belief about thetime and place of the happier life—a variety which cannot be traced back toHesiod or any other single source, but suggests an old and widespread traditionhandled at different times and places, and by different authors, in manydifferent ways. . . . Further confirmation may be sought in the variousparallels contained in Eastern literature, notably the Indo-Iranian myth inwhich Yima of the [Zoroastrian] Avesta and Yama of the [Hindu] Vedas must havehad their common source—the story of a past age of happiness under a ruler who,when it ended, became lord of a Paradise inhabited by the souls of the blessed.. . . 2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en971]The Golden Age represented a “Paradise inhabited by the souls of the blessed.”Baldry mentions a common source that we can trace all the Golden Age propheciesback to—namely the primordial “Indo-Iranian myth” which gave rise to bothZoroastrianism and Hinduism. Both religions appear to be talking about the samehero-king, the name slightly changed depending on which religion you look at.His name was Yima in Zoroastrianism and Yama in the Vedas.ZOROASTRIANISMWe’ve already gotten a good look at the Hindu legends of the Golden Age in PartOne, but we haven’t explored Zoroastrianism at all. The TraditionalZoroastrianism Web site features an extremely comprehensive collection ofresearch articles on the subject, and in “History of the Ancient Aryans” byPorus Homi Havewala,3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en972] we find outmore about this primordial Indo-Iranian civilization that later (probably muchlater) splintered off into Zoroastrianism and Hinduism:All the ancient Zoroastrian scriptures speak of an earlier homeland from whereour people came, the lost “Airyane Vaejahi” or seedland of the Aryans. From thishomeland, the Indo-Europeans or Aryans moved to upper India, Iran, Russia andthe nations of Europe such as Greece, Italy, Germany, France, Scandinavia,England, Scotland and Ireland. . . . The “Vendidad” is one of the ancientscriptures of the Zoroastrians. . . . In the first “Fargad” or chapter, theGolden Age of the ancient Aryans is outlined with their greatest king, “YimaKshaeta” (Yam Raj in the Indian Vedas), who banished old age and death.Then, the ice age broke on the ancient home, and the Aryans were forced tomigrate southward, to the southeast and the southwest. Mr. Bal Gangadhar Tilak,a great Brahmin (Indian Aryan) scholar of India in the last century, studied theVedas and the Vendidad to find an ancient homeland of the Aryans. The Vedas arescriptures written by the Indo-Europeans or Aryans after they migrated to India.From the descriptions of the weather patterns mentioned in the Vedas, Tilakconcluded that the ancient home must be in the Arctic regions, i.e., abovepresent Russia. The Aryans migrated from the ancient home to Iran, and fromthere to India and Greece and Europe. Tilak also said that the most ancienthistorical scripture was the Iranian Vendidad, which actually describes theancient homeland of the Aryans. . . .4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en973]The great nineteenth-century Indian scholar Bal Gangadhar Tilak concluded thatthe Zoroastrian Vendidad was the “most ancient historical scripture” in theworld. The name Zoroaster is actually a Greek pronunciation of “Zarathushtra,”so both names refer to the same man. Zarathushtra allegedly made contact withAhura Mazda, the Zoroastrian equivalent of God—but according to the Vendidad,this was only a more recent reconnection.Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: “O Ahura Mazda, righteous Creator of thecorporeal world, who was the first person to whom You taught these teachings?”Then spoke Ahura Mazda: “YIMA the splendid, who watched over his subjects, Orighteous Zarathushtra. I first did teach the Aryan religion to him, prior toyou.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en974]The author then describes the prior Golden Age in which “there be neither coldwind nor hot wind (neither extreme winter or summer), [and] there be no sicknessnor death,” in which people are “undying and unwanting, and gloriously happy.”We then have a very interesting statement about time: “In the first 1,000 yearsof his rule, Yima the splendid enjoined righteous order on his Aryan subjects.He controlled invisible time itself, making it so much large in size so as topraise and spread the righteous law.”6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en975] It is very interesting to speculateon what was meant by controlling “invisible time itself.” Given what we nowknow, this carries much more potential impact than most people may realize.Graham Hancock points out similar statements from Egyptian texts in hisintroduction to this book—that life is maintained by the “progress and movementof time”—and these words now sound very cutting-edge.As the Vendidad continues, we have what appears to be a very clear descriptionof the coming of the last major Ice Age.That glorious age of the Aryans did not last for ever, O Zarathushtra. It wastime for the evil one’s attack. I Who am Ahura Mazda spoke then to Yima Kshaeta:“O splendid Yima, toward the sacred Aryan land will rush evil as a severe fatalwinter; evil will rush as thick snow flakes falling in increased depth. From thethree directions will wild and ferocious animals attack, arriving from the mostdreadful sites. Before this winter, any snow that fell would melt and convey thewater away. Now the snow will not melt (but will form the Polar ice cap) . . .Now, there will be no footprints discernible at all on the packed sheets of hardice that will form.”7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en976]Hence, the ancient Aryan civilization appears to have originated in what is nowthe frozen wasteland of northern Russia—prior to the coming of the last greatIce Age. Given all the work of Graham Hancock and others, we can safelyassociate this with the time of the purported civilization of Atlantis.BOYCE AND GRENET’S PIONEERING RESEARCHAs soon as I read this, I wanted to know as much about the ancient propheciesinherited by Zoroaster as I could. This may be as close as we can get, in ourown historical record, to the original teachings about what 2012 and the GoldenAge really means. This brings us to Mary Boyce and Frantz Grenet’s epicscholarly work from 1991, A History of Zoroastrianism, Volume Three:Zoroastrianism Under Macedonian and Roman Rule.8[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en977]In it, considered among scholars tobe the defining standard of all research into Zoroastrianism, we find out thatsome of the literary, archeological and numismatic (coin) evidence used to paintthe picture of Zoroastrianism has only recently come to light. What I findinteresting about this book is that the original Zoroastrian concepts about theend of the age do not have the apocalyptic quality that many other propheciesdo.Zoroaster did not espouse the idea of human beings levitating up into theheavens and disappearing.[Zoroaster’s] future expectations were fixed upon this loved and familiar earth.It is on it, restored to its original perfection, that the kingdom of AhuraMazda is to come; and the blessed are to live here eternally in his presence,solid flesh on solid ground. . . . It was an end of history that he foretold,not an end of the world.9 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en978]On page 382, we get more detail about how this transition into the Golden Age isexpected to take place. Namely, we see a “progressive weakening” of evil thanksto the hard work of many people in exposing the truth.Prophecies of woes and iniquities in the last age are alien to orthodoxZoroastrianism, for Zoroaster’s fundamental message was that the triumph ofgoodness would come when evil had been progressively weakened through theconcerted efforts of the just. . . . [H]uman virtues, such as justice, faith,liberality, joyfulness, will then be increasing throughout the world, and vicessuch as tyranny, enmity, heresy and injustice will dwindle away. . . .10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en979]Zoroaster “perceived the salvation of the world as dependent both on cosmicstriving and on the sum of individual human choices; and these two conjoinedaspects of his teachings—emphasis on individual responsibility and concern forthe whole cosmos—made his doctrines strikingly relevant to the conditions andproblems of the Hellenistic age.”11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en980]Of course, the Hellenistic age inherited these teachings, as did all otherreligions. That’s one of the points that Boyce and Grenet make so effectively.Everything traces back to the original seed of information and insight—and itappears that Zoroaster is the farthest back in time, and therefore the closestto the original essence of it.Very interesting context about the true nature of evil was revealed on page 443:“Zoroastrianism taught that Ahura Mazda’s rule over earth in the beginning hadbeen deliberately brief, since he wished for the invasion of his Adversary, theEvil Spirit, so that he might defeat and annihilate him.”12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en981] This, of course, suggests that thereal purpose of the negative forces are simply to help us evolve inconsciousness; but they were never intended to win—and never can win. They canonly adapt to the basic nature of the Universe itself, which is loving kindness.FRASO-KERERTIOn pages 427–428, we find out that time itself is expected to change—bybasically ceasing to exist as we now know it—once the Golden Age has arrived.This passage also speaks of a “Great Judgment,” which could obviously bedisturbing to many people—and this may already represent how the originalteachings were starting to get watered down and altered. Based on many otherprophetic sources I have encountered, it appears that all this judgment reallymeans is that we will be given a choice of whether we wish to continuereincarnating, and learning the same lessons, or move into a state where we canpass through space-time and time-space with equal effectiveness—basically in anAscended form. If we don’t decide to take the “Great Invitation,” we’re notpunished—we live our lives, pass away when it is normal and right, and continuemoving through the growth opportunities that future lives in a physical body cangive us.This passage is taken out of 2 Enoch in the old Zoroastrian scriptures.Before everything was, before all creation came to pass, the Lord establishedthe Aion of Creation. Thereafter He created all His creation, the visible andthe invisible. After all that He created man in His image. . . . Then for thesake of man, the Lord caused the Aion to come forth, and divided it into timesand hours. . . . When all the creation that was created by the Lord will come toan end, and every man will go to the Great Judgment of the Lord, then the timeswill perish: there will not be any more years, or months or days, the hours willnot be counted anymore, but the Aion will be one. And all the righteous thatwill escape the Great Judgment of the Lord will join the great Aion, and at thesame time the Aion will join the righteous, and they will be eternal. . . . 13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en982]This all sounds very much like a blending together of space-time andtime-space—so we can function in both worlds at the same time. Boyce and Grenetgive valuable context from other sources about the same thing on pages 444–445.In another passage (I Corinthians 7:29, 31) Paul, believing that “the appointedtime has grown very short,” declared that “the form of this world is passingaway.” Some centuries later Augustine . . . saw this change of the world’s“form.” . . . The cosmos, too, is to pass out of time into eternity, [and] is toshare, according to its capacity, in the eternity of the immutable Truth. . . .In the final consummation of all things, therefore, time will be no more; allwill be eternal—God, man, the world.” This teaching, found by Augustine in Paul,has been characterized as remarkable; but it is in fact what had been taught byZoroaster, and believed by his followers down the ages.14[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en983]On pages 365–366, we hear about how we will have a “future body” that is a“return to perfection.”Among Zoroaster’s eschatological ideas was his teaching about the “future body,”that at the Last Day the bones of the dead will be clothed again in flesh andreanimated by the soul (which has been existing apart, in heaven, hell or limbo,according to the individual judgment passed on it at death). . . . According tohim, each created thing, animate or inanimate, possesses its own indwellingforce or spirit; and Ahura Mazda created these spirits first and then clothedthem in material forms . . . at the end of time there will be a return to thatperfection, with the blessed entering into the kingdom of Ahura Mazda in theideal form of a just soul clad in an unblemished body, made immortal andundecaying.15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en984]Bear in mind this is not talking about a single Messianic figure—this is sayingthat “the blessed” will achieve this feat. This could be many different people.Boyce and Grenet carefully trace how the difficulties of Roman and Macedonianrule affected Zoroastrian prophecies as well—causing later writers to adopt muchmore of a doom-and-gloom approach, which then seeded into all other Westernreligions. Nonetheless, what we see in the oldest, least-disturbed accounts isof a world that is transformed—in which time as we know it has come to an end,but not in a cataclysmic fashion. Evil is exposed and dwindles away, andhumanity on earth appears to have transformed into an “unblemished body, madeimmortal and undecaying.”THE GOLDEN RACEGetting back to the intense, multilingual scholarship of Baldry on the Romanwritings about the Golden Age, he concludes that the Roman poets mistranslatedthe words saecula and aetas as both meaning “age”—but in fact, saecula may meaneither “race” or “age,” and aetas should be translated as “race.”Now it all comes together. Everyone thinks the classical prophecies are talkingabout a Golden Age—and that’s definitely a part of it—but that’s also amistranslation. The Zoroastrian prophecy of immortality in an ideal andunblemished body made its way into Greek thought as a Golden Race—but this wasthen mistranslated by the Romans into the idea of a Golden Age—withoutnecessarily describing what would happen to us once we get there. The last wordin “Novus Ordo Seclorum” is derived from saecula as well—so this directlyrelates to the Sibylline prophecies, giving them even greater context—as well asthe Great Seal of the United States.It is extremely important to mention that this Golden Race is not some weird andsick Hitlerian vision of a bunch of blond-haired, blue-eyed wunderkinder, orNietzschean overmen, that everyone else must die off in order to make room for.Just like the Cayce Readings said about the “Fifth Root Race,” this Golden Racemay well be everyone on earth, within a finite period of time—not just aparticular nationality or skin color. As we just learned, Zoroaster called itthe “Future Body.” Let’s pick up with Baldry again to learn more about thisso-called Golden Race:Gold played no part in the generally accepted picture of those whom Hesiodcalled the golden race. . . . These Greek authors, like Hesiod, all refer to agolden race. It is only in Latin poetry that this is sometimes replaced by agolden age. . . . Gold, far from having a place in the traditional picture, wasseen as one of the causes of degeneration from that happy state. . . . It wasRoman writers who made the transition from a golden race to a golden age, andfrom them the concept was handed down into more modern literature.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en985]This really blew my mind. The coming of the Age of Aquarius, surrounding theyear 2012, is the repetition of a cycle that has already occurred before—a cyclein which everyone on earth apparently had mystical abilities much greater thanwhat most of us now possess, leading them to have perpetual bounty and a life“untroubled by strife or want . . . a Paradise inhabited by the souls of theblessed.” The pursuit of gold was seen as “one of the causes of degenerationfrom that happy state.” Unfortunately, our current scientific models arewoefully insufficient to explain how something like this could be possible—butthat doesn’t mean it couldn’t actually happen.APOTHEOSIS IN 2012The Sibylline prophecies speak of a coming Golden Age in the Zoroastriantradition, and clearly state that this will be a time where “the Golden Oneshall arise again in the whole earth”—meaning everyone who is here.Intriguingly, there are thirteen courses on the pyramid in the Great Seal of theUnited States, and the year 1776 is inscribed at the bottom. During the time theSpanish conquerors came to Mesoamerica, the natives were using a thirteen-katunsystem to count time that they called U Kahlay Katunob, which adds up to about256 years.17 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en986] A katun is 7,200 days,or less than 20 years. The time of the founding of the United States occurred asthe Maya calendar shifted to a new katun, and this may have been intentional.056 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_056_r1.gif]The pyramid in the Great Seal of the United States may reveal a time-encodedprophecy that 13 Maya katuns of 19.7 years would pass, beginning in the 1756 to1776 cycle, before the Golden Age was believed to begin in 2012.If you add 256 years to 1776, you get 2032—but if you count the first course ofthe pyramid on the Seal as 1754 to 1776, then the top course of the pyramidwould end in 2012—as Raymond Mardyks originally suggested and other authors thenco-opted. The Eye would then appear in the final twenty-year katun between 2012and 2032, as the pineal gland opens. The phoenix symbolism, as we now know, isdirectly associated with the ability to travel through time-space—and it alsorefers to the transformation of the earth.Furthermore, in the very top of the U.S. Capitol dome in Washington, D.C., onthe inside, there is a painting called The Apotheosis of Washington, where he isportrayed on a rainbow—indicating he has transformed himself into a divinestate, which is also known as Apotheosis. 18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en987]057 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_057_r1.gif]The Apotheosis of Washington appears in the domed ceiling of the U.S. Capitol.This is a cropping of the original image from the Architect of the Capitol.This image is surrounded by a ring of seventy-two five-pointed stars. WilliamHenry and Dr. Mark Gray point out that this adds up to a total of 360 starpoints, and if we multiply the number of star points by the number of stars, weget 25,920—again suggesting the American founding fathers were well aware of theprecession, and the prophecies of what it might do for humanity.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en988] Every other star in this ring has apinecone pointing at it from the outside.058 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_058_r1.jpg]Apotheosis means “Man becomes God.” Washington is portrayed as living among thegods and goddesses of antiquity and sealed on a rainbow—which may indicate abelief he had reached an “Ascended” state called the Rainbow Body.The Capitol dome may also be intended to resemble the shape of the pineal gland,similar to the Masonic symbol of the beehive—where “only the bees inside areaware of the inner activities of the lodge/hive.”20[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en989]If you look farther down within the Capitol dome, you see a frieze along theinside wall that shows the moment Cortès conquered the Aztecs. The Azteccalendar—which ends in 2012—is clearly pictured behind Montezuma, and we alsosee the image of a serpent curled around a jar of fire, which may againsymbolize the pineal gland.21 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en990]059 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_059_r1.jpg]This frieze also appears in the Capitol dome. It depicts Cortès’s initialmeeting with Montezuma. The Aztec calendar is prominently pictured—and it endsin 2012.Regardless of the lies and corruption now so obviously displayed by variousworld governments, I do feel there is an underlying positive tradition theyinherited. The meanings may have long since been lost, or confused with other,more recent teachings, but it does seem that America was secretly founded tohelp fulfill these ancient prophecies. In no way do I believe the elites aregoing to be able to create a new world order in which everyone will go alongwith some sort of world dictatorship. The very essence of the science andprophecies we’ve detailed in this book show that the change we are going throughis woven directly into our DNA. No government can stage-manage or control thisprocess. The United States may have been intended to help pave the way for thistransformation, such as by creating a system of laws that encourage freedom ofthe press, freedom of religion and freedom from tyranny—but ultimately it is thegalaxy, the Sun and earth itself that are directing this evolutionary process,as well as various relatives we appear to have.THE RAINBOW BODYCould humanity be prepared to move into a “light body” of some kind, as themystical prophecies of Zoroaster, the founding fathers of America and othersseem to have suggested? William Henry and Dr. Mark Gray reveal the widespreadprevalence of light-body references in numerous ancient traditions—where thehuman body is transfigured into a new form.In Sufism it is called “the most sacred body” and the “supracelestial body.”Taoists call it “the diamond body,” and those who have attained it are called“the immortals” and “the cloudwalkers.” Yogic schools and Tantrics call it “thedivine body.” In Kriya yoga it is called “the body of bliss.” In Vedanta it iscalled “the superconductive body.” The ancient Egyptians called it “the luminousbody or being” (akh) or the karast. This conception evolved into Gnosticism,where it is called “the radiant body.” In the Mithraic liturgy it was called“the perfect body.”. . . In the Hermetic Corpus, it is called “the immortalbody.” In the alchemical tradition, the Emerald Tablet calls it “the goldenbody.”22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en991]Tibetan Buddhism has ongoing reports of the “Rainbow Body” to this very day—inwhich people transform their physical bodies into a new, rainbow-coloredenergetic form after many years of practice. In many cases, they would completethis process of transformation by meditating in a cave. When they come out, andare ready to graduate to this next level of their own evolution, they will oftenpush their hand or foot directly into the stone. They can now easily flip thestone molecules into time-space, and leave an impression behind—and some ofthese handprints and footprints have been photographed and published online.23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en992] There are fully 160,000 documentedcases of the Rainbow Body in Tibet and India alone.Kathok monastery in eastern Kham in Sichuan Province, China, has recordsindicating that over 100,000 within the Kathok lineage achieved this state sinceits founding in the twelfth century, while nearby Dzogchen monastery had 60,000lineage holders reach such a state since the monastery was established in theseventeenth century. Both monasteries are of the Nyingma Sect.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en993]060 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_060_r1.jpg]This is one of many depictions of the Rainbow Body from Tibet. More than 160,000documented cases of the Rainbow Body have occurred in Tibet and India alone.I first heard about this when I read Dream Yoga and the Practice of NaturalLight by Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. Here’s a particularly good description of theprocess.Body of Light: Tibetan, ja-lus. Also known as the “rainbow body.” Certainrealized beings . . . achieve the transformation of their ordinary bodies into aBody of Light. . . . In this process the physical body dissolves into itsnatural state, which is that of Clear Light. As the elements of the body arepurified, they transform from their gross manifestation (body, flesh, bone,etc.) into their pure essence as the five colors: blue, green, white, red andgolden yellow. As the body dissolves into these five colors a rainbow is formed,and all that remains of the physical body are fingernails and hair.Twentieth-century practitioners of Dzogchen who have attained the Body of Lightinclude the teachers and family members of Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche—for example,his uncle Urgyen Danzin (Togden), his two teachers Changchub Dorje and AyuKhandro, and Changchub Dorje’s master, Nyala Pema Dendul.25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en994]As reported in 2002, David Steindl-Rast, a Benedictine monk, proposed ascientific investigation of the Rainbow Body phenomenon with the Institute ofNoetic Sciences—and got an enthusiastic approval. Steindl-Rast explains theeffect it would have if this phenomenon were studied and widely acknowledged asgenuine.If we can establish as an anthropological fact that what is described in theresurrection of Jesus has not only happened to others, but is happening today,it would put our view of human potential in a completely different light.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en995]Steindl-Rast then contacted Father Francis Tiso, an ordained Catholic priest whofrequently visited Tibet, and encouraged him to explore recent cases of RainbowBody and document his findings. Tiso explored the case of Khenpo A-chos, aGelugpa monk from Kham, Tibet, who died in 1998. Tiso located the village wherehe died, and recorded multiple interviews with eyewitnesses to Khenpo A-chos’sdeath. The witnesses said Khenpo A-chos had a warm, spiritual nature thattouched everyone he met.This was a very interesting man, aside from the way he died. . . . Everyonementioned his faithfulness to his vows, his purity of life, and how he oftenspoke of the importance of cultivating compassion. He had the ability to teacheven the roughest and toughest of types how to be a little gentler, a littlemore mindful. To be in the man’s presence changed people.27[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en996]The witnesses reported a rainbow appearing over Khenpo A-chos’s hut a few daysbefore he died, and that “dozens of rainbows” appeared in the sky afterward. Hewas not sick and nothing appeared to be wrong with him—he simply chanted amantra.According to the eyewitnesses, after his breath stopped his flesh became kind ofpinkish. One person said it turned brilliant white. All said it started toshine. Lama A-chos suggested wrapping his friend’s body in a yellow robe, thetype all Gelug monks wear. As the days passed, they maintained they could see,through the robe, that his bones and his body were shrinking. They also heardbeautiful, mysterious music coming from the sky, and they smelled perfume. Afterseven days, they removed the yellow cloth, and no body remained. Lama Norta anda few other individuals claimed that after his death Khenpo A-chos appeared tothem in visions and dreams . . . Lama A-chos told Tiso that it takes sixty yearsof intensive practice to achieve the rainbow body. “Whether it always takes thatlong, I don’t know,” acknowledges Tiso, “but we would like to be able toincorporate, in a respectful way, some of these practices into our own Westernphilosophical and religious traditions.” . . . To our knowledge, says Tiso, thebodies of most Christian saints did not disappear or shrink after their deaths.. . . However, he adds, bodily ascensions are mentioned in the Bible and othertraditional texts for Enoch, Mary, Elijah, and possibly Moses. And there arenumerous stories of saints materializing after their death, similar to thewidespread phenomenon known as the “light-body.” 28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en997]DIVINE SYNTHESISGiven all that we have learned, how can we analyze and hope to understand suchan incredible series of prophecies scientifically? Clearly there is a wealth ofevidence suggesting that the ancients were absolutely convinced that majorevents would be heading our way as we go through the shift into the Age ofAquarius. We’ve seen proof that the Maya calendar corresponds to real cycles inthe solar system that may well be driven by the galaxy—cycles that are nowcausing us to experience interplanetary climate change as we head into the Ageof Aquarius. We’ve seen many ancient prophecies describing the coming of aGolden Age, where humans would again be as gods. This obviously shows us muchmore is at work than just a major catastrophe, as so many 2012 scholars haveconcluded. In fact, I firmly believe these disaster prophecies are amisunderstanding, and we’re already seeing the worst of the Earth Changes rightnow. We appear to be in safe hands—guided through an evolutionary process byforces much greater than most of us could ever comprehend.All these ancient traditions suggest that humanity is undergoing some type ofevolutionary event. The Tibetan Rainbow Body observations give strong support toBiblical prophecies suggesting that we may transform into some sort of energeticbody—the Perfected Body. Hence the American founding fathers and others oftencalled themselves the “Perfectibilists.”Obviously there is no way to know if we will transform into a light body of somesort—but we do now know we are going through a rapid phase of evolution, on adirect, biological level. Our civilization has grown by leaps and bounds withinthe last few hundred years, and it appears that greater forces are atwork—forces that the ancients may have known much more about than we do now. Onething is for certain: The old models of a human body as a random geneticaccident that only showed up on earth by Darwinian mutations must be thrown out.In fact, we have suffered under a variety of illusions about who and what we arethat have kept us trapped in a prison of materialistic thought. Our bodies growout of, and are nurtured by, a hidden energy field unknown to the Westernmainstream scientific community. This field ultimately unifies all of ourthoughts together as One—in directly measurable, provable ways. With thisknowledge come powerful new tools that help us evolve as conscious beings. Wegain remarkable new methods to heal ourselves and expand our own evolution in aremarkably short time. We have clearly shown how the ancient stone relics of alost Golden Age point toward the elaborate, technological use of these energyfields. The year 2012 may represent a time when we begin to collectivelyrediscover this lost science—and start using it to heal ourselves and ourplanet.There are certain intriguing Bible quotes I’d like to share with you—as witheverything else we’ve shared as context, they become quite interesting toconsider. These quotes may have been inspired by the same tradition ofFraso-kererti that was inherited from the Zoroastrian scriptures—and was widelybelieved to be an accurate prophecy.The First Adam was made a living soul, and the last Adam a quickening spirit.—I Corinthians 15:45 The first man is of the earth, the second man is the Lord from heaven.—I Corinthians 15:47 We shall bear the image of the heavenly. . . . I show you a mystery, we shallall be changed in the twinkling of an eye . . . the corruptible must put onincorruption, and the mortal must put on immortality.—I Corinthians 15:49–53 We look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.—2 Peter 3:13 Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: The former world shall not beremembered, nor even come into mind.—Isaiah 65:17 As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,so shall your seed and your name remain.—Isaiah 66:22 There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars [planets?];and upon the earth the distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and thewaves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thosethings which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and greatglory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift upyour heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.—Luke 21:25–28"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYDisclosureI do believe a formal, open disclosure of the ET/UFO phenomenon is an essentialaspect of our movement into a Golden Age. I have tried to avoid relying onUFO-related accounts in this book, but I do feel there is undeniable evidencethat we were visited by human-looking extraterrestrials in ancient times—andthat these visits have continued through to this very day. No discussion of theSource Field is complete without an examination of UFOs and their influence ontechnology, ancient peoples, and the 2012 prophecies.In 2009, Dr. Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Science speculated thatthere could be one hundred billion earthlike planets in our Milky Way galaxyalone. This estimate is based on the widespread prevalence of extra-solarplanets that have been discovered, leading him to assume there could be anaverage of one earthlike planet per star. He also believed they are probablyinhabited—at least by microbial life-forms.1[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en998] During this same time frame,scientists from the University at Edinburgh ran a computer simulation where theyconstructed a synthetic galaxy with billions of stars and planets. From thisdata, which included extinction events, they concluded that “at least 361intelligent civilizations have emerged in the Milky Way since its creation, andas many as 38,000 may have formed.”2[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en999]In December 2009, Discover magazine published a “controversial study” of aseries of archeological findings that began in the autumn of 1913—in a SouthAfrican town called Boskop. Two farmers dug up hominid skull fragments thatseemed “unusual.” Eventually, S. H. Haughton, a formally trained paleontologist,concluded that the Boskop skull contained a brain that was potentially 25percent larger than our own—or more.Boskop has a face that takes up only about one-fifth of his cranium size, closerto the proportions of a child. Examination of individual bones confirmed thatthe nose, cheeks, and jaw were all childlike. . . . Boskop’s brain size is about30 percent larger than our own—that is, a 1,750-cc brain to our average of 1,350cc. And that leads to an increase in the prefrontal cortex of a staggering 53percent.3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1000]The prefrontal cortex is where we process our highest cognitive functions—and,it is suspected, our intuition.With their perhaps astonishing insights, they may have become a species ofdreamers with an internal mental life literally beyond anything we can imagine.. . . In a classroom with 35 big-headed, baby-faced Boskop kids, you wouldlikely encounter five or six with IQ scores at the upper range of what has everbeen recorded in human history. They died and we lived, and we can’t answer thequestion why. Why didn’t they outthink the smaller-brained hominids likeourselves and spread across the planet? Perhaps they didn’t want to. . . .[Nonetheless,] anthropologists report that Boskop features still occasionallypop up in living populations of Bushmen, raising the possibility that the lastof the race may have walked the dusty Transvaal in the not-too-distant past.4[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1001]It’s one thing to dismiss people as “crazy” if they think they’ve encounteredbeings like this in a spaceship. It’s quite another when we find archeologicalevidence that people like this lived and died here, and Discover magazine tookit seriously enough to publish the article. Were the Boskops dangerous villains?Just the opposite, according to those they lived with.Just about 100 miles from the original Boskop discovery site, furtherexcavations were once carried out by Frederick FitzSimons. He knew what he haddiscovered and was eagerly seeking more of these skulls. At his new dig site,FitzSimons came across a remarkable piece of construction. The site had been atone time a communal living center, perhaps tens of thousands of years ago. Therewere many collected rocks, leftover bones, and some casually interred skeletonsof normal-looking humans. But to one side of the site, in a clearing, was asingle, carefully constructed tomb, built for a single occupant—perhaps the tombof a leader or of a revered wise man. His remains had been positioned to facethe rising sun. In repose, he appeared unremarkable in every regard . . . exceptfor a giant skull.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1002]Dr. Steven Greer has worked tirelessly to gather together more than 560witnesses who directly worked in classified programs where UFOs and ETs weredealt with directly. Disclosure is the term Greer and others use to describe ahypothetical moment in which the governments around the world openly revealtheir secret archives of UFO knowledge—including any retrieved technology—or mayeven give us a direct introduction to ETs themselves. We are getting closer andcloser to achieving real transparency, and governments have been increasinglysharing their formerly classified materials about these encounters. They keptthem hidden for years because they apparently feared it would trigger aworldwide epidemic of terror—but with the coming of the Golden Age, I believethe public response will be one of awe and acceptance, not chaos and panic. Allwe need is a congressional subpoena; Dr. Greer’s witnesses are prepared totestify to exactly what they know in open, public hearings in Congress. I wasfortunate enough to attend Greer’s “Closed Executive Summary Briefing” formembers of Congress and VIPs that took place on May 10, 2001—and the mood in theroom was electric. The witness who stood out the most was Sergeant CliffordStone, who allegedly worked on crash-retrieval projects. He was so traumatizedby the things he had witnessed in the line of duty that he burst into tears andalmost could not finish his presentation. Among many other intriguing datapoints, Stone revealed that he had a field manual describing fifty-sevendifferent varieties of extraterrestrial intelligent life now visiting the earth.Every one of these fifty-seven varieties was human in appearance, with onlysuperficial differences from the way we look here on earth—if any.Other members of Dr. Greer’s entourage reported direct ET interventions thatpowered down nuclear missile installations, or actively disabled missiles thatwere in flight—rendering them completely nonradioactive once they crashed to theearth. These and additional witnesses came forward in a major public conferenceat the National Press Club on September 27, 2010,6[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1003] and were given generous coveragein the mainstream media.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1004] Themilitary-industrial complex has been forced to see these power-downs as hostileacts, but another equally valid viewpoint is to see that we are being protectedfrom a nuclear holocaust by our long-lost relatives. These visitors may wellaccount for the many reports of angels and gods in a variety of ancientcultures—and we may now be on the threshold of a true Family Reunion.THE CIRCLEMAKERSOn October 20, 2009, the U.K. Telegraph reported a story where a police officersaw three men, each with blond hair and over six feet tall, taking instrumentreadings near a crop circle. The officer heard a hissing sound similar to staticelectricity, and this crackling noise seemed to run through the entirefield—while also causing the crop to gently move. He shouted at the three menbut they did not seem to be able to hear his voice. However, when he entered thefield, they all looked at him and began running.They ran faster than any man I have ever seen. I’m no slouch but they weremoving so fast. I looked away for a second and when I looked back they weregone.8 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1005]A similar case was disclosed on March 22, 2009, after the British governmentofficially released many of its UFO files. On November 20, 1989, an anonymouswoman called R.A.F. Wattisham in Suffolk to report a strange experience she hadwhile walking her dog. She saw a man wearing a light brown one-piece garment,similar to a flying suit, who had a “Scandinavian-type accent.” He asked her ifshe had heard anything about large, flattened circles appearing in wheat fields.During the course of a ten-minute conversation, the man told her he was fromanother planet that was similar to the earth, and there were others like him whohad traveled to earth and were making these formations. These visitors were herefor a friendly purpose, but “they were told not to have contact with humans forfear that they would be considered a threat.”9[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1006] Apparently he never said who toldthem not to contact us. The woman was “completely terrified”—and as she ranhome, she heard a “loud buzzing noise” behind her, and saw a large sphericalobject, glowing with orange-white light, rise straight up from behind sometrees. The R.A.F. operator said the woman spoke for about an hour—and had nodoubt that she was reporting a genuine experience.10[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1007]The Crop Circle Connector Web site has an archive of every formation that hasoccurred in England since 1978, and many others around the world as well. For anominal fee, you can explore this vast resource—and you will be stunned at thenumber of formations that reveal three-dimensional geometric patterns like theones we’ve been discussing. Although some formations are undoubtedly hoaxes, Ido feel the Circlemakers are giving us a variety of symbolic messages in theseformations that can help us transition into a Golden Age. For me, perhaps thesingle most compelling crop formation appeared on July 15, 2008, at AveburyManor in Wiltshire. This pattern appeared directly next to the northwest portionof an elaborate series of standing stones, not unlike Stonehenge, that are foundin this same area. What we see is a clear, unambiguous illustration of our solarsystem—with a large, flattened circle in the middle for the sun, surrounded by aseries of circular rings representing planetary orbits. In each of these rings,a smaller circle gives an exact position for each planet. Andreas Müller and RedCollie both independently analyzed this pattern, using astronomy software, andconcluded that the alignment depicted a particular day in our future: December21, 2012.11 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1008]061 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_061_r1.jpg]This crop circle appeared on July 15, 2008, next to the Avebury stone megaliths.It is an exact diagram of the alignment of the planets on December 21, 2012.Of course, there is no way to ever know for certain whether a particularformation is real or not. High-quality hoaxes are routinely being done. However,it is quite unlikely that the crop circles described by Agobard, some 1,200years ago, were also done by hoaxers. Nor do I think hoaxers were responsiblefor the crop formations Robert Plot diligently recorded in the 1600s. I went toEngland in August 2010 to witness this phenomenon myself, and walked throughfour different formations. The part I found the most intriguing was that each ofthe formations was written into a hillside—and you could not see the entireformation from any one spot on the ground due to the shape of the land. Thepatterns were designed to be seen from the air—it appeared that the geometry onthe ground had been slightly stretched to make it look right from the sky insome cases. On the ground it was very difficult to tell what any of theseformations actually looked like—and the real ones appear overnight.062 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_062_r1.jpg]This fractal Julia Set crop formation appeared next to Stonehenge on July 7,1996, in broad daylight. Witnesses reveal it had to have formed in fifteenminutes or less.In July 1996, a complex Julia Set pattern appeared in broad daylight, betweenfive thirty and six fifteen P.M., directly next to Stonehenge—and was made of151 circles. Flies have been found stuck to the crops as if their wings had beenmelted. Radiation levels 76 percent above normal have been observed, only tomysteriously disappear soon afterward. The growth nodes on the crop stems oftenappear to be elongated, consistent with the effects of microwaving, and theircells reveal microscopic pitholes—suggesting they were flash-heated in amicrosecond. Some plants also have a thin layer of carbon covering them. Ninetypercent of crop circles are formed over aquifers, suggesting a technology may bepulling water out of the ground to keep the crops from burning. Electricalequipment often fails inside the formations and magnetic compasses pick upunusual readings. The rate of time has been observed to change slightly within acrop circle in two different sets of experiments.12[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1009]I also highly recommend Crop Circles: A Beginner’s Guide by Hugh Manistre,13[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1010] and “Crop Circles and theirMessage” by David Pratt, which has a variety of great photographs in addition tomany unique data points.14 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1011] Inpart one of Pratt’s article we discover that the soil under crop circles is muchlooser and dryer than usual, has an increase in crystallization, and featuresunusual microscopic spheres of pure iron. In young crops where the seeds arestill forming, the seeds are stunted and do not germinate well, if atall—whereas “in mature plants with fully formed seeds, seeds often exhibit amassive increase in vigour and a growth rate up to five times that of controlseeds.”15 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1012] In part two, Prattreveals that there are many reports of balls, discs or columns of light thathave been seen over the areas where crop circles then appeared. Several dozenpeople have heard a high-pitched trilling noise before crop circles occurred.Approximately seventy people have witnessed crop circles forming right in frontof their eyes. They report that the whole process is very rapid, taking betweenten and twenty seconds—and in some, but not all cases, there appears to be avisible whirlwind in the atmosphere as it happens.One evening in July 1981, Ray Barnes witnessed a wave or line moving through theheads of a cereal crop in Wiltshire. After travelling across the field in anarc, the line dropped to the ground and radially described a 75-foot circle in aclockwise direction in a single sweep in about four seconds, accompanied by ahissing noise. The crop went down as neatly as if it had been cut by a giantflan cutter, and the plants showed absolutely no spring-back.16[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1013]Getting back to our 2012 crop circle that appeared on July 15, 2008, the farmerat Avebury was not pleased—and tried to destroy it by driving three linesthrough it with his tractor. The Circlemakers then returned, and made a seriesof modifications—including a second circle that was as big as the solar systemdiagram had been, positioned directly next to the original. This second circlewas completely hollow on the inside, but it was surrounded by a series ofstrange, small illustrations.063 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_063_r1.jpg]On July 22, 2008, this formation was heavily enhanced after the farmer drovethree lines through the original pattern. The size of the sun was dramaticallyincreased.At a conference I spoke at in 2009, Dr. Beverly Rubik pointed out that theselittle symbols all looked like various types of cell organelles. The largecircle could therefore represent a cell membrane—but now there was nothinginside of it. Although no one can be sure of its intended meaning, thissymbolism may suggest that some sort of fundamental transformation of biologicallife might begin to occur after December 21, 2012—akin to the Tibetan legends ofthe Rainbow Body. What I found even more interesting was that the Circlemakersalso widened the diameter of the Sun in the solar system glyph—all the way outto the orbit of Venus. This implies that December 21, 2012 may represent thetipping point for this profound energetic change that is already occurring inthe solar system.064 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_064_r1.jpg]In this image we clearly see the circular trench dug into the ground surroundingthe Avebury megaliths—directly above our definitive 2012 crop formation.Crop circles may also be used as reference points for time travel within theSource Field. They often appear right near the ancient vortex points andmonuments, which may serve as portals for travel through time-space to this veryday. By keeping a comprehensive log of what formations were positioned, andwhen, you could quickly scan through a large databank of different points intime. Once you see the formation you are looking for, you can then enter intothat point in time. This may dramatically simplify the process of identifying aparticular window of time you wish to visit.REVERSE-ENGINEERING THE PINEAL GLANDProject Looking Glass was a program that allegedly involved our ancientancestors reverse-engineering the pineal gland and developing it into a workingtechnology on a larger scale. The idea was to stand in front of this massivemachine that acts as a psychic amplifier—projecting your thoughts into a giantyellowish bubble with a fish-eye-lens distortion around the edges. This wouldallow you to detect potential future events before they arrive—but there arealways various probabilities and timelines of what may happen. I have spoken toa variety of insiders who claim to have worked in classified research projects,and Project Looking Glass is one of the most common things you hear them talkabout. Robert Lucien Howe claimed to have gained access to classified documentsin his government work for the U.K., and gave a description of this device,which you can read online. I do not agree with everything he says in his writtenposts, but some of his words do fit in very nicely with what others have toldme. In order to understand what he is telling us, it is important to mentionthat the insiders apparently call our energetic duplicate the transient body,and our access to the Source Field is called transience. In other posts, Howesaid the pineal gland was called a transiator within these programs.People all have a transiator sensor that tries to make our future better andlooks for things that threaten us and warns us . . . it is what we use toprotect ourselves from entropy so we can live much longer. A human with notransiator at all might only live 5 or 10 years. Sadly, most of this is in thepast because human transiators can never have more than about 5–10 watts (andoften only milliwatts) while some machines have achieved tens of kilowatts. Wecan still win here sometimes because 5 milliwatts can win against 5 kilowattsbecause of the complex rules that transience follows. . . .The machine is actually a time accelerator. It works by creating a change ofmomentum or energy of matter inside a Schrodinger box. The box is actually verysimple to make. Its heart is a very strong EM shield. It is electricallyshielded. Inside is a special box full of warm water at body temperature 35degrees Celsius. It is non-conducting and non-metallic and should have amagnetic field of-or-near zero. Finally it should have little or no soundvibration, and the machine must generally not move in any way.Extraneous pulsations of any kind will tend to stop the machine working. Theshape of the machine decides what it does in the same way that shape decides thefunction of ordinary machines. The heart of the machine, though, is that it mustsurvive into the Future. If someone breaks it in the Future, it will stopworking now. They also work better the older they are, though this wasapparently omitted from the CIA’s version.17[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1014]What Howe is calling a box has usually been described to me as a barrel, shapedlike the pineal gland, that is filled with water. This barrel is apparentlysurrounded by three rings that rotate around the barrel and create theelectromagnetic shielding effect.As various insiders described this to me in private conversations, and evenproduced illustrations of approximately what it looked like, I was quitesurprised to realize that the movie Contact featured a very similar set ofrotating rings. Carl Sagan may well have been tipped off about Looking Glass,but he never told Jim Hart there was any truth to the story. According to thesevarious testimonies, once the shielding is fully activated, the water inside thebarrel creates a direct gateway into time-space. One form of this technology is“Looking Glass,” as we’ve been describing it, where you only get to look atthese locations from afar. Another version of this technology is code-named “theArk”—and this forms an actual stargate you can physically travel through and useto teleport from one space and time to another. Again, the whole secret to thistechnology is the shielded, electrified barrel of water in the center. It isfascinating to consider that the pineal gland may be able to create a stargatethat is powerful enough to teleport the human body through space and time—if itbecomes large enough for the entire body to fit through.065 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_065_r1.jpg]Multiple insider witnesses have revealed the existence of Project LookingGlass—a gigantic machine, built by the ancients, that reverse-engineered thepineal gland to create a means of peering through time and space.As Howe goes on explaining this, he discusses many physics concepts that soundvery similar to what we’ve been talking about in this book. Apparently thelight-speed frequency in an atom is called the Crescendo point. Ordinary matteris apparently referred to here as tardon matter, as it exists in a state whereit is actively retarded from going over light speed. The insiders’ theory alsostates that matter is in a quantum superposition where it keeps popping over thelight-speed boundary, or Crescendo point. Once it crosses that point, Howerefers to it as being in “the super-light part of its superposition.”Such machines can be very dangerous because they can emit enormous quantities ofradiation and energy without warning. This is because the space inside themachine can reach 90 percent of crescendo. “Crescendo theory” says that alltardon matter is trying to spontaneously jump to lightspeed in a special kind ofsuperposition. Matter is at “crescendo” when it has enough energy to reachlightspeed, [and] the super-light part of its superposition has lower or equalenergy than its tardon state.There are 2 routes for matter to reach crescendo: zero energy or total energy.The zero energy state works by touching energy that is already moving at thespeed of light. One of the most difficult parts of crescendo theory to grasp isthat matter can be transient (at the speed of light) while not moving (this isnot a contradiction) because crescendo matter can deform space completely on theatomic scale.The theory is part of a greater theory called “common atom” that gives space afinite strength against bending. On small scales, space is smaller and so hasless energy. At atomic scales, it becomes deformed completely. Each atom is atiny massed singularity with its own independent internal time space. An atom’suniverse only lives for a few seconds. But this doesn’t matter because its timeis static compared to ours, thanks to space-time curvature.The same theory allows photons to co-exist as real particles and waves, andgreatly simplifies Quantum Mechanics and Relativity by allowing all thedifferent theories to co-exist together. The graviton particle turns out to bephysical matter itself.If you can decode the above, you have the bare bones of about 80–90 percent ofall the military censorship ever done to physics.18[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1015]The graviton particle turns out to be physical matter itself. Photons coexist asreal particles and waves. Space can be bent and curl in on itself to form anatom—and the interior of an atom is moving at a much different time rate thanthe area outside of it. When you accelerate atoms past lightspeed, you reachcrescendo and they pop into a parallel reality. All of these concepts shouldsound very familiar by now, even though the wording may be a little different.The implications are stunning, because it means that the pineal gland may verywell function as a literal stargate once it is fully activated—based on thesesame principles—and as this stargate widens to the size of our entire body, weappear to be glowing with light. This may well be why the ancients created somany different myths, symbols and metaphors to get us investigating thissubject. Each of us already has this pineal gland technology installed in ourown bodies—and the ancient gods who visited many different cultures, worldwide,seemed very keen on teaching us how to switch it on and help create the GoldenAge. Though certain negative groups have co-opted these concepts, the vastmajority of spiritual traditions emphasize that the nature of the Universe islove—and our research into the Source Field provides strong evidence that thisis true.ET CONTACT IN MODERN-DAY INDIAThe India Daily Web site has a section called “Technology”—and well over 50percent of the articles in this section appear to be leaked from divisions ofthe Indian government itself. There appears to be a very strong effort towarddisclosure being made in these reports—unlike anything else I’ve ever seen inthe world. Naturally, since most of the writers are anonymous, and at this pointthey cannot prove their sources, most people could easily dismiss them. However,the level of technical detail in these articles—and how well it ties in withwhat we’ve been discussing in this book—is nothing short of astonishing.One article from April 29, 2006, revealed that India was originally contacted byextraterrestrials after conducting its first nuclear test in the early 1970s—andthe ETs showed up again when India performed new tests on May 11 and 13, 1998.19[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1016] India’s version of NASA is theIndian Space Research Organization, or ISRO. In 2008, India Daily revealed thatISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair is “in charge of the very secret mission ofkeeping ISRO UFO files secret, coordinated by the secretly driven U.N.efforts.”20 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1017] The article goes onto say that U.N. officials are very concerned that India may not keep thesesecrets much longer. Some areas within the ISRO are kept classified—butaccording to India Daily, not everyone is staying quiet.One [scientist] who works inside this closed area said India is just starting toreceive reverse-engineered technologies from extraterrestrial UFOs controlled byU.N. Security Council efforts. In exchange, India must keep quiet about what ithas learnt about UFOs through its space missions.21[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1018]The article goes on to say that the BJP party is known for making decisions thatsurprise the U.N.—and disclosure may be another example.Against all odds and threatening from the United States and other countries, theBJP-led Indian government went ahead with the tests of multiple nuclear bombs.This time it will reveal how the world was kept in secret about the UFOs for thelast one hundred years through a well-organized international forum of secrecy.But there is one catch. India will forfeit its chance to become the sixth memberof the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) if it goes ahead with telling the truthabout UFOs. BJP most likely will reveal the truth and then fight for India’sspot in the UNSC.22 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1019]In 2004, India Daily announced that defense research scientists and engineers inPune, the top city for this work in India, have been told they cannot tell theworld what they know from these classified projects until 2012.If you carefully keep your ears on these whispers you will realize India hastested something no one wants to talk about. It is a breakthrough inconventional physics and traditional mechanical and aeronautical engineering . .. If the whispers are right, India may be changing the world forever. But whythe magic year 2012? Why does everything have to be kept secret till then?23[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1020]India has already entered the space race—and in 2008, India Daily reported thatthey are already aware of ET bases on the moon.India may surprise the world. The surprise may come any time. The country mustreveal the existence of the underground infrastructure of UFO bases.24[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1021]A report from July 4, 2005, revealed what these alleged extraterrestrials haveapparently been telling the Indian government and military—and by now it shouldsound very familiar.Once we are in one of the parallel universes, we can view time and space thesame way we can differentiate length, height and width. The time travelers fromfuture human and alien civilizations visit us using UFOs through the network ofwormholes. . . . Traveling through the wormholes is fascinating. One can planand program time and space separately. Then you apply the entry and exit pointsof the wormhole to match the time and space reference points. One has to performthe time and space reference point calculations using higher dimensions (in aparallel universe) . . . Adjusting the entry and exit points of the wormholescan be comparatively easy once performed from a higher dimension in a paralleluniverse. It can be an extremely difficult numerical analysis problem if we tryto do it in our physical universe.25[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1022]The idea that time can be viewed “the same way we can differentiate length,height and width” is exactly what we’ve been saying throughout Part Two of thisbook. The degree of technical detail in many of these India Daily articles isstartling, and goes well beyond the space we have in this book to properlydescribe. One article says that portals can be formed by bombarding theionosphere with very high intensities of energy.26[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1023]Unless the wormholes are specially processed and manipulated, the physicalentity loses all physical attributes at the core. . . . Through the paralleluniverse, though, the entity can traverse time and space instantaneously. Thencomes the real challenge where the aliens really are way ahead of ourcivilization—they know how to transform back to physical entities in anotherwormhole, leading back to our physical universe . . . According to someresearchers, the transformation from physical to parallel universe entitieshappens automatically once the wormhole is programmed to carry an entity out toa parallel universe.Programming a wormhole is not easy. It can be programmed from the paralleluniverse easily, but from this side it will be a classical challenge in terms ofnumerical analysis. However, advancement in computational algorithms andprocessing powers will allow us to solve the complex equations and program thewormholes.27 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1024]An article from October 7, 2006, said that time can be detached from space,creating a holding zone in hyperspace that can later be attached to anotherpoint in time. “The detachment of space and time is achieved through the use ofgravitational radiation manipulation.”28[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1025] Other articles indicate thatthere are many parallel realities in time-space—and as paradoxical as this mayseem, we can actually coexist in many different locations at once.29[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1026] “Do we coexist as a separateentity when we dream? No, say experts; the same entity coexists in multiple timedimensions. This is also true when we think about someone and mentally will themto get something done.”30 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1027]HOW DO WE TRAVEL INTO THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE?On July 9, 2005, the India Daily Technology Team said the key to making thisstargate travel possible is the creation of negative mass. This appears to beexactly the same concept as what we’ve been discussing here—namely, that massconverts to negative mass as its internal movement is accelerated past the speedof light.Once the negative mass is created, all the puzzles of time travel, bending spaceand time, movement in and out of a parallel universe—all can be instantaneouslysolved. As you enter [a] black hole, if you can accelerate the process of makingyour mass negative you can easily pass through. . . . The onboard computers [ona spaceship] are able to control the mass factor from positive to negative andso on just like airplanes balance weight during takeoff, flight and landing.Once mass of the entity can be manipulated, the travel through wormholes will beeasy. This will not only enable us to travel to different time dimensions butalso into parallel universes and beyond.31[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1028]With this technology, we apparently will be able to see any potentially negativeevents in the future before they arrive, and take precautionary steps to changethe outcome.32 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1029]Also if a civilization can see the future and is able to change the future byreplacing the time axis, they will reach immortality in the terrestrial sense.That is exactly what the advanced aliens have achieved. And that is exactly whatwe will achieve in the next few hundred years.33[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1030]On July 22, 2005, further information was given regarding the idea ofthree-dimensional time—and it sounds very familiar.What really happens in the parallel universe [is that] the lack of time as adimension . . . makes living through that environment very different from thephysical universe. . . . Like we can walk around in the physical universe frompoint A to point B, in the parallel universe, it is possible to walk from onetime to the next time.34 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1031]On July 23, 2005, the concept of parallel universes was further described.The super space of higher dimensions defies all known laws of physics that holdtrue in the physical universe. It is a universe in which time does not exist asa dimension. It is a universe in which you can create parallel time dimensions.The physical objects collapse into multi-entity objects. . . . We belong tomultiple parallel universes right at this moment. . . . While the physical bodyis in the physical universe . . . we communicate with [ourselves] from theparallel universe, and guide the brain to do work and live our lives. Once wedie, we continue to live, except we withdraw from the physical universe sincethe body is not usable. We continue to live in the parallel universes.35[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1032]On July 26, 2005, the India Daily Technology Team made a statement that isprecisely identical to the science I independently worked out for this book. Iwas stunned when I saw this connection.. . . [W]hat happens to the photon if [the] time dimension is not only moving atthe speed of light, but is actually made to accelerate further? . . . [T]he netresult is that an entity can fall back from the physical universe and merge intothe parallel universe. That is fascinating. Because that is what happens toadvanced civilizations that know how to live an immortal life in the paralleluniverse, and once in a while hover around the physical universe. Somescientists now believe that after death, the electromagnetic spatial source ofenergy, or the soul, just moves through a tunnel of decelerating time to end upat the white light—which represents the entry to the parallel universe.According to researchers in this field, an advanced civilization can achieveimmortality by being able to access the physical and parallel universe anytime.Most probably that is what happens when we are born and when we die. But thetechnology of accelerating time or decelerating time will allow us within thephysical universe to access and move in and out of the parallel universe.36[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1033]On July 27th, the India Daily Technology Team discussed this science in terms ofbiology—and again sounded very similar to what we have been discussing.Two-thirds of our brain is not under our control. It is guided by the entitiesin the parallel universe. We communicate using mind-generated signals commonlyknown as telepathy with many other entities, and even with ourselves in higherspatial dimensions of the parallel universe. . . . We do traverse the paralleluniverses with our mind all the time without physically leaving the physicaluniverse. That part of the brain is not even under our control. It thereforeseems that we are connected genetically to some advanced life-forms that cantraverse from the physical to the parallel universe all the time.37[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1034]Other articles say many extraterrestrials are visiting us from the M15 StarCluster, which is the densest part of our local universe—and has many blackholes, providing extraterrestrial civilizations with a giant transfer station.These extraterrestrials are apparently preparing to reveal themselves to earthin 2012.38 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1035] An August 10, 2005,article said that “many of the UFOs that are reported are actuallytime-reversing phenomena initiated by our own future generation hundreds ofyears later. They can come and visit us, observe us, but they cannot change anyevent.”39 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1036]PREPARING FOR THE “GALACTIC FAMILY REUNION”One report in 2006 revealed that UFOs and extraterrestrial civilizations will beannounced to humanity in December 2012—and “the general consensus is to make theworld slowly ready for it.”40 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1037] Anarticle from December 29, 2006, said that world governments have been hiding thetruth of UFOs and ETs for decades, but secret preparations are being made toreveal the truth in 2012. It also says that “Brazil, India and China are takingthe lead in this matter,” and that the world will secretly use the help ofextraterrestrials to avoid any potential disasters that may occur due to thistransition.41 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1038] On May 12, 2005,India Today said we will be visited by representatives from all eighty-eightconstellations in the night sky as of December 2012. At this time, we will“finally understand the actual process of evolution, the process of bending timeand space, the fact that gravity is a wave and not a force,” and much more.42[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1039]Another article, from January 4, 2007, reveals what is expected to happen whenthis “galactic alignment” reaches its peak in December 2012.Galactic alignment changes the world. The civilizations get reincarnation. Theearth gets rejuvenated. It is a function of [the] gravity wave. The gravity wavein higher dimensions is programmed to create this galactic alignment for earthto have reincarnation.The major galactic alignment happened before. Some believe the dinosaursdisappeared millions of years back during a major galactic alignment. The Vedicliterature talks about galactic alignment. Atlantis was lost during a galacticalignment. Interestingly, ancient literature also hints at formalextraterrestrial visitation during and after galactic alignment. About onehundred years before the galactic alignment, advanced extraterrestrialcivilizations start visiting the earth. Interestingly, modern UFO sightings werefirst recorded in 1911 in Germany. The extraterrestrials create the environmentfor their formal visitation. This may be no different. We might see in 2012 orafter that time the extraterrestrial civilizations—the type IV advanced aliensresponsible for the big bang. The science, history, philosophy and all aspectsof human life may change that day as we watch with astonishment.”43[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1040]In total, these disclosures from India Daily’s “Technology” section are sonumerous, specific and ongoing that I feel it is highly likely that they areindeed telling us the truth. And this data corroborates what certain witnesseswho worked for the military-industrial complex in the United States andelsewhere have said.THE TESTIMONY OF “MR. X”This brings us to the words of “Mr. X,” the very first witness interviewed byProject Camelot. He died suddenly of a massive stroke as he was getting ready tocome forward, reveal his identity and tell much more of what he learned inclassified projects. Nonetheless, we do have his written testimony of thetop-secret documents he read, which revealed the messages that had been given toour world leaders as early as the 1950s. Jerry Pippin directly interviewed thiswitness, and wrote about what he heard.. . . [T]he ETs have said they will conduct a mass landing all over the world onDecember 21st or 22nd, 2012, whether our leaders like it or not. Apparently ourmedia will be used (or some similar worldwide method—more likely to betelepathic) to convey this information to the whole world—it will be somethingeveryone will know. People will be given a choice as to whether they want toevolve spiritually and travel with the ETs or not:“Mr. X: We’ll be given choices. Q: And the choice is what? Mr. X.: [Whether ornot] we want to learn where they came from, and to learn to evolve morespiritually—so we, too, can go throughout the universe and make life.”44[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1041]It’s easy to overlook the impact of what “Mr. X” really means when he says wewill have the choice to “evolve more spiritually.” A transcript of theirinterview reveals even more details. I have no idea if this will actuallyhappen, but it is certainly interesting to speculate.There will be a mass of information released that will shatter most of our corebeliefs. Some will panic because their belief system will be shattered. Somewill be angry because they have been lied to for so long. Some will think thatthe end of the world is here. Most will be confused at best about religiousissues, since the truth will be told and that truth will shatter ALL religiousbeliefs. We will learn the true history of man through the ETs and the powersthat be. It is inevitable. If the world stays on the track it is on—and I see noreason for it to change—we will have to be shown the truth. And if those who runthe world do not do it, the ETs will.45[wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1042]As the old saying goes, “the truth will set you free.” I have handpicked thevery best data from thirty years of dedicated research to put this book togetherfor that very reason—and with this knowledge we have the tools to create theGolden Age. We can create limitless, clean, nonpolluting free energy. We cancreate spectacular new healing technologies. We can conquer gravity, space andtime, and move effortlessly throughout the galaxy. We may well experience aworldwide awakening of the pineal gland, giving us dramatic new intuitiveabilities—possibly even enabling us to move into a light-body state. If theZoroastrian legend of Fraso-kererti is indeed true, then Time as we know it maychange in some fundamental way—giving us the ability to enter into nonlocal,nonlinear time—the realm of time-space—much more easily.I feel that we are being given an invitation to use the knowledge this bookcontains, along with many other sources of positive, uplifting and inspiringinformation. The Golden Age is a participatory event, not something we sit backand wait for. The technologies I have shared with you are real. They can bedeveloped. And they can transform our society into a level that we wouldnormally only think of as science fiction. We are not helpless against EarthChanges and shadowy quasipolitical world powers. Our own minds are in symbiosiswith one another, and with the earth, in a way we do not currently understand onany mass level. Our human relatives appear to have been responsible for plantingthe seeds of every major world religion—and their messages about the importanceof loving and respecting others have reached everyone on earth. The energy ofthe Universe is provably loving in nature—and this makes it very likely that allthe events now happening on earth and throughout our solar system, despite howominous they may appear to so many people, do have a positive purpose—to helpinspire a mass, collective human evolution and awakening. The love we create inour own lives may even extend all the way through into a complete evolution ofwhat it means to be human. We tend to adore complexity, and mental puzzles, butin this case the truth may be very simple: The earth is a school for spirituallearning, and we are all students. Graduation day is upon us—and we get ourdiploma by proving, to ourselves and everyone else on a higher level, that wedon’t need to keep repeating the same lessons anymore—lifetime afterlifetime—and creating a mass dream of hell. If we are indeed on the threshold ofsuch a radical shift in the nature of what it means to be alive and conscious,then soon we will experience this majestic transformation in the Now. It willhappen, in real time—as a living, breathing, vividly wonderful experience. Wemay indeed come to realize that the world has been like a vast illusion—a luciddream where everything we create keeps reflecting back to us—and we finallyrecognize that we have never truly been awake before.The facts are on the table. The Source Field is a reality. We all want to makethis world a better place, and we now have a new set of tools to help us do it.We are not victims and we are definitely not alone. The Universe itself may wellbe a conscious superbeing, encouraging us to make a quantum leap in our ownunderstanding of who and what we are—and giving us the solar-system-widegalactic energy boost we need to get there. Thousands of years’ worth ofprophecies, from every major culture around the world, were given to help usunderstand what is actually happening—and rebuild the science we need to finishthe job. We create the Golden Age ourselves—beginning in our own lives—and therewards are almost beyond imagination. By moving through the self-hatred andfear to reach that hard-earned place of acceptance and forgiveness—of both selfand others—we heal the world:I love you. I am sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you."},{"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsIn January 1996, I began reading The Law of One, a series of five books thatwere allegedly transmitted telepathically by very advanced extraterrestrials.These ETs claimed to have helped build the Great Pyramid, originally forpositive purposes, but were forced to withdraw from the earth when it becamecontorted for negative uses. They also said the main reason they made thiscontact in modern times was to apologize for what they had done, and give usthis new gift in the hopes of improving the desperate situation they hadinadvertently created. A surprisingly large number of the points I have made inthis book appear in the Law of One series, most of which came through in 1981.They reveal that the mind is indeed infinite, but nonetheless has a singularidentity at a vast cosmic level—which they call the One Infinite Creator. We aretold that we are all perfect, holographic reflections of the One InfiniteCreator; that we reincarnate to work on spiritual lessons, and will eventuallyreturn to our original identity; that the “25,000-year cycle” creates biologicaland spiritual evolution in sudden jumps, and that the cycle will be complete inthe approximate neighborhood of 2011 to 2013—ushering in a quantumtransformation of space, time, matter, energy, biology and consciousness that isalready well under way. The Law of One series also describes the global grid,goes into great detail about the physics of space-time and time-space, discusseslevels of spiritual evolution that are based on the rainbow color spectrum,suggests that the galaxy is an intelligent superbeing that has designed thehuman form to appear on millions of inhabited planets, and says that we do havethe potential to evolve into an entirely new level of being as we go throughthis transformation.1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_nts_r1_b.xhtml#en1043] Thebenevolent group they refer to as “The Confederation of Planets in Service ofthe One Infinite Creator” has apparently been assisting the earth throughout itsentire evolution—and is particularly focused on helping us move through thistransition smoothly and safely. This material formed the basis of much of mywork, and many specific details were given that could later be explored andverified scientifically. Every credible insider I know has given me stunningconfirmations of specific details in the Law of One series, though not one ofthem ever read it. I have had many fascinating personal experiences that haveled me to believe this material is indeed accurate and truthful—and I thereforeconsider it to be quite different from most other allegedly channeled teachings,which seem to invariably contradict each other, and often do not line up withthe science I disclose in this book.Another notable exception to the rule is the Seth books, brought through by JaneRoberts and Robert Butts—particularly the earlier volumes. The concludingchapters of The Seth Material feature a long dissertation on what Seth callsconsciousness units—and this data fits in very nicely with everything I’vepresented in this book.I hope you have found this investigation into the Source Field as fascinatingand as informative as I have in writing it. This book is the most significanteffort I have made so far to help the process of disclosure along—so theseadvanced technologies and sciences do not seem so impossible to believe anymore.I feel there is no reason to fear these changes that are now happening. We aremoving through a process that may well be intelligently scripted—to promote ourown evolution. We have the power to increase our own coherence by learning to bemore loving, accepting and forgiving of others—for in forgiveness of others,there is forgiveness of self.I do wish to thank the many heroes and pioneers whose work allowed this book tobe possible—and so many others who are working in these same areas. Without yourstunning efforts of magnificent genius, we would never be aware of our truepotential. I wish to thank my mother, father and brother, my beautiful femalelife partner, and the many people who have shared their lives with me over theyears in various ways—and have given me love and guidance. I also want to thankBrian Tart, Graham Hancock, Jim Hart, the staff at Dutton and so many others whohave helped me fully realize this work. I also wish to thank those who areoutside of time, and gave me such extensive support in the research anddevelopment of these ideas and the writing of this book—including ongoing dreamfeedback, critiques and new breakthrough ideas, not to mention an incrediblenumber of remarkably accurate future prophecies—both personal and planetary. Ihope we will get to meet in person, or the energetic equivalent thereof, sometime soon—as I find the concept of a “Galactic Family Reunion” to be highlyinspiring."},{"pageContent":"NotesIntroduction1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en1] Walter Scott (ed.), Hermetica:The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings which Contain Religious or PhilosophicTeachings ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus, vol.1 New York: Shambala, 1985 p.327.2 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en2] Ibid., p. 351.3 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en3] Ibid., p. 351.4 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en4] Ibid., p. 355.5 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en5] Ibid., p. 425.6 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en6] Ibid., p. 387.7 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_itr_r1.xhtml#Ref-en7] Ibid., pp. 387–389.Preface1 [wilc_9781101543504_oeb_c01_r1.xhtml#Ref-en8] Wilcock, David.
