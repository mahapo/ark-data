[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" PROLOGUE: THE VOICE OF THE VISIONARIES This new addition of 10/20/02 gives us an overview of the entire three- volume series in the Convergence material. PROLOGUE: THE VOICE OF THE VISIONARIES It’s not as hopeless as you might think – in fact, it might just be perfect. You are about to read an organized collection of thoughts that you may have had at various times in your life, but perhaps could never quite fully integrate. Chances are, you will also find many things in this book that you have never seen before, and which will utterly dazzle you. Hence, you can step out of the waiting room, as this next phase of your own personal initiation has just begun. The scroll that is about to unfold before you will resonate deep within, triggering ancient memories from before the time that you were born, giving you the keys to regaining your own freedom in a world that is increasingly becoming a perceptual prison of fear and anxiety. We live in an age where tiny snippets of information perpetually rise and fall in everyone’s life, blowing about with the futility of a rain of confetti – and without the proper context to put them into a framework of some kind, they are simply swept away on the winds of tomorrow. And then, if they are remembered, the specific references are generally sacrificed to dim, murky hearsay, through toxic words like “They” or “that study” or “I read,” which then emerge as, “Did you hear about that study where they found that the light speed barrier was broken? I read about it a while ago.” We have been conditioned to automatically nod our heads in agreement when the almighty “They” are invoked. “Oh wow... I didn’t know that they had done that!” Well, who is “They?” What study? Read it where? This fast-and-loose information game works temporarily with an open-minded person when hearing new concepts similar to what we shall be presenting in this book series, but we must remember that there is a far mightier “They” that has enslaved the minds of most people – the consensus of mainstream thought. If you are reading these words slowly enough, then you’ll probably end up thinking about this concept, and how it has affected you and those around you, for days. Which is good. (Sometimes we will still need to use the word “they” to define a certain subset of people, such as the alternative science community, or a particular group of non-physical beings once named, or in discussing a particular study once the names have been given. We will capitalize the word “They” and surround it with quotation marks when using it in the context we have just mentioned.) Ultimately, it appears that the subconscious gravitates towards the word “They” as it is a soft, comfortable substitute for God; deep inside, every person longs to be connected to the source of their being, and therefore wishes to have a source of omniscience to draw from that he or she “knows is right.” However, let us recognize the paradoxical mind-split that this situation has created, once and for all. We ultimately want to use the word “They” to invoke God’s presence, but since the Renaissance, science has boldly attempted to remove God from all “rational thinking ” through Pierre Simon de Laplace’s concept of “logical positivism.” This is how “They” of Science have come to automatically assume that God is irrelevant to the quest for truth. Scientists believe that this quest for truth is best accomplished by the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"collection and synthesis of observable data , nothing more. The collection and synthesis of things that we can study and measure is the scientific process – and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with it. However, the opinions of mainstream Science are not objective. “Science” is not a fair game. Untold numbers of data points are rejected by nothing more than an emotional decision that the data doesn’t “feel” right, with the belief in an empty, Godless universe as the motivating backdrop. This is then further bolstered by the heavy opposition of those who have strong media / political influence and who would stand to lose all of their funding if their prized theories turned out to be incorrect. Thus, planets are just “rocks in the sky” that churn about in a purposeless idiot dance, in a Universe that is slowly dying away by the “law of entropy,” eventually collapsing back into the nothingness from which it is believed to have originated. Perhaps a wandering space rock will happen to veer into Earth’s gravity and kill us all, since in this Godless universe there is no “Scientific” reason to assume that we will be protected. To suggest otherwise is to suddenly discover that you have “stormed the machine-gun nest” of those who will accuse you being a “ridiculous religious fundamentalist crackpot” with no respect for Science. Hence, any invocation of the word “They” is almost entirely pointless when you’re trying to tell another human being that almost every major aspect of conventional scientific thought is either flawed or incomplete, from the tiniest to the most massive levels of size, both organic and “inorganic,” and that a hidden, grandiose model exists that can integrate everything into a fantastic spiritual vision heretofore unimagined by most . The “scientific priesthood” does not want to give up its quasi-Divine claim to the power of the word “They”, but with the rise of the Internet, many people are beginning to open their minds and open the books that might have otherwise just sat on the shelf. So do try to remember the specific names of the people who made important discoveries, as with that knowledge comes power – the power to free the human mind from a subtle, unspoken and persistent despair. Normal, clear, rational thinking is beginning to overtake the infantile desire to blindly accept what “They” want you to think and believe about the Universe. And generally, when the truth is presented in its purest form, it is not difficult for a regular person to understand – they simply may never have thought of it before. Once we move out of the scientific arena into what Carl Sagan patronizingly described as “the demon-haunted world,” we enter into a completely different playing field with new rules. Many of these new rules are issued on-the-fly by the continual rise and fall of those who claim to be “channeling” information about how the concept of God integrates with our physical reality. A surprising number of people will grab onto a certain set of teachings and will practically fight you to the death if you are not willing to believe everything that their chosen channel said. Hence, there is a new crop of folks in town who are embittered by the old atheists, but end up repeating their same mistakes in the desire to harness the Hammer of the Gods and wield the almighty power of the word “They.” Everyone seems to want to be the Messiah these days, and claim an exclusive gateway to the truth that only “They” can provide. I do believe that intuition and higher consciousness have a valuable place in the research process, but to say that you simply “channeled” a major chunk"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of new, otherwise unverifiable specific information is, to me, a distracting shortcut to doing this research “homework.” Specific information is not the main purpose of channeling, as I understand it. The spiritual sources I have studied with tell us that all research, all science is ultimately of small importance, and eventually falls away as we move farther and farther along on the path to true Oneness. What does matter the most is the general material that can help us in the evolution of mind, body and spirit. I have no objections to the channels who focus on this type of material. Every person has a unique and precious gift to give in helping all of us evolve – and you give them a microphone and some freedom from fear, and if they are honest enough, they can move the entire room to tears. Too often this only happens at funerals, if a bereaved family member decides to speak. Perhaps for the first time they are truly feeling the gifts of God that were reflected through that person, and are more honest about their own feelings of separation from God than they ever normally allow themselves to be. (Most people do not realize this as the true source of their pain.) Actors who can cry on demand in front of a camera and can bring this same response out of us are seen to be dazzling. We know when they are faking or not, and often the movies where it is clearly real will enjoy great success. At the time of this writing, “Spider Man” is the best-selling movie of all time – and when his father died and you saw that scared little boy crying close-up, you either melted into it and totally identified with his character or you had to force that clamp down on your heart once more and drive away the pain. The authenticity of Tobey Maguire’s tears made that scene far more than a typical “Hollywood death” – as suddenly it became our father down there, and we were the ones longing for his loving presence to return. Some information can dry our tears, make us feel whole, and renew the sense that we are One. Most of this philosophical information can never be “proven” and does not involve specific “facts,” but simply appeals to a philosophical sense of reason, wisdom and loving-kindness. This type of material does not require any outside references or validation – it just speaks to the timeless self within all of us, and thus is definitely not “scientific.” Specific information can easily draw us away from our own spiritual path if it invokes fear or does not ultimately relate to our own evolution as conscious beings who are One. Even if we could prove that we’re all going to die tomorrow, next week, next month or next year, knowing that will do nothing to help us grow and evolve today. And if our body drops, there it will lie. We will still be ourselves, wondering what just happened to us as we look down at it, and where to go next. What matters most is love and wisdom, female and male, meshing together into the Unity of compassionate wisdom and the sacramental nature of all things. And ultimately, I must admit that even the concept of a dimensional shift in our imminent future matters little, as the true work to be done is inside of ourselves. A strict reading of “ The Law of One ” would say that most specific information is “transient,” meaning that it is of little importance. However, certain concepts of cosmology and physics were answered in quite exquisite and revealing detail. So in this case, it appears that we are being told that it is important for us to remember if the concepts of “reality” that are automatically believed in the mainstream are really truthful or not. What do you think about when you"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"see the world around you? What do you think about when you see the stars? What implicit assumptions have you consciously made about “physical matter”? Do you think this way because you automatically believe that “They” are right? Do you feel you must fawn at the feet of the scientific priesthood and request oblations from the TV, magazine, newspaper and Internet because you were “Bad” in math and science? Might you run to speculative tabloid nonsense because it doesn’t really challenge you to think? Can you free yourself to embrace Oneness when the rational mind constantly gets in the way with an atheistic science as its backdrop? Do you dare to “storm the machine gun nest” of alleged Fact, knowing that you may incur the disfavor of others in order to arrive at greater self-integration? This is where certain forms of specific information become important. We need some sort of a foundation to work off of if we truly want to make progress. It is a heck of a lot to ask an uninitiated person to believe that this current dimensional shift, now nearing completion, is scientifically “real.” Yet, once we find out that the world around us is truly Divine, fully interconnected and part of an Ultimate Being that is One, then certain specific information becomes a shuttle that quickly allows us to merge the small “I” with the large “I AM” that we are all ultimately a part of. We are again led to remember who we really are, as the secrets of the Universe become our teacher. And once we can reflect that realization of oneness with the Creator to others, we don’t need to tell them anything. They’ll feel it right away. So, if higher beings do exist, and if they respect us, then they should be able to give us a blend of relevant information about the universe that is both spiritual and physical, forming a bridge between these worlds. If we are indeed living in a Divine Cosmos, then let’s see it! If there is a higher order to the events that we are now seeing unfold in the world, then let’s find it! If these beings’ intelligence is truly higher than our own, then they should already know the answers to the largest problems that perplex the scientific community, such as the solution to the “Unified Field Theory.” Furthermore, in knowing the answers, they should then be able to see what we are missing and give us a road map to follow for our scientific research so we can fill in the missing pieces. Figuring out how we prove these concepts is the truly marvelous game of the scientific researcher on the endless quest for Truth – and the three “P’s” of Patience, Persistence and Psychic Insight are all very helpful, though frequently lacking. So, as you may be aware, the predominant goal of this entire series of books is to rebuild a complete, Unified model of a Divine Cosmos that will prove to the rational mind that the Shift of the Ages is already underway, and will reach Convergence in the near future. However, this is far from a situation where we are all magically transformed on the striking of the clock. There is work to do, and some of it is occurring collectively and some of it is occurring individually. By the time you have finished the series, you will understand exactly what I am about to write: Energetic conditions are now being created in our Solar System that accelerate both physical and conscious processes at the same time. The physical processes , such as the “Earth changes” that are actually occurring throughout the entire Solar System, aren’t hard to see. They can easily be measured with our instruments and studied scientifically. We can and will nail down the cycles of time that drive these events, and how they work. The"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"conscious processes that occur in the collective body of human thought can also be measured with the blunt movements of financial markets between the extremes of joy and fear, buying and selling – which will prove to be remarkably in tune with outside astrophysical factors. We will also see historical events that repeat themselves in remarkably similar fashions over certain cycles of time, such as 2160 years. In addition, certain cycles perfectly connect physical and conscious processes together – such as finding an outside energetic cause that simultaneously creates massive earthquakes, explosions of nearby stars, collapsing of bloated empires, formation of new societies from the ashes, relatively exact increases in the size of the world’s population by a simple mathematical function, the development of new calendar systems for measuring time and the arrival of great spiritual teachers for humanity. This can be thought of as a spiraling energetic structure of time that is imploding into a point of “singularity” in our near future – a point of final spiritual transformation, if you will, the shedding of the old ways and the adaptation of the New Heaven and New Earth. Better yet, this cycle was found in a very ancient source, more than three thousand years before the birth of Jesus. The conscious processes in our own lives are much more subtle, and that is where we firmly enter the arena of choice. We can either choose to move through the often-shattering experiences of love and trust, or shut them down in fear and hate to avoid any further ( apparent ) damage. We have every right to continue to be blind to the suffering of others, and focus only on our own needs, attempting to manipulate and control others for our own gain. However, if we make this choice, the energetic conditions that surround us at this time will make our lives harder and harder and harder. We get to learn by experience that we will keep getting smacked around until we surrender to love for others and for ourselves. Elaborate plans for an imperial “New World Order” will crumble into dust, the funding for these initiatives completely evaporated as a byproduct of these changes, as have all previous empires collapsed as each notch of this “imploding spiral of time” is reached. At the time of this writing, the next two notches will hit at 2003 and 2008, as we increasingly implode towards a moment of singularity. The most difficult aspect of this personal / global growth process is to be willing to accept what you will “lose” along the way, and not get upset about it. It feels like a form of spiritually-invoked abuse at first, but it is the simple byproduct of the law of cause and effect, once properly understood – and all is happening for a Divine purpose. As these energetic conditions continue to increase, they will indeed reach a final “point of no return,” a moment of spontaneous quantum evolution. As I said, this point ultimately does not matter, even though we do have a “smoking gun” that can nail it down to within about a two-year window. We have been told by sources such as The Law of One that if we have not done the work on ourselves that these current energetic conditions can produce, we will simply be transported to a new and different Earth to pick up where we left off once the “shift” happens. If we do choose to shift, and cry, and grow, and love, we shall live to see the day when every tear that we have shed is an investment in the new being that we shall metamorphosize into, as the Earth completes its own conscious evolution. There are definite dividends to these investments, as what we will have is a world that will apparently be 100 times more harmonious than what we are living in now, with the abilities of the greatest masters at our fingertips. There will still be plenty of work to do,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"but we will have crossed a major hurdle and will actually live in this “dream world.” For now, we can choose today to make shifts in ourselves that bring Heaven to Earth, and allow us to live in the glory, grace and trust that has been prepared for us since time immemorial, on the inevitable spiraling path back into Oneness. This series could not have been possible without the diligent work of many thousands of highly intelligent visionary thinkers. They may not be aware of it, but their waking and dreaming lives are usually being guided by Divine beings who are completely willing to forego any credit for their subtle efforts. Hence, these researchers ultimately do speak as the Creator. For years they have worked in isolation, never able to share the same stage with others like themselves and come together with a common vision. They are often genius- level people. Others often steal their ideas without credit. They are often poor. They may have worked for years on one particular problem, feeling that the final answer will surely shake the Universe, only to solve it – and then find out that no one seems to care. Doors have slammed in their faces. They have continued their quest for the ultimate truth of our Being despite formidable odds, lack of proper funding and scorn from their peers, and thus are unable to get published in “accepted” journals. They may actually decide to give up eventually if they continue to be unappreciated, and focus on more profitable endeavors. A great many of them do have Ph.D. degrees – but the scientific priesthood simply banishes them as “lost souls” and more heads nod unquestioningly as “They” issue forth the official decree. Some of these visionaries live in foreign countries, such as Russia, and their results are thus immediately discarded as being “unverifiable,” even if they have been duplicated in the West. These avant-garde thinkers have discovered many pieces of data that are quite mind-blowing, but which almost never get discussed, even in the “New Age” movement, usually due to the difficulty of fully understanding the work. They often do not make the time to read each other’s material, as they tend to be totally focused on their own projects. They will talk to you for hours, hardly pausing to breathe, and go way over your head if you let them, as they are so desperate to have their voices heard. You might see the simultaneous pain and joy in their eyes when they finally get the chance to speak – a look that says, “ Please don’t walk away .” They may have hair loss from many sleepless nights of furious concentration. They may have enormous social ineptitudes and awkward, nervous, eccentric behaviors, being much more comfortable with work than with people. They may have bad breath from being so in their minds that they fail to drink enough water to support the physical body. Their clothes may have been out of style for years. They often develop elaborate personal systems of jargon in order to explain the breakthrough concepts that they have discovered, which can be very confusing to a newcomer. You may often need to read through their papers knowing that you can only expect to understand 60 percent of it, at best, while digging for the “meat” of their findings. I love and respect these people, and have been blessed to meet many of them in person, triggering waves of scientific and spiritual ecstasy in their minds as I demonstrate how their prized concepts fit into a wider overall model of a Divine Cosmos, and thus removing their feelings of aloneness. Everyone who has inspired a concept gets full credit in this series. With a few exceptions, such as this book series, no one seems to have been"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"willing enough to try to unify their concepts into a single overall model. It can be a huge burden to go through stacks and stacks of books and website printouts. Most channelers don’t bother to read these materials, as they may tell you that they were “never any good at math or science.” Some people have thrown this book down – right in front of me – as soon as they see pictures of geometric objects inside, for that very reason. Anything that looks like “work” is often avoided. Furthermore, I believe that many people have never even imagined that these types of concepts could actually be explored with the scientific process. Nevertheless, consider the following quote from the most well-documented “channeler” of all time, Edgar Cayce: When there is the same interest or study given to things or phases of mental and spiritual phenomena as has been and is given to the materialized or material phenomena, then it will become just as practical, as measurable, as meter-able as any other phase of human experience . [2012-1, yr. 1939] That’s it right there. It is interesting that this reading was the first to be performed for client number 2012, as many people are already aware that the year 2012 is one of special importance in this dimensional shift process that is now underway, since it represents the ending date of a unique system for counting time devised by the ancient Mayans of Mesoamerica and the Yucatan. The Mayas equate the ending of their own time system with the arrival of a Golden Age for humanity, a time of dramatic spiritual renewal. So, there is a subtle suggestion in the above Cayce reading that if we make a scientific study of the information surrounding the “ phase of spiritual phenomena ” that is the alleged dimensional shift in 2012, we very well may be able to establish a good case. I receive two or three emails a month from people who tell me that they would have written this book series themselves, but they didn’t have enough of the specific data to do it. However, specific data is exactly what we need if we really want to enact social changes by convincing the rational mind that this is a genuine phenomenon that is occurring. Furthermore, we also run into the problem that the first “entrance requirement” of this text is simply having a large enough imagination to take in the concepts intellectually, emotionally and spiritually, whether or not you actually even agree with them. Some people physically cannot make “room” for this data in their minds to even decide whether they agree with it or not. Thus, I am often told that the books are ‘hard to read.’ There is nothing in these books that is intrinsically difficult to understand for a person with a basic education, but if the person has a closed mind, the skeptical rationalizations and head-in-the-sand ostrich behavior might get so vast and labyrinthine that the book must be tossed aside to again regain the comfort of the status quo, so “They” can grab you by the skin on the back of your neck and “rescue” you once you have dared to wander from the box. So, I am one who likes to gather up this rain of information “confetti” with big bags, and then lovingly examine each square over years and years of time, memorizing and documenting all the specific references, seeing how they fit together into a beautiful mosaic and knowing that eventually the information will be assimilated into coherent, digestible new thoughts. Thanks to the Internet, the walls are finally coming down, with an infinity of available research to be conducted – but only a finite number of relevant topics, with a finite number of linked pages that can be printed, bound, studied and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"underlined. Since I became completely self-employed as an intuitive counselor in 1998, I have made it my full-time job to literally search “the ends of the earth” and turn over as many of these stones as I possibly can. The stack of Internet-printed research books that have gone into the Convergence series is now about four or five feet tall – and you will not have to repeat these steps yourself, as herein you will find the distilled end-product of these labors, an entirely new view of the Cosmos that may well “hurt your brain” as you try to assimilate all the new – and deeply truthful – concepts. However, if you can just take your time the second time through ( most blast through it the first time like weary, makeup-clad trick-or-treaters with a big bag of Halloween candy ,) you should be able to fundamentally reconstruct a whole new vision of reality for yourself that is in harmony with “true reality,” not the illusion of the mainstream consensus. I hope you like the way that I have sculpted these facts together for you. The “they” I work with seem to think I’ve done a good job. So do I. And when “They” becomes “I”, then outside opinions no longer matter, do they?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 01: INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 01: INTRODUCTION How are you? Look around. Look at the people in your life. Look at the changes in yourself. It is not the same world as it was just a few years, few months, even a few weeks ago? Everything seems to be going so fast that it is hard to keep up with it. Something is definitely going on in the world, something mysterious and inexplicable. You might even be scared to death about it. You see the weather disasters, ecological destruction, the violence in society, the ridiculousness of the media. You also are aware of more than a few convincing prophets who have spelled certain doom for this period, and continue to do so. If not the y2k, then it was May 5, 2000. And when the huge catastrophes don't come to pass in one sudden moment, they simply push them further ahead. The more lip service you pay to them, the more hopeless you feel, since there is no pot of gold at the end of their \"rainbow.\" So, in order to maintain your sanity, you naturally discredit and ignore what is being said, continuing to plan for the future as if nothing is going to happen. It's really the only way to function in daily life. So here we are at the dawn of the new millennium. Big deal. The y2k \"computer crash\" came and went, with a \"whole lot of nothing\" to show for it. Why all the attention, we ask? Did we all fall for it? Yep, we did, at least on some level. We all know that the Earth has now revolved around the Sun more than 2000 times since the year that we declared as the birth of Christ. Prior to the y2k rollover itself, we couldn't help but think that the world might very well have taken a crash course in a technology and electricity-free, pioneering lifestyle, for an unknown length of time. It was a HUGE heads-up for humanity, a wake-up call that forced us to ask some very serious questions. We all had to look directly at the possible future ahead of us, and think about what life would be like without all the creature comforts that society has afforded us. We also realized that our ecosystem is very delicate, and without some serious changes, there will be further problems to contend with. We cannot go on destroying ourselves and our planet forever. So was it all doom and gloom? Do we still believe every computer guru, stock trader, metaphysician or prophet who comes along and tells us, \"Well, this is it?\" And now that y2k is history, do we simply relax and think that \"business as usual\" will now continue on indefinitely? Or could there be another side to the story as well? All of us need to be very honest with ourselves about what is already happening right now. The UFO sightings are now on an all-time high level of intensity, never before seen in recorded history. All over the world, economies are collapsing from within, with the US barely holding its ground as the last bastion of \"economic growth and well-being.\" At the time of this rewrite, April 2000, the stock market has been showing unbelievable instability with the breakup of Microsoft in the works. On April 4, 2000, the NASDAQ index lost 11 percent of its entire worth in a single morning, only to be bought back by the Federal Reserve, ostensibly, to keep the economy from collapsing. Then, the next day the London markets shut down completely,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"theoretically due to a computer glitch but more realistically in an outrageous attempt to check further losses. And on the weekend when this book was finished, the market as of April 15 had experienced its single greatest crash since 1987. These types of economic contortions have been serious enough that even the major brokerage houses have been closing down due to the extreme volatility of the markets and their complete inability to make sense out of it. And in a relatively similar fashion, the weather is behaving in extremely erratic ways that obey the prophecies while stumping any rational explanations. At the time of this rewrite, the two volcanoes in Edgar Cayce's well known earth-change formula, Etna and Montserrat, right near Vesuvius, are erupting. As of early April 2000, Antarctica lost two more icebergs of simply colossal size, threatening shipping in that area. All over the world, the environment is collapsing at a very real and very horrifying rate, and you don't have to be a \"tree-hugger\" to see it. There is an endless stream of information every week in the world media that points towards the reality of these circumstances. Indeed, if we are able to step away from our own denial and look at things from the perspective of clean, unfiltered truth, it isn't hard to see that we are on the verge of permanently destroying ourselves and our planet. Everyone knows this on some level, some more consciously than others. The y2k period made humanity much more aware of this, because even if we didn't believe anything would happen, the idea of a social collapse was still being discussed on a worldwide level. The truth of the degree of problems that exist is much too hard for most of us to accept, because of the feeling of utter futility that it naturally creates. Species are going extinct at a rate that is faster than we can measure. The oceans are heating so rapidly that huge pieces of Antarctica are continuing to drop off into the ocean. The ozone layer is being destroyed, the oil is being pumped out of Mother Earth until none remains, and it doesn't seem as though any one person or group of people could do anything to stop these things from occurring. Our society has grown essentially out of control, tearing down trees for development all over the world at a rate that is much faster than they can be replaced. And therefore, once stripped of all barriers and boundaries of denial and ignorance, our collective Ego mind must conclude that it is faced with the scientific fact of its own imminent destruction; if not in our generation, then certainly in future generations, unless something very drastic is done to stop it. Whether any of these systems would change from within, regardless of external threats, is certainly a question of serious debate. And even if we did collapse the industrial economy as it now stands, could we really change the weather patterns that are already in place? But what about our collective subconscious ? Even though you will never see this in the mainstream media, it is not difficult to observe that a massive movement is occurring within the populace at large; a movement towards the \"basic Christ principles\" of love and acceptance for self and for others. Faced with the impossible task of changing the world, we must turn within and seek to find the ways we can change ourselves. Massive metaphors play themselves out in the public consciousness that lead to our own personal realizations of wrongdoing. The impeachment trials of President Clinton in 1998, for example, served as a metaphor for each individual, leading them to a profound inner question:"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"What if that was me up there in the Presidency? How would my own life look if every possible secret and embarrassing detail of my life was revealed, literally, to the entire world? Would I also be deemed unfit to be President and threatened with impeachment? The questions that all of us are asking ourselves these days are very deep, very profound and very meaningful. Without a full awareness of what we are heading into, we might not realize how important these questions really are. That is where this book, and the information contained within it, comes into play. At first glance, this book appears to simply contain a scientific thesis, describing a new and comprehensive, harmonic model of the Big Universe Out There. But the question it proposes is very spiritual, very real, very important. Are we all \"getting the message?\" Are we all trying to align with what we understand the nebulous term of \"spirituality\" to mean? Or, are we continuing to protect and preserve our own self-interests at the expense of others? When we really look at the problems that we are encountering as a human entity, is it not difficult to see the truth? Can we not see that the entire gamut of problems we now face are inherently caused by our own self-serving actions? Our companies continue to measure their success solely on the basis of how much profit they produce. If the company makes money, then the company is a success. If the company goes broke, the company is no good. The more money the company makes, the more of a success it is. This can apply equally well to our own self-conceptions. The materialism of our society, \"programmed\" into us day after day from a dancing colored box, teaches us to think the same way. Any of us with this \"programming,\" when we rise to levels where we can actually have access to such wealth, must fight a very natural predisposition to hoard it, to treasure it, to want it all for ourselves and to never, never, never be happy unless we have more, more, more. And even once we have more, we still feel empty. Something, somewhere, somehow is still missing -- even if we have the white picket fence, two point- five children, beautiful spouse and great job. Many of our lives just seem to be empty, and the former definitions of success in our society no longer seem to hold weight. Along these same lines, our spiritual institutions are changing dramatically. Rigid dogmas have given way to a new set of questions, where many of us no longer feel that we have a clear or organized idea of what, or who, God really is. Much to the chagrin of avid church supporters and Fundamentalists, Christianity is like a withering fruit, clinging to the dying vine of its past and fearing the inevitable plummet to the Earth. This collapse of religion is being openly acknowledged moreso in England than in America, where the organized churches are at such desperate points that they are telling their remaining congregations that they will either have to raise a certain amount of money or start firing vicars, closing churches and even consolidating different denominations together in order to survive! As numerous surveys report that well over 50 percent of all Americans are actively involved in New Age studies, including chakras, crystals, colors and channeling, it is not hard to see that religion is no longer answering our own \"big questions.\" And now, with the presence of extraterrestrials as an"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"increasingly real proposition, we can no longer be content with the old answers. Something real is going on, and those who refuse to acknowledge that fact are looking more and more ridiculous with each new television special, movie, filmstrip, photograph, mass sighting and ex-government \"whistle-blower\" that comes forward. So most of us can now safely say that \"we are not alone,\" since it is virtually impossible that every single report and sighting is a figment of the imagination. But where does God fit in to all of this? Most professional UFOlogists are disgusted by the slightest mention of a spiritual meaning to the UFO phenomenon, and anyone trying to assert such a connection is shunned. When asked why 'they' are here, all too often we hear fear-based statements about how some form of looming invasion could be in the works, or that they are simply studying us to see what we are going to do in these troubled times, or even more nefarious hypotheses about how they are simply using us for \"parts.\" Few UFOlogists want to humble themselves enough to admit that 'they' just might be here to help us. God might very well have a lot of help, and once help has arrived, do we choose to accept it or continue to ignore its essential mission and purpose? And so, regardless of where we look for it, if we have not made a place for God and / or God's helpers in our lives, then indeed there must not appear to be any hope for getting through the future unscathed. As the corporations continue to rake in the dough, the Earth inexorably moves towards death and sterility. Without the notion and presence of God's forces as a tangible, real thing, there literally could seem to be no hope. No one can honestly accept that our social structures will change quick enough to avert catastrophe on their own, after reading a healthy dose of articles describing the incredible acceleration of Earth Changes that we are witnessing. We have made our bed, and now we have to lie in it. To many of us, a fat wallet provides a high that leads to myopic blindness, and we will simply refuse to change until it is already far, far too late. But getting back to our discussion involving the extraterrestrials, what if everything that we are discussing is going exactly the way that it is supposed to happen? Should we have the audacity to be fearful when such miraculous visitations are showing up all around us? Can we honestly think that we understand the Universe when everything we see is telling us that the dreams might be even more real than the reality ? Will we also one day have anti- gravity propulsion, limitless free energy sources, super-light-speed travel and cooperation with a whole galaxy worth of intelligent beings? With the technology that our visitors display and the messages that they seem to be giving us in greater and greater numbers, in our dreams and through dedicated channels including the author of this book, can we deny that 'they' are here on a spiritual mission, supervising an imminent renaissance and rebirth of the human spirit? Could we just possibly be on time , going through a process already well scripted and rehearsed throughout the entire universe? And is time truly nothing more than a straight-line path, or are we indeed subject to other, more mysterious cycles of human civilization, based upon a hidden harmonic structure in the Universe? Our media seems to have a complete blindness to the amazing spiritual events that are occurring in many of our lives, as well as the unbelievably bizarre collapses and physical / emotional catastrophes that are occurring in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the lives of individuals all around us. If we sit down and think about it from an expansive spiritual perspective, it would seem that the \"law of Karma\" is indeed real. Our thoughts create our experiences, and we attract exactly what we have asked for. If we live in fear, then fearful events happen to us. If we live in trust, then somehow everything always works out. And now more than ever, anything in our lives that holds us back from making positive and loving choices is being burned off. We can look at those around us who seem to be the most deeply lost in self and see the personal apocalypse already occurring. The events on the planet seem to be no different. As we unquestionably move closer and closer to some sort of event of major proportions, or what the Ancients referred to as the Shift of the Ages, do we really know what we are moving towards? Indeed, why is it that the entire \"outside world\" of extraterrestrial intelligence seems to be doing everything within their power to alert us of their presence now? Have we ever before had so much convincing evidence that there were previous advanced civilizations on Earth, and that they may well have been in contact with these same extraterrestrials before? Why is it that almost every person knows deep down inside that our own military / corporate / government / media hierarchy is practically bashing us over the head with the reality of extraterrestrial life, just so that they don't have to \"officially\" declare it? Why do we all keep waiting for \"them\" to release the secrets, when we already know the truth but just don't want to make that dizzying step of really, really believing it ? And with incredibly accurate psychics in history such as Edgar Cayce, can we really deny that precise telepathic communication with this higher intelligence is possible? Why do so many of us feel that something wonderful is about to happen? Are we expecting the truth of open contact with these extraterrestrials, of becoming a member of an interplanetary conclave of intelligent life? Are we paying attention to the fact that the more we try to \"do good,\" the more our lives seem to flow in unpredictable and beautiful ways, answering all of our prayers? Do we notice the presence of synchronicity in our lives, how so many strange things seem to be happening that suggest that a higher spiritual force is at work, that we just happen to be at the right place at the right time? Why are there increasing numbers of people out there, such as the author of this book, who are clearly able to contact these higher intelligences, and repeatedly produce results including accurate future prophecies that would be otherwise impossible to attain? Why are our dreams so filled with wonder that we awaken with awe and reverence, longing to return to wherever we had just been? Why, indeed, do we \"just trust\" that even in the midst of all the seemingly depressing and terrifying collapse occurring all around us that there is also new life, new wonder, new beauty and love? Why do we somehow know that we are, indeed, about to experience something so fantastic as to be the Single Greatest Moment of All Time ? In our minds, in our hearts and in our souls, often beneath our direct conscious awareness, we know : we remember : we understand . We are all aware, in some inconceivably vast way, that a fantastic event is about to occur on Earth. The Christians would have it as the Second Coming. The UFO buffs would have it as either the \"big government disclosure,\" the \"landing on the White House lawn\" or both, as one may well trigger the other. The doomsayers might choose to see that we are about to be vomited off the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"surface of the earth by volcanoes, hurricanes and tidal waves in an epic pole shift, asteroid collision or coronal mass ejection from the Sun, and insist that \"it's all over.\" Others of us are much less certain about what it is, and therefore we can continue to keep it at arm's length and try to go on like nothing is going to happen. Indeed, we might never truly understand this event, or even believe that something is really going to change, until it already has. And at that point, whenever \"it\" happens, everything that happened before that moment will seem to be nothing more than a faded chapter of life in dull monochrome. Our new lives will burst with color in a way that we could never have possibly understood. It is quite hard to imagine, for example, the day when every TV station, every newspaper and magazine headline, every government leader and every thinking person on the entire planet finally says in unison: \"We are not alone.\" Or even better yet: the day of world peace, when every person, every nation and every race looks at each other, at the earth and at all other forms of intelligent life in the universe and says, \"I love you and I respect you for who and what you are, as I love and respect myself for who and what I am. I am sorry for anything that I have ever done to hurt you and I hope you can forgive me. Let's work together to create a new world - a world without hurt, a world without pain, a world without crying children rotting away in festering starvation, a world where we are truly One with each other, with our earth and with the One Creator. So be it.\" Our collective feminine Lunar self, symbolized by the number 1080 in ancient teachings, must overthrow the stranglehold that the masculine Solar self known as 666 now has over the planet. (And yes, it is this dominance of the masculine archetype on Earth that is behind the metaphorical Biblical prophecies for this period.) Both ourselves and our society must again embrace the Universal Feminine in love, thus giving us unity, as the ancient number 1746 represents. Our numerous creative works prepare us for this 'fusion' event on the subconscious level. In the 1998 movie Pleasantville , a world of black-and-white turns to color as people learn to leave behind their outmoded, 1950's-style beliefs and achieve true personal, emotional and intellectual freedom. In The Truman Show , a man symbolizing the collective mind of humanity comes to the stunning realization that the entire world around him is constructed as a giant illusion, where he is the star that millions of people in the outside world watch on their television screens. In Close Encounters of the Third Kind , the lead character is driven by an arresting series of visions to finally board a gigantic extraterrestrial spacecraft, forever leaving behind his Earth life for the promise of something far greater. In the JRR Tolkien Lord of the Rings series, the entire world is preparing to undergo an incredible, multidimensional shift never before known in history. In 2001 , a Monolith is found that seems to alert an extraterrestrial presence of our own \"coming of age.\" Guided by this force, spaceship commander David Bowman eventually enters into a vortex of spiraling light that first ages him and then returns him to a fetal state, indicating new life in a mysterious higher realm. In 2010 , the metaphor expands even more: Bowman returns as a multi-dimensional entity, telling us of an imminent, unbelievable transformation. \"What is going to happen?\" they ask him. \"Something wonderful,\" he whispers, shaking his head gently from side to side with reverent, loving awe. Jupiter eventually explodes and becomes a star, creating an entire new solar system for us to use within our own. On every"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"television screen on Earth, the spiritual forces write, \"All these worlds are yours... Use them together... Use them in peace.\" In James Cameron's movie The Abyss , a fantastic and unspeakably beautiful extraterrestrial world is found in our own oceans, and after we achieve contact with it, it rises to the surface of the sea of our consciousness. In Ghost , our lead character is a spiritual being that says goodbye to the pottery- throwing woman symbolizing Mother Earth to enter into a vortex of pure light. In Cocoon, the old folks go off with the luminous extraterrestrials to a place where they \"won't get sick, won't get any older and won't ever die.\" In E.T. , a fallen alien being, representing ourselves, finally gets to return home after nearly dying from living on Earth with \"the children.\" In the Star Wars trilogy, Darth Vader, as the symbol of the crushing weight of male-driven corporate America, is overthrown by the heroic power of love, and we realize that he is our own father, our own family, and he is welcomed back, newly transformed. In Titanic , as the ship representing our modern world sinks, throngs of people surround a minister who boldly and solemnly reads the scripture, saying, \" And there will be a new heaven, and a new earth ...And there shall be no more death, for we will have everlasting life ... \" People go to bed and peacefully prepare for what is going to come. Then, people from \" the future \" come with exotic space-age undersea equipment to try to reconstruct the past events that had happened there, and these people include one of the original participants. In Contact , we achieve communication with an extraterrestrial race, and this leads us to build a machine that enables us to journey to their own level. It is an exhilarating journey of light, sound and color, rocketing through unspeakably vast wormholes to a realm of pure, luminescent peace and beauty, where the angelic entities present themselves as members of our own family. In Mission to Mars , the beings responsible for building the \"Face\" reveal to us that \"They are us: we are them,\" and one of the best \"Ascension\" finales on film occurs in the last two minutes. And in The Matrix , lead character Neo finally believes in himself enough that he gains complete control over the illusion of the physical world itself, defeating the negative forces that were trying to destroy him and acquiring Christlike abilities. Time after time, as we see these beautiful movies, tears stream down our faces as a part of us, somehow, some way, knows and believes that something as fantastic as this is going to happen to us in our own lifetimes. But it seems to be so far away, so far away, beyond our grasp or comprehension. The ultimate conclusion of this book is that the event commonly known as \"The Shift of the Ages\" or \"Ascension\" is indeed going to occur, and it is indeed unspeakably fantastic. The chances are that we will never truly understand exactly what this means or how we will personally experience it until we are actually going through it. The truth of its imminent arrival is practically exploding out at us from all directions, both positively and negatively. Perhaps this is why it is so amazing that almost no one in the prominent UFO/metaphysics field is talking about it at all . Everyone seems to gather information that will get quite close to describing it, without ever actually identifying The Big Picture as it really is. Nor can we simply ascribe this transformation to a tired old Christian prophecy, as it was indeed forecasted long before Christianity ever came onto the scene."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"But what exactly is this event going to be, you say? Sure, we all have an idea, but each idea can be different from the others. Some people familiar with these ideas feel that it simply represents a shift in consciousness that will occur here on the planet, with everyone making sudden strides in their awareness and the dawning of a new day, a new consciousness. Some people feel that it has to do with the moment when we achieve open contact with the \"visitors\" and become a member of a group of planetary societies with technology far vaster than ours, which could certainly create the previous scenario as well. Some others, such as James Redfield in The Celestine Prophecy , take the opinion that the body itself will actually disappear from view in a flash of light, or that some sort of spontaneous, holographic mutation of our DNA is going to happen at this moment. The author of this book wondered about these questions just like everyone else. Before he ever started doing psychic readings, he had been fastidiously recording his dreams for over five years. It was through this medium that he was first exposed to the notion of Ascension, and of what it might actually involve - or at least a healthy, inspiring metaphor for it, in order to make the subconscious understand its impact. What follows is a transcript of the Aug. 1, 1996 dream that first gave him a direct metaphor to convey the wonder of what this experience might feel like when it actually comes. I was standing in a clearing where I could see a large image of the moon against a bluish sky. During this time, I noticed that there was a round circle of glowing light on the surface. I got excited as I realized that others reported seeing this same thing before, and that it was basically supposed to be a reflection from an extraterrestrial \"base\" on the Moon. As I watched it, it expanded into a fireball that was 1/3 of the width of the Moon in the middle. Then, it shrank back down to a point and expanded several more times, in a fluid expansion-contraction mode. It eventually overtook the whole moon and shone brilliantly in white, with a bluish tinge. Energy seemed to be coming in from the sides, and I was privy to the most fantastic special effects ever seen - reminiscent of what happened to Jupiter in Arthur C. Clarke's 2010, but even more incredible. The energy assembled itself into the form of a blue-white torus, like an inner tube. There was black in it as well. It seemed to roll off of the Moon while spinning around its internal center, moving closer towards me on Earth. I noticed about five thin circular bands of energy that were spinning around the torus faster than it was spinning itself. They had these sparkling \"stars\" that seemed to be of a luminescent, shimmering black orbit in the circle. The stars were black, the rest of the circle much lighter colored. It was all spinning and spiraling as it headed down towards me. All of the differing motions made for quite an impressive spectacle. It threatened to draw in everything that it contacted like some giant, living black hole. By this time, I was utterly and completely awestruck like never before. I felt like this was the most fantastic thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life. I began to fly up into the vortex, noticing that there was a blue ray on about a 45-degree angle that was connecting me back to the Earth somehow. It was at this time that I had realized that this had to be it - the big moment - the Ascension. I was so excited that I could hardly even believe it."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"As I flew up into it, it became a gigantic, 300-foot wide tunnel of swirling, blue-white light. It was very bright, but cool and not unpleasant. It appeared as though I were wrapped in the middle of an endless tunnel composed of galactic arms, spinning and turning. I seemed to be hardly more than a speck compared to the epic size and vastness of the vortex I was traveling through. Part of what made it so incredible was that there was absolutely no sound, except for the incredible shouts of ecstasy in my own mind. I could tell that I was rapidly moving closer towards a sparkling wall of this luminescent blue light at the end of the swirling cylinder. Once I passed through it, I would never be the same again. As all of this was happening, I felt an emotion not unlike fear. I thought to myself, \"Now? What will happen? A higher dimension? I can't believe it!\" I had a dim idea of what to expect there, but I felt that thought as just a remote patch in a corner of my mind. It was too indistinct. I really didn't know what to expect, but I didn't resist it. I basically was welcoming the experience. As my hands plunged into the blue light, it dissipated around them like water and vanished; I was on solid ground again... THE TEACHINGS OF RA After an experience of this magnitude, he obviously yearned to know more. He had already become familiar with the idea of Ascension as a possibility, but it was the sheer epic quality of this dream that made him ask even deeper questions. This dream directly led to a renewed interest in studying a series of books called the Ra Material and/or the Law of One , which were allegedly extraterrestrial communications. In these books, a Ph.D. physicist, university professor and airline pilot by the name of Don Elkins found the apex of his lifetime of research into the UFO phenomenon through telepathic contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. For twenty years he had been working with various gifted individuals who would go into trance and speak on behalf of these higher intelligences. And time after time, Dr. Elkins would ask them the most difficult, challenging questions coming from the forefront of his research into advanced physics, and he would get the answers. These answers were repeatedly coming from those who had no knowledge of these things while awake. It was at the end of this twenty-year period that Elkins' work with Carla Rueckert, a very successful channel, broke through to a much more substantial level. This breakthrough was directly precipitated by the arrival of Jim Mc Carty, who thought that he was coming to help Don and Carla catalog, categorize and organize the volumes of material that they had already produced. Instead, something totally unexpected happened. They attracted a true heavy-hitter of the higher realms, perhaps the main group responsible for our care: a huge spiritual group of entities that had apparently fused themselves into one single mind that called itself Ra, and said that they were from the sixth dimension, millions of years more advanced than modern humanity. The words and concepts were highly sophisticated and precise, unlike any other type of channeled material ever seen, and were referred to by one professor as \"akin to a Ph.D. dissertation on epistemology.\" As soon as Ra began speaking, they made it clear that this was the first time that they had been able to get through an undistorted series of messages in thousands of years of human history. Carla was brought to the complete unconscious state and taken out of her body for the Ra contact to occur, and had no"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"knowledge whatsoever of what had occurred while she was away. This contact occurred in 1981, well before the field of channeling had reached such a huge surge of rather repetitive, simplistic and contradictory information that is often seen on the Internet and in certain magazines and books today. For whatever reason, the work has never become very well-known, but this certainly is no fault of the material itself. The quality and gravity of the information that Ra presents is unlike any other that this author has ever seen. As David continued reading this material, he came to a greater and greater realization that what Ra was truly trying to convey to Dr. Elkins was a completely new view of physics as we now know it . In this new view, there are multiple dimensions, each one capable of sustaining intelligent lifeforms in time and space. Each dimensional level is higher or closer to Oneness than the one before it. Ra explained that those on Earth were on the third dimension, and that there were a full four dimensions of higher experience that we would go through before returning to the One Creator. At the point that this total reunion is accomplished, there would be no consciousness of any separation, only a consciousness of unity and Oneness. Ra also explained that each dimension gave different levels of teaching along the path to this Oneness, and that our own level was called \"The Choice.\" According to Ra, all that we have to do is choose whether we are going to be of service to self or service to others. The realization of the importance of serving others is our first step towards re- aligning with the Oneness that they so often spoke of. If we only think of ourselves as separate beings and do not choose to love and to help others, then we are forgetting that we are truly only One Being, and that therefore serving others is serving our own True Self. What this Oneness wants for us, says Ra, is to simply love and get along with each other, to spread harmony and truth. Obviously, this is an identical message to that which is spoken by most channelers now in the New Millennium. However, there were some very large differences between what Ra was saying and what the average channeler usually speaks in more recent times. We must remember that Ra was being interviewed by a very gifted physicist, and Dr. Elkins was often completely befuddled in his attempts to understand Ra's words. In the five books of the Law of One series, Ra lays out a comprehensive cosmology that is extremely internally consistent. David tried over and over again to find even one time when Ra contradicted themselves or appeared to falter, but could not. Even more importantly, this cosmology was not simply all in the realm of lofty speculation -- for all intents and purposes, Ra was systematically teaching Dr. Elkins about a whole new form of physics, a new form of understanding the way that the Universe functions, rooted in compassion, harmony and wisdom. Ra was pleased that Dr. Elkins was familiar with the work of physicist Dewey Larson, who proposed that space and time were in a reciprocal relationship -- meaning that for every dimension of space, there was a corresponding dimension of time. They also mentioned that there was a lot more to understand than what Larson had come up with, but that it was a good start. And as their words in the five books continued, they gave many very precise statements that indicated exactly what this system of physics was, and its impressive spiritual implications."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"As David read through the Law of One books and studied them in greater and greater detail, he realized that the systems that Ra were discussing were already becoming more and more visible in the scientific literature just since 1981, when the book was first published. The more he read, the more shocked he was to realize that apparently no one else had ever seen how many connections there really were, or that they even existed in the first place. Having already read and digested some 300 metaphysical titles by this point, David realized that the wisdom of Ra had now become a vast umbrella of truth that tied together many, many separate areas of study, providing answers where many other researchers had to work it out on their own. As time has progressed into the present, while this book is being rewritten, David has continued to find more and more scientific evidence to back up Ra's assertions. Earlier versions of this book were made available on the Internet as early as spring of 1998, but the amount of new information has significantly been enhanced since the book's inception. The version that you now hold in your hands is specifically designed to upgrade the existing body of information before launching into a three-book series that will retain the original name Convergence and will be investigating these same topics with even more depth than before. The crowning achievement of truly being able to decode the physics systems that Ra has described is the knowledge that the Earth is going to undergo a dimensional shift . Ra explains that there is a natural structure to the galaxy that we are all passing through at this time, a structure where certain portions of the galaxy have a higher concentration of \"energy\" than others. As we naturally pass into these areas of higher frequency, there are changes visible in our Sun as well as in the Earth itself. And even more importantly, there are changes in each one of us as well. Although we cannot know for sure how or when this event will actually occur in our own personal experience, we know that Ra tells us that at the conclusion of this shift, life on Earth will be fully 100 times more harmonious than it is now. All of the abilities that were demonstrated by Jesus and much more will be readily available to everyone. This is apparently not a gradual transition by any means, but an epic change that occurs in a very brief period of time, when the critical threshold in consciousness is finally reached. Quite significantly, our latest research has revealed that Ra was right about there being an underlying energy to the Universe that has fluidlike properties of vibration. Modern scientists call this \"zero-point energy\" or the \"virtual particle flux.\" We now know that there are 'virtual' counterparts to all the basic components of the atom, (such as protons, neutrons and electrons,) which appear to be exactly the same except that they continually \"wink\" in and out of existence. The discussions of zero-point energy have captivated the world of quantum mechanics as well as many other aspects of physics, as we now must conclude that all of reality that we see is fundamentally built up from an energy that remains hidden to us. And for many, this is not a very comfortable concept, as we like to \"get our hands\" on the world around us, not be confronted with a mysterious energy that we cannot directly measure. And yet, experiments and prototypes such as the Casimir effect, sonoluminescence, and anti-gravity / free energy devices have already proven that this energy must exist. In the future editions of this body of research, now in progress, we will cover"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the study of zero-point energy in far more detail. Modern researchers have brought back the forgotten term \"aether\" for this energy, as up until the beginning of the 20th century, scientists believed that it was there. As just indicated, those who now work with the concepts of the 'aether' have discovered that it can indeed be harnessed to produce all of the basic effects seen in the UFO, including anti-gravity, limitless generation of energy from \"empty space\" as well as the possible travel through higher-dimensional spaces. Clearly, our understandings about reality are changing very quickly, and David has continued to be impressed as each new finding only helps him to greater understand what Ra had already been saying all along in the Law of One series. Most of this book is dedicated to giving us a good, general overview for how this system of \"aether\" energy works, and how it is related to the dimensional shift that we are now approaching. We will see that the principles of vibration are the most fundamental in understanding the behavior of the aether, or what we might simply want to call spiritual energy. Part One of this book, The Harmonic, Multidimensional Universe , explains in the next chapter that the master organization of this energy is in an Octave of dimensions. Ra referred to the different levels as \"densities,\" as what we actually have is one unified energy that simply exists in different levels of concentration. It is the relative speed of vibration that determines each level of concentration, and we will show that there are three levels to this vibration that must be considered equally: light, sound and geometry. When we look at the aether itself, we see that it is comprised of a vast sea of energy \"units\" that we will refer to as Consciousness Units. Due to the basic laws of harmony and vibration, these units will always maintain a spherical field, but the characteristic vibrations of each \"density\" or dimension will give them a different \"color\", \"sound\" and geometric structure. We will take a look at the exact numbers that are involved in these harmonics, and see how much they reveal when studied more closely. More importantly, we will see that these consciousness units are not bound by space or time as we know it- they can be tinier than the tiniest subatomic particle or as large as the entire Universe itself. In Chapter Three we explain how the Ancients knew of this system of three- dimensional geometric vibrations, and built structures such as the pyramids to harness these forces. We will also look into the idea that very similar structures known as the Martian Monuments fit this pattern as well. We also will take a look at the amazing structure and complexity of the Great Pyramid itself, especially at the time that it was first built, and with our understandings of this universal energy source it becomes quite easy to see that it truly is an artifact of a higher level of technology than we now possess. In Chapter Four we explain how modern physics is beginning to catch up to this ancient knowledge through such things as \"Superstring Theory.\" Then, we bring in a quote from the well-known entity Seth, channeled by Jane Roberts in the late 60's and for years afterwards, which reveals that almost identical information to this advanced theoretical physics concept had been given well before Superstring Theory or the Ra books ever came about. In Chapter Five we begin looking at the true father of all current multi- dimensional physics models, an Indian mathematician known as Srinivasa Ramanujan. We will clearly see that Ramanujan's information was acquired through a mystic process that bears remarkable similarity to channeling. Furthermore, we will see that the key number of dimensions in Ramanujan's"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"models was always eight, thus lending further support to Ra's model of an Octave. In Chapter Six we devote a great deal of space to an exploration of a passage dictated by Seth in 1971, which gives us a much greater understanding of how the sphere-based \"consciousness units\" of aether energy function in our Universe. Then, in Chapter Seven we will see that the extraterrestrial forces are continuing to try to teach us this information through the \"crop circle\" phenomenon. In these pictograms which emerge overnight in various crops, often accompanied by anomalous sightings and inexplicable heating and bending of the crops themselves, we find all the blueprints for this model of harmonic aether geometry in place. We specifically zero in on a formation known as Barbury Castle 1991, and show how precisely it displays this complex three-dimensional information, both literally and symbolically as well. We also investigate the work of Gerald Hawkins, who proved that the most common formations that were seen in the crops were directly related to musical proportions, in a perfect harmonic relationship. With this knowledge in place we open up Part Two of the book, Planetary Grids and Ancient Knowledge . In this section, we explore how these geometries directly affect the fundamentals of the Earth itself. Science is now catching up with Ra in revealing that these aetheric energies or \"consciousness units\" are constantly streaming in and out of all physical objects in the Universe, continually forming them moment by moment. We remember that size does not affect these units, and that the sphere of the planet itself can resonate as one massive \"unit\" in its own right. Once we know that such behavior is expected of the Earth in the new physics, all we have to do is start looking for it. We then begin Chapter Nine by discussing the work of Bruce Cathie in this regard. Cathie gave clear evidence that extraterrestrial beings were navigating the earth using a geometric \"grid\" that consists of the simple cube and octahedron geometries, crisscrossing over the Earth's surface. Cathie made incredible strides in decoding the harmonic structures of these energies, all of which ties in very neatly with the models that Ra espoused in the Law of One series. Furthermore, Cathie's model does indeed provide a harmonic basis for the Unified Field Theory of physics, which may well prove to be his most lasting accomplishment. We also include some of Ra's quotes in this chapter to help the reader see the connections that are involved. In Chapter 10, we discuss the Philadelphia Experiment as one of a number of examples that help to show us that a simple magnetic field, when used to create the proper harmonic and geometric vibrational frequencies, can actually concentrate aetheric energy in a local area and cause a dimensional shift to occur. This well-known experiment supposedly was the result of a Navy experiment in radar invisibility that went awry. In the future, it may well be a usable \"teleport\" technology. We also remind ourselves that the far greater aspect to this energetic change is occurring in our Solar System as a whole, relative to our placement to the center of the galaxy and aided by the harmonic cycles that we will find in the Sun. Then, in Chapter 11 we continue our exploration of the Global Grid with this knowledge of the energies involved as being very real, and quite possibly engineerable. The work of Richard Hoagland and the Enterprise Mission is cited as a means of showing us how the geometry of the \"aether\" emerges in planets. Through an analysis of the Martian Monuments, Hoagland's team discovered that an encoded message was set forth which gave precise"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"information for future visitors to decode the basics of the aetheric physics discussed by Ra. This fundamentally comes about through the observation of a tetrahedron inside a sphere, which we will have already seen in Chapter Seven. Hoagland's team went on to show this tetrahedron as an underlying energy structure in almost every planet in our Solar System, responsible for cloud bands, giant volcanoes, sunspots and giant swirling vortices such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Then, after establishing the placement of the tetrahedron with the cube and octahedron that we had already been investigating from Bruce Cathie, we begin investigating the work of Carl Munck, who showed us how these energetic forces on Earth were precisely harnessed by the Ancients. Through Munck's work, known as \"The Code,\" we see that almost every single pyramid, sacred site and earthwork from ancient times on the planet is part of a vast, planet-wide matrix of coordinates, centered at the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. We bring in an excerpt from the Wilcock Readings as he struggled to understand how to unify the work of Munck with Bruce Cathie, Richard Hoagland and other \"Grid\" researchers we will meet in the next chapter. In Chapter 12 we complete our geometric mapping of the higher dimensions on Earth through the investigation of the work of Ivan P. Sanderson, then Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov and culminating with professors William Becker and Bethe Hagens. The only two of the five basic \"Platonic\" geometries left undiscovered at this point were the icosahedron and dodecahedron, as Cathie showed us the cube and octahedron and Hoagland showed us the tetrahedron. We see that Sanderson discovered the presence of the icosahedron through a careful study of worldwide \"trouble spots\" for marine and air travel such as the Bermuda Triangle. His exhaustive efforts came up with twelve fundamental \"Devil's Graveyards,\" all of which were spaced in perfect harmonic proportions from each other. When these spots are connected together, an icosahedron is formed. The Russian scientists Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov expanded on this idea by including the dodecahedron in the Grid model as well, and they suddenly realized that the combined icosahedron / dodecahedron grid appeared to be directly responsible for the positioning of continents, mountain ranges and undersea ridges, as well as weather and population centers, animal migration patterns and anomalous distortions in space and time as first cataloged by Sanderson. Furthermore, they realized that almost every sacred site or monument on Earth was fundamentally connected to this Grid. When the work of Becker and Hagens is then added in, we find that they provide a Grid model of 120 interconnecting triangles that unifies all five of the Platonic Solids as one, and also reveals even more detailed results about how these energies are operating on the Earth. We also introduce our own independent research, which shows that various island chains on the Earth's surface form precise \"grid circles\" that are clearly related to the structure of the Becker/Hagens grid itself. We also investigate a series of reports regarding the mysterious disappearances and time-warping effects seen at various points on this Grid. Then, in chapter 13, we introduce information from Dr. Lefors Clark regarding the behavior of magnetism, and how it can form \"diamagnetic vortices\" as it travels. These vortices help explain exactly what we are seeing in the Grid Circles, and how the natural aetheric forces in the Grid brought them about. We then give a much closer look to the five Platonic Solids themselves, in order to see more clearly how they are directly related"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"to the interconnecting system of harmonics that we have been discussing. Then, we again bring in the work of Carl Munck, who revealed a very fundamental connection between the Speed of Light and the harmonic numbers of sound which suggest that they are actually functions of the same unified energy source . Although Bruce Cathie revealed the same thing in his own harmonic system, the connection discovered by Munck is arrived at in a totally different way, but with the same conclusions. Then, in Chapter 14 we suggest that those who built this Grid never really faded out of view, they simply went into secrecy. We show the clear connections between modern \"secret societies\" such as the Freemasons and these ancient truths, including photographs of the mural that was erected in the UN, which clearly show us that its builders were well aware of sacred geometry and \"consciousness units\" in some form, and hence a working knowledge of the entire system of harmonic physics in general. We also see similar coded information emerging in the Great Seal of the United States. We then discuss the idea that a \"Hall of Records\" preserved from Atlantean times exists under the Giza plateau in Egypt, and cite the controversial research of Aaron Du Val who apparently worked with one Dr. Scott who claims to have found identical records in other areas, beginning with the alleged Atlantean ruins off the Florida coast near Bimini. Then, having completed our investigation of the Global Grid, we move into Part Three and expand the window of understanding this system of physics to larger-scale harmonic events occurring in time . The main time cycle that we will be investigating is that of our Sun, hence the title for Part Three: The Great Solar Cycle . In Chapter 15, we again return to the words of Ra to discuss this cycle, what it is and how it functions. We introduce the idea of the Earth's precession, a long-term wobble that takes 25,920 years to complete and is precisely mirrored in Ra's discussion of the Solar Cycle. We also correlate this with the well-known trance writings of Edgar Cayce, as few realize that he also spoke of a Solar Cycle as well. Excerpts from Ra explain exactly what we can look forward to as we approach this event, which they refer to as \"harvest.\" In Chapter 16, we bring in the work of Maurice Cotterell, who has made discoveries that completely bolster the findings in the Ra books, but were not even begun until years after the contact had ended. Through long-term mapping of the Sun's counter-opposing speeds of rotation, he came out with a series of graphs that predicted very long-term cycles in its activity -- cycles far longer than modern science would want to accept. We then see that identical numbers as seen in Cotterell's work were actually known and recorded by the Maya thousands of years ago. Part of this study involves the Mayan Calendar, a complex instrument for measuring the passage of time in roughly 5,125-year increments. In Chapter 17 we discuss the work of ex-NASA astrophysicist Maurice Chatelain, who further enhanced humanity's understanding of the Mayan Calendar. Although Chatelain's ultimate hypothesis about the dating of the Calendar can be proven incorrect, his insights regarding the importance of Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions are crucial in understanding how this system of physics operates in our Solar System. We continue our discussion of Chatelain's work in Chapter 18, where we bring in his discoveries of even longer-term cycles in our Solar System through the Constant of Nineveh. This constant is an harmonic expression of all the orbits of our Solar System down to the second, and every time that it completes a cycle we could think of it as"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"being a time when all the planets would be in a perfectly straight line. We will also show that this number was charted by the Sumerians thousands of years ago . Even more importantly, the entire number can be built up by multiplying 70 seven times by 60, thus giving us a valuable clue to the ultimate harmonic simplicity of the cycles that are at work. This is followed by Chapter 19, which starts off with the work of Bradley Cowan, who has shown clear evidence of geometric structures in time that directly affect human behavior in stock trading, thus giving us a clearer picture of the underlying nature of all the cycles we have been looking at. We then detail Wilcock's own discoveries that neatly expand the Nineveh Constant out to a galactic level, revealing it to be a precise harmonic of the time that it takes the galaxy to complete one rotation. This discovery lends even more credibility to Ra's ideas about there being different areas of harmonic energy concentration in the galaxy, areas that we may well be moving into at this time. Our own Earth's precession is also very fundamentally related to this Constant through simple harmonic proportions as well, thus showing us the true Galactic scope of the Solar Cycle. We then go further to reveal that Cotterell's work reveals that three Earth precessional cycles must be included in order to make a perfect fit with the cycles that are seen in the Sun, and again this information is precisely mirrored in the statements from the Ra Material. Viewing all of this information together, and reviewing all the changes that are occurring around us now, we can certainly see how far the validity of Ra's statements really goes. In Chapter 20 we conclude our mission by looking at the work of \"cyclology,: which shows historic events repeating in harmonic time intervals. We return to the Great Pyramid to reveal that the crown jewel of its hidden message is a timeline that relates to our present point in history very directly. Clear evidence of this elaborate system is presented, along with a powerful suggestion -- that the conclusion of the timeline itself is now, and is associated with a passage to the stars and / or those from the stars coming to us. As this event in the Timeline occurs in our near future, we are again convinced that our Atlantean / extraterrestrial brothers were very well aware of what we would be going through at this point in our history, and were intent on giving us a valuable means of predicting it in advance. Once we see the reality of this massive \"prophecy in stone,\" it becomes quite difficult to deny the message. We then follow with our conclusion in Chapter 21, where we will review all of the material and reveal a few more surprises as well. And so, without further ado, let us begin. Even if we choose not to believe that every portion of the research is valid, we will clearly be able to see the connections, and this will greatly assist us in trusting that we are indeed going through a process that is for our highest and best good. It is a process that might just have a fantastic \"surprise ending\" that none of us could have ever expected until it actually happens. If Ra's statements are accurate, no one person could ever possibly fathom the incredible joy and bliss that awaits us as we transfer into this higher realm of being, where a Utopian world of science fantasy and pure love becomes the reality of each and every \"day.\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 02 HARMONIC DIMENSIONS: The Architecture of the One CHAPTER 02: HARMONIC DIMENSIONS: The Architecture of the One This chapter begins your initiation into the hidden history of planet Earth, which is our first major key in unlocking the secrets of the Universe. Keep in mind that certain concepts that some find difficult to make “room” for in their minds need to be installed early along, and that there is a big payoff to having this information in mind later on. As always, if a certain part stumps you, just continue reading along, as what matters is the overall vision, not the specifics. The discussions in this book will increasingly lead the reader to the understanding that the ancient world knew a lot more about the real way that things work than we do right now in the mainstream. If we want to understand how the physical Universe really “works,” including the spiritual connections, some of our best pieces of evidence will be found in the written and physical relics of the distant past. Indeed, we can no longer deny that a very advanced civilization existed at least 12,500 years ago, and possibly much farther into the mists of remote antiquity than that as well. For those who are interested in pursuing this knowledge and research further, the following contemporary books are a brief sampling of some of those that have demonstrated themselves as being quite academic, reputable and enlightening: The Mysteries of Atlantis Revisited by Edgar Evans Cayce Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock When the Sky Fel l by Rand and Rose Flem-Ath The Orion Mystery by Robert Bauval and Adrian Gilbert Message of the Sphinx by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval From Atlantis to the Sphinx by Colin Wilson SPHINX WATER WEATHERING The most common argument of “proof” that one will encounter when reading the above books and others like them has now been dubbed as the “smoking gun” of the case for Atlantis. We are hereby referring to the observable fact that the Great Sphinx of Egypt, situated directly next to the three main pyramids on the Gizeh plateau, shows unmistakable signs of having been weathered by water . There certainly isn’t any water in the Egyptian desert at the present time, nor was there any in the times typically cited for the construction of the pyramids. This is easy enough to prove through direct geological studies of the surrounding lands. This intriguing pattern of weathering on the Sphinx was originally observed by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, a brilliant scholar and thorough researcher who completely redefined humanity's understandings of ancient Egypt and Atlantis through the mid-1900's. Contemporary author John Anthony West re-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"discovered this anomalous weathering pattern, which was rather casually mentioned in de Lubicz's book The Temple of Man , and realized that it was clearly something that was testable and provable that had been almost miraculously overlooked in the past. And after many, many failed attempts to gain the support of myriad geologists, West was able to find cooperation with Robert Schoch, a young but well-respected expert in the field, having already written four published books on archeology by his late 20's. Schoch was reluctant to investigate West’s hypothesis until he was certain that he had secured tenure at his academic organization, but by the beginning of the 1990's he was ready to proceed. West and Schoch then finally traveled to Egypt and realized that the case was even more powerful than they had previously thought; there were overwhelmingly redundant signs of water weathering everywhere they looked, both on the Sphinx and nearby temples made of huge stone blocks as well. The Sphinx was carved out of limestone, which is a conglomerate of sandy particles that have fused together into a solid. Wind erosion produces stratified, horizontally ribbed surfaces in limestone that look like the pages on the side of an old book, as certain layers of the conglomerate rock will be thinner and weaker and certain layers thicker and stronger. The thicker areas of limestone will resist the power of the wind more strongly and thus erode less, whereas the thinner layers will disappear more quickly, thus producing an uneven surface that most of us have probably seen in desert photographs, or perhaps even in person. On the other hand, water erosion produces smooth, sensuous curves that cut directly down into the rock regardless of its thickness, forming rounded corners, snakelike rivulets and crevices. The signs of this erosion are so obvious that when West disguised the Sphinx out of the pictures with tape, all geologists who he showed the images to could agree that it was a picture of a rock outcrop with water erosion . However, once West removed the tape and showed them where the picture was from, they immediately grew agitated and did not want to discuss it any further, for the simple fear of losing their reputation. Dr. Schoch was the first geologist to face the facts and stake his own reputation on the obvious. And since we all know that Egypt is now a desert, the Sphinx simply must have been built at a time when a lush, green jungle climate with abundant rainfall was in existence . And even the most outrageously conservative geological estimates for there to be enough water in Egypt to create such formations date back to at least 7,000 BC, and most would agree that 9,000 BC is a far more realistic figure; and that is simply the most recent time that there was any rainfall at all . You must then also factor in exactly how long it would take for such advanced water weathering to occur – certainly not a few hundred years but potentially many thousands . And so, even if one was to throw away the multitudes of other solid evidence that exists in support of an advanced ancient civilization, we can still come back to the Sphinx. Once we know what we are looking for, we will realize that this is only one of the more obvious means of proving that the historical \"Atlantean\" culture – i.e. an ancient advanced civilization – had a precedent in fact. ROBERT BAUVAL AND THE \"GIZA ALIGNMENT\""},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The next popular academic argument for “Atlantis” came from Robert Bauval in “ The Orion Mystery ,” from the early 1990s, though Dr. J.J. Hurtak originally mentioned the same concept in The Keys of Enoch in the 1970s. The three main Pyramids of Egypt at Giza are arranged in close proximity to each other, and Bauval was curious about the apparent lack of symmetry or geometry in their layout. He knew that there had to be some reason for why they were aligned in the way that is now seen overhead. Inspiration finally struck as he looked up at the constellation of Orion, which has three main stars that form the middle section, referred to as the \"belt.\" He realized that the Pyramids of Giza were configured in precisely the same manner as the \"belt\" of Orion , and he quickly proved his point by overlaying the site maps of the Pyramids and the star maps of Orion's belt on top of each other. Not only was each Pyramid in the proper position, but even the relative sizes and colors of the Pyramids were directly proportional to the magnitudes and colors of the stars in Orion's belt. (The Cheops and Khefren pyramids were both originally covered in white limestone and are approximately the same size, like the two main stars in Orion’s belt, whereas the Menkaure pyramid is significantly smaller and was originally encased in red granite, just like the dimmer and redder third star.) As Bauval continued to investigate the matter, he realized that the architects of Giza had created a perfect duplication of the starry heavens on Earth – an idea that fit in perfectly with their concept of the connection between the physical world and the Duat , or spiritual world. Furthermore, the position of the Nile River relative to the Pyramids was identical to the position of the Milky Way relative to Orion's belt in the starry night sky. Further Pyramids near Giza seemed to suggest that several other significant stars of Orion and the nearby Hyades constellation were immortalized in stone on the Earth as well. Figure 2.1 – Robert Bauval's Comparison of Orion/Milky Way with Giza/Nile"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Though this alignment is intriguing, it does not appear to give us any new information about the time that the pyramids were built. However, by using a program known as Skyglobe , Bauval realized that the only \"recent\" time that the Milky Way would be perfectly aligned with the Nile River was roughly 12,500 years ago. At that time, and only at that time, (unless you were willing to travel back more than 30,000 years ago,) one could stand on Earth and observe the Pyramids and Nile River at a distance, and watch the Nile align directly with the Milky Way, while the stars of Orion's belt would perfectly align with the positions of the terrestrial pyramids. This is caused by the phenomenon of the Earth’s precession, a long-term wobble in its rotational path that we will discuss later. As a simple, preliminary explanation of precession, you would normally expect that when you get to the same time each year, where the Earth is at a specific angle to the Sun, such as the equinox or solstice, then all the stars should be in the same positions from year to year on that date. Nevertheless, the stars in the night sky will drift from those visible positions by one degree every 72 years, tracing a full circular path through an area of the night sky about every 25,920 years. If you build a temple to align with a star at the solstice time, then within a relatively short time your descendants would realize that something was causing these star positions to shift out of their previous alignment. So, it was clear that Bauval had found a time capsule, an encoded archeological matrix of information designed to show the exact time that the entire complex was first designed and planned. Clearly, the ancient architects were very clever to design such a system. Another layer of “proof” is the fact that during this same time frame, and only during this time frame, the Sphinx directly faces the constellation of Leo the Lion, due to its position in the Earth’s precession. This whole body of findings is so obvious and compelling that it has completely bypassed the prejudiced “peer review” of mainstream archeology and gone directly into the public consciousness through documentaries on Discovery Channel and the like. SUPER-ADVANCED DRILLING Another recent breakthrough in the argument for a lost civilization with high technology comes from Christopher Dunn, whose main expertise is in drilling. He has definitively proven that certain artifacts, including the empty coffin or \"Granite Coffer\" that is featured in the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid, show signs of super-advanced drilling techniques that surpass anything now in our possession. Dunn analyzed the Granite Coffer and found unmistakable evidence that indicated that it had been hollowed out with some form of tube- shaped drill that would core out a piece at a time. The spiraling patterns that were left behind in the granite showed that this drill was capable of boring through 1/10th of an inch of rock per second . However, granite is such a hard stone that even our most modern diamond-tipped drilling systems can do no better than 1/100th of an inch per second , meaning that the ancient technology used works ten times better than any method now at our disposal. In books such as Fingerprints of the Gods , Graham Hancock points out another intriguing aspect of Dunn’s work. In various ancient Egyptian tombs we see carved vases and statues of diorite , which is a dark-colored material"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"that is considered to be one of the hardest forms of stone on earth. These vases have very long and thin necks, and are carved out from one single piece of diorite. The openings on some vases are not even large enough for a child's finger to fit inside, and yet their inner contents were hollowed out perfectly . So now we must not only visualize a drill that puts our current designs to shame, but a drill that must have flexibility as well, in order to produce a tiny hole and then move around inside. Dunn's conclusion is that the Ancients must have been in possession of a drilling technique that far outstrips anything that we now possess. He goes on further to suggest that these ancient drills might have utilized ultrasonic sound somehow, thus working in a similar fashion to how the repetitive vibration of a jackhammer carves up concrete streets and sidewalks. But even then, he is at a loss to explain how they could have carved the diorite vases. While these findings do not give an exact date for when such work would be produced, they certainly do not appear to be consonant with any technological developments in known Egyptian history. They appear to be much more in tune with a society that had technical capabilities equal to or exceeding our own. ANCIENT AIRCRAFT Frontier scientist Richard Hoagland's research team The Enterprise Mission , at www.enterprisemission.com/tombsweb3.html , pointed out another relatively new and interesting development in the proof for a lost technological society. Among other points, Hoagland et al. discuss the recent findings of German scientists Dr. Algund Eeboom and Mr. Peter Belting. Several small gold trinkets have been recovered from tombs of the Incas, dating back thousands of years. These trinkets clearly depict structures that undeniably appear to be workable flying airplanes, complete with what appear to be gun turrets on some of the wings. See for yourself: Figure 2.2 – Eeboom and Belting’s discovery of ancient gold trinkets of working aircraft. In order to prove that these tiny models represented real airplanes, Eeboom and Belting collaborated together to design perfect schematic diagrams of the tiny objects. They then expanded the proportions of these blueprints large enough to build workable scale models. And to their amazement, they found that by simply putting a propeller at the front and stabilizers on the wings, the planes not only flew but were capable of performing complex aeronautical maneuvers via remote control. See the above link for more details and photographs of their prototype in action. Hoagland et al. also point out the far more well-known fact that working bird- shaped gliders have been found within tombs in Egypt. Since these gliders also possess remarkable similarity to working airplanes and are capable of long flights when thrown, we must assume that the ancient Egyptians were also well aware of this technology. With the evidence now seen from the Incan tombs above, we may suppose that the bird gliders were simply children's toy"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"models of systems that were in much more common use at one time. And so, if we are seeing workable airplane models being built as small gold statuettes and wooden models in two different ancient cultures separated by the Atlantic, we certainly can assume that a large-scale technological society with full-sized, working aircraft may have been in existence at one time as well. It is frustrating that we have not found any full-sized models. However, after a hypothesized 12,500 years of time passing, we should expect that any such structures made of wood or metal would have long since deteriorated. The Atlantean lore from the Edgar Cayce readings states that almost the entire concentration of that society was on an island in the Atlantic that included present-day Cuba and outlying areas as well, and which subsided under ocean waters, known as “Poseidia.” And if the modern toys of our society were suddenly subjected to a vast cataclysm and promptly left unattended for 12,500 years, the savage action of tidal waves, land subsidence, rust, tornadoes, hurricanes, rising sea levels, glaciers, natural disasters and all other forms of growth and decay would most likely completely wipe out all remnants of things such as wooden houses, hollow buildings and skyscrapers of glass, and metallic automobiles, trains or airplanes. So therefore, despite their toy-like appearance, which may indeed have been the playthings of children at one time, these tiny gold statuettes could well have been considered very sacred objects – some of the sole remaining fragments of a culture of “Gods” destroyed in the seas of Time. These precious models were held onto and possibly copied over and reduplicated for thousands of years by the survived \"Atlantean\" cultures of the Incas and Egyptians before being buried in their tombs. They may well have been the direct symbols of a lost \"time of the Gods\" when humankind had conquered the skies and could fly around at will, with the gifts of advanced technology. SUBMERGED CITIES If one still is not convinced by working ancient airplanes, special time-encoded alignments, super-advanced drilling and water weathering on the Sphinx, an even more impressive “smoking gun” is now available in the mainstream. As of late 2001, Paul Weinzweig and Paulina Zelitsky of Advanced Digital Communications, a company dedicated to using advanced undersea scanning technology to salvage shipwrecks, discovered a massive city of “pyramids, roads and buildings” some 2000 feet down under the sea on the western edge of Cuba. Right as we were putting this final revised chapter together, this story broke for the first time into the mainstream media, through an article by Kevin Sullivan for the Washington Post newspaper, page A25, on Thursday, October 10, 2002. Read for yourself: HAVANA – The images appear slowly on the video screen, like ghosts from the ocean floor. The videotape, made by an unmanned submarine, shows massive stones in oddly symmetrical square and pyramid shapes in the deep- sea darkness. Sonar images taken from a research ship 2,000 feet above are even more puzzling. They show that the smooth, white stones are laid out in a geometric pattern . The images look like fragments of a city, in a place where nothing man-made should exist, spanning nearly eight square miles of a deep-ocean"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"plain off Cuba's western tip... The discovery immediately sparked speculation about Atlantis , the fabled lost city first described by Plato in 360 B.C.. Weinzweig and Zelitsky were careful not to use the A word and said that much more study was needed before such a conclusion could be reached. But that has not stopped a boomlet of speculation, most of it on the Internet. Atlantis-hunters have long argued their competing theories that the lost city was off Cuba, off the Greek island of Crete, off Gibraltar or elsewhere. Several Web sites have touted the ADC images as a possible first sighting. Among those who suspect the site may be Atlantis is George Erikson, a California anthropologist who co-authored a book in which he predicted that the lost city would be found offshore in the tropical Americas. \"I have always disagreed with all the archaeologists who dismiss myth,\" said Erikson, who said he had been shunned by many scientists since publishing his book about Atlantis. He said the story has too many historical roots to be dismissed as sheer fantasy and that if the Cuban site proves to be Atlantis, he hopes \"to be the first to say, 'I told you so.' \" Manuel Iturralde, one of Cuba's leading geologists, said it was too soon to know what the images prove. He has examined the evidence and concluded that, \"It's strange, it's weird; we've never seen something like this before, and we don't have an explanation for it.\" Iturralde said volcanic rocks recovered at the site strongly suggest that the undersea plain was once above water, despite its extreme depth . He said the existence of those rocks was difficult to explain, especially because there are no volcanoes in Cuba. He also said that if the symmetrical stones are determined to be the ruins of buildings, it could have taken 50,000 years or more for tectonic shifting to carry them so deep into the ocean . The ancient Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is only about 5,000 years old, which means the Cuba site \"wouldn't fit with what we know about human architectural evolution,\" he said. [emphasis added] If we read this article with a clear and open mind, it isn’t hard to see that the “disclosure timeline” that so many in the metaphysical community believe to exist is now being pushed forward. The skepticism borders on the ridiculous, especially once we learn that the pyramids are indeed perfect replicas of those still visible in Mesoamerica, that the “ geometric pattern ” of the “ smooth, white stones ” is in some cases exactly the same design as Stonehenge, and that obviously manmade inscriptions such as crosses have been observed and filmed on the stones. Furthermore, Zelitsky leaked to Enterprise Mission’s chief investigator Richard Hoagland that they have also found giant Sphinx statues as well . Let us not forget the priests who refused to look through Galileo’s telescope, because they literally did not want to see the proof that they were wrong. So, regardless of what you choose to name it, the ancient civilization did exist. Period. And the Edgar Cayce readings said that before the final parts of Atlantis sank, the island continent of Poseidia was the center of population, and was located where Cuba and the Yucatan are now."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Thankfully, National Geographic is planning a full-blown manned submarine mission to the site in summer 2003. Originally it was promised for summer of 2002, but “funding problems” interrupted the process. Perhaps “someone” didn’t think the world was ready yet... and we’ll explain why that is later in this chapter. ATLANTEAN LITERATURE Contrary to what many might believe, even those who have been studying the subject for a long time, there do appear to be certain sources of literature that have survived from the time of Atlantis. The most informative material to provide an explanation for the airplane models that we discussed above comes from the Vedic scriptures of India. According to David Hatcher Childress in the book Vimana Aircraft of Ancient India and Atlantis , The India of 15,000 years ago is sometimes known as the Rama Empire, a land that was contemporary with Atlantis. A huge wealth of texts still extant in India testify to the extremely advanced civilization that is said by these texts to go back over 26,000 years. Terrible wars and subsequent earth changes destroyed these civilizations, leaving only isolated pockets of civilization. The devastating wars of the (Hindu scripture known as the) Ramayana and particularly of the Mahabrata are said to have been the culmination of the terrible wars of the last Kali Yuga, (or cosmic cycle of time.) The dating process is difficult, in that there is no exact way to date the yugas because there are cycles within cycles and yugas within yugas. A greater yuga cycle is said to last 6000 years while a smaller yuga cycle is only 360 years in the theory expounded by Dr. Kunwarlal Jain Vyas. His papers said that Rama belongs to the twenty-fourth small yuga cycle and that there is an interval of 71 cycles between Manu and Mahabrata period, which comes out to be 26,000 years. Clearly, if the smaller Hindu cycle of time is 360 years and the authors of their scriptures have diligently counted at least 71 of them, we are dealing with a civilization that is far older than we are currently willing to acknowledge. More importantly, within the voluminous Vedic scriptures are repeated references to vimanas, or flying craft, as well as the usage of what appear to be devastating nuclear weapons. Indeed, some of the Vedic descriptions of the vimana so perfectly match our modern concept of an airplane that scholars invariably use this word when translating them into English. To elaborate a bit further on this point, we will cite a quotation from Dr. Richard L. Thompson's book Alien Identities. Thompson is a Cornell graduate whose Ph.D. is in mathematics, and who also has a deep interest in Vedic studies and UFOlogy. His book actually stands fast as one of the few genuine breakthrough texts in UFOlogy today, where an author made significant new discoveries instead of simply rehashing second-hand accounts of events such as the purported crash at Roswell. And so, from Chapter 7, pgs. 260-261, we read the following, with underlines and comments that we inserted: [The ancient author] Bhoja's [text, called] Samarangana-sutradhara , states that the main material of a flying machine [or vimana's] body is light wood, or laghu-daru. The craft has the shape of a large bird with a wing on each side . The motive force is provided by a fire-chamber with mercury placed over a"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"flame. The power generated by the heated mercury, helped by the flapping of the wings by a rider inside, causes the machine to fly through the air. Since the craft was equipped with an engine, we can speculate that the flapping of the wings was intended to control the direction of flight rather than provide the motive power... [Note: The idea of the \"flapping of the wings\" could simply be an error in translation by successive Vedic authors, initially referring to the pilot's utilization of the ailerons and stabilizers to steer the plane as it flew.] I would suggest that the vimanas described by Bhoja are much more similar to conventional airplanes than to UFOs. Thus they are made of ordinary materials like wood, they have wings, and they fly like birds... However these vimanas were actually powered, it seems likely that they relied on some conventional mechanical method that extracted energy from burning fuel and used it to produce a flow of air over wings. We can contrast this with the flight characteristics of UFOs which don't have wings, jets or propellers, and seem to fly in a manner that contradicts known physical principles. The Vedic description of a possible nuclear blast, culled directly from page 677 of the transcription of the ancient Drona Parva text itself, is enough to give us chills even now. Despite its horrific contents, we have inserted it here to remind ourselves of what we have done to each other in our own past: The valiant Adwatthaman, then staying resolutely on his (vimana) touched water and invoked the Agneya weapon, incapable of being resisted by the very Gods. Aiming at all his visible and invisible foes, the preceptor's son, that Slayer of hostile heroes, inspired with mantras a blazing shaft of the effulgence of a smokeless fire and let it off on all sides, filled with rage. Dense showers of arrows then issued from it in the welkin. Endued with fiery flames those arrows encompassed Parthie on all sides. Meteors flashed down from the firmament. A thick gloom suddenly shrouded the (Pandava) host. All points of the compass also were enveloped by that darkness... Inauspicious winds began to blow. The Sun himself no longer gave any heat... The very elements seemed to be perturbed... The Universe scorched with heats seemed to be in a fever. The elephants and other creatures of the land scorched by the energy of that weapon, ran in fright, breathing heavily and desirous of protection against that terrible force. The very water being heated, the creatures residing in that element, O Bharata, became exceedingly uneasy and seemed to burn... Huge elephants burnt by that weapon, fell down on the Earth all around, uttering fierce cries loud as those of the clouds. Other huge elephants, scorched by that fire, ran hither and thither, roared aloud in fear, as if in the midst of a forest conflagration. The steeds, O King, and the cars also burnt by that weapon looked, O Sire, like the tops of trees burnt in a forest fire. Indeed, if this is not a terrifying description of the usage of a nuclear device in anger, then how do we explain all the connections that are so easily seen? Is it for this reason that Robert Oppenheimer, one of the fathers of the nuclear bomb, was quoted as saying upon the first test of a modern prototype, loosely paraphrased, “ This is not the first time that mankind has exploded a nuclear"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"devic e?” VISITORS FROM SPACE So, throughout the course of researching this subject, we will see that there is overwhelming tangible evidence, including written texts and an eight-mile square city of pyramids, roads and buildings on the sea floor of western Cuba, supporting the existence of a lost advanced civilization. It is important for us to remember that the descriptions of this civilization are only tangentially similar to our own - and most of the similarities have to do with technology. According to many, many different sources, including the Vedic scriptures, the Atlantean culture was far more spiritually centered than our current culture could ever possibly be. They simply shared an entirely different perspective on reality, one wherein some important fundamental truths of the Universe were far more understood, and explained in ways that are unfamiliar to most of us upon first glance. Schwaller de Lubicz's works go into extensive detail about this completely separate paradigm espoused by the Ancients - and as we progress further, we will have quotes from a scholar named Manly Palmer Hall who will help us to understand that symbolism is a very significant portion of this spiritual paradigm. Furthermore, as we already stated there are ample historical texts and data from all over the world that support the idea that the Atlantean civilization was routinely visited by and in cooperation with extraterrestrial intelligence . Joseph Campbell, writing under the pen name “Ernest Scott,” i.e. the “Earnest Scotsman ,” referred to this intelligence as the “ Hidden Directorate ” in his book The People of the Secret . Past civilizations such as Atlantis apparently established an advanced rapport with these visitors. The scholarly work entitled Gods and Spacemen of the Ancient East by W. Raymond Drake provides a truly worldwide cultural perspective on cooperative human – extraterrestrial interaction in ancient history. The historical accounts that Drake invokes come from such diverse civilizations as India, Sumer, Tibet, China, Japan, Egypt, Israel and Babylon – and the book significantly repairs the damage done by the likes of Erich Von Daniken, who apparently falsified a great deal of data to come up with his conclusions regarding such interactions in books like the 1970’s best-seller Chariots of the Gods . To help us support our continuing argument for an advanced civilization that cooperated with extraterrestrials / higher dimensional beings in the remote past, we again bring in evidence from India cited in Dr. Thompson's book, page 216-217. Here, he discusses the various \"powers\" known as siddhis that cosmic or extraterrestrial beings visiting earth at the time, [which he calls \" Vedic humanoids ,\"] frequently discussed in the Vedas, had readily available to them. These siddhis were also said to be available to certain illuminated human masters as well : • Mental communication and thought-reading. These are standard among Vedic humanoids, but normal speech through sound is also generally used. • Being able to see or hear at a great distance. • Laghima-siddhi: levitation or antigravity. There is also a power of creating tremendous weight. • Anima- and mahima-siddhis: the power to change the size of objects or living bodies without disrupting their structure. • Prapti-siddhi: the power to move objects from one place to another, apparently without crossing the intervening space. This power is connected"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"with the ability to travel into parallel, higher-dimensional realms. • The ability to move objects directly through the ether, without being impeded by gross physical obstacles. This type of travel is called vihayasa. There is also a type of travel called mano-java, in which the body is directly transferred to a distant point by the action of the mind. • Vasita-siddhi: the power of long-distance hypnotic control. Vedic accounts point out that this power can be used to control people's thoughts from a distance. • Antardhana, or invisibility. • The ability to assume different forms or to generate illusory body forms. • The power of entering within another person's body and controlling it. This is done using the subtle body (defined below.) [Author's Note: The definition of the subtle body is referred to in common parapsychological literature as the astral body or soul body, and apparently these ancient societies had a much firmer recognition of its existence and of the ability to transfer one's normal waking consciousness fully into it. Modern-day explorers of this art refer to it as having an OBE, or out-of-body experience . The literature on NDE's, or Near-Death Experiences, seems to have a close parallel as well.] Although many \"academics\" would automatically throw out these ideas as being far too mind-bending to be real, there are repeated examples of many of these \"siddhis\" appearing in ordinary people in our modern age. Michael Talbot's incredible book The Holographic Universe covers these types of phenomena in great detail, and such data will also be discussed in volumes II and III of this series. In Dr. Thompson's book, a far-reaching series of correlations are made between these phenomena as expressed in the Vedas and the many various UFO reports that have come about in this wide-ranging field. Simply put, we can see that a society that could command abilities like those listed above would be truly extraordinary, and would obviously be viewing life from a much different perspective than that which we now have. Returning to our immediate discussion regarding extraterrestrials, Dr. Thompson reveals the Vedic perspective on the nature and abundance of extraterrestrial life on the page before the above list is given: The Puranas speak of 400,000 humanlike races of beings living on various planets and of 8,000,000 other life forms, including plants and lower animals. Out of the 400,000 humanlike forms, human beings as we know them are said to be among the least powerful . This, of course, ties in with the picture that emerges from accounts of UFO encounters. [emphasis added] Clearly, our current society does not have open contact with our alleged visitors. In a society that did have such contact, their view of the Universe would indeed be very different than ours – especially with the knowledge that humankind was \"among the least powerful\" of the other races of beings that it was aware of. There was a time, apparently, where we knew how plentiful life was in the galaxy and had contact with it, but that time has been lost. And even though they were still in the kindergarten version of universal evolution, at that time the Rama / Atlantean civilization possessed inner qualities and outer technology that are only just now becoming tangible for us once again. It is important that we note that although some vimana appear to have been"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"airplanes, there were other designs in use that apparently go far beyond any technology that we now openly possess. The most important Vedic text on the vimana, says Childress in Vimana Aircraft of Ancient India and Atlantis , is the Vaimanika Sastra, first reported to have been found in 1918 in the Baroda Royal Sanskrit Library. Previous references were made to this text by other authors, but it was not rediscovered until 1918 - a flutter of time after 1901, when the Wright Brothers made the entire question of the existence of vimana aircraft much more plausible to modern humanity. (Remember that right up until the day the Wright Brothers flew, notable skeptics such as Sir William Thomson boldly declared that “heavier-than-air flight” was impossible.) Although some have questioned the authenticity of the Vaimanika Sastra, Childress details the many qualities of the text that lend serious credibility to it. As we read the following, remember that a translator's job is to take these ancient words and to then match them up with their closest approximation in our own modern language: Says the Vaimanika Sastra about itself: In this book are described 8 pregnant and captivating chapters, the arts of manufacturing various types of aeroplanes of smooth and comfortable travel in the sky, as a unifying force for the Universe, contributive to the well-being of mankind. That which can go by its own force, like a bird, on earth, or water, or air, is called Vimana. That which can travel in the sky, from place to place, land to land, or globe to globe, is called Vimana by scientists in Aeronautics. The ancient manuscript claims to give: • The secrets of constructing aeroplanes, which will not break, which cannot be cut, will not catch fire, and cannot be destroyed. • The secret of making planes motionless. • The secret of making planes invisible. • The secret of hearing conversations and other sounds in enemy places. • The secret of retrieving photographs of the interior of enemy planes • The secret of ascertaining the direction of enemy planes approach. • The secret of making persons in enemy planes lose consciousness. • The secret of destroying enemy planes. Unfortunately, due to size constraints we cannot give Dr. Thompson, David Hatcher Childress, Raymond Drake and others' material anywhere near the degree of coverage that it really needs in order to completely prove the point – but the evidence is out there. The reason for why Thompson's Alien Identities is considered such a breakthrough book is that it presents exhaustive, groundbreaking documentation from both the Vedic scriptures as well as modern UFO literature, and shows a highly significant number of coincidences between the two bodies of data, both on material and spiritual levels. While the vimanas referred to in the Vedic scriptures are clearly some form of airplane, there are repetitive examples of flying craft and humanoid beings that are definitely far, far more advanced and unlike those of contemporary or ancient humans, and sources such as Dr. Thompson's book cover this in great detail. SUMERIAN KNOWLEDGE: ANOTHER MISSING LINK The encyclopedic work of Zecharia Sitchin, including Genesis Revisited and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"especially in his series entitled The Earth Chronicles , also focuses on this cooperation between humankind and extraterrestrial life that once existed. Dr. Sitchin claims to be one of only about 200 people in the world who can fully read and translate the ancient Sumerian cuneiform tablets. By simply accepting that the information and historical accounts may well be true, documented facts, without falling back on the standard belief that they are simply myths, Sitchin has made some very surprising discoveries. His work is so solid that no skeptics have ever made any serious attempts to disassemble it. Therefore, Sitchin is simply ignored, as his scholarship is so complex, integrated and far-reaching that no one has been willing to try to mount a full attack. Once again, in Sitchin's books we see written evidence of super-advanced flying technology (as well as more mundane forms such as rockets,) extraterrestrial humanoids, lasers and weaponry, as well as a veritable cornucopia of advanced knowledge, including rigorously accurate and detailed descriptions of our Solar System. Within these ancient texts are diagrams and properties of all the planets that we have currently discovered as well as a large \"twelfth planet\" named Nibiru. The existence of that very planet is just now being formally (and quietly) acknowledged by the mainstream scientific community as of October 1999. The modern case for a distant planet that recent NASA scientists have presented comes from the mysterious, visible perturbations in the orbits of distant comets originating from the far recesses of our solar system, which suggest that there must be a potentially Jupiter- sized planet beyond the orbit of Pluto whose gravity is affecting them. Nevertheless, there is no real evidence that this planet is going to pass by the Earth in May 2003, as many still believe at the time of this updated edition in October 2002. Based on the intensely technical descriptions that come to us from the Sumerian cuneiform tablets, some of which we will explore in mathematical detail in future chapters, we must wonder if they were at least partially derived from verbally-preserved Atlantean records. This could explain the basis behind the epic \"Saga of Gilgamesh,\" which details the story of a small group of people led by a man named Gilgamesh who survived an ancient flood - i.e. the demise of Atlantis. In The Earth Chronicles , Sitchin makes a solid case for the Biblical story of Noah and the Ark being a condensed and simplified version of this tale, where the character Gilgamesh was renamed Noah and many other important details were omitted. OANNES: FIRST CONTACT The existence of Atlantean flood-survivors such as Gilgamesh also helps to reveal the identity of the illustrious \"men from the sea\" such as the Sumerian / Babylonian sea-king Oannes who were described in many ancient cultures worldwide as coming and civilizing various peoples so quickly. The most prevalent idea behind the Oannes story is that he was simply the first of these Atlantean survivors who appeared before the public and dressed up in, believe it or not, fish suits to add a mythical, magical presence to their identity for the then-uncivilized, superstitious masses. Were the air and sea-worthy vimana still in partial existence at this time, Oannes could have simply parked their craft under the sea, venturing out of it by day and back to it at night. Here we cite a quote from Alexander Polyhistor in Raymond Drake's book about this. (\"Berossus\" was a Sumerian / Chaldean author responsible for"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"recording the original account of this information.) Berossus describes an animal endowed with reason, who was called Oannes; the whole body of the animal was like that of a fish, and had under a fish's head another (regular human) head, and also feet below, similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish's tail. His voice too and language was articulate and human, and a representation of him is preserved even to this day. This Being in the day-time used to converse with Man, but took no food at that season; and he gave them an insight into letters and sciences and every kind of art. He taught them to construct houses, to found temples, to compile laws, and explained to them the principles of geometrical knowledge . He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth and showed them how to collect fruits; in short, he instructed them in everything which could tend to soften manners and humanize mankind. From that time so universal were his instructions, nothing has been added material by way of improvement. When the sun set, it was the custom of this Being to plunge again into the sea and abide all night in the deep, for he was amphibious. After this there appeared other animals like Oannes. [emphasis added] As we can see, the single most remarkable aspect of the story of the Sumerian culture is how beings like Oannes led them so incredibly quickly from nomadic hunting and gathering\" to an advanced society with running water, schools, codified law, government, domestication of animals and cultivation of crops for food and herbal healing remedies, as well as mathematics and geometry, house building and the like. Obviously those of a higher civilization could come into a primitive culture and effect changes very quickly, just as we in the West have done throughout our entire world. THE MYSTERIES According to many, many sources from diversified fields, the survivors of Atlantis preserved their corpus of knowledge, albeit in a scattered form, as most of them left the sinking continent in great haste and with little to spare – hence the ancient story of Noah’s Ark. The only historical account of Atlantis that ever made its way into the public was from the Greek philosopher Plato, and modern researchers still draw off of his writings when investigating the subject. It is often written that Plato caused a serious upset in the Egyptian priesthood by publishing this data, as it was intended to remain strictly concealed from the public. According to Plato's account, Atlantis disappeared in a sudden cataclysm that caused it to sink beneath the sea. There were a precious few who became aware that this was going to happen before it actually did, and they were able to evacuate the island continent before the event itself occurred. They migrated to different areas throughout Europe, Africa and Asia as well as the Americas, most notably within the Mesoamerican region of the Yucatan. According to the legends as preserved by Plato and others in secret, the majority of the entire world was not civilized during the time of Atlantis, but existed in a primitive / tribal state. The secluded island of Atlantis itself, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean on all sides, was far more advanced than many of the indigenous cultures that were already in existence in other parts of the world. At that time, not everyone was at the same level of development by any means, and the legends say that Atlantis had just begun a large-scale colonization / civilization program for the outside world when they collapsed."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Atlantean cataclysm completely submerged all the remnants of their once great island, and in many cases the survivors of this disaster found themselves thrust into situations with primitive peoples who could barely even begin to fathom the civilization that they had come from. And in some of these cases, if they were to begin openly speaking about their knowledge, they would have been killed very quickly out of fear. Therefore, it appears that the majority of survivors from Atlantis had to pass down their traditional knowledge in conditions of the utmost secrecy , knowing that their conflicting religious and scientific beliefs could quickly turn them into dinner for a tribe of wandering cannibals if they weren't careful. The overarching term that was given for the secret knowledge from the lost civilization of Atlantis, (other than “The Tradition,”) was “ The Mysteries .” In most cases, the secrecy of the Mysteries was kept so tightly that rigorous initiations were demanded of anyone who either chose or was invited to participate. And furthermore, to insure their own survival the inheritors of the Atlantean legacy would often punish those who betrayed the secrets with death . In order to be entrusted with the secrets, you had to swear an oath that you gave permission to be killed if you ever revealed the knowledge to those who were “uninitiated.” They believed that it was better to sacrifice one traitor than to lose everyone in an ambush soon afterwards – and this was a very real possibility at that time. One can certainly imagine that many bands of survivors who did not either keep strict secrecy or were not as careful or dramatic as the Babylonian Oannes or the Mesoamerican Viracocha were simply wiped out, and that perhaps this common link among recognized historical figures of the Mysteries was the very thing that had preserved their knowledge through time. According to numerous sources of evidence, especially “ Secret Teachings of All Ages ” by Manly Palmer Hall,” the knowledge of the Mysteries was almost totally wiped out more than once due to these oppressive conditions in uncivilized lands. Yet, the underlying power of the information was so strong that great men would always come along and completely reintegrate all of the fragmented pieces. This happened in Greece with Thales, Pythagoras and Plato touring the African / Eurasian continents and compiling lost ancient data, and much more recently it was done again by Francis Bacon, a highly- educated royal contemporary of the Elizabethan era who had access to ancient records in the Vatican and elsewhere. Bacon's efforts to resuscitate the Mysteries were what directly fathered the modern-day Masonic Order, and he and Pythagoras are said by Manly Hall (discussed below) to be the single two most important figures in Masonry today. The Masonic Order is often lambasted by modern ‘conspiracy theorists’ as an easy target due to its vows of secrecy and demonstrable worldwide power in our modern civilization. There is strong first-hand evidence from “cult survivors” that a negatively oriented group known as the “Illuminati” has penetrated through certain aspects of the Masonic Order, though this does not necessarily impugn most average Masons. This will be discussed in more detail towards the end of this volume. As just one of hundreds of examples, almost every person who signed the Declaration of Independence was a Mason, as well as a high number of astronauts and US Presidents. (Haven’t you ever wondered why there is a pyramid on the back of the dollar bill with the “All-Seeing Eye” on the top? Or why the Washington Monument is a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"perfect Egyptian obelisk?) Many authors have gone far out of their way to demonstrate that the majority of high-level corporate executives, military officials and top government politicians all have connections to Masonry, and updated lists of these people (which may or may not be entirely accurate) are easily found through searching the Internet. Only those who had penetrated through the highest “degrees” of Freemasonry had any idea about what the Mysteries really were. The lower degrees, especially the first three “Blue Degrees,” were designed to foster a large body of loyal and unified members for the group, thus enhancing Masonic power and influence without compromising any real knowledge or secrets. Those who would receive the deepest knowledge could be carefully observed over a long period of time, and handpicked slowly and carefully through higher degrees in a very controlled fashion. Any sign of lack of integrity, doubt or distrust on behalf of the initiate would permanently freeze his progress, insuring that he would never advance any further. (And yes, only men can join the Freemasons. The corresponding, much less popular women's group is called Eastern Star.) And so, even if certain “Illuminati” elements that have penetrated the top levels of the modern Masonic Order have become quite confused and power- hungry, the original secret information from Atlantis is very important to us. It does not appear that the ancient information was biased towards the negative side of spirituality, though the “Illuminati” may have now co-opted it as such. Many researchers agree that the books of Manly Palmer Hall, a 33rd-degree Masonic initiate, (the highest publicly acknowledged degree,) are the ultimate source available for learning about the real secrets that are preserved by these modern inheritors of the Mysteries. The book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages , is inarguably Hall's finest accomplishment – written as a literal encyclopedia of all the great truths that he or any other members of these societies were willing to openly reveal. And within that subset, Hall has quite a lot to say. Once all the other pieces are in place, we will see that Hall's information is far more than adequate for recombining the true picture of the Atlantean Mysteries. Hall's book begins, paradoxically enough, with an enormous and perhaps even boring discussion of philosophers , from Greek to Roman right up through the present, going into great detail about their widely contradictory ideas. In this discussion, we can clearly see how the unified knowledge of the Mysteries had already become widely dispersed, and everyone had their own theories based on what little they knew – and yet underneath it all, a common thread could be perceived. Certain philosophers such as Pythagoras actively sought to eliminate this problem by traveling far and wide to collect this scattered secret information from other areas. By the end of that chapter, the reader is practically exhausted with the huge body of philosophical information that was presented, and at this point Hall comes clean with the hidden Masonic knowledge that he is in contact with, regarding the true secret origin of all philosophy. In this excerpt, he also touches upon the all-important concept of symbolism being used to convey information and hide truth from the uninitiated: The magnificent institutions of Hindu, Chaldean (Sumerian), and Egyptian learning must be recognized as the actual source of Greek wisdom. The last was patterned after the shadow cast by the sanctuaries of Ellora, Ur, and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Memphis upon the thought substance of a primitive people. Thales, Pythagoras, and Plato in their philosophic wanderings contacted many distant cults and brought back the lore of Egypt and the inscrutable Orient. From indisputable facts such as these it is evident that philosophy emerged from the religious Mysteries of antiquity, not being separated from religion until after the decay of the Mysteries. He who would fathom the depths of philosophic thought must familiarize himself with the teachings of those initiated priests designated as the first custodians of divine revelation. The Mysteries claimed to be the guardians of a transcendental knowledge so profound as to be incomprehensible save to the most exalted intellect and so potent as to be revealed with safety only to those in whom personal ambition was dead and who had consecrated their lives to the unselfish service of humanity . Both the dignity of these sacred institutions and the validity of their claim to possession of Universal Wisdom are attested by the most illustrious philosophers of antiquity, who were themselves initiated into the profundities of the secret doctrine and who bore witness to its efficacy. The question may legitimately be propounded: If these ancient mystical institutions were of such \"great pith and moment,\" why is so little information now available concerning them and the arcana they claimed to possess? The answer is simple enough: The Mysteries were secret societies, binding their initiates to inviolable secrecy, and avenging with death the betrayal of their sacred trusts. Although these schools were the true inspiration of the various doctrines promulgated by the ancient philosophers, the fountainhead of those doctrines was never revealed to the profane. Furthermore, in the lapse of time the teachings came so inextricably linked with the names of disseminators that the actual but recondite source - the Mysteries - came to be wholly ignored. [emphasis added] And as we continue further along in Hall's book, we come upon the chapter \"Atlantis and the Gods of Antiquity,\" where the core idea of humanity's hidden Atlantean past is expounded upon further: \"The history of Atlantis,\" writes Ignatius Donnelly, \"is the key of the Greek mythology. There can be no question that these gods of Greece were human beings. The tendency to attach divine attributes to great earthly rulers is one deeply implanted in human nature. ( See Atlantis .) ...The Garden of Eden from which humanity was driven by a flaming sword is perhaps an allusion to the earthly paradise supposedly located west of the Pillars of Hercules and destroyed by volcanic cataclysms. The Deluge legend may be traced also to the Atlantean inundation, during which a \"world\" was destroyed by water. Was the religious, philosophic, and scientific knowledge possessed by the priestcrafts of antiquity secured from Atlantis, whose submergence obliterated every vestige of its part in the drama of world progress? Atlantean sun worship has been perpetuated in the ritualism and ceremonialism of both Christianity and pagandom. Both the cross and the serpent were Atlantean emblems of divine wisdom... The mythologies of many nations contain accounts of gods who \"came out of the sea.\" Certain shamans among the American Indians tell of holy men"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"dressed in birds' feathers and wampum who rose out of the blue waters and instructed them in the arts and crafts. Among the legends of the Chaledans (Sumerians) is that of Oannes, a partly amphibious creature who came out of the sea and taught the savage peoples along the shore to read and write, till the soil, cultivate herbs for healing, study the stars, establish rational forms of government, and become conversant with the sacred Mysteries. Among the Mayas, Quetzalcoatl, the Savior-God (whom some Christians believe to have been St. Thomas), issued from the waters and, after instructing the people in the essentials of civilization, rode out to sea on a magic raft of serpents to escape the wrath of the fierce god of the Fiery Mirror, Tezcatlipoca. [Note: Again, with references to a \"magic raft\" and a \"Fiery Mirror\" we can see a clear connection to the more magnificent versions of the vimana that we had discussed above.] May it not have been that these demigods of a fabulous age who, Esdras-like, came out of the sea were Atlantean priests? All that primitive man remembered of the Atlanteans was the glory of their golden ornaments, the transcendency of their wisdom, and the sanctity of their symbols - the cross and the serpent. That they came in ships was soon forgotten, for untutored minds considered even boats as supernatural. Wherever the Atlanteans proselyted they erected pyramids and temples patterned after the great sanctuary in the [Atlantean] City of the Golden Gates. Such is the origin of the pyramids of Egypt, Mexico, and Central America. The mounds in Normandy and Britain, as well as those of the American Indians, are remnants of a similar culture. In the midst of the Atlantean program of world colonization and conversion, the cataclysms which sank Atlantis began. The Initiate-Priests of the Sacred Feather who promised to come back to their missionary settlements never returned; and after the lapse of centuries tradition preserved only a fantastic account of gods who came from a place where the sea now is... From the Atlanteans the world has received not only the heritage of arts and crafts, philosophies and sciences, ethics and religions, but also the heritage of hate, strife, and perversion. The Atlanteans instigated the first war; and it has been said that all subsequent wars were fought in a fruitless effort to justify the first one and right the wrong which it caused. Before Atlantis sank, its spiritually illumined Initiates, who realized that their land was doomed because it had departed from the Path of Light, withdrew from the ill-fated continent. Carrying with them the sacred and secret doctrine, these Atlanteans established themselves in Egypt, where they became its first \"divine\" rulers. Nearly all the great cosmologic myths forming the foundation of the various sacred books of the world are based upon the Atlantean Mystery rituals. Without going into further long quotations here, Hall later makes the important point that the language of symbolism was used to hide the Atlantean knowledge, both scientific and spiritual. In this way, there could be a physical structure, such as a pyramid or building, which was built according to certain “sacred” proportions. Once someone had a basic understanding of the physics that we will be discussing in this book, these symbolically encoded mysteries can again be revealed. Mythological teachings, repeated generation after generation, were also used to hide very advanced information; and we will have more to say about this as we progress. Certain sculptures or illustrations were also used, with their true meanings hidden in myth. Hindu dances and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"mandalas incorporated “sacred geometry” into their patterns as well. The Yin- Yang symbol of the ancient Orient is also of particular significance, as is the staff with two coiled serpents surrounding it, now used as the symbol for medicine. THE TEACHINGS OF ‘RA’ So, if the above information is accurate, we are dealing with an ancient advanced civilization that cooperated with far more evolved extraterrestrial and / or interdimensional beings, and which passed down their traditions in secret after the bulk of their civilization had collapsed, as well as “hiding them out in the open” through cloaked symbolic meanings, in many cases written right into the structure of buildings and sacred temples. We should remember that at this time in the world, most of the other cultures had not attained the sophistication of Atlantis, and thus had no clear historical record of their existence as they had been left alone. Thus, it was easy for Atlantis to be forgotten. Throughout this series, we will see incontrovertible evidence of highly advanced ancient scientific knowledge, which suggests that the Atlanteans had a full awareness of the system of cosmology and physics that we will be discussing. It is interesting to point out that the Law of One series, which we consider to be perhaps the most reputable channeled material available, paints the exact same picture. “Ra” claims to have been in contact with the ancient Atlanteans and shared knowledge quite directly with them, including the gift of technical assistance in rendering the magnificent architectural marvels of the Great Pyramid. We do know that the Egyptian inheritors of the Atlantean legacy worshipped a “god” known as Ra, and this account appears to be a time-distorted record of what started as a genuine contact, not simply another feeble-minded myth. The timelines that Ra gave for their contact with the Atlanteans (from approximately 18,000 to 11,000 years ago) fit very nicely with the time of the alignment that Bauval discovered at the Giza complex, (11,500 years ago,) and also fit with the timeline given by the Edgar Cayce Readings for the construction of the Great Pyramid (11,500 to 11,450 years ago.) This convergence of dates is but one of many layers of validation. Carla Rueckert, MLS, who brought through the information, has said that she was unaware of this convergence of Ra’s data with the Cayce Readings until she was informed at the end of 2001. For thousands of years after the fall of Atlantis, many efforts have been made to re-integrate the lost sacred teachings, but it still doesn’t appear that there has ever been a truly complete model of the actual physics they were using available to the public... until now. As Manly P. Hall asserts, most of this knowledge was hidden in symbolic forms, which can be open to multiple interpretations. Therefore, the story gets more interesting once we realize that the original source of all the Atlanteans’ technical information was able to share their knowledge with humanity again in the early 1980s, without the use of symbolic, encrypted language, and completely outside of the mysterious cloaks of government conspiracy and secret societies. A tremendous amount of this information was later validated with ensuing scientific discoveries that were completely unknown at the time, so the “burden of proof” is extremely well satisfied, as we shall see. No other channeled source we have ever found"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"has gone quite so far, with so much scientific validation, as the Law of One, so it is in a category all its own . Indeed, we freely admit that the Law of One material ultimately inspired this entire series, as Ra gave many specific pieces of information that could subsequently be verified with scientific findings that would come out in ensuing years. Without starting with the answers, we probably would not have known what questions to look for, and thereby discover the underlying proof. You don’t really need to accept the channeling if it simply leads you to an understanding of the hard science, but for those who are interested we will cover some of Ra’s non-provable spiritual philosophies as well. We have been able to continue to work and communicate with Ra to fill in the remaining pieces of their scientific model, predominantly through dream research that augments extensive physical research. The personal side of this is largely outside the scope of this series, but rest assured that we have had many, many cases of accurate future prophecies and other methods of direct validation, including as we said the physical appearance of Ra before others, including counseling clients and the author’s own brother. So in short, there are two ways to go about writing this book. One way would be to painstakingly attempt to reconstruct the science of the Ancients solely from the scattered bits and pieces of the past, cloaked in symbolism, such those pieces found as in Manly Palmer Hall’s book, which come from knowledge bases that Ra says were “quickly distorted” by the priesthoods of the day. Another way to write the book is to simply present the reader with some of Ra’s basic assertions about the Universe, summarized with our scientific conclusions that will be established throughout the series, and then leave it to each person as to whether they will accept or reject the material. This second choice is what we have decided to go with in this final version of the book, since it is good to have documentation of Ra’s basic model of the Cosmos somewhere in the series. THE ‘AETHER’ So, the most important aspect of Atlantean knowledge that we need to start with is the idea that the Universe is composed of energy . The Greeks referred to this energy as “aether,” which is their word for “ shine ,” indicating that it has qualities similar to light. In the ancient model, this energy is both within physical matter and outside of it at the same time. Our current science has discarded this idea as a ridiculous, archaic relic of the past, but it was a very active part of all Greek philosophy. And if Hall’s assertions are correct, then the reason why the Greeks have preserved knowledge of this “aether” is because they inherited it from the Atlantean civilization, which appears to have originally acquired it from the Ra group. Our conceptions of the aether, and of how it interacts with physical matter, have grown by leaps and bounds since the time that this first volume was originally written – and thus much of the information that we originally presented in this chapter is now no longer needed. Later volumes will go into the technical detail that will satisfy those who would like to have it. Suffice it to say that in Volume III we will show that almost all of our information about quantum physics – that which builds up all that we see in the Universe on the smallest level – is flawed, including the idea that there are any real “particles” in the atom. Among other things, we will show certain cases where atoms are"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"forming into substances where they lose any sense of an individual “particle” identity, but rather fuse into a single conglomerate form. Such substances include microclusters and quasi-crystals, both of which have extremely obvious geometric qualities, and Bose-Einstein condensates. To summarize the model as simply as possible, we can list some of the initial basic characteristics of this newly rediscovered energy field, which we will most consistently refer to as “aether,” and how it structures the Cosmos. You’ll definitely not want to blaze through this list, but spend a little time meditating on each point if you want to understand everything else as the series goes on. We admit that this list might “hurt your brain” at first as you try to reorganize your mind to fit the new information in. As we go, all of these points will be nicely rounded out, so don’t feel obligated to completely understand all of this now – just be aware of it. Also know that our assertion is that everything you are about to read was well-known in the time of Atlantis : • What we have is a fluidlike energy source, which is technically known as an energy medium or substrate , (remember the word “medium,”) and which exists everywhere throughout the known universe. This energy medium is normally unseen to us just as we do not see the air that we breathe, and could be thought of as the “body” of the One Infinite Creator. • It exists at an extremely high pressure, much more than that of the surface air pressure on Earth. Yet, we move through it quite easily, since we are also made of the same “stuff.” • At the tiniest level, the energy is created by what Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg (vol. III) calls “field bubbles” – tiny spheres of energy that roll and flow around each other, thus imparting a liquid-like behavior to the medium. • Mainstream scientists have quietly rediscovered this energy medium, and it is variously called the Virtual Particle Flux, the Zero-Point Energy Field, the Quantum Physical Vacuum, the Quantum Foam, “Superstrings,” “Dark Matter” and “Dark Energy,” among other things. They are becoming aware that it must be responsible for the creation of matter. • For all practical purposes, the energy itself is conscious, and therefore unifies all the Universe as one conscious lifeform – an Ultimate Being. Any time the energy gathers together in an organized pattern, you have some form of intelligent life. This includes stars, planets and galaxies, as well as cells, microclusters, molecules and atoms. • Many, many alternative science researchers have observed this energy in the laboratory, including its at-times bizarre properties of consciousness, and given it their own unique name, such as Dr. Wilhelm Reich’s “Orgone energy.” (A predominant amount of this research was done in secret throughout the former Soviet Union, and has only recently been declassified and posted in English on the Internet since the “fall of the Iron Curtain” in 1990-91. We appear to have performed the most complete compilation of this material within a single book (Volume III) in the Western world.) • Various spiritual teachers have called it “spiritual energy,” “loving energy,” “healing energy,” “the Holy Spirit,” et cetera. All are discussing the same energy field. They are often very aware of how consciousness directs this energy, especially when love is the major motivating factor. Miraculous healings have resulted from this ability. • The human being does have an egg-shaped “energy body” that is composed of this medium, which many trained seers can both see and heal, and disease conditions will appear in this body first before they become physical. This is one of the deeper secrets that are well known in the Atlantean Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"• You can expose a person to higher doses of this energy by certain technological means, and they will experience many signs of spiritual, mental and physical enhancement. As documented in Volume III, many top- level Russian researchers have dramatically proven this – and we have replicated their experiments with a safe, special machine called an “axion field generator” and / or “ dynamic torsion generator ” known as the Comfort 7-L model, produced by Dr. Alexander Shpilman. You can get similar but weaker effects by building a pyramid, or a “ passive torsion generator ,” as we will discuss in the next chapter and more thoroughly in Volume III. • Plants will have dramatic, robust growth enhancements in the presence of these energy fields, which also destroy viruses, bacteria, cancer cells and related organisms that are dangerous to higher forms of life, dramatically increasing the chances of survival in a diseased organism. Since the energy is intelligent, it will automatically “do” what needs to be done for body/mind/ spirit healing when a person is exposed to it, even though such a marvelous notion is vastly disagreeable to most medical / scientific thinkers. • The ancient traditions mentioned this energy secretly and symbolically by calling it “water,” or “the water of life,” among other things. • There are two major kinds of waves in the aether – electro/magnetic fields and gravitational / torsion fields . We will describe their differences in Volume III, with emphasis on the torsion fields, as they are largely unknown to Western science. • This energy can be directly harnessed to produce technologies such as limitless free energy, anti-gravity and even teleportation, as we will cover in volumes II and III. • All moving ( propagating / dynamic ) waves in this energy medium travel in spirals of various sizes, from very tiny to very large ( and we will explain why .) Many ancient teachings used the symbol of the spiraling serpent to represent “universal wisdom” – another symbolic encoding of this scientific knowledge – hence the man Jesus once said, “ Be ye wise as serpents and gentle as doves .” • Light is simply one major type of movement of this energy – hence the aether can be thought of as “liquid light,” or as the author of Genesis said, “ In the beginning... the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said “Let there be light,” and there was light ...” [Gen. 1:1-3] • There are seven major “densities” or thickness levels of this fluidlike energy medium throughout the Universe, often referred to in esoteric traditions as the “seven heavens.” These different densities are formed solely by the amount of vibration that is occurring within the aether in a certain area . • As one similar analogy to help you visualize these energy densities, we know that if water molecules vibrate really fast, they become gas, and if they vibrate really slowly, they turn into solid ice. Vibration is solely what causes these phase changes, nothing else. The aether behaves in a nearly identical fashion to this, though it is not a “physical” substance in the normal sense. • We cannot visually see any of the density levels in the Universe above the one that we are now at – thus the Universe appears to be entirely “3D physical” to us in our telescopes. However, there are ways to detect these different aether density levels in the Cosmos with direct observation of their unique signatures in the microwave spectrum, as will be discussed in Volume III with the work of Arp, Tifft and Aspden. • In mystical states of consciousness the higher density levels can be directly perceived visually, and learning to “see” is a very basic aspect of ancient"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"esoteric training. • Within the seven main energy density levels are seven sub-levels , and there are seven sub-sub-levels within each sub-level, and so on to infinity – much like a hologram or fractal, as we will later discover. (This is similar to how you could have a swamp where you could measure infinitely different grades of thickness throughout it with fine enough instruments, but which you could resolve into seven main categories ranging from swamp gas to fully “wet” super-free-flowing liquid to fully solid mass – like peat moss.) • Even though there are many fine gradations of energy levels, all resolve into seven major densities, which Ra calls the “true color” densities. This follows the same basic “harmonic” rules that form the structures of music. • Vibration of the fluidlike energy source forms these densities. The same basic rules of vibration are also responsible for the 7-fold color spectrum of visible light and the 7-tone octave of the mathematically pure “Diatonic” scale, which we can hear with the white keys of the piano. (More on this below.) Thus, in sound and color, nature reveals its secrets for “those who have eyes to see,” while to the “profane” the secrets remain “inscrutable.” Ancient mystery school teachings delve excessively into studies of sound and color, and this has been used in the formation of cathedrals with colorful stained glass windows and Gregorian Chant music by the Knight Templars, one group that inherited the Mysteries and helped design and build the cathedrals. • Wherever you are in the Universe, all energy densities exist there to some degree. Nevertheless, most regions will have one density level of energy that predominates over the others. Planets also progress as intelligent beings from density to density, and thus will reside at particular density levels depending on their state of development. • Size does matter in the Universe. Planets are far more advanced beings than individual lifeforms living on the planets, yet are nevertheless very receptive to their people. Stars are far more advanced than planets, having full consciousness of all the densities. Galaxies are far more advanced than stars, programming the basic conditions for spiritual, mental and even physical evolution throughout all star systems. And the visible Universe is far more advanced than any galaxy, setting up the basic laws and templates that all shall follow, as it is the embodiment of the One Infinite Creator. • Galaxies, as conscious beings, use the natural laws of vibration to create discretely layered “zones” of energy density / consciousness throughout themselves. From a top-down view, the galaxy is separated into zones or sectors of density, which looks like a pinwheel or a cake cut into many moon-shaped curving pieces, which bloom out from the center like a flower. These zones essentially remain stationary in space while the star systems pass through them. • As a star system moves through successive zones, the overall density of the aether is seen to steadily rise or fall, depending on the position. These zones have already been detected and measured scientifically – and Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev refers to them as “magnetic strips and striations.” Precise cycles of time, based again on the mathematics of music and vibration, govern how long a planetary system will move through a particular zone. This first volume will cover these cycles extensively, as the Ancients preserved a fantastic degree of knowledge about them, such as in the Sumerian clay tablets. • The purpose of planetary systems moving through these differing energy density levels is to promote spiritual evolution at a fixed pace. Beings like humans have free will as to when they will choose to proceed , with the cycle"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"end-points from one density to another offering an opportunity to escape the cycles of reincarnation and progress to a higher realm of being – whereas for stars and planets the timelines for progress are relatively fixed. • The boundary from one zone of density to another in the galactic “pinwheel” formation can be visualized in much the same way that a straight line forms when oil sits on top of water, as this is a perfect analogy of what happens when two different densities of fluid are in contact with each other. • The solar system is now moving into the next higher level of density in the Galaxy, which is causing the zone around the Earth to go from the third- density that we now inhabit into the fourth-density – essentially creating what could be thought of as a “dimensional shift.” • We “cross the waterline” from one density into the other somewhere between 2010-2013, corresponding to the end-date of the Mayan Calendar on Dec. 21, 2012. This creates irreversible changes in the basic quality of matter and energy that surrounds us, including the traveling speed of visible light, which sizably increases in our own local area. Remember that right now, we are observing all stars through the lens of the speed that light travels in the third density, and nothing higher. Thus the whole Universe shifts in its appearance to us as we move into a higher level. • The entire Solar System is showing massive signs of an increasing energetic charge as we move closer and closer to this final moment, as more and more of the higher vibrations and pressures of this energy are “bleeding off” into our own solar system. Every month there are new findings coming out from the scientific community that are unknowingly adding further validation to this model – most recently through the September-October 2002 discovery that Pluto is experiencing “global warming” and large increases in atmospheric pressure, even though it is now moving farther away from the Sun. The scientific priesthood says this is “unrelated” to global warming on Earth, even though other recent articles reported “global warming” on Mars and Venus as well, with other anomalies occurring on the other planets such as increasing brightness, increasing magnetic strength, huge atmospheric changes and even pole shifts on Uranus and Neptune. Pluto was the only planet left that we didn’t already have good, solid evidence for... so now the model is complete. • On a separate but relevant note, the DNA structure changes as we move from one density to another , and we now have a scientific model to explain why. The spiraling “torsion” ( i.e. “twisting” ) energy waves in the aether have the pattern of DNA written into them at the smallest level, as programmed by the intelligence of the Galaxy. These spiraling waves exert subtle but measurable currents of force on physical matter, as we will show in Volume III. As loose elements bounce around, they are increasingly caught up into the currents of these spiraling waves and will automatically arrange together like a jigsaw puzzle, first into amino acids, then eventually into DNA. • When a given planet passes into a zone of higher energy density, the underlying spiral waves become more complex, and the DNA structures thereby become more highly evolved. One of the discoverers of the DNA molecule has published a remarkable study that suggests that most of the visible dust in the galaxy has all the same qualities that we would expect from bacteria , showing this energetic DNA formation in effect throughout the Galaxy. • Dangerously high amounts of this energy, far more than what is used for healing work, can be sent through one organism and transfer the DNA qualities of that creature to another organism, causing a physical transformation / mutation . Dr. Yu. V. Tszyan Kanchzen was able to use this"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"process to cause a hen to begin mutating into a duck, which included the appearance of webbing between the hen’s normally naked toes. • Dr. Kanchzen’s discovery provides effective proof that the spiraling torsion waves are the true hidden architects of the DNA molecule, and that these templates can be energetically altered within a single lifetime . Despite ethical objections, these experiments could be repeated relatively easily, if desired. • Species evolution , both physically and in terms of consciousness, automatically results when we pass from one level of aetheric density to another. We already have a great historical record that shows when and how this has happened before, where in a remarkably short time the indigenous creatures of Earth disappear and more highly-evolved forms take their place – and that was only what happened as we went through various sub-levels of density ; now we’re breaking through to another major “ true color ” level. • As we read in the last chapter, we already are far along in the process of a mass extinction on a level not seen since the time of the dinosaurs, so there is no need to fear some unseen doom – we’re already most of the way through this process now. We have assumed that these events are strictly “manmade” causes, but the model suggests otherwise. Every time this has occurred in the past, new and more highly evolved species have emerged very suddenly upon the world stage – and this time will be no different. Now that we’ve delved into our new model of evolution, let’s return to some of the behaviors of the aether as they relate to universal consciousness and the formation of ‘physical matter’. We will also show some further evidence of how this technical information was hidden in symbolism by those who survived the Atlantean cataclysm. We will also show how neatly the energy fields at different levels of size are organized throughout the Cosmos, according to simple properties of vibration: • At the highest levels of density this energy medium acts more like a solid – just as water can be frozen into solid ice. In these levels, energy travels much, much faster than the speed of light – theoretically at an instantaneous speed, thus insuring instantaneous consciousness throughout the Universe, i.e. Oneness – and in Volume III we show how Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev discovered this. Thus, the physics provides for there to be instantaneous consciousness in this “mind of God” that is our Universe, which we naturally expect would have to be present for “God” to exist . • Again, spiraling “vortex” movements like eddying currents in a flowing stream form all physical matter from within this non-physical fluidlike medium. (Not all vortexes are strong enough to create stable matter. “Virtual Particles” have now been discovered, which appear just like normal atomic “particles” but appear and disappear from view constantly.) • Hence, everything that we see in the universe is formed by complex movements of nothing more than pressure and counterpressure , push and pull, within a single medium. • To visualize these basic matter-creating vortexes, we must visualize a sphere with two trumpet / tornado-shaped whirlpools, one pointing down into the center of the sphere from the north pole and another coming up into the center from the south pole, with their hollow tube funnels joining to form a clean, narrow hole through the center of the sphere. The entire sphere flows and curls around itself like a ball of string or a smoke ring. This shape, essentially just a sphere with a “donut hole” pinched through the middle, is technically called a spherical torus ."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"• Ancient shamans and mystics traveled out-of-body and saw this domed spherical structure surrounding the Solar System, with a translucent bluish- white appearance against the blackness of space, and with the funnel- shaped ‘tube’ passing directly through the Sun at the center. From the Earth’s orbital perspective along the midplane of the sphere, looking towards the Sun’s north pole, this energy field looks like a towering pillar coming up from the Sun and branching out into a spherical canopy – with a similar “root” going down below the south pole – hence it was called the “ World Tree .” This is actually the same energy structure that forms the body of a tree on Earth. It was another way in which the ancient Atlanteans hid their technical knowledge through symbolism, and will be covered in detail in Volume II. Later seers who visually perceived it simply believed the myth that it was a ‘tree’ and did not understand the science behind it. • Another symbolic / technical metaphor of this energy field from the Atlanteans is the “Orphic Egg” and / or the “Omphalos stone,” the “navel of the world.” This is pictured as an egg with a serpent coiling around it – and is another very accurate symbol of what these swirling spherical fields actually look like, with the serpent representing twisting “torsion” fields and the egg showing the basic spherical structure. • Every atom in our current reality, especially those formed in undisturbed natural circumstances, has some degree of existence in the different densities, but tends to be “focused” at the level we now perceive. • Since this energy is conscious, a highly-trained person can actually form physical matter by conscious intention alone. • The same energy fields structure all levels of size in the Universe, ( and all are alive in some form ,) from the atom to the cell to the fruit to the vital organs to the human body to the tree to the moon, planet, star, galaxy, galactic cluster, and visible Universe. At every level you will see the same basic underlying energy forms at work, such as the human aura or a planetary magnetic field, once you repair the damage that now exists in scientific thought. • A clean, even musical ratio of 34560 separates these different levels of size, as discovered by Ray Tomes, which will be more fully covered in Volume III. The Universe is extremely well organized according to the laws of vibration. • Thus, within even the smallest “subatomic particle” is the image of the entire Creation, much like a hologram. There is a universe within each of your cells – formed with the same basic patterns as the One Infinite Creator. Hence, “God made Man in Its own image.” • Each density is populated with increasingly intelligent life, moving ever closer to complete Oneness – and we are only on the third out of seven levels. Hence we have a lot of help now, as one could say that we are “screwing up” on the planetary scale, causing a great deal of damage and existing in a relatively blinded state, spiritually speaking. As these nuggets of thought grow in your mind, they will be unrolled and revealed in their true splendor throughout the series, with plenty of proof to back them up, along with many other surprises that we have not yet revealed. CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLUTION FIRST DENSITY One part of Ra’s model needs to be made clear: we can visually perceive all"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"forms on Earth and elsewhere that have first, second and third-density levels of consciousness, not just the third. Hence, these densities are not directly similar to the concept of ‘higher dimensions’, as we shall explain later. Ra teaches that the first density is the world of the elements – earth, air, fire and water. In this density there is simply empty awareness that has no central focus of space or time. Gradually, as these elements disrupt each other, such as by water moving over earth, awareness eventually becomes more localized into that area of space and time. This causes the spiraling intelligent energy to combine into “ increasingly intelligent patterns ” therein, and thus the basic elements will begin forming into amino acids and eventually DNA molecules, which signals the bridge into second density. SECOND DENSITY The second density encompasses all forms that we normally consider to be “living,” from single-celled organisms to plants to animals, birds and fish, except human beings. In this density, there is awareness, but these organisms still do not have a sense of a separate self – they have a group awareness that is shared amongst all of their species. This gives rise to various observable phenomena, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish that can all make sudden, simultaneous changes in their direction of movement. Dr. Rupert Sheldrake has written extensively on this subject, which is not difficult to understand if we can accept that consciousness is all around us , not just within our own minds. Consciousness is naturally shared between particular species of animals, via the intelligent energy that connects all life in the Universe, and there is also some degree of sharing between all different species as well. The different animals within a given species are always consulting this “group mind” as they go throughout their daily routines, and if enough animals have the same experience, the knowledge gained from this experience becomes a part of the group-mind. Hence we have the famous “hundredth monkey” effect, where a series of monkeys were studied on separate islands, all isolated from each other. The scientists performing the study presented the monkeys with a challenge for gathering food that they had never encountered before. Either potatoes or rice were presented to the monkeys, but they were covered in sand. Some of the monkeys got the idea to wash the food in the stream and remove the sand. After approximately 100 of the monkeys did this, a “critical mass” was reached. Suddenly, every monkey on every island was no longer perplexed by the problem; they would all immediately wash the rice or potatoes as if they had always known how to do it , though they had never been in contact with any of the first 100 monkeys who solved the puzzle on their own. Hence, a critical threshold was reached once the “hundredth monkey” learned the skill, and the behavior became completely automatic. This shows us how a new survival concept was written into the group-mind of this particular species of monkey. In Ra’s model, this would represent an aspect of conscious evolution of that species as a group, precipitated by the free will of its members. It is a natural system designed for lower-level organisms to adapt to their surroundings and thereby be able to function in a largely automatic fashion. In time, this effect may be seen as one of the finest scientific discoveries of the 20th century."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THIRD DENSITY The next question would be, “ If animals can share thoughts, then why can’t most humans? ” The answer to the question is that we do still have a propensity towards “groupthink,” though not on the directly conscious telepathic level any longer. In order to progress to the human level, we must shed some of what we have gained in second-density. The third-density is the first plane where each organism has a direct consciousness of itself as a separate being . In order to have a consciousness of being separate, we must lose the ability to merge with others of our own kind into a “group-mind.” Our own individual mind actually becomes far more powerful in this process. We certainly hold the memory of having a group-mind that will allow us to run on ‘autopilot,’ and thus we can succumb to the “herd mentality” or what Dr. Caroline Myss calls the “tribal instinct” where we want to be part of a group, and let the group do all of our thinking for us. The problem with having a group-mind is that it removes the need for most individual thinking, reasoning and learning, and we never really grow by experience. With third-density awareness comes the advent of conscious processes that are not directly required for survival, such as love, compassion and creativity. This is considered to be the most important level of existence in the Universe in the spiritual sense, as it presents one with very unique conditions, as follows: FREE WILL In third density, there is no direct “proof” that God exists. It is quite possible for a being in this realm to conclude that they are “alone in the Universe.” However, we can think of our entire Universe as a big game that was set up by the One Infinite Creator, where the idea was to separate itself into many distinct parts, each of which has total free will. The Law of One teachings repeatedly emphasize that free will is the most important law in the universe , and often the least understood or respected. It was free will that was behind the different fragments of the One choosing to separate and form the templates that eventually led to the rise of galaxies as conscious mega- beings. Many people feel that they have a right, even an obligation to force their beliefs onto others. However, “behind the scenes” there are higher-level beings who rigorously protect the free will of others, thus insuring that no person meets with experiences that are above and beyond what they created for themselves through their own free will. Our experience in this cycle of Earth civilization is especially potent, as we have an institutionalized system of “science” that strongly frowns on any notion of a higher purpose behind the events that unfold in our lives. Thus, when a person begins thinking that such a “behind-the-scenes” world really exists, they often have to sit alone with that knowledge, and feel that it separates them from others. Thus, we can again state that one of the most important realizations to free us from the “fairytale” of modern third-density civilization is that events in our lives do not happen randomly . The reality is that w e are living in a highly structured system with very specific rules, with free will as the pre-eminent law . There are relatively exact guidelines in place for how we will meet with what we create – either on the positive or the negative path, which we will discuss below. The balancing adjustments that we attract to ourselves are precisely carried out by higher beings without any sense of judgment. We"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"should also remember that if we do get some “bad karma,” we are perpetually returning to a clean slate of balance – so there is usually never a need to fear any long-term repercussions. The processes of karma are always giving us the opportunity to make huge inner progress in any moment, as we are always being returned to a state of balance where we have no karmic residue from the past. If you did something you think was “bad,” then fear not, for whatever balance you attracted to yourself came soon afterwards, and there is no need to fear any residual long-term effects. This is always the case, particularly at the end of a major cycle of evolution – though events of particularly negative nature, such as murder, may need to be balanced in future lifetimes. Hence, by free will we choose to keep repeating certain experiences that we may think of as “mistakes,” and choose to continue to experience the natural consequences that we then attract. We can simply make different choices, in the direction of self-acceptance, self-forgiveness and a finer exercising of the powers of our creative will to help others, and miraculously discover how quickly our experiences we have labeled as “suffering” will subside. And if we want to spiritually advance in the Universe, we are well advised to choose through our own free will to increasingly lose our sense of being a separate self – and this means that we love others as we love ourselves, and we are completely respectful of their own free will. Eventually, we will get to a point where we can look in the mirror and see the face of the Creator, look into the faces of others and equally see the face of the Creator, and look at the entire Universe around us and see the Creator, with the awareness that our own True Self is what we are seeing at every level, and that all is perfect. Ultimately we will have no personality, no identity, no memory of past, present or future, but simply consciousness as the All. This is a state of consciousness that you can aspire to right now, here in third density. Your thoughts are not your enemy and nothing is to be overcome. In meditation, just allow them to flow through you and run their course. We certainly can aspire to having our personalities become increasingly reflective of the Oneness, while knowing and accepting our “distortions” along the way. This is why it is important to cultivate a sense of humility, and to pay less attention to spiritual teachers who do not evince it in their own behavior. So, the goal of the Creator is for each entity to make a conscious choice to again seek Oneness, out of our own free will – not because anyone else forced us to. If we are told what to do and what to believe, then we have learned nothing and will not make any progress. Perhaps the single most basic realization to make is that we live in a loving Universe . If we are all One Being, then it is foolish for us to hate anyone, as we are only hating ourselves, as the cliché goes. In third-density, we are not expected to have a full consciousness of the Law of One; in fact, Ra says that we must realize that we do not understand everything about the Universe in order to be able to make further progress. In third density, we “grope in the dark” for truth, while having no direct proof that God exists. What matters most is how we use our free will in making a choice of which path we will follow. We can either choose to love and respect others or to manipulate and control others . The path of love and respect is the positive path, and the path of manipulation and control is the negative path."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Ra also explains this in terms of energy. The positive path is that which radiates energy out of itself and the negative path is that which absorbs energy into itself. Neither one of these behaviors of energy are intrinsically “good” or “bad,” as both are required for anything “physical” to exist – we have pressure and counterpressure, radiance and absorption or “source” and “sink.” However, in the realms of consciousness, the positive path is a far more expedient path back to the Oneness, as both paths ultimately unify into a positive, loving creation. When we act lovingly, we are radiating joy and happiness to others, thereby enhancing the Oneness, and when we act negatively and violate free will, we are trying to absorb others’ life energies into ourselves, thereby enhancing the separation within the One. Another related deep realization is that the more that we can radiate energy out of ourselves, the more it will naturally be attracted back to us without having to manipulate or control anything to get it – we create a “flow.” That which flows out of us must be replaced, by virtue of the laws of pressure and counterpressure. Higher pressure ( aether density ) always flows back into a lower-pressure zone. We don’t automatically shift into the next density if we are not ready for it. In order to “make graduation” into fourth-density positive, we must be slightly more than 50-percent oriented towards service to others, as demonstrated by our thoughts and actions, which are completely transparent to higher-level beings. It still appears that about 95% of all present-day human beings on Earth will be repeating their third-density cycle on a different planet after the Earth has entered into fourth-density , since it is so easy in this experience to focus on the material and on how other people, animals, plants and the environment can all be manipulated to increase the comfort and ease of existence for the self; i.e. energy absorption. It is for this very reason that our economic structures are collapsing right out from under us as we rewrite this edition; the increasing energy density level that is charging up the whole Solar System simply does not allow these systems of consciousness to propagate any longer – they cannot maintain an existence within the instreaming higher energy. However, once the cycle ends, if we have simply gone above this basic 50-percent level of loving others in our truest, deepest thoughts and actions, then we are ready to evolve to the next level and proceed forward. And even at this late stage in the game, we do still have a narrow chance of increasing the numbers of those who will “make it” to well above 5 percent, hence Ra tells us that “estimation is meaningless.” Those who are going to repeat a third-density cycle are not going to “hell,” they are simply staying at the level that is most appropriate for them to learn. We are told that higher-level beings will transport them to a new planet that is suitable for their path. The Universe allows you to choose a path, negative or positive, in third-density. However, most modern Earth people are stuck in what Ra calls the “morass of indifference” where their actions are not sufficiently polarized for either path, and thereby will repeat the cycle. This is not good or bad, it simply is . These general metaphysical principles are said to be constants throughout the Universe – and in this series of books, we will learn how to remember the Creation from the perspective of the One True Self that we once were. Once we learn the hidden truths of science, our minds have become conditioned to accept a greater inner knowledge of Oneness, and we will automatically advance on our spiritual path as a result. Again, the more that we can step"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"out of our sense of being an individual self, and see others as the self, the quicker we will progress. So, the Law of One concepts of “densities” are clearly different than the dimensions. We can directly see the elemental life of first-density, the “organic” life of second-density and the human life of third-density. The next obvious question is “Why can’t we see the beings in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh densities?” In the Law of One series, it says that \" All the densities 4, 5, 6 and 7 would remain visible, were they not freely choosing not to do so .\" As a brief overview, fourth density is that realm of unconditional love – a realm of love that is not very well informed with wisdom and discernment. Fifth density is the realm of wisdom, and compassion can be lacking. In sixth density compassion and wisdom are integrated. Seventh density is where one recognizes that all things are perfectly sacred, and there is the dissolving of any sense of separate self back into Oneness once more. Finally, the Octave is the Oneness, a return to complete timelessness. Channelers often give many different interpretations of how many dimensions there are, but it is important to remember that the eight-level Octave model is supported by direct higher-dimensional physics equations, as we shall see. We are now moving into the fourth-density level on Earth and will begin studying the lessons of fifth-density as well, and we have every reason to expect that life will be seen as almost unspeakably fantastic compared to what it is like now. The Law of One series tells us that life in fourth-density is “one hundred times more harmonious” than life in the third-density. In the next chapter we will return to our physical modelings of the behavior of this fluidlike aetheric energy, and introduce the penultimate concept of sacred geometry. It is very, very frequently discussed in all ancient teachings, to the point that the main symbol of the Masonic Order is a compass and straightedge, the two basic instruments needed to work with sacred geometry – hence the “G” for “Geometry” in the center of the symbol. A working knowledge of the importance of geometry in the flow of aetheric energy was behind the construction of various pyramids, standing stones, earth mounds and related formations worldwide.

It is important to again remember that these densities are formed by a fluidlike, non-physical energy source. The hard proof for the existence of a fluidlike ‘aether’ is extensive, and will be covered in greater detail in volumes II and III. First of all, from sources including Ra, we know that the Universe is One. This One is unilaterally referred to as Pure White Light. It is also referred to as the \"seed sound\" of the Universe, or the AUM. We are then told that things got rather stale as The One, since nothing really ever changed in this Unity. So, The One decided to create new life from itself. In order to do this, The One vibrated itself into the \"octave.\" The Pure White Light became a series of seven colors - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. The visible color spectrum embodies the memory of this. The One Seed Sound broke up into a series of pure tones - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. The immutable structure of the Octave, those notes which are the purest mathematical ratios and also sound the best to our ears, holds the memory of this. (They can be seen and heard with the white keys on the piano.) Another word for vibration is “harmonics,” and we will frequently use that word to describe these systems. We need to remember that this Pure Light and Pure Sound are simply two different ways of describing the same vibrations of the fluidlike “intelligent energy” of the One. There is no real difference between them, as they are both functions of vibration. Sound is a vibration of air molecules, and light is ultimately a vibration of the fluidlike aether. We will see in Volume II how Dale Pond has demonstrated that if you multiply the pure sound frequencies many times over, you get the visible color frequencies, thus showing the equivalence between the two. [Most scientists agree that light behaves like a wave, but they also try to assert that there is no medium that the wave is traveling through – that the wave is simply a particle-like entity known as a “photon” traveling through an empty ‘vacuum.’ This is a preposterous notion, as all natural examples of waves have something that they are ‘waving’ through. The basic definition of a wave is “an impulse that travels through a medium,” and in reality light is no different.] The third key “harmonic” component that we need to have in place after light and sound is geometry, which is the visible result of vibration. The first and most important geometry that we must start with is the sphere, which the ancient traditions see as the highest geometry in the Universe, the pure essence of the One. In our physics model, the Universe is ultimately spherical in shape, as its energy fields expanded at a uniform rate in all directions as it was formed. [All of our visible galaxies in the Universe have coalesced into"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"one single “flat” super-galaxy, however, but the spherical energy fields are still present around this super-galaxy, just not as visible. This will be discussed in Volume III.] A sphere can be compressed into a single point, which has no space and no time, and thus exist as the simplest object in the Universe, but the sphere also is the most complex form in the Universe, containing all other things within itself. Although this might not seem to make sense at first, it is actually quite simple to explain when we start out with a “flat” two-dimensional demonstration, as the ancient students of sacred geometry would learn. We start by drawing a circle with a compass. Any spot on a circle could be defined as a point, and you could then take a straightedge and draw a line to any other possible spot on the circle. There are literally an infinite number of different lines, angles and shapes that could be drawn within the circle. Mathematically speaking, no other geometric shape can form as many different geometries inside of itself as a circle can, and thus it is the most complex two-dimensional shape there is. At the same time, its pure, harmonic structure makes it the simplest possible two-dimensional shape in the Universe. It is the only shape where there is only one edge, no straight lines, and a curve that is completely unified for a full 360 degrees around a single center point. It resolves to One, and thus it is the simplest possible two- dimensional shape. When we expand this into three dimensions, we can then see that the similar principle applies to the sphere. Confusingly, physicist Buckminster Fuller described a sphere as \" a multiplicity of discrete events, approximately equidistant in all directions from a nuclear center. \" Events, you say? To put this in drastically simpler language, in a sphere you can draw an infinite number of lines that connect to an infinite number of points (i.e. “events” ) on the surface of the sphere, with all the lines starting from one single center point or nucleus, and all the lines will come out to be the exact same length. This makes the sphere the most complex three-dimensional object that there is; an infinite number of different geometric shapes can be drawn inside of it, by simply connecting different points on the surface of the sphere together. Once you stretch or flatten the sphere in any way, you have less symmetry and thus have less flexibility in what can be geometrically created inside. (This may seem hard to understand, but it can be proven mathematically. This also explains why liquid naturally forms into spheres when it is in free-fall and/or in a soap bubble, as the air pressure on the liquid is equal on all sides.) The sphere is also the simplest three-dimensional formation in the Universe for the same reasons as the circle; namely, there is only one edge, perfectly symmetrical in its curvature around a center point, and thus all resolves to One. For comparison, a cube would have six sides or edges, and this is one of the simplest three-dimensional shapes that there is. The sphere has only one ‘side’. Interestingly, the work of Dr. Hans Jenny (pronounced “Yenny”) has shown that when a spherical area of fluid is vibrated at pure “Diatonic” sound frequencies, i.e. the basic vibrations of the Octave, then geometric forms emerge inside the fluid. Tiny particles that Jenny put in the fluid known as ‘colloids’ would assemble into basic geometric forms during the experiment, leaving clear water in between – where normally the particles would be suspended all throughout the water equally. If Dr. Jenny turned up the sound frequency to a higher level, then more complex geometric structures would"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"appear, and when he turned it back down to the original level, the exact same geometry that he started with would be seen once again in the same way. This is quite a dramatic demonstration when seen on Dr. Jenny’s “Cymatics” video, which is accessible from various sources – yet such research has been remarkably undervalued and / or ignored by the scientific community. Thus, geometry is a very basic characteristic of vibration – or as Pythagoras once said, “Geometry is frozen music.” The five most important three- dimensional geometries are collectively known as the Platonic solids, since the Greek philosopher Plato first wrote them about in modern times. Figure 3.1 – The five Platonic Solids. As one note, the Star Tetrahedron is more technically known as an interlaced tetrahedron. You can also examine the tetrahedron by itself, which is simply a four-sided pyramid with equilateral triangles on each face, but in terms of the workings of energy as vibration, it appears that most tetrahedral structures have two tetrahedrons stuck inside of each other as we see above. There is clear evidence that any scientific effort which moves towards a discovery of the importance of these geometries in the Universe is being actively suppressed, as those in the secret brotherhoods still have a high degree of power and feel bound to “ever conceal and never reveal” the “secrets of the Order.” Many of these group members have deliberately arisen to power in various scientific institutions, and are thus positioned to deflect certain types of research, especially those related to free energy / anti- gravity, as we shall discuss in Volume II. Richard Hoagland and the Enterprise Mission, working with Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, have shown how such suppression efforts trace back to the 19th century, at least. The great 19th century pioneer who analyzed the behavior of the electromagnetic (EM) wave was Sir James Clerk Maxwell. His equations, known as “quaternions,” were"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"used to map out the full, hidden internal structures of the EM wave in full 3-D view, with over 200 equations altogether. When you analyze all 200+ quaternions as a group, you see the geometry of a tetrahedron inside a sphere. This is the hidden secret of the electromagnetic wave, the underlying structure that determines its behavior as it moves along – and Oliver Heaviside and others, who reduced Maxwell’s equations to four basic quaternions and declared the hidden geometry to be “occult nonsense”, vigorously removed it from all academic debate. Had this not been done, we may have “solved the puzzle” far earlier along. There is no direct way to prove that those from the secret groups inspired this political move on Maxwell’s work, but it is exactly what we would expect based on their own system of beliefs that they are sworn to uphold on pain of death. An even more obvious example was the demonizing of the “aether” concept through using the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment as “proof.” 19th century mystic Madame Blavatsky predicted that the aether would be removed from discussion, and that “the pillars of science would come down along with it.” We will discuss this more fully in volumes II and III. Even now, the anti-aether bias is so strong that you will be almost immediately dismissed if you try to bring it up in a scientific discussion – but we are not concerned, as time and proof will heal this wound. Once we do accept the existence of a fluidlike aether at various levels of density, where each density has a different quality of vibration, then we realize that certain clear geometric forms will emerge at the various “pure” frequencies. Indeed, geometry is the single most important aspect of the aether’s behavior in terms of being able to construct stable structures, such as crystals. Without the geometry, matter would not be possible, as geometry is what allows the “field bubbles” of the aether to clump together in precise, organized patterns, forming specific molecules. Otherwise, the best we could hope for is that the spheres would line up pole-to-pole, and otherwise be free flowing around each other – and this behavior would not be complex enough to build matter. The tips of the geometries have more strength to attract each other than the other areas on the surface of the sphere, as we shall discuss below, and this allows the spheres to organize into non-random “matrix” patterns. Though we cannot directly see these geometries most of the time, except in crystal structures, microclusters and quasi-crystals (volume III), they create distinct “stresses” or pressure zones in the aether that can exert enormous forces on their environment. Think about the force that is contained in a whirlpool and you’ll see how a fluid can have areas of stronger and weaker force inside of it. These geometric forms therefore possess both qualities of a fluid, as they are forming in a fluid medium, as well as a crystal, as they are clearly geometric – hence Dr. Harold Aspden refers to them as “fluid crystals.” By the end of Volume III, we will have constructed a complete physics model to demonstrate how these formations are hidden within all physics, whether quantum, biological or cosmological. If you think the science of chemistry and quantum physics is complete as it is, you will be very surprised to find out how many problems there are with the current models – and that the design we present here solves every one of these problems. In this book we will cover some of the basics of how this geometric patterning works, including the “Global Grid” of energy lines on the Earth, which directly shape the continents."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The most important quality of the Platonic Solids is that each shape fits perfectly into a sphere, such that all its outer points precisely merge with the outside surface of the sphere. Each of the straight lines that make up these objects will be the same length, and all geometric points on the sphere’s surface are equidistant from their neighbors – which is exactly what we would expect with the science of vibration. Plato and other Greek philosophers also pointed out that all the angle measurements in these geometric solids are the same, and that each side of the three-dimensional objects have to be the same shape. Although this may seem confusing at first, it actually works out very nicely. There are only five major shapes to contend with when we look at this information. Those five shapes are the octahedron, star tetrahedron, cube (hexahedron), dodecahedron and icosahedron. In order to understand why such geometric objects form inside a vibrating sphere of fluidlike energy, we have to know a little about wave movement. If we have a simple two-dimensional wave, such as a vibrating guitar string, then there are three basic components that will stay the same if the wave is not disturbed. These three basic components are the wavelength, the frequency and the amplitude. The wavelength is how long each part of the wave is, i.e. “the observed distance between two adjacent wave crests,” (measured as a length quantity in angstroms when dealing with visible light.) The frequency is the number of wave crests that pass by an observer each second – measured as cycles per second or “hertz,” and the amplitude is how high each wave is – i.e. “the size of the wave measured from zero to peak.” Any color or sound that stays the same for a length of time will have a continuous repetition of the same wavelength during that time. As a typical example, the “concert-level” frequency for the note A is 440 cycles per second. This means that when air vibrates 440 times in one second, our ear interprets this as the musical sound “A”. That’s all there is to it. If those 440 cycles didn’t all have the same frequency and amplitude, then we wouldn’t hear a steady pitch at a steady volume. If we increase the frequency of the sound, such as by going up to 497 cycles per second, then the pitch will go up as the wavelength shortens. If we increase the amplitude, the volume of the sound will go up as the height of the wave increases, but its pitch will stay the same. We should also remember that complex information can be stored in these waves. We have two types of waves that are used for radio: frequency modulation, or FM, and amplitude modulation, or AM. The word ‘modulation’ simply means ‘changing.’ So, as a simple explanation, the FM waves stay at the same amplitude but have continuing changes (modulations) in their frequency, whereas the AM waves maintain the same frequency but have continuing changes in amplitude. That’s basically all there is to it. Since these electromagnetic waves can move so fast, there is a great deal of information that can be stored within them – and that is an important point. The encoded information of AM/FM radio, CB, the police / fire / emergency bands, broadcast and satellite television stations, cordless and cellular telephone conversations are always around us in every moment. Now when we have a three-dimensional geometric waveform inside of a sphere, the wavelength and frequency would be represented by the distance between the various node points across the surface of the sphere, which could be measured in degrees, and calculated by the sine function in trigonometry."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The amplitude would be measured by the size of the sphere, which could be measured in radians, and calculated by the cosine function. Thus, as we pump up the strength (amplitude) of a given spherical energy field, so too will we increase its size – which explains why these structures exist from the tiniest level of quantum mechanics all the way up to the known Universe. It is also important to realize that in this fluidlike aether system, increases in frequency will also draw in more aetheric energy from the surrounding environment, and thereby increase the size (amplitude) of the sphere as one geometry shifts to another. We will explore this later in the chapter, when we see how neatly the different Platonic Solids “nest” inside of each other, with each new geometry larger than the one inside of it. So typically, a frequency increase will also involve an amplitude increase. The only thing left to explain is why the vibrations form tips or points or vertices at the surface of the sphere, with straight lines connecting them. Again, returning to a the simple study of a wave in two dimensions, known as wave mechanics, we know that every wave has certain points known as “nodes” where there is no movement. This is easiest to see with the basic sine wave, which is shaped like a slow-moving wave on the surface of a lake – a continuing S-shaped curve. If you pluck a guitar string, there are certain areas of the wave where there is no movement at all, but it actually will remain perfectly still. These areas are the “nodes,” and you obtain the wavelength by measuring the distance between these nodes. A node could also be seen as the area where a child’s seesaw is supported by a metal pole; either side of the seesaw can go up and down, but the middle of the board will always stay in the same place. Again, such a point is known in wave mechanics as a “node” or a “moment point.” Similarly, the pointy tips or vertices of the Platonic Solids represent the nodes of the wave. These points are where the least amount of vibration is occurring throughout the entire sphere. Consequently, we will see that in this “stillness” is great power, caused by the pressure surrounding the points. These node areas (as well as the exact center of the sphere) actually have the greatest energetic strength across the entire surface of the sphere, because the surrounding higher-pressure zones of vibration will naturally gather up and direct everything “loose” in the area back to these low-pressure zones. It is for this very reason that the most number of loose “colloids” would gather into these nodes in Dr. Jenny’s experiments. (This is also the same reason why high-pressure storm clouds will rush into a low-pressure zone in our atmosphere.) Since these nodes exert great force on each other by the laws of vibration, then as the old saying goes, “the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.” So, straight lines of force are naturally formed between these nodes once they are created, and when you see all the lines combined together, the geometric object emerges – just like connect-the- dots. The last terms from wave mechanics that we need to introduce at this time are “moving wave” and “standing wave.” (The terms “dynamic” or “propagating” for the moving wave and “static” for the standing wave are also used.) This is quite self-explanatory – a moving wave moves through space, where a standing wave stands still as it vibrates. So, if we have a sphere of fluid that remains stationary and has a geometric stress pattern of vibration inside of it, that geometry is referred to as a “standing wave.” Once we think in these terms, it becomes easy to put the model together – it is based on"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"simple, known physical principles of vibrating fluid, and the quasi-solid “stresses” that can be formed inside of it by vibration. MATCHING UP GEOMETRIC FORMS TO THE “DENSITIES” Now if we think back to the idea that there is an Octave of aetheric densities in the Universe, we can see that these densities have color, sound and geometric components. This is perhaps the most frequently studied connection that was explored by the inheritors of the ancient mysteries, long after they had lost track of the full scope of scientific knowledge that was behind it. So, one early puzzle that we worked on from 1996 to 1998 was, “How do we assign a geometric shape to each of the seven major densities, since there are only five Platonic Solids and the sphere to work with?” We do not need eight shapes, as the ancient traditions tell us that the sphere exists both at the beginning and the end of the Octave. Similarly, in the Octave of sound, any note that is an octave higher than another note will sound the same, just in a different register – a higher or lower octave. Mathematically, any musical note that is an octave higher than another note will have exactly twice as many cycles per second – so “A” at 440 cycles per second will again become “A” when it gets to 880 cycles per second. So where is the seventh shape? The answer was found in the “religious myths” of the ancient Vedic scriptures from India, the remnants of the Rama empire, as told in Robert Lawlor’s invaluable book Sacred Geometry. The Hindus, or their contacts, supplied the answer by supplying us with one of the Platonic Solids twice. Just as the sphere appears twice, at the beginning and end of the octave, so does its closest harmonic partner, the icosahedron, located at the second and seventh density levels. For the rich, mystical culture of the ancient Vedic texts, with the full cooperation of extradimensional entities flying about in fabulous vimanas, the icosahedron shape was actually turned into a god. They named him Purusha, and in the seventh dimension, or density, he represents the masculine force in the universe. Figure 3.2 – The icosahedron, known as the masculine god “Purusha” to the ancient Rama empire."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"As we just said, Purusha also shows up as the first shape for the sphere to crystallize into when we are at the beginning of the spectrum. Therefore, the One, being a manifestation of all conscious entities, must crystallize down into the world of form as Purusha, and any entity must again attain the level of Purusha to return to the One at the end of the cycle. The next image from Lawlor’s Sacred Geometry shows how you would draw an icosahedron in two dimensions, using a compass and straightedge. Figure 3.3 – The icosahedron, as drawn in two dimensions with a compass and straightedge. (From Sacred Geometry) Before we assert that the Hindu culture was sexist and male-driven, assigning masculinity to all the best spiritual forces in life, realize that there is a yin to our yang. The universal feminine force is referred to as Prakriti, and is identified as the dodecahedron, or the sixth density. Figure 3.4 – The dodecahedron, known as the feminine goddess “Prakriti” to the ancient Rama empire. (From Sacred Geometry)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"In fact, it appears that each density can be considered as having either “male” or “female” qualities, the second being female, third male, fourth female, fifth male, et cetera. Let us not forget that the Oneness is a combination of both genders in Unity. Thus, as Purusha starts as female in the second density, we see that it is, indeed, a father / mother god, also encompassing the feminine, or Prakriti archetype within itself. Once we read further into the design and understand the metaphysical and spiritual properties of the dimensions, their “genders” will make tremendously good sense. Other than the sphere, we can see that Purusha and Prakriti are the two highest shapes in the spectrum, so it makes sense, in some way, that these two shapes themselves could have been personified as gods and goddesses. These higher realms are clearly something we can aspire to, and these are, essentially, conscious shapes. Our own home is currently in shape number 3. This, the octahedron, is the vibratory level that provides the invisible background framework for the energy that all of our atoms and molecules are created from. Rod Johnson, whose sacred geometry model of quantum physics covered in Volume III, has asserted that the massless \"neutrinos\" that have been observed in the laboratory could well be octahedrons. However, more often than not these vibrations would remain undetectable, as they are only the underlying framework of reality, not the actual reality itself. When you look at a finished skyscraper, you don't see the I-beams. Similarly, we don't see the \"zero-point energy\" that creates \"virtual particles\" of protons, neutrons and electrons which constantly wink in and out of existence, but yet we know that it must exist. Therefore, the ancient physics would teach us that this shape represents the fundamental background for all matter in our \"density.\" This is the forgotten ancient teaching. It is important to realize that this is only a general rule, as within our own density we see evidence of all the Platonic Solids, representing the different “sub-densities.” We need all of them in place to be able to build physical matter – but the strongest one in third-density is the octahedron. Figure 3.5 – The octahedron, which is the underlying geometry of our own “third density.”"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"To look at just the top half of an octahedron, we can easily see that it is identical to the shape of the Egyptian Great Pyramid. With the full physics model in place, this simple fact will clearly illustrate that all pyramids were designed in order to be able to focus this geometric energy of the aether, much as would a funnel direct a flow of water. As we will see later in this volume, the “torsion fields” on the Earth can vary from place to place far more than the normal “push” of gravity or of the Earth’s magnetic field, and in the Russian lingo, any pyramid acts as a “passive torsion generator.” Matter itself behaves like a vibrating sponge that is submerged in water, with fluidlike energy continually flowing in and out of it with a pulsating motion. When you clump matter together into a single structure, the shape of that structure will determine how the aether “currents” flow through it. Any cylinder or cone-shaped object will harness and focalize torsion fields, as we have extensively documented in Volume III. There are always torsion fields coming out of the Earth in spirals, and the cone shape can direct and focus these fields. Let us not forget that these fields are composed of intelligent energy, so one major benefit of harnessing these fields is that they will dramatically enhance your physical health as well as your spiritual consciousness in a short time – hence the ancient Egyptians referred to the pyramids as “temples of initiation.” And we know that the Greek word “Pyramid” is a conjunction of the words “Pyre” and “Amid,” meaning “Fire in the Middle.” This “fire in the middle” represents the energy fields that are harnessed inside the Pyramid – hence the name itself conceals part of the secret. In essence, with the proper science in place, we realize that the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, the most precisely constructed pyramid on Earth, is a fantastic machine, fashioned with a technology that is far more advanced than our present scientific level of understanding. The reason why is that this is a technology of consciousness, working off of a physics model that we are only just now rediscovering in the public arena. And the more that we examine the Pyramid, the more that we can see how accurate and comprehensive the ancient knowledge that went into it must be. It is an established, longstanding fact that if you take the difference between the base and height measurements of the Pyramid, the pi ratio of 3.14159 is expressed. This means that you could draw a circle from one corner, over the top and down to the opposite corner, and that circle would perfectly touch all three points. Then, all we have to do is think in three dimensions, and we will quickly discover that the Pyramid mathematically fits perfectly within a half- sphere."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Figure 3.6 – The Great Pyramid fits perfectly within a half-sphere, as pictured. So, in a very direct fashion, the pyramid structure forms “resonance” with the aether, causing a sphere of unseen energy to form around itself just like this. Remember that the strongest geometric energy structure of our own dimension, if we could see it, would look exactly like this. Thus, the Pyramid was not only a geometric object, it was literally built as a giant, solidified “consciousness unit.” On one level, we could think of it as a giant statue in honor of the energy density that we now inhabit – but it is also a very potent machine. We have also been told by Ra that it was far more effective when it was first built than it is now, due to the changing positions of the Earth and the deterioration of its stone faces. Many Pyramidologists have pointed out that the outside of the Great Pyramid expresses the exact length of an Earth year, 365.2422, in many different measurements. Since scholars understand that the Pyramid perfectly fits into a half-sphere, many have concluded that the Pyramid is designed to represent the Earth. But that wouldn't explain why the pyramid builders didn’t simply erect a globe, especially with the apparent technology that they had at their disposal to precisely position such huge stones. It is only now that we can see why the octahedral form was chosen in order to do this. Though we cannot see the Pyramid as a crystal now, it is a well-known fact in Egyptological circles that when the Pyramid was first built, it was entirely covered on the outside with casing stones. These were made of white Tura limestone that was precisely mirror-polished to a glowing sheen (Lemesurier, 1977.) It was so bright in daylight as to be blinding, hence the ancient Egyptians named it “Ta Khut,” or “The Light.” It would be very easy to conclude that it was not built by primitive human beings when seen in this original form. In the next picture below, we see the remnants of these stones that still exist along the bottom."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Figure 3.7 – Casing stones that still exist along the base perimeter of the Great Pyramid. What is not often known is that the spaces in between these casing stones were only 1/100th of an inch wide (Lemesurier, Hoagland.) For comparison, the best that modern technology could do to align the heat shield tiles on the Space Shuttle was one thirtieth of an inch tolerance (Hoagland.) This puts the fashioning of the casing stones on the level of optical precision; something we would normally only use for extremely sensitive pieces of equipment. All of this precision was used to make it that much more effective as a “machine” that harnessed torsion fields. Furthermore, in these incredibly tight spaces between casing stones, so tight that a knife blade cannot be pushed into them, there is an impossibly thin layer of “cement” holding them together. This “cement” is so strong that to strike the joint with a sledgehammer, the limestone itself breaks before the “cement” does. Still to this day, no one has provided a satisfactory explanation for how this could have been done. It certainly appears that the stones themselves were fused in place, and thus it wasn’t cement at all, but a product of extreme heat, melting the two stones together. So how did they get the heat? A laser, perhaps? Or was it focused consciousness, transforming the matter phase of conscious limestone molecules? Ra's explanations start to make more and more sense to us as we go along, as in their model, they were able to use consciousness to visualize how they wanted the stones to arrange themselves, and their visualizations would then become reality. To summarize, then, the outside of the Pyramid was fashioned with an optical precision that is only now matched by the type of work that we would do on a mirror lens for a reflecting telescope (Hoagland.) We must then picture a giant pyramid built out of four mirrors, so bright in the daylight as to be almost blinding. Again, it is no wonder that ancient Egyptians referred to it as “Ta Khut,” or The Light. When it was in its true crystal state, there could be no doubt that it was not built by the humans of the time; it would be a most totally alien-looking structure. We can only imagine its original appearance"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"now, as earthquakes jarred most of the casing stones loose in the early years of the first millennium AD, and these perfect white stones were then hauled off to build mosques in Cairo. Thus we can only measure the original design of the casing stones from the few that remain along the bottom, still intact. The top of the second pyramid also has some casing stones still remaining. Figure 3.8 – Top-down view of second pyramid on the Giza plateau, showing casing stones at top. This almost insane degree of precision starts to make a lot more sense when we realize what energies might be able to be harnessed by the building of such a structure. These energies would not be cold and lifeless like electricity; instead, they would represent conscious energy, and could thus be directed by a conscious human being, once trained. The author’s own sources, along with Ra and the Cayce readings, indicate that a person well trained in directing this energy could rejuvenate dying bodies to extreme youth and vitality, travel in time and levitate massive objects with ease. Furthermore, it helped to stabilize the Earth on its axis, decrease severe weather and earthquakes in the surrounding area, heal and normalize the mind, purify water, create usable energy and eliminate leftover radiation from nuclear battles in much shorter amounts of time. The more we learn about the science that is involved, the more obvious this will become – and the greater of a desire we will have to rebuild a worldwide network of pyramids once again to heal the earth of the present damages that we are creating. Indeed, Ra tells us that the Pyramid was a giant gift that they produced for our civilization, a gift whose primary purpose centered on providing a temple"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"for initiation while also functioning as an effective balancing agent for the Earth’s energy fields. Having a “temple of initiation” meant that higher-level energies could be harnessed and integrated into the physical and nonphysical bodies of the human seeker, and the full soul evolution progress through the spectrum of seven densities could then be made while still on Earth. This was a very rigorous and terrifying process, as one essentially confronts all of the “distortions” of the personality self at once, in what amounts to a subjectively long-lasting nightmare. A trained healer, who can travel with the person out- of-body while they go on this journey, was always present for this work to be done, since the fear alone could cause the person to lose track of the physical body and thereby die. If the initiation was successful, then after such a progressive evolution is complete, that entity would have access to all the power of the entire octave of dimensions, becoming like a god and having Christlike abilities, if it decided not to leave the Earth. One reason that the inheritors of the Atlantean Mysteries felt that they had to keep the knowledge a secret is that they felt that if a negatively-polarized person made sufficient progress in the Pyramid, they could become a very powerful force of evil on Earth – even though it appears that this would not truly be possible, since the negative path cannot sustain itself above the fifth density. It should be no surprise that mystical tradition long holds that Jesus also completed a Pyramidal initiation in such a manner, and might well have been the only person coming in well equipped enough to actually complete the process in full. According to the Edgar Cayce readings, Jesus enjoyed a former lifetime as Hermes, the co-designer of the Pyramid with the priest Ra- Ta, who later reincarnated as Cayce himself. Thus, it appears that Jesus later utilized the very piece of technology that he originally helped to build, in order to complete his own initiation. As we will see in the end of the book, the Pyramid actually wrote Jesus’ arrival directly into a timeline based on a geometric and numeric code built into the design of the chambers and passages inside. The prophetic statement of this Messianic arrival occurs at the moment where the narrow Ascending Passage suddenly heightens tremendously into the Grand Gallery. This particular event in the Pyramid symbolism is arguably one of the single most powerful symbolic events of the entire span of time given. Obviously Jesus knew, even as he helped design this incredible structure, what he would later use it for in future lifetimes. If the pyramid shape is a basic product of understanding a more advanced physics than we are now using, then we would expect that the technology would be discovered by any civilized society on any inhabited planet. In 1981, Ra said that Mars is the only remaining planet in our Solar System that had third-dimensional humanoid life like ourselves in any recent past. And in the late 1980's, Richard Hoagland’s work began to be more widely known, which did indeed reveal the remnants of just such a civilization. From Hoagland and others' data regarding Mars, we see that the largest and easiest pyramid to identify in the Viking-photographed Cydonia region of Mars is five-sided, almost precisely duplicating the top of an icosahedron, or the Hindu god Purusha, if we remember. Near this five-sided pyramid is a city complex of slightly smaller pyramids that appear identical to those we see in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"In addition, the Mariner-photographed Elysium pyramids on Mars are clearly in the form of tetrahedrons, and Carl Munck, whom we will meet in later chapters, demonstrates a North American Earth mound in the form of a tetrahedron in his book The Code, also available from the Laura Lee Online Bookstore. Furthermore, Hoagland and others have written of spherical glass domes on the Moon, which might well serve the same purpose in harnessing torsion fields, holding in an atmosphere and providing a clear view of “outer space.” Our own ex-NASA astrophysicist Maurice Chatelain, whom we also shall discuss in later chapters, came forward in 1995 with the shattering revelation that NASA had found \"geometric ruins of unknown origin\" on the Moon during the Mariner and Apollo missions. More recently, similar testimony was given at the Disclosure Project conferences, starting on May 9, 2001 – and we attended the May 10 event and personally interviewed the witness. GEOMETRIC ENERGY TRANSITIONS Our next question is, “How do we naturally map out the transitions from one geometric energy frequency to the next?” Through a moderately complex set of procedures, one can demonstrate how each geometric form will naturally “grow” out of the one before it. To begin with, the sphere into the icosahedron is relatively obvious – the movement of formless Unity into geometric form – so there is no real modeling to be done. The second-density icosahedron into the third-density octahedron will be clearly modeled in Volume II. In order to turn our own octahedron into the shape of the 4th dimension, all that is required is to expand each face into a basic four-sided triangle, or tetrahedron. In our diagram here, we conceptualize it as if you were going to place a tetrahedron onto each face separately. Figure 3.8 – The transition of the octahedron (L) into the star tetrahedron (R)."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Each face on the octahedron, which is in the form of an equilateral triangle, (composed entirely of 60-degree internal angles, with each side the same length,) becomes one three-sided tip of a star tetrahedron. As the octahedron has eight sides, you would then need to add eight tetrahedra to its faces. To animate this progression like a cartoon, it would appear that the octahedron was suddenly blooming like a flower; the faces suddenly sprout upwards as the tetrahedra rise into position. [Compare the diagram here with the original harmonic table in order to help visualize this. The top right shape in the diagram shows where one of the eight tetrahedra would be, in terms of position, if it were not attached directly to the octahedron.] In order to then progress from the fourth dimension to the fifth, you can look at the diagram and easily see how a simple connect-the-dots on the edge points of the star tetrahedron forms the cube. To go from the fifth-dimensional cube to the sixth-dimensional dodecahedron, a further outward expansion is required, where each face of the cube sprouts an inward-slanting \"rooftop\" in order to turn into the dodecahedron. The \"roof\" shape that appears is most easily seen in the rectangular area below, whereas the square area would be more akin to an overhead view. Figure 3.9 – The cube’s “nested” position within the dodecahedron. Then, if you put a dot in the center of each pentagon on the dodecahedron and connect all of the dots together, you will have a series of lines that form five-pointed stars that create the icosahedron shape, the last major node before the return to the Sphere. In short, going back to our original harmonic table again, we can see how the entire progression is a sphere, or a Oneness, expanding into the “seed” or fundamental form of the icosahedron, which then by its structure gives rise to all of the other forms contained therein (Lawlor, 1982.) The \"seed\" aspect of the icosahedron is why the Hindus associated it with a male god - they were using the metaphor of the semen, or \"seed of life.\" "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Figure 3.10 – The full hierarchy of geometric shapes that represent the Octave of densities, L-R What we have here is an understanding of the fact that the shapes formed by these energy vibrations can grow, much in the way that crystals grow. ALL IS ONE We shall briefly cover another point that has been a major source of confusion to those reading this book, and attempt to break it down into simpler terms in this revised edition. If you still find it difficult to understand, just be reminded that it isn’t an essential point that is needed to understand the physics. In order for the Universe to truly be One, there must be a level where there is no space and no time – where All is Here and Now. Sources such as “Seth” through Jane Roberts tell us that nothing in the Universe really ‘exists,’ including the aether itself – that all the Universe is expanding and contracting from a single point of Oneness in each and every moment. So, the many tiny “field bubbles” that make up the fluidlike aether appear to flow around each other when we study their behavior. On one level, this is indeed true, as the experiments of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev, Nikola Tesla and others have demonstrated, which we will cover in Volume III. On another level, we must remember that the amplitude of the spherical wave shows us that the “zero point” of the wave is indeed right in the center, meaning that the wave itself is constantly expanding and collapsing from a single point. Think of a balloon that is constantly inflating and deflating from a very tiny point to a very large sphere. At the highest level of vibration, all of the energy in the sphere is contained within the central point. Though this does seem confusing, various sources such as Seth and Ra tell us that all of those single points are actually joined together in Oneness – that there is only one single point that all is emanating from. This is another way that we can understand that we do have a perfect “spark” of the One Infinite Creator within ourselves. If this is true, and we have every reason to believe that it is, then each of the geometric shapes that we have discussed must be continually present, at their own frequency, in every “consciousness unit” or field bubble in the entire Universe. Roughly speaking, every energy form is pulsating from a point, through the icosahedron, into the octahedron, to the star tetrahedron, to the cube, to the dodecahedron, again to the icosahedron, and again back into the sphere or point once more. This is the only way we can explain that Seth would tell us, loosely paraphrased, that “your entire reality system is “off” as much as it is “on,” and you simply do not vibrate quickly enough to see what is in between the gaps.” Another analogy that we have used is the idea of a filmstrip. The actual filmstrip in a movie camera is a series of still pictures that are separated from each other, but when we watch them fast enough, they form “moving pictures,” or “movies.” So, the spherical energy that forms the Universe itself could be seen to vibrate through all the different shapes at mind-numbing speeds, forever expanding from a single point out to form the boundaries of space and time as"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"we know it and then compressing back into that space yet again just as quickly. Although it seems almost impossible to conceive of our entire universe as crumpling up into a single point over and over again at speeds too fast to measure, this is exactly what is happening, say sources such as Ra. Since all of physical reality is ultimately nothing but conscious energy in vibration, each density would then have the illusion of only existing at one level in this energetic system. In fact, all of the densities are interpenetrable, and the vibrations from higher densities will exert measurable stresses in space and time here in the third. Among other things, this forms the basis for the Global Grid, which we will examine in future chapters."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 04: THE BREATH OF THE DIVINE AND SUPERSTRING THEORY CHAPTER 04: THE BREATH OF THE DIVINE AND “SUPERSTRING THEORY” This author’s first understanding of this pulsating movement of aether known as the “Breath of the Divine” or “Breath of the Compassionate” came from a passage that fellow researcher Joe Mason (www.greatdreams.com) read him out of a book on the first night that they shared information, November 9-10, 1996. This conversation directly led to Wilcock’s first telepathic breakthrough to Higher Intelligence the next morning, which started an entirely new life as the “veil” was lifted. Mason graciously supplied us with these next two paragraphs to illustrate the example of this geometric breath that he uncovered. The late Walter Russell, who was an artist and scientist located in Waynesboro, Virginia, had a published reading on pg. 165 in the book “Channeling” by John Klimo. Russell claimed that the messages came from “God,” and that they gave him an understanding of how the basic universal forces of electromagnetism, gravity, and atomic energy really operate. Let’s hear what God has to say, from an excerpt first published in 1947: “In My universe there is but one form from which all forms appear. That one form is the pulsing cube-sphere, two halves of the heartbeat of My dual thinking. All forms pulse, therefore, all forms are two, one form for the inbreathing pulse, which generates, and one for the outbreathing, radiating one. The cube is the sphere expanded by the outward breath to black rest in cold space, and the sphere is the cube compressed to the incandescence of white-hot suns by the inward breath.” Walter Russell was clearly way ahead of his time, as in the early 20th century he experienced 39 days of “illumination” where he could see how the Universe really worked. Many students of Russell’s work are delighted to see that we have continued along similar lines, drawing upon many new findings that were not available at his time, and we attended his surviving organization’s “Metascience and Cosmic Consciousness” conference in 2000. The website for this group, the University of Science and Philosophy, is www.philosophy.org. The author is also happy to have met John Klimo, the author of the book “Channeling,” in 2002 at the US Psychotronics Association conference, where Wilcock was a well-received speaker and workshop presenter. Klimo has recently done a dramatic revision and updating of this classic text, still often considered to be required reading for those who wish to learn about channeling. If we examine the above excerpt, we again have the psychic suggestion that the entire Universe is continually pulsating from the spherical \"incandescence of white-hot suns\" to the cubical \"black rest of cold space.\" Although this particular passage does not intimate the speed with which this pulsation is occurring, sources such as Seth and Ra fill in the gaps. And therefore, from this little-known psychic source from the early to mid-twentieth century, we have another contact with a Higher Intelligence that was attempting to reveal to us the hidden harmonic code of the progression of densities. The quote above expresses the heart of the story, without going into all the technical"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"detail regarding the different shapes making up the Octave. The Ra contact did not name the actual shapes either, as they explained that it is very difficult for them to use words that are not already stored within the channel's conscious or subconscious mind. Looking at Russell's quote, we can see that even without the extra geometries added in, there are very close similarities to the Hindu story of Purusha and Prakriti. Again, we have the masculine and feminine forces dancing in an eternal pulsating rhythm with each other, representing what Russell's source called the “two halves of the heartbeat of My dual thinking.” (It is important to point out that some of Russell’s diagrams, such as in the book Atomic Suicide?, do show the other Platonic Solids as well.) An even more direct example of this energetic behavior comes from the highly respected book The Seth Material, brought through by Jane Roberts in 1971. Roberts claimed to be in contact with an entity who called itself Seth and said that it was from the fifth dimension. In The Seth Material there is ample evidence given for Seth's high intelligence and capabilities, as he could perform psychic \"parlor tricks\" such as reading the contents in sealed envelopes, and at one point he also led a very high-level philosophical discussion with a tenacious college professor who was determined to \"debunk\" the contact. The professor repeatedly referred to ancient metaphors and abstract philosophical concepts that only a graduate philosophy student would have known, and Seth was consistently aware of exactly where the professor was going and provided quite the intellectual challenge point-for-point. Furthermore, at various times Seth was actually capable of creating visual holographic images of himself or other related phenomena, as well as being able to alter the consciousness of others in the room to a trance-like state if he so chose. In The Seth Material, a picture of Seth is drawn as he appeared in apparition form in front of one of Roberts' friends during a session. The large bald head and black eyes is almost stunningly reminiscent of the Grey features that would become so commonplace more than 15 years later, with the advent of “Communion” by Whitley Strieber. Figure 4.1 – The appearance of “Seth” in 1969 as seen by an associate of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Jane Roberts. Again, this apparition was an actual visual manifestation that occurred in the room during one of Jane Roberts' trances, as the reading itself talked them through the experience. While Robert Butts continued to transcribe Seth's words, William Cameron Macdonnel sketched the entity. Seth later commented that the head Bill had drawn was too tall, and lowering the height of the skull would only make the apparition look even more like a typical Gray – though this was way before such images were popular. Says Seth, in our quote from Jane Roberts' book: \"[This picture] represents the appearance that these abilities of mine take on when closely connected with the physical plane. This does not necessarily mean that in all planes I have the same image. It is the first such representation of me, and I am quite fond of it...\" [Note: Roberts then includes the following information:] ...Seth explained that the apparition's appearance was distorted by Bill's own ideas, though. The high forehead represented Bill's interpretation of great intelligence, for example. Bill interpreted the available data in his own way: this was the Seth that Bill saw, regardless of Seth's own appearance. Now, this enigmatic image has filtered its way through the collective consciousness of humanity, largely through the efforts of Whitley Strieber and his groundbreaking work “Communion.” It is quite stunning to realize that at the time that this apparition was first seen in 1969, the \"Summer of Love,\" almost no one was aware of this facial morphology as being related to extraterrestrials. Now, were the event to have happened again, Seth would probably look even more like a typical Gray than he did here, due to the effect that a human's perception has on the actual image itself. The most extraordinary aspect of this body of material is that Seth dictated a number of full-length books from 1971 to the mid-1980’s, entirely through the repeated sessions with Jane Roberts and her husband Robert Butts. Even if Jane left the Seth work for months at a time and never read the transcripts of any of the sessions, Seth would pick up right where he left off as soon as she went back into trance. There may not be a single other contact yet that has generated entire books, with themes that build up from chapter to chapter, through psychic readings in such a reliable and consistent fashion. Seth identifies himself to us as a male entity, and the material does not have the rigid scientific and linguistic structure of the Law of One / Ra Material. Being a full level of density lower than Ra, Seth has much more creative license to use an entertaining dry wit in his writing. The Seth books are practically unparalleled, in terms of the strength and accuracy of a fifth- dimensional contact. Again, contacts such as the Cayce Readings and the Ra Material do originate from even higher levels such as 6,7 and even the Akasha, or the Octave, but the Seth Material is definitely in a league by itself with its crystal-clear contact to the fifth density. Furthermore, as you study the Law of One series from Ra and learn the characteristics of fifth-density entities, you can clearly see where Seth's shortcomings lie. According to Ra, the fifth-density is focused on wisdom, and the graduation to sixth-density does not come until pure compassion is fused back together with that wisdom."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Ra constantly speaks reverently of the Law of One and the importance of compassion, whereas it is clear to see that Seth is very deeply involved with explaining as much of the universal wisdom as he possibly can. In our opinion, the “thirst for God” doesn't seem to be present in the Seth Material to anywhere near the degree that it is in the Law of One series, and this certainly could relate to Roberts’ natural personality, which was essentially non- religious and skeptical, as opposed to Carla’s natural personality, which is very religious and spiritually-driven. Because the wisdom of Seth is so vitally essential to understanding our propositions, we will take a look at two extended sessions that will help us understand everything we have gone into so far. As we read these sessions, it is very important to realize that on the conscious level, Jane Roberts was by no means schooled enough in science to have been able to construct such a model of physics on her own, as was the case with Carla Rueckert. The first session that we will investigate is described in The Seth Material as being the “first time Seth really ‘came through’ as a definite other personality, laughing and joking.” (Pg. 38.) Seth used this particular session as a form of encouragement for Jane and Robert to continue working with him, as Jane had become disillusioned with the strangeness of what was happening to her and wanted to try to shut it down. The contact had originally started through a series of Ouija-board sessions, but as time went on Jane became more and more aware that whole words and sentences were coming into her mind very clearly before the pointer ever spelled them out. In the beginning, she was so disconcerted with what was happening to her that she would pace the room, one hand on her forehead and eyes wide open, as she spoke for Seth. Since this was taking a great toll on Jane's sense of normalcy, she really wanted to quit, but on this day, “The session so aroused our intellectual and intuitional curiosity that all thoughts of discontinuing went out the window.” (Pg. 38.) Remember now that Seth is describing how these individual spheres of consciousness are all interconnected into a unified web, fitting together to form universes. Let us also remind the reader that Seth’s readings on this subject will take on profound implications when we compare them with the most recent discoveries of modern physics. As we will see in future chapters, Seth clearly was tapping into the truth of “how things work” before the physicists began to understand it. So now, relax and enjoy yourself as we journey through these mind-bending readings. The italics are our own. Consider a network of wires, a maze of interlocking wires endlessly constructed so that looking through them there would seem to be no beginning or end. Your plane [or density or dimension] could be likened to a small position between four very spindly wires, and my plane could be likened to the small position in the neighboring wires on the other side. Not only are we on different sides of the same wires, but we are at the same time above or below, according to your viewpoint. And if you consider the wires as forming cubes - this is for you, Joseph*, with your love of images - then the cubes could also fit one within the other, without disturbing the inhabitants of either cube one iota. And these cubes are themselves within cubes, and I am speaking now only of the small particle of space taken up by your plane and mine."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"[Seth's reference to \"cubes\" would be accurate for his own dimension, but in ours it would obviously be the octahedron. So, he is clearly simplifying the material in order to make his point. *Seth referred to Robert as \"Joseph,\" as apparently where Seth resided, this was Robert's \"true name.\" Similarly, Jane was assigned a masculine \"true self\" name of Ruburt, as we shall see a few paragraphs below.] Again think in terms of your plane, bounded by its small spindly set of wires, and my plane on the other side. These, as I have said, have boundless solidarity and depth, yet to one side, the other is transparent. You cannot see through, but the two planes move through each other constantly. I hope you see what I have done here. I have initiated the idea of motion, for true transparency is not the ability to see through, but to move through. This is what I mean by fifth dimension. Now, remove the structure of the wires and cubes. Things behave as if the wires and cubes existed, but these were only constructions necessary even to those on my plane... We construct images consistent with the senses we happen to have. We merely construct imaginary lines to walk on. [Indeed, in coming chapters we will see this same point made through the work of Bruce Cathie, where he discovered that the fifth-density cube shape was a Global Grid system that was being used for navigation by a wide variety of UFOs that were sighted. Furthermore, Seth's comments reveal to us that these geometries are not 'real' as we would normally think - they are simply a different way of expressing a harmonic frequency of vibrating energy. The only thing that is truly 'real' is that One Energy itself, as the lines simply represent stress points in that energy, where it is more concentrated.] So real are the wall constructions of your room that you would freeze in winter without them, yet [in the truest universal sense] there is no room and there are no walls. So, in a like manner, the wires that we constructed are real, though there are no wires. The walls of your room are transparent to me, though I am not sure I would perform, dear Joseph and Ruburt, for a party demonstration. Nevertheless, those walls are transparent. So are the wires, but for practical purposes we must behave as if both were there. . . . Again if you will consider our maze of wires, I will ask you to imagine them filling up everything that is, with your plane and my plane like two small bird’s nests in the nestlike fabric of some gigantic tree. Consider that these wires are mobile, constantly trembling, and also alive, in that they not only carry the stuff of the universe but are themselves projections of it, and you will see how difficult this is to explain. Nor can I blame you for growing tired, when after asking you to imagine this strange structure, I then insist that you tear it apart, for it is no more to be actually seen or touched than is the buzzing of a million invisible bees. Once again we are finding consistency in the extraterrestrial reports regarding this complex harmonic energy structure in the Universe. So, as Seth appears almost indistinguishable from the classic image of the Grays, it is not hard to infer that Seth is giving us a precise description of how some of our visitors"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"perform their interdimensional travel. Essentially, Seth is telling us that they are using these energetic harmonic structures for navigation, and that they are both formed from and carriers of intelligent energy at the same time. Seth makes it quite clear that the shape he is working with here is the cube, which corresponds perfectly to his being a fifth-density being, in light of the Vedic model of geometry. Obviously, the other shapes are not mentioned, but as Jane says before the quotation, “We had no idea that it was actually a highly simplified explanation, cleverly geared to our own level of understanding at the time. It made a tremendous impression on us nonetheless.” SUPERSTRING THEORY Further enhancing the validity of this contact, Seth’s 1969 essay gives a precise description of the “Superstring Theory” of modern physics, which did not fully come about until the mid-1980’s. Dr. Michio Kaku’s book Hyperspace is the simplest and most well known resource for introducing us to this complicated new theory. Early along in the book, Kaku mentions that Superstring Theory first came about from physicists who grappled with a large and fundamental problem in physics, which we have already touched upon briefly. That fundamental problem was the fact that a “photon” of light can be clearly shown to possess the properties of a wave, even when our contemporary models would not provide any background energy in the Universe that such waves could travel through. (We remind the reader that Zero-Point Energy and \"aether\" theories have filled this gap, and are becoming more and more widely accepted.) Explaining this point in greater detail, Dr. Kaku says, But if light were a wave, then it would require something to be ‘waving.’ Sound waves require air, water waves require water, but since there is nothing to wave in a vacuum (though light still travels through it with ease,) we have a paradox. How can light be a wave if there is nothing to wave? Again, the premise of our model is that the “waves” themselves are traveling through this fantastic concentration of “background” aether energy that exists throughout the Universe. As we continue in Hyperspace, Kaku then describes the shock he encountered when discovering Kaluza-Klein theory, which directly paved the way for an understanding of what was going on: Since the theory was considered to be a wild speculation, it was never taught in graduate school; so young physicists are left to discover it quite by accident in their casual readings. This alternative theory gave the simplest explanation of light; that it was really a vibration of the fifth dimension, or what used to be called the fourth dimension by the mystics. If light could travel through a vacuum, it was because the vacuum itself was vibrating, because the “vacuum” really existed in four dimensions of space and one of time. By adding the fifth dimension, the force of gravity and light could be unified in a startlingly simple way... So, it is clear that the Kaluza-Klein theory required there to be some form of background energy source in the “vacuum.” Kaku briefly describes how the Superstring model helped iron out the conceptual problems that the Kaluza- Klein theory introduced, and after this explanation he continues (italics added:)"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Many of the world’s leading physicists now believe that dimensions beyond the usual four of space and time might exist... Indeed, many theoretical physicists now believe that higher dimensions may be the decisive step in creating a comprehensive theory that unites the laws of nature; a theory of hyperspace. If it proves to be correct, then future historians of science may well record that one of the great conceptual revolutions in twentieth-century science was the realization that hyperspace may be the key to unlock the deepest secrets of nature and Creation itself... (pg. 9.) The extraterrestrial information strongly favors the idea that these ‘strings’ are in fact waves of frequency that travel through the ‘aether,’ which Russian scientists call “torsion fields.” This is slightly different from Superstring Theory, as Kaku and others would visualize the universe actually built up solely from these strings. The ancient Atlantean / Ra model sees the “strings” as simply being waves in an aetheric medium. Later in the book, Dr. Kaku explains this theory further, pointing out how much it helps to explain: String theory answers a series of puzzling questions about particles, such as why there are so many of them in nature. The deeper we probe into the nature of subatomic particles, the more particles we find. The current “zoo” of subatomic particles numbers several hundred and their properties fill entire volumes.... String theory answers this question because the string, about 100 billion billion times smaller than a proton, is vibrating; each mode of vibration represents a distinct resonance or particle. The string is so incredibly tiny that, from a distance, a resonance of a string and a particle are indistinguishable. Only when we somehow magnify the particle can we see that it is not a point at all, but a mode of a vibrating string. In this picture, each subatomic particle corresponds to a distinct resonance that vibrates only at a distinct frequency. Essentially, in this above passage, we can clearly see that when Seth says, “Consider that these wires are mobile, constantly trembling, and also alive,” he was giving an even more complete hyperdimensional model that was about fifteen years ahead of this cutting-edge modern physics theory, which Kaku describes as “21st century physics dropped into the hands of the 20th century.” Plus, Seth was speaking through Jane Roberts, who was by no means a physicist and obviously had not the slightest clue that the obscure foundation of Kaluza-Klein theory ever existed. Although the foundations of Superstring Theory certainly aid tremendously in legitimizing the Octave model of energy densities or dimensions, we still have a problem, in that Kaku’s book clearly states that the physicists have mathematically “proven” that there have to be at least 10, and possibly 26 dimensions in the universe. Ra and other sources insist that all of the dimensions are unified as an Octave of eight densities of vibrating “intelligent energy,” and therefore the 10-dimensional model is just a bit too high. But before we dismiss Ra's words as disproven, we must look carefully, as this number shows up in quite directly Kaku’s book as well. Thus, in the next chapter we will uncover the impossible -- a direct connection between the physics work of Dr. Kaku and our metaphysical idea of the dimensions being structured in an octave form. Many, many psychic sources including Cayce, Ra and Scallion are unanimous in stating this, including"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Wilcock’s own, before he was even aware of what exactly he was being told. What should impress us even more will be that Srinivasa Ramanujan, the mathematician whose equations set the entire model for modern “string theory,” was apparently using quite similar mystical techniques to those of Seth, Ra and others to gain his findings. Even though such techniques might seem to be completely scientifically unacceptable, no one in mainstream science can deny the outstanding importance of Ramanujan’s mathematical concepts. Although his findings were embraced, no further research was done to determine how he came about receiving them in his trance states. Therefore, we will refer to Ramanujan, this enigmatic figure, as the “Edgar Cayce of Physics.”"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 05: SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS FOR AN OCTAVE OF DIMENSIONS CHAPTER 05: SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS FOR AN “OCTAVE” OF DIMENSIONS In Hyperspace, Dr. Kaku describes the life of an enterprising young mathematician from India known as Srinivasa Ramanujan. The equations that Ramanujan came up with are still considered to be the most important parts of creating a model for the higher dimensions, including how many dimensions there must be. If the Octave model of Ra and the ancient mystery schools is indeed accurate, then the best mathematical proof we could ever hope to find would be if Ramanujan’s equations also added up to there being eight dimensions – and this is exactly what we find. Remember, now, that Ramanujan is from India, and this is the country where all the Vedic texts were written, as it was the original host to the Rama Empire. Let us also remember that the ancient texts have already given us a solution for the puzzle of how we can integrate five Platonic Solids and the sphere into an Octave of eight geometries. The mystery only deepens when we learn how Ramanujan got his information: as Kaku writes, “Ramanujan used to say that the goddess of Namakkal inspired him with the formulae in dreams.” In Hyperspace, Dr. Kaku states the following about this exceptional man. It is not important for us to understand every term that Kaku uses, just the overall message that he is giving us about what Ramanujan discovered: Srinivasa Ramanujan was the strangest man in all of mathematics, probably in the entire history of science. He has been compared to a bursting supernova, illuminating the darkest, most profound corners of mathematics, before being tragically struck down by tuberculosis at the age of 33, like Riemann before him. Working in total isolation from the main currents of his field, he was able to rederive 100 years’ worth of Western mathematics on his own. The tragedy of his life is that much of his work was wasted rediscovering known mathematics. Scattered throughout the obscure equations in his notebooks are these modular functions, which are among the strangest ever found... In the work of Ramanujan, [i.e. the modular functions,] the number 24 (8 x 3) appears repeatedly. This is an example of what mathematicians call magic numbers, which continually appear where we least expect them, for reasons that no one understands. Miraculously, Ramanujan’s function also appears in string theory... In string theory, each of the 24 modes in the Ramanujan function corresponds to a physical vibration of the string... When the Ramanujan function is generalized, the number 24 is replaced by the number 8. Thus, the critical number for the superstring is 8 + 2, or 10. This is the origin of the tenth dimension. The string vibrates in ten dimensions because it requires these generalized Ramanujan functions (based on the number 8) in order to remain self-consistent. In other words, physicists have not the slightest understanding of why ten and 26 dimensions are singled out as the dimension of the string. [Now read the next sentence carefully, and remember that this is being spoken by a highly regarded mainstream scientific authority figure:]"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"It’s as though there is some kind of deep numerology being manifested in these functions that no one understands... In the final analysis, the origin of the ten-dimensional theory is as mysterious as Ramanujan himself. When asked by audiences why nature might exist in ten dimensions, physicists are forced to answer, “We don’t know.” [emphasis added] As we progress, we will explain why modern physicists have added two more dimensions to Ramanujan’s elegant eight-dimensional model. But for now we will continue exploring this front-runner of future science. After years of seclusion, Ramanujan was finally able to get some attention in the Western world regarding his abilities. This came about through a letter that Ramanujan wrote, which found its way to “the brilliant Cambridge mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy.” ...The letter from the poor Madras clerk contained theorems that were totally unknown to Western mathematicians. In all, it contained 120 theorems. Hardy was stunned. He recalled that proving some of these theorems ‘defeated me completely.’ He recalled, “I had never seen anything in the least like them before. A single look at them is enough to show that they could only be written down by a mathematician of the highest class. [Interestingly, the number 120 is very fundamental to harmonic theory, as it represents a musical frequency or vibration. It is very possible that all 120 are important for a unified model, such was the way that Ramanujan’s mind worked. Since the aether’s behavior is entirely based on vibration, it is not surprising to see that Ramanujan had 120 theorems in his letter – as this number has many, many divisors, and thus there is a great deal of ‘vibration’ within the number – which we will explain in later chapters.] Kaku then describes how the Cambridge mathematician Hardy and Ramanujan began working together, and then says, Unfortunately, neither Hardy nor Ramanujan seemed interested in the psychology or thinking process by which Ramanujan discovered these incredible theorems, especially when this flood of material came pouring out of his “dreams” with such frequency. Hardy noted, “It seemed ridiculous to worry him about how he had found this or that known theorem, when he was showing me half a dozen new ones almost every day.\" [emphasis added] Kaku then describes a scene that took place between Hardy and Ramanujan, which to the metaphysical reader seems to be a classic case of psychic power. Hardy vividly recalled, “I remember going to see him once when he was lying ill in Putney. I had ridden in taxi - cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and that I hoped that it was not an unfavorable omen. “No,” he replied, “it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways.” (It is the sum of 1x1x1 and 12x12x12, and also the sum of 9x9x9 and 10x10x10.) On the spot, he could recite complex theorems in arithmetic that would require a modern computer to prove."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"[It is quite interesting to note here that 9 and 12 are the fundamental numbers that we will keep working with in the frequency cycles of our harmonic Universe.] INTUITIVE BURNOUT In the next paragraph, we receive information about Ramanujan's health. At first, our inclusion of this information may seem tangential and unrelated to the point, but actually it is not. It seems that for a person to work with these higher psychic energies, they need to be extremely well grounded. The work can take a tremendous toll on their lives, even leading to death. Always in poor health, the austerity of the war-torn British economy prevented Ramanujan from maintaining his strict vegetarian diet, and he was constantly in and out of sanitariums. After collaborating with Hardy for 3 years, Ramanujan fell ill and never recovered. World War I interrupted travel between England and India, and in 1919 he finally managed to return home, where he died a year later. (Pg. 176.) The story of the death of Ramanujan does closely parallel the story of many psychics. It is quite common in abduction literature, Eastern mystical arts and psychic circles for vegetarian diets to be a necessary component to achieving contact with higher dimensions. The author’s own Higher Self insists upon this, and in the case of the “awakening” of well-known psychic Gordon Michael Scallion, he suddenly found that could not eat the foods outside of the diet without getting violently, physically ill. The extraterrestrials working with Whitley Strieber told him in the book Transformation that he would physically die if he didn’t follow the diet that he was given, which centered around the need to give up refined sugar. In fact, in We, The Arcturians, a series of channeled works by Dr. Norma Milanovich that closely parallels the material in the Seth and Ra books, we find this same information: The physical bodies need to be tuned occasionally and we find this is the weakest of all three areas. In humans this is sometimes the most abused body also. We see that your ingestion process includes many items that do not quicken the vibration, but instead actually retard it. Such items are those of your animal life forms, sugars, and white flours. These are not harmful to the body, as such. They are only harmful to the vibrational increase. When you do not know that you need fuel for the increased frequency, then the foods you consume do not bother you. When you are on an accelerated path, the foods that you consume can either make or break your energy patterns. In fact, there are presently many Beings on your planet that can tolerate only the consumption of the highest forms of energy. [Incidentally, Dr. Milanovich’s sources repeatedly refer to an octave of dimensions, as do Scallion’s. The “Arcturians” also model the Universe on what they call “liquid light.”] So in essence, bad diet and intuitive burnout killed Ramanujan. This closely parallels the story of Edgar Cayce, the well known American psychic. Cayce performed in-depth psychic readings for many people, which had an"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"unparalleled accuracy, giving him the oft-quoted status as “America’s Greatest Psychic.” Once in trance, Cayce could medically diagnose people at a distance whom he had never met, and prescribe accurate herbal treatments that neither he nor anyone else had previously heard of. The more popular that Cayce became, the more readings he did, and his health quickly deteriorated as a result. His sources also laid out a complex dietary set of guidelines, and Cayce continually flaunted them, refusing to stop smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee and eating the pork chops that he loved. Though his sources urged him to curtail his work, which eventually reached up to eight deep-unconscious- trance readings a day, he never did, and he died of burnout as a result. The same basic effects took their toll upon Jane Roberts, as she was unable to stop drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and passed away before her time. The out-of-body traveler Robert Monroe also seemed to become overly disconnected from his physical body, according to some we have spoken with who met him in person before his death. The Ra contact almost destroyed Carla Rueckert’s health completely, and it took her years to recover. Lastly, the story of Paul Solomon, another deep trance psychic in the Cayce tradition, is curiously similar as well. In the Law of One series, Ra explains this problem by saying that the more that the spiritual body of a human being travels into the higher realms, the more its level of aetheric vibration increases. If the physical body is not also kept \"up to speed\" with rigorous dietetic and exercise practices, then the normal connection between the body and Spirit becomes increasingly strained. Ultimately, if not taken care of, this leads to the premature death of the physical body. As Carla, the channel for Ra, has stated in private interviews with Wilcock, “To truly do this work, it takes a life.” He agreed, as his own contacts are extremely strict about diet, exercise and health in general, and all of his waking and sleeping hours are dedicated to his purpose -- no time is “wasted,” and even recreational activities must be carefully planned out and scheduled. No television or other mind-altering substances are to be found in his ‘physical intake’ of the world. With regards to the energy transition that is occurring on the planet in general at this time, it is wise for everyone to make a stronger effort to obey the principles of a healthy diet. However, it doesn't become truly life-threatening unless a person is deeply involved with trance work in some form or another, and even then it is really not that difficult to teach oneself to stop craving certain unhealthy foods and to stretch and take regular walks. THE OCTAVE-BASED REVELATIONS OF RAMANUJAN And so, it is easy to see that such apparent miracles as Ramanujan's calculations of the harmonics behind the taxicab number 1729 were not being done solely in his thinking mind, but were actually coming through a trance state. In this state, he had access to a realm of pure information and knowledge, which would then provide the answers that he desired. It also took the same toll on him as it has for other pioneers who have not yet enjoyed mainstream acceptance. If there were no proof to believe that Ramanujan could get data like this, then a skeptic could just brush it off as coincidence. However, the author has completely, redundantly proven to himself and to others that psychic"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"techniques such as those used by Ra and Seth are able to access information, such as future prophecies and scientific data, in ways that can later be proven to be valid. Ramanujan is really a front-runner, in the sense that he used these abilities to make scientific advances. It is obvious that such techniques will become much more common as public awareness continues to expand. Again, we now return to the problem that we have in harmonizing our theory with the physicists, in that they have apparently deemed it necessary to add two more dimensions, for a total of ten. Digging into footnote number 13 on page 346 at the back of Hyperspace, Kaku says that the two additional dimensions are added in order to “preserve the symmetry of the string.” He then says, However, two of these vibratory modes can be removed when we break the symmetry of the string, leaving us with 24 vibratory modes, which are the ones that appear in the Ramanujan function. If you haven’t been paying close attention to this discussion so far, please read this paragraph carefully: What Kaku is telling us is that two extra dimensions were added to Ramanujan’s equations because the physicists feel that the strings could only vibrate if they are symmetrical. This is something that was “added on” to Ramanujan’s data after-the-fact. So, given the nature of Ramanujan’s extreme mathematical genius, coupled with an extremely legitimate psychic contact, they obviously did not feel that such “symmetry” was needed, or else these numbers would have been included in the work. Our latest research on this topic suggests two different reasons for why this “added symmetry” may be a mistake: One, the missing symmetry is probably explained by the 'zero-point energy' that actually exists between the so-called ‘strings,’ which are actually nothing more than waves within this unified energy; and Two, the Superstring physicists were not aware of the basic geometries that are formed when the aether vibrates. No extra dimensions are needed; they simply come into being by the “magic” of vibration. DR. TONY SMITH: AN OCTAVE OF DIMENSIONS, BUILT ON PLATONIC SOLIDS More recent physics from Tony Smith, freely available on the Internet for those who can understand them, (as they are extremely complicated, draw extensively on the reader’s foreknowledge of advanced scientific jargon and are therefore almost completely unintelligible to the non-technical reader,) do indeed reveal an elegant, Octave-based “eight-dimensional spacetime” model, which depends entirely on “Platonic Solid” geometries. Here we will cover the extreme basics of this model, which Smith and other specialists refer to as S3#, a rather dull-sounding and “Godless” name. It is interesting to note that Smith is open-minded enough to incorporate non-traditional sources of information into his investigations, such as material from the ancient Mayan Calendar and the channeling work of Krsanna Duran, who claims to be in touch with beings from a planetary system around the star Sirius. So, we begin with Smith telling us what the geometry of this Octave model of “dimensions” actually looks like: WHAT DOES S3# LOOK LIKE? Here are some images from the WWW pages of Richard Hawkins, [www.newciv.org/Synergetic_Geometry], who calls S3# the Mayan Time Star. His pages contain many more images and movies that help you understand how S3# looks, and also how a lot of other things look."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"What we can see here is that Smith feels that the geometry of this Octave model can be found in the work of Richard Hawkins, through what he calls the “Mayan Time Star.” So, let’s next visit some of Richard Hawkins’ website for context. GEOMETRY IN TIME: THE ‘MAYAN TIME STAR’ FORMATION In this next excerpt, Hawkins discusses this Mayan Time Star model directly, showing his belief that there can be energetic structures in time that correspond to the Platonic geometries. We will learn more about this as we proceed into the later chapters of this first volume: The TimeStar of the Maya is 5 interpenetrating tetrahedra whose vertices [tips] lie on the 20 faces of an icosahedron. [See Figure 5.1.] According to Jose Arguelles, time is symbolized by a tetrahedron. [Note: We can actually back this statement up with the work of WD Gann and Bradley Cowan, as we will see later in this volume.] The 260-day sacred calendar of the Maya, which consisted of five 52-day cycles, is symbolized by five tetrahedra. Five tetrahedra have a total of 20 points [as each tetrahedron has four corners – three at the base and one at the top.] One of the basic numbers of the Mayan calendar is 20. The Earth's internal geometry and the solar-lunar cycles were represented by the 20 points of the TimeStar (five interpenetrated tetrahedra) and in the sacred cycle of the Maya. Compare Plato's most complex solid, the icosahedron, which is comprised of 20 faces centered on the points of the five interpenetrated tetrahedra. [emphasis added] It is important to realize that what we are seeing here is that you can take five tetrahedrons and stick them together in such a way that when you play connect-the-dots between their points, you will naturally form the icosahedron, and / or the dodecahedron, as the two are closely related. (See Figure 5.1 below.) This is another surprising way in which we see the symmetry between the different shapes. Even more interesting is the fact that these five tetrahedrons, when combined, give us all the needed coordinates to build any of the five Platonic Solids directly. And even more interesting yet is that this idea first came from Krsanna Duran, who claimed to have channeled it, and it subsequently triggered the interest of physicist Gerald de Jong, who then modeled her ideas on a computer and discovered that she was right. Again, it is very unlikely that Duran could have figured this out on her own, or would have had any motive or desire to do so – it took one of the few specialists in the world who actually understands higher-dimensional geometry to verify and model what her source had said. We will read more about this in the next excerpt below – and first we will give some background to explain this curious concept. Space and time are unified in our model, which can be confusing at first. When we think of time, we can think of certain events that are created as we move through layers of aetheric energy density. One of our premises is that the planets are held in place by spheres of aetheric energy at a certain"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"density level. Since we have multiple planets in the Solar System, we also have “spheres within spheres” holding them in place – spheres which are nested inside of each other like the layers of an onion or the Russian “nested dolls” toy called the Mastrioshka. There will always be a series of ‘nested spheres’ no matter where we look at these energy fields, including the human aura. As documented in the first Edgar Cayce book “There is a River,” the Edgar Cayce Readings once said that Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune now correspond to the eight dimensions or densities – we know that Pluto isn’t in fact a “full” planet but rather a “planetesimal” due to its tiny size. So, in Ra’s model, each planet travels along the edge of a spherical energy field, which holds the planet in place. Rotating energy fields continually emanating from the Sun, which look like ever-expanding flower petals, are what drive the planets along. The current models of why and how the planets revolve around the Sun are vastly inadequate, as the Sun contains fully 99.86 percent of the entire mass of the Solar System – so if we were only dealing with Newtonian gravity, the planets should have crashed into the Sun a long, long time ago, since it is much more massive than they are. Remember that we are discussing invisible energy structures, but they can indeed be detected with the proper instruments – and they often do have subtle magnetic energy signatures. The “flower petals” we are referring to are seen in what NASA has named the Parker Spiral, for example. So then you ask, “OK, so if each planet is supposedly orbiting around a sphere, then why are the orbits not perfect circles, but rather stretched out into ellipses?” Good question! The planetary orbits become elliptical as these spheres are slightly flattened as the Solar System moves through the “local interstellar medium” or LISM of our Galaxy. So, the spheres that hold the planets in place must also have a certain underlying geometry in them, caused by vibration of the aether. Then, as our Earth orbits the Sun, we pass through various geometric structures created by these different ‘nested’ spheres. As the Earth gets closer to a line or a node of any of these geometries, the intensity of aetheric energy that we will feel on Earth increases – and this has a direct effect on consciousness. If you think that this has something to do with astrology, you’re right... but that data will come later. It is also important to remember that Ra tells us that the Sun has all of the eight densities within itself. This gives us a strong clue that there must be at least eight levels of density inside of the Sun, which would be layered inside of each other like an onion. Of course, each of these density layers would also have its own geometric structure. And when we remember that each density has seven sub-densities, and so on, we can see that the Sun would need to have a deeply multi-layered structure inside of it for this model to “work.” This is exactly what Dr. Oliver Crane suggests in his breakthrough paper, Central Oscillator and the Space-Time Quanta Medium, which we will discuss in Volume III. We apologize in advance for the complexity of the next two paragraphs as we attempt to explain the mystery of the Mayan Time Star. We can now consider this very intriguing possibility that all of the Mayan Calendar cycles may actually be clocking out the movement of geometric structures of energy. (We will be covering the Mayan Calendar in far more detail in the second half of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"this volume.) Our own intuitive / rational research on this suggests that this geometric structure of five interpenetrating tetrahedra actually exists at one spherical level of density inside the Sun. So, we do know that the Sun rotates exactly 26 days along its equator. Ten of these cycles add up to 260 days. It appears that one of the spheres inside the sun is rotating exactly ten times slower, for a total cycle of 260 days. (The “powers of ten” are very important in the behavior of harmonic numbers, as we will see as we go along.) So, if there is a sphere of energy inside the Sun that rotates once in 260 days, then the Mayan Time Star geometry that Duran discovered may be the vibratory pattern that exists inside of it. The five tetrahedrons could be seen to divide up the sphere into five equidistant “zones” across the surface of the sphere. Each of these zones would then take 52 days to rotate past a fixed point on the Sun’s surface, as the entire sphere rotates in 260 days. So, as the Mayan Time Star structure rotates, it changes in its orientation to the other geometric structures nested in the Sun. (Some of the other geometries are easy to detect, such as the octahedron, as we shall see in volumes II and III.) As the different geometries attract and repel each other, the Sun’s overall energy output is affected, especially in the sense of the torsion fields or “waves in the aether” that are being released. We could visualize this by having a bright light, and then passing different brightly colored sheets of clear plastic in front of the light, going in opposite directions. If a red sheet passes in front of a blue sheet, then they will combine and we will see a purple light. The different geometries can blend together in a loosely similar fashion, creating new effects – and this is one reason why you can tell so much about a person from their astrology. The Mayans wanted to be aware of, and graph out, these changes in the Sun’s aetheric output, as certain times that were more energetically charged were very useful for consciousness- raising ceremonies, especially within their pyramid structures. Ra tells us that high-level sixth-density beings gave the Maya the information that allowed them to construct this Calendar. We do want to point out that there is still room here for other pioneers to come after us and finish up the details on how these geometric systems are actually operating, but we will have further suggestions on what is occurring in later chapters on the Mayan Calendar. Now we return to Tony Smith's article, which features an image of this Mayan Time Star formation of five inter-penetrating tetrahedrons. Unfortunately, this image doesn’t appear as well in black-and-white print as it does in color. What follows is Smith’s attempt to geometrically explain how you could have a “particle” that requires two complete rotations, or “spin 2,” in order to return to its original position: How did Richard Hawkins find out about the Time Star? Krsanna Duran says: \"... I wrote an article about what the Sirians told me about five interpenetrated tetrahedra embodying and unifying all prime geometries [i.e. the Platonic Solids,] which was published in January, 1995. Richard Hawkins read the article and sent an email to Gerald de Jong about it. Gerald de Jong constructed a computer model of the five interpenetrated tetrahedra to discover that it did all the things I said it did with extraordinary elegance...\""},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Time Star is one of my favorite Archetypes. Start with a dodecahedron. Five tetrahedra fit inside the dodecahedron: Figure 5.1 – The “Mayan Time Star” of five tetrahedra inside the dodecahedron. (Smith) The alternating permutation group of the 5 tetrahedra is the 60-element icosahedral group. This last sentence is simply a very fancy way of saying that the five tetrahedrons fit inside an icosahedron, which has 20 faces with three lines per face, or a total of 60 “elements” if you don’t count the lines as ever being shared between two faces. From here, Smith goes through a complex model that we presented in earlier versions of this book, but we now feel that it is unnecessary as Johnson’s physics is a more complete model. For now we will keep things simple. The key point that we should take out of this is that there are indeed mainstream physicists who are making findings that are in complete agreement with the model that is seen in the words of Seth and Ra, as well as the ancient Atlantean and Raman systems. Therefore, no skeptic can easily dismiss the idea that Platonic geometry is important in understanding the Universe, since some of the best thinkers are working on these very problems. Furthermore, Smith’s model does not have the burden of the “two extra dimensions added for symmetry” that is in the Superstring model – the symmetry arises from the Platonic Solids themselves. At the time of this writing, the link to the page we have quoted from is as follows: http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/PDS3.html In our next chapter, we will take a very close look at the underlying spherical units that make up the dimensions.

As these are conscious energy units, they have a mind of their own and are quite fascinating. With this reading, we will provide a solid backbone for many other discussions that could splinter off of the main topic, which other writers may choose to pursue. The point behind all of this is as follows: as these units are the fundamental structure of all creation in all dimensions, we can expect them to have quite extraordinary properties. This reading from Seth also can be used to neatly tie together the theory of a Holographic Universe, and explain why things like psychic phenomena might work."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 06: THE SETH ENTITY AND CONSCIOUSNESS UNITS This chapter is a direct excerpt from the end portions of \"The Seth Material,\" the original debut of Jane Roberts' channeling efforts in 1971. What we find is an in-depth study of the Consciousness Unit. The metaphysical properties of the CU are explained by Seth in careful detail. The result is a guided tour through a set of metaphysical ideas that most people have never considered before. We then explore how archetypes and CUs are related. CHAPTER 06: THE SETH ENTITY AND “CONSCIOUSNESS UNITS” In the previous chapter, we discussed how “Superstring Theory” and the physics of Tony Smith both match up with the idea of an Octave of dimensions, with the Platonic Solids underlying them. [In Volume II we will show that Ramanujan’s own functions have been directly associated with Platonic Solids in very advanced mathematics work that only emerged in the 1990s, completely separate from what Smith is discussing.] Let us again remember Dr. Michio Kaku’s quote: “It’s as though there is some kind of deep numerology being manifested in these [dimensional] functions that no one understands.” The numerology Kaku was speaking of is the widespread occurrence of the number 8 in Ramanujan’s physics equations, which are used to map out higher dimensions. In hindsight, it appears that this numerology is, in fact, sitting right in front of Kaku’s face, as he mentions “the vibrations of a string.” In other words, a vibrating guitar string can make notes all throughout the spectrum of an octave, but it can never go outside of an octave framework; if the vibratory pitch was moved higher, such as by reaching double its original value in cycles per second, then the pitch would simply enter into a higher octave, but essentially sound the same. Similarly, the vibrations of the densities must conform themselves to this same octave system that is indicated by Ramanujan’s function, since they are composed of a fluidlike energy source. In the previous chapter, we indicated that Ramanujan’s function is based on 24, or three times eight. Kaku then explained that the harmonic of three sets of eight could be compressed down into one set of eight, which would then represent a single octave. Having established that, we come up again to the geometric shapes themselves. These shapes, as previous chapters have indicated, are a series of “perfect” geometric solids that all fit within the sphere, and have a growth sequence that fits into the octave pattern, according to the Vedic model of Purusha and Prakriti. Seth has already told us that the universe rises out of “cubes within cubes” in a universe made up of “a myriad of interconnecting wires, constantly trembling.” As stated, this is literally identical to superstring theory, which also discusses cubes within cubes as “hypercubes,” and builds the universe on a matrix of interconnecting strings that vibrate. Tony Smith's model of “S3#” shows us that our top thinkers are already working the Platonic solids into their mathematical models for these higher realms. For the rest of this chapter, we will present the words of Seth from the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"appendix section of “The Seth Material,” which help us to understand how the basic spherical units of energy in the Cosmos interact with each other. It took us several years to actually match up all of this information with scientific data, but now as we conclude the three volumes of the series, we have found some degree of proof for almost every point that Seth had made back in 1969. This original text was invaluable in helping us to understand what was going on, as it provided crucial data that was missing in Ra’s own Law of One series. In order to avoid repeating the phrase “[emphasis added],” the reader should be advised that almost all italicized or bolded portions of text were added by this author after-the-fact, in order to help enhance comprehension. When we write “Note:” followed by text in parentheses, these are our comments added in. ________________________________________________________________ _______ Now: there are electromagnetic structures, so to speak, that are presently beyond your (scientific) instruments, units that are the basic carriers of perception. They have a very brief “life” in your terms. Their size varies. Several units may combine, for example; many units may combine. To put this as simply as possible, it is not so much that they move through space, as that they use space to move through. There is a difference. [Note: This may seem complicated at first, but once we see that what Seth calls “space” is in fact the aetheric energy, it makes sense. Since the units are made of aetheric energy, they must use aetheric energy to travel. They are not self-contained “particles” that move through an empty vacuum.] In a manner of speaking, thermal qualities are involved, and also laws of attraction and repulsion. The units charge the air through which they pass, and draw to them other units. The units are not stationary in the way that, say, a cell is stationary within the body. Even a cell only appears stationary. These units have no “home.” They are built up in response to emotional intensity. They are one form that emotional energy takes. They follow their own rules of attraction and repulsion. As a magnet, you see, will attract with its filaments, so these units attract their own kind and form patterns, which then appear to you as perception. [Note: This is easy to miss. Seth is saying that everything we perceive is some form of pattern built up from consciousness units. Since they do form all of physical matter, this is a very accurate statement indeed.] Now: the fetus utilizes these units. [Note: Seth had been discussing the fetus earlier in the discussion.] So does any consciousness, including that of a plant. Cells are not just responsive to light because this is the order of things, but because an emotional desire to perceive light is present. [Note: This idea of an “emotional desire to perceive light” conforms with cutting-edge research cited by Gregg Braden in his various books, available from Laura Lee Publications. The work of Garaiev and Poponin entitled the “DNA Phantom Effect” has found that a DNA molecule can be inserted in a cylinder with light passing through it, and the DNA will actually attract the light"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"and cause it to spiral along with it! Furthermore, when the DNA is removed, the light continues to spiral as if the DNA were still there. (We will have a lot more to say about this in Volume III, as it relates to evolution and how the torsion wave forms the DNA molecule.) This is obviously a very strange finding, but we can see that Seth helps us to understand it; the DNA has an “emotional desire to perceive light,” as it naturally attracts light into itself. This might not seem possible until we realize that all life and matter has some degree of consciousness, since it is made of “intelligent energy.”] The desire appears on this other level in the form of these electromagnetic units, which then cause a light sensitivity. These units are freewheeling. They can be used in normal perception or what you call extrasensory perception. I will discuss their basic nature at a later session, and I would like to tie this in with the fetus, since the fetus is highly involved with perceptive mechanisms. (\"Next session will be fine.\") It is not that you cannot devise instruments to perceive these units. Your scientists are simply asking the wrong questions, and do not think in terms of such freewheeling structures. [Note: Seth implies that we can indeed design instruments that would be able to perceive these units. We will have a lot to say about this in Volume III, as there are several Russian scientists who have designed very effective torsion- field detectors. Also, this work has been replicated by Lt. Col. Tom Bearden (ret.) among others in the US. The pyramid work of Joe Parr, also covered in Volume III, clearly shows these fields as well. So, the latest research shows that since the time when Seth gave these readings in 1969, some scientists are now asking the \"right questions.\"] SESSION 505, OCTOBER 13, 1969, 9:34 P.M. MONDAY Good evening. (\"Good evening, Seth.\") Now: These units of which we spoke earlier are basically animations rising from consciousness. I am speaking now of the consciousness within each physical particle regardless of its size; of molecular consciousness, cellular consciousness, as well as the larger gestalts of consciousness with which you are usually familiar. Because of Ruburt's limited scientific vocabulary, this is somewhat difficult to explain. Also some of the theories I will present to you in this discussion will be quite unfamiliar to you. These emanations rise as naturally as breath, and there are other comparisons that can be made, in that there is a coming in and a going out, and transformation within the unit, as what is taken into the lungs, for example, is not the same thing that leaves on the exhale stroke. You could compare these units, simply for an analogy, to the invisible breath of consciousness. This analogy will not carry us far, but it will be enough initially to get the idea across. Breath is, of course, also a pulsation, and these units operate in a pulsating manner. They are emitted by the cells, for example, in plants, animals, rocks, and so forth. They would have color if you were able to perceive them physically."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"[Note: In Volume III, we will show how the work of Dr. Oliver Crane demonstrates the importance of a “breathing” movement in these spherical energy fields. This became one of the most important revelations in having a complete solution for the model, as we will see. It is truly stunning at how accurate Seth was, while none of this material had been formally discovered scientifically at the time.] They are electromagnetic, in your terms, following their own patterns of positive and negative charge, and following also certain laws of magnetism. In this instance, like definitely attracts like. The emanations are actually emotional tones. The varieties of tones, for all intents and purposes, are infinite. [Note: And of course, all tones must fall somewhere into an octave structure.] The units are just beneath the range of physical matter. None are identical. However, there is a structure to them. This structure is beyond the range of electromagnetic qualities as your scientists think of them. Consciousness actually produces these emanations, and they are the basis for any kind of perception, both sensory in usual terms and extrasensory. [Note: Russian research into torsion fields has validated Seth’s statements here, as these fields are indeed non-electromagnetic in nature, having qualities that are more similar to gravitational waves. There is extensive evidence that we will cover in this series to show how these torsion fields relate to consciousness.] We are only beginning this discussion. Later you will see that I am making it simple for you, but you will not understand it unless we start in this manner. I do intend to explain the structure of these units. Now, give us a moment. These emanations can also appear as sounds, and you will be able to translate them into sounds long before your scientists discover their basic meaning. [Note: We can now see that Seth has covered all three of the bases as far as harmonics is concerned: light, sound and geometry are all a factor in these vibrations. At the US Psychotronics Association conference in July 2002, this author saw certain machines that created torsion fields by using sound – so what Seth is saying here is indeed possible. One large ultra-low-frequency sound machine in particular had such a powerful effect that the author felt as if the ground was falling out from under him when he would stand in a certain spot, which aligned him with the torsion-field emanations coming from the device. He discovered this quite by accident, and the spot where it worked was over 30 feet away from the machine.] One of the reasons why they have not been discovered is precisely because they are so cleverly camouflaged within all structures. Being just beyond the range of matter, having a structure but a nonphysical one, and being of a pulsating nature, they can expand or contract. They can completely envelop, for example, a small cell, or retreat to the nucleus within. They combine qualities of a unit and a field, in other words."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"[Note: This is a very astute point that fits perfectly with the model, such as with the idea of “fluid crystals.”] There is another reason why they remain a secret from Western scientists. Intensity governs not only their activity and size, but the relative strength of their magnetic nature. They will draw other such units to them, for example, according to the intensity of the emotional tone of the particular consciousness at any given “point.” [Note: Thus, Seth is telling us that the amplitude of the spherical wave is actually a function of the emotional intensity that went into its creation.] These units then obviously change constantly. If we must speak in terms of size, then they change in size constantly as they expand and contract. Theoretically there is no limit, you see, to their rate of contraction or expansion. [Note: We can see that the shapes could easily expand into a size that would engulf a pyramid, based on this information. The essential foundation shape is a sphere, and a planet, sun, and galaxy can provide a basis for this pulsation, as can microclusters, molecules and atoms.] They are also absorbent. They do give off thermal qualities, and these are the only hint that your scientists have received of them so far. [Note: Here we should remember that heat is simply a reflection of how fast the molecules in a given object are vibrating. Once more, Seth wins big points here, as we will see in Volume III that these formations have been visually observed in the infrared and microwave spectrums. In particular, the infrared spectrum is a direct measurement of how much heat (vibration) is in a given area.] Their characteristics draw them toward constant interchange. Clumps of them (Jane gestured - her delivery was quite emphatic and animated) will be drawn together, literally sealed, only to drop away and disperse once more. They form – and their nature is behind – what is commonly known as air, and they use this to move through. The air, in other words, can be said to be formed by animations of these units. [Note: Right here we can clearly get a hint of the importance of meditation; our breath may well be the closest connection that we have to brining in greater amounts of this spiritual energy into our bodies. It seems that what Seth is truly driving at here is that the unseen geometric stresses in the aether have a direct impact on how the air molecules are bouncing around. This eventually gets into discussions about weather, which will be covered in this and later volumes when discussing the Global Grid.] I will try to clear this later, but the air is the result of these units’ existence, formed by the interrelationship of the units in their positions and relative distance one from the other, and by what you could call the relative velocity of their motion. Air is what happens when these units are in motion, and it is in terms of weather that their electromagnetic effects appear most clearly to scientists, for example."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"[Note: As we will see in future chapters, the earth’s Global Grid of energy lines directs wind and water currents in certain directions.] These units – let us discuss them as they are related to a rock. The rock is composed of atoms and molecules, each with their own consciousness. This forms a gestalt rock consciousness. These units are sent out indiscriminately by the various atoms and molecules, but portions of them are also directed by the overall rock consciousness. [Note: Here we can see a precise correlation with statements in the Ra Material where they described how they transformed the limestone rock into neatly carved blocks to build the Pyramid. Ra had said that the entity doing the building needed to “communicate to the intelligence of infinite rock-ness” and command it to displace a portion of itself into a higher frequency of vibration – much in the same sense that certain advanced spiritual masters and / or psychic children have been seen to manifest and demanifest objects.] The units are sent out by the rock, informing the rock as to the nature of its changing environment: the angle of the sun and temperature changes, for example, as night falls; and even in the case of a rock, they change as the rock’s loosely called emotional tone changes. As the units change, they alter the air about them, which is the result of their own activity. They constantly emanate out from the rock and return to it in a motion so swift it would seem simultaneous. The units meet with, and to some extent merge with, other units sent out, say, from foliage and all other objects. There is a constant blending, and also attraction and repulsion. [Note: Again, we pay close attention to Seth's statements: “it would seem simultaneous.” Clearly, our instruments would not be able to slow down this motion to a measurable speed – thus we may appear to see fixed clouds instead of the movement of “units.”] You may take your break, and we will continue. (10:10. Jane's delivery was quite emphatic and animated through- out. Her trance state was good.) (The rest of the session was devoted to Seth's interpretation of one of my dreams-Robert Butts.) SESSION 506, OCTOBER 27, 1969, 9:40 P.M. MONDAY (Sometime after 9 P.M. Jane and I sat to see if Seth would come through. I told Jane she needn't have a session, but she was willing enough, if Seth decided to. She has been working long hours on her book and has but a couple of chapters to rewrite.) (Jane has had two recent, excellent and long sessions for her ESP class, however, featuring both Seth and Seth II, and including new material.) Good evening. (\"Good evening, Seth.\")"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Now: Ruburt need not worry that he has missed a few regular sessions. He has been exercising spontaneity, and paradoxically enough, it is upon spontaneity that the regularity of our sessions depends. Do you follow me? (“Yes.”) Now: the units about which I have been speaking do not have any specific, regular, preordained “life.” They will not seem to follow many scientific principles. Since they are the intuitive force just beyond the range of matter, upon which matter is formed, they will not follow the laws of matter, although at times they may mimic the laws of matter. It is almost impossible to detect an individual unit, for in its dance of activity it constantly becomes a part of other such units, expanding and contracting, pulsating and changing in intensity, in force, and changing polarity. This last is extremely important. (Pause, one of many.) With Ruburt's limited vocabulary, this is rather difficult to explain, but it would be as if the positions of your north and south poles changed constantly while maintaining the same relative distance from each other, and by their change in polarity upsetting the stability (pause) of the planet – except that because of the greater comparative strength at the poles of the units (gestures, attempts to draw diagrams in the air), a newer stability is almost immediately achieved after each shifting. Is that much clear? (\"Yes.\") [Note: Again, time has proven the efficiency of Seth’s words. A spherical torus does have the greatest amount of energy influx at the polar regions. Every Platonic Solid does have the central axis of a spherical torus going through it, in a form that is most balanced for that particular geometry. This balance- point changes from one geometry to another, causing there to be a necessity for the poles of the spherical torus to shift their positions. This is the true, hidden mechanism that is responsible for magnetic pole shifts on Earth as well.] The shifting of polarity occurs in rhythm with changing emotional intensities, or emotional energies, if you prefer. [Note: This past sentence is extremely important to our discussion - it is the emotional intensity in a given area that causes these polarity shifts. And that intensity is simply a function of the ‘density’ or the degree of concentration of the aether energy itself. Similarly, sources such as Ra tell us that the Earth’s poles are going to have approximately a 21-degree shift at the time that the cycle ends – and it is the overall spiritual / emotional state of humanity that determines how quickly and how damagingly this shift will occur.] The “initial” originating emotional energy that sets any given unit into motion, and forms it, then causes the unit to become a highly charged electromagnetic field with those characteristics of changing polarities just mentioned. The changing polarities are also caused by attraction and repulsion from other like"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"units which may be attached or detached. There is a rhythm that underlies all of this changing polarity and changing intensities that occur constantly. But the rhythms have to do with the nature of emotional energy itself, and not with the laws of matter. [Note: Again, rhythm is another way of expressing vibration. In Volume III we will see how Seth is giving us a very general description of what is going on in Rod Johnson’s model of quantum physics.] Without an understanding of these rhythms, the activity of the units would appear haphazard, chaotic, and there would seem to be nothing to hold the units together. [Note: Remember that modern \"superstring\" theorists add two more dimensions to Ramanujan’s functions because they demand symmetry. Seth shows us here that this is not necessary, because there is an underlying rhythm of emotional energy that holds the units together.] Indeed, they seem to be flying apart at tremendous speeds. The “nucleus” – now using a cell analogy – if these units were cells, which they are not, then it would be as if the nucleus were constantly changing position, flying off in all directions, dragging the rest of the cell along with it. Do you follow the analogy? (“Yes.”) The units obviously are within the reality of all cells. Now: the initiation point is the basic part of the unit, as the nucleus is the important part of the cell. The initiation point is the originating, unique, individual, and specific emotional energy that forms any given unit. It becomes the entryway into physical matter. [Note: Seth’s “initiation point” would be the infinitesimally small sphere of the first density, which we would define in classic one-dimensional terms as a “point.”] It is the initial three-sided enclosure from which all matter must spring. The initial point forms the three sides about it. (Gestures; pause.) [Note: Based on context from other aspects of Roberts’ writings, including the cover of her book Adventures in Consciousness, it is clear to see that Seth is referring to the structure of a basic equilateral triangle, which forms the sides for all the Platonic solids except the dodecahedron and cube. And we now know that this is a simplified explanation, and the Hindus are more accurate in saying that the sphere crystallizes into the icosahedron. The triangle analogy makes this two-dimensional and thus easier to see.] There is an explosive nature as the emotional energy is born. The three-sided effect, instantly formed, leads to an effect that is something like friction, but the effect causes (more gestures) the three sides to change position, so that you end up with a triangular effect, closed, with the initial point inside the triangle. Now, you understand this is not a physical form. (“Yes.”)"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"[Note: As we will see in future chapters, this formation frequently appears in \"Crop Circles,\" another way that the visitors are trying to teach us about this system of vibratory physics.] The energy point, from here on, constantly changes the form of the unit, but the procedure I have just mentioned must first occur. The unit may become circular, for example. [Note: The circle appears to have been one of the only shapes that Seth could cite using Jane’s current vocabulary, but this doesn’t eliminate other possibilities.] Now these intensities of emotional energy, forming the units, end up by transforming all available space into what they are. Certain intensities and certain positions of polarity between and among the units and great groupings of the units compress energy into solid form (resulting in matter). The emotional energy within the units is obviously the motivating factor, and you can see, then, why emotional energy can indeed shatter a physical object. You may take your break. [Note: At first, in this paragraph Seth is describing how matter is simply a more compressed form of these energy units, coming about by “great groupings” that are organized together into “certain intensities and certain positions of polarity between and among the units.” Again, this is a perfect description of Johnson’s quantum physics model. Then, Seth suggests an understanding of the phenomenon of telekinesis, or mind over matter. It might be nothing more than the ability to control the “consciousness units” making up the object, then putting them “out of phase” with the pulsations of gravity in order to cause them to rise. This falls quite well in line with the stories given by master yogis regarding their Siddhi powers, as well as the cases of poltergeist activity being traced back to disgruntled teenagers with enormous emotional stress causing the events by telekinetic force. Indeed, in all telekinetic experiments, the author of this book has discovered that the only thing that will get an object to move is the firm mental visualization of it actually moving; that firmness of belief is what forms the emotional energy.] (10:10. Jane came out of trance quickly enough, though it had been a good one. At times her delivery had been quite fast. She said she could feel Seth pushing at her to get her to let the material through as clearly as possible without distortion.) (She also had some images while giving the material, though she could not remember them by break. Usually, she said, she forgets any images, or even whether or not she has had any, unless I specifically ask at once when a session is over or at break. Sometimes, she said, the same images will return to her when she reads a particular session; she then recognizes them.) (Jane made it a point to mention that in regard to the switch in polarities of the units: \"This isn't only with the north and south switching, but opposites anywhere on the rim of the circle [that was used as an analogy], with east and west reversed, for instance.\") [Note: Let us not forget that Seth appears to have used the analogy of a circle"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"instead of a sphere to keep things simpler.] (Resume 10:26.) Now: the intensity of the original emotional energy controls the activity, strength, stability, and relative size of the unit; the rate of its pulsation, and its power to attract and repel other units, as well as its ability to combine with other units. The behavior of these units changes in the following manner. When a unit is in the act of combining with another, it aligns its components in a characteristic way. When it is separating itself from other units, it will align its components in a different way. The polarities change in each case, within the units. The unit will alter its polarities within itself, adapting the polarity-design of the unit to which it is being attracted; and it will change its polarity away from that design on breaking contact. [Note: All of this relates to the geometries inside of the spheres themselves, and how they interact with each other.] Take, for example, five thousand such units aligned together, formed together. They would, of course, be invisible. But if you could view them, each individual unit would have its poles lined up in the same manner. It would look like one single unit - say, it is of circular form - so it would appear like a small globe with the poles lined up as in your earth. [Note: Here is where Seth steps out of “flat” two-dimensional metaphors and brings in the idea of a sphere – specifically a spherical torus, since he is focusing on the poles of the sphere.] If this large unit were then attracted to another larger one, circular, with the poles running east and west, in your terms, then the first unit would change its own polarity, and all of the units within it would do the same. The energy point would be halfway between these poles, regardless of their position, and it (the energy point) forms the poles. They revolve, therefore, about the energy point. The energy point is indestructible basically. Its intensity, however, can vary to amazing degrees, so that it could, relatively speaking, be too weak or fall back, not strong enough to form the basis for matter, but to project into another system, perhaps, where less intensity is required for “materialization.” [Note: This is made possible by the fact that there are many “densities within densities,” as Ra has illustrated.] These units may also gain so in intensity and strength that they form relatively permanent structures within your system because of the astonishing energy behind them. Your Stockridge- (Seth paused; Jane frowned as though groping for a word.) (“Oak Ridge?”) No. (Gesture.) The remains of temples."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"(“Oh. Baalbek?”) These were places for studies concerning the stars. Observatories. (“Yes?” I thought I probably knew the word Seth/Jane was looking for, but I didn't have time to think and write notes.) The units so charged with intensive emotional energy formed patterns for matter that retained their strength. Now these units, while appearing within your system, may also have a reality outside it, propelling the emotional energy units through the world of matter entirely. These units, as I told you, are indestructible. They can, however, lose or gain power, fall back into intensities beneath matter, or go through matter, appearing as matter as they do so and projecting through your system. [Note: There are examples of “consciousness units” that do appear as matter, and this is well covered in both the second and third volumes. Most of the time, they will appear to be glowing balls of light when this occurs.] We will deal with that portion of their activity separately. In such cases, however, they are in a point of transition obviously and in a state of becoming. You may take a break or end the session as you prefer. (\"I guess we'd better end it.\") I wanted to give you this material. (\"It's very interesting.\") It is only a beginning. I would disregard the analogies if you did not need them. A fond good evening. (\"Good evening, Seth.\") (10:45. After we talked a bit, I deduced that Seth/Jane had been trying for the word “Stonehenge,” meaning the ancient Druidic stone monoliths arranged in a circle in England, etc. Jane then said this was the word Seth had been trying to get her to say. She didn't know why it didn't come out while in trance, since she knows the word and what it stands for.) [Note: The author has had similar things happen, wherein the force behind the words was trying to express a word that, for whatever reason, it could not find in the mind of the individual. In these cases, the word must get pushed out syllable by syllable, and there may well be distortions. The author was able to get accurate Japanese sentences at one point, with almost no knowledge of the language, but certain syllables in the words were slightly incorrect.] SESSION 509, NOVEMBER 24, 1969, 9:10 P.M. MONDAY (Today Jane had been reading Experimental Psychology by C. G. Jung, first American edition, published by Jung's heirs in 1968. We hadn't asked Seth to comment.)"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Good evening. (\"Good evening, Seth.\") [Note: Here Seth goes into a discussion about Jung’s definitions of the different levels of consciousness, compared to his own definitions. Jung did not ascribe the degree of significance to the subconscious that Seth does here. We cut to the following paragraph to preserve the flow, as it summarizes Seth's point and segues into our discussion:] The conscious ego rises, indeed, out of the “unconscious,” but the unconscious, being the creator of the ego, is necessarily far more conscious than its offspring. The ego is simply not conscious enough to be able to contain the vast knowledge that belongs to the inner conscious self from which it springs. [Note: Thus, we have an explanation for where Ramanujan’s information was coming from. Apparently, his ego was conscious enough to contain some of it, and within three years of full-blown academic research in Europe, he died.] It is this inner self, out of massive knowledge and the unlimited scope of its consciousness, that forms the physical world and provides stimuli to keep the outer ego constantly at the job of awareness. It is the inner self, here termed the inner ego, that organizes, initiates, projects, and controls the EE (electromagnetic energy) units of which we have been speaking, transforming energy into objects, into matter. The energy of this inner self is used by it to form from itself – from inner experience – a material counterpart in which the outer ego then can act out its role. The outer ego then acts out a play that the inner self has written. This is not to say that the outer ego is a puppet. It is to say that the outer ego is far less conscious than the inner ego, that its perception is less, that it is far less stable though it makes great pretense of stability, that it springs from the inner self and is therefore less, rather than more, aware. The outer ego is spoon-fed, being given only those feelings and emotions, only that data, that it can handle. This data is presented to it in a highly specialized manner, usually in terms of information picked up by the physical senses. The inner self or ego is not only conscious, but conscious of itself, both as an individuality apart from others and as an individuality that is a part of all other consciousness. In your terms, it is continually aware, both of this apartness and unity-with. The outer ego is not continuously aware of anything. It frequently forgets itself. When it becomes swept up in a strong emotion it seems to lose itself; there is unity, then, but no sense of apartness. When it most vigorously maintains its sense of individuality, it is no longer aware of unity-with. The inner ego is always aware of both aspects and is organized about its primary aspect, which is creativity. It constantly translates the components of its gestalt into reality – either physical reality through the EE units I have mentioned, or into other realities equally as valid."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Now you may take your break and we shall continue. (During our break I wondered aloud if Jung had changed his ideas since his physical death.) (Resume 10:05.) Now: the EE (electromagnetic energy) units are the forms that basic experience takes when directed by this inner self. These, then, form physical objects, physical matter. Matter, in other words, is the shape that basic experience takes when it intrudes into three-dimensional systems. Matter is the shape of your dreams. Your dreams, thoughts, and emotions are literally transformed into physical matter purposefully by this inner self. The individual inner self, then, through constant massive effort of great creative intensity, cooperates with all other inner selves to form and maintain the physical reality that you know, so that physical reality is an offshoot or by- product of the highly conscious inner self. [Note: It is very obvious here that this is the “holographic universe” theory in action, well before it emerged in books such as Michael Talbot’s, of the same name. We really are living in a collective visualization, or a three-dimensional hologram of thought. The reason why we can’t walk through walls is that we are by far not the only ones creating them.] Buildings appear to be made of rock or stone or steel. They appear fairly permanent to the physical senses. They are actually oscillating, ever-moving, highly charged gestalts of EE units (\"beneath,\" say, any atomic particles), organized and maintained by the collective efforts on the part of inner selves. They (the buildings) are solidified emotions, solidified subjective states, given physical materialization. [Note: It is also easy to see here that the more densely populated an area is, the greater amount of torsion-field charge there can be on the physical objects built there. This is one reason why cities can be extremely damaging to the psychic work process. They will often have a great deal of stored energy, which can be predominantly chaotic and negative due to the hardships and crowding faced by many people. These chaotic emotions translate directly into energy that enters into the structures.] The powers of consciousness are clearly not understood, then. Each individual has his part to play in projecting these EE units into physical actuality. Therefore, physical matter can be legitimately described as an extension of the self, as much as the physical body is a projection of the inner self. It is obvious that the body grows up about the inner self, and that trees grow out of the ground, whereas buildings do not spring up like flowers of their own accord; so the inner self has various methods of creation and uses the EE units in different ways, as you shall see as we continue with the discussion. Having determined upon physical reality as a dimension in which it will express itself, the inner self, first of all, takes care to form and maintain the physical basis upon which all else must depend; the properties of earth that can be called natural ones. The inner self has a vast and infinite reservoir"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"from which to draw knowledge and experience. All kinds of choices are available, and the diversity of physical matter is a reflection of this deep source of variety. With the natural structures formed and maintained, other secondary physical properties – secondary constructions – are projected. The deepest, most basic and abiding subjective experience is translated, however, into those natural elements: the ample landscape that sustains physical life. We will continue with this discussion at our next session. Jung enlarged on some of his concepts shortly before he died. (Leaning forward, humorously emphatic.) He has changed a good many of them since then. Now you may take a break or end the session as you prefer. (\"We'll take the break.\") (10:30 P.M. Jane said she thought the delivery had taken perhaps ten minutes instead of the twenty-five it had actually taken. Resume at 10:43.) We will shortly end the session. Suffice it to say, however, that in the future what I am telling you will be more generally known. Men will become familiar to some extent with their own inner identity, with other forms of their own consciousness. [Note: Thankfully, that future is already starting to happen now – increasingly so each year.] Throughout the ages, some have recognized the fact that there is self- consciousness and purpose in certain dream and sleep states, and have maintained, even in waking life, the sense of continuity of this inner self. To such people it is no longer possible to identify completely with the ego consciousness. They are too obviously aware of themselves as more. When such knowledge is gained, the ego can accept it, for it finds to its surprise that it is not less conscious, but more, that its limitations are dissipated. Now: it is not true – and I emphasize this strongly – that so-called unconscious material, given any freedom, will draw energy away from the egotistically organized self in a normal personality. Quite the contrary, the ego is replenished and rather directly. It is the fear that the “unconscious” is chaotic that causes psychologists to make such statements. There is also something in the nature of those who practice psychology: a fascination, in many cases, already predisposed to fear the “unconscious” in direct proportion to its attraction for them. The ego maintains its stability, its seeming stability, and its health, from the constant subconscious and unconscious nourishment which it receives. Too much nourishment will not kill it. Do you follow me here? (\"Yes.\") Only when such nourishment is for some reason cut off to a considerable degree is the ego threatened by starvation. We will have more to say concerning the ego's relationship with the “unconscious.” In a healthy personality, the inner self easily projects all experience into EE units, where"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"they are translated into actuality. Physical matter, therefore, acts as a feedback. Now we will end our session, unless you have questions. (\"I guess not. It's been very interesting.\") My heartiest regards and a fond good evening to you both. ________________________________________________________________ _______ So with this segment, we can easily begin to pick up how familiar our Higher Selves must be with these units of consciousness. Seth essentially says that each sphere, pulsating its way through the different geometric shapes, is an EE unit, and that these EE units make up our entire physical reality. With these words, we can well begin to get a glimpse of the far-reaching metaphysical realities that underlie these units. Since they are formed by consciousness, we create them constantly, whether we are aware of it or not, through our own thoughts. They can hold certain specific emotional energy charges, and emotional energies are often rooted in the archetypal systems, which we will briefly discuss. The rest of this chapter may seem to be off-topic from the direct physics discussions, but it is partly designed to give the less technically inclined reader some breathing room; it is also designed to explore the more esoteric ramifications of the perspective that Seth has given us on the physics under discussion. ARCHETYPES AND THE HARMONIC DIMENSIONS Archetypes are often mentioned, such as in the Law of One series, but few people really understand them, so we will explore them for a moment. Essentially, the theory behind the archetypes is that all life experiences that anyone could have may be refined and organized into a common series of events. Each archetypal event would then be a necessary part of learning our lessons in Spiritual Growth in order to advance further. According to Ra, there are certain lessons that each density teaches us, which we must pass through in order to achieve the vibratory level necessary for the next level. Each vibratory level, then, could be likened to an archetype for a specific lesson that needs to be learned, for each of the three parts of our being; spiritual, mental, and physical. Here we enter the major arcana of the Tarot cards, which was based on what are known as the “sephiroth” from the Jewish mystical system known as the Cabala. It is a longstanding tradition among mystics that both Tarot and Cabalistic systems, each having 22 archetypes, contain the full spectrum of learning experiences necessary for self-perfection, which would be returning to the One, or the Octave, a full reunion with God. It is then fascinating to see that these 22 can be likened to three “scales” of seven, (7 x 3 = 21,) with the 22nd archetype, the Fool, existing outside of the others as a separate card. This peculiar character of the Fool is constantly referred to in books on the Tarot; the Fool in and of itself stands separate from the rest of the deck. We can then take The Fool as representing an archetype of the starting point for all three levels given, as the One will always be the same, never divided. Thus, if we apply the Fool, as the One, to the beginning of each set of seven, we get 8 x 3, or Ramanujan’s mystical number of 24. (However, Ra did say"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"that there isn’t an exact one-to-one relationship between the archetypes and the densities.) The definition of the Fool is interesting, in that it depicts a man walking forward at the edge of a cliff, with a stick that has a small purse at the end of it, which is balanced over his shoulder. He looks to the sky and holds a flower in his other hand, apparently walking totally unaware of the cliff he stands in front of, while a white dog barks incessantly at him, trying to warn him of the danger. The purse is supposed to represent the stored up knowledge of universal memory, which he carries with him. A quote from Sidney and Bennett’s book on the Tarot reads, “It is said that the Fool “possesses the foolishness of God, which is greater than the wisdom of men.”” What exactly is the Fool telling us? Why would a full consciousness of God lead us to being so haphazard in the care for our own lives? This is only the outer meaning of the archetype. The deeper meaning is that the Fool knows that he can trust God completely, and thus he does not perceive any obstacles as actually existing in reality. The dog would represent our lower, more animal natures, which bark out in anger at the slightest thought of our having this blind trust, fully seeing the pitfalls and dangers lying ahead. But the Fool, in his or her love for the One, simply has complete faith. It could well be stated, then, that for anyone to fully attain this wisdom in the material plane, they would be so obviously out of place as to appear a fool, moron or idiot. Yet, time and time again, this unwavering faith proves itself to be of the highest caliber. We are reminded of the Biblical story about how Jesus and his disciples are out on a boat in the sea, and a horrible storm comes up, which scares the men so badly that they beg Jesus to wake up and deal with it. Jesus, rising from his slumber and probably grumbling to himself, walks out to the edge of the boat, sleepily raises his hands and releases powerful torsion fields that promptly dissipate the storm. He then chastises his apostles, saying that they have no faith. Indeed, as we continue to explore the true multidimensional nature behind the Great Cycle that is now ending, and explore how some of the “Earth Change” events surrounding it are fraught with catastrophe and disaster, it is helpful to be able to trust in the fact that the positive aspect known as “Ascension” will really occur as the end product of all of this. If we do not have the faith, then we will never know if our opinions of “doom” were right until the event has already passed. Apparently, there will be more than one opportunity to Ascend over the course of a relatively brief period of time, but it is important to prepare ourselves for the first “wave”, as it is often called. This is exactly what was promised to us by the highest spiritual forces ever to appear on Earth, and the promise will not go unfulfilled. On the physics level, it is a simple question of expanding our vibration to accommodate our movement into a higher density, which we already do every night in dreams. The only difference this time is that we will be going there to stay, because we have earned it, through our diligent personal growth process. Getting back to our discussion, it appears that each frequency in the octave is related to certain specific archetypes, which one must go through to fulfill our curriculum for returning to God, or the One, as perfected beings. Therefore, there would be certain emotional phases associated with the units that Seth is referring to, which would remain as constants throughout the universe. This"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"helps us understand how aetheric energy can affect the personality, as in the science of astrology. The three cycles of seven archetypes correspond to the initiation of the mind, body and spirit, emphasizing our need to address all three areas equally in our spiritual growth process. Each area of our being represents a unique and separate challenge for integration, but these challenges do relate to each other as well. Thus, choosing to eat a purified diet initiates the body, by making it more vital and healthy, and resisting its addictive, genetically based cravings. However, the diet also initiates the mind, through the discipline of respectfully denying the Self the gratification that it constantly is begging for. The initiation of the Spirit comes through knowing that by performing this discipline, you are acting on behalf of God’s will, and in so doing, raising your vibratory level. You can probably tell that this is a simplified example, but it will do for now. Interestingly, the author has learned that the actual act of drawing the Tarot cards and having the reading be accurate will often involve the subconscious storage of “consciousness units” that correspond to the emotional energy of that particular archetype inside the card. Your subconscious mind, which can exert influence over the body, can tell you what card to pick just by getting a feeling as you pass your hand over it. Each card could then be likened to a little magnet, programmed with its own emotional charge, waiting to be renewed. The act of concentration while shuffling the cards puts the power of consciousness back into them, which reinvigorates the stored blueprints of energy patterns inside them. Then, after tuning into the cards in nothing more than a light to moderate trance, the reader can instinctively grab the card their Total Self is looking for – and thus the cycle is completed. Each Tarot reading spread has several cards, and invariably there are certain positions that are for the future. Thus, the Total Self, influencing the subtle act of drawing cards, can tell the reader what the strongest future probabilities are in the present term. This ingenuous system is actually behind the vast majority of self-declared “psychics” who do these readings for people, and in the hands of an attuned person who already understands and practices the spiritual growth curriculum indicated in the cards, much great work can be done. The only time required to be in trance is when the cards themselves are drawn, and sheer analysis will easily produce the answers after that point. One time, someone told Wilcock that the Tarot cards were evil. He responded by saying that if a person uses the English language to speak evil things, does that then mean that the English language is evil? Certainly not. Knowing what we now do about the structure of the densities, and that it is a growth curriculum that we can actually complete on Earth, we can easily see the Tarot cards as a sort of alphabet of the collective consciousness that gives rise to our universe. The discussion of “consciousness units” also gives credence to the claims of psychometrists, those people who can pick up a personal item of an unknown person and uncover what types of emotions that person is feeling. Wilcock himself did this after reading about it in high school, and obtained some very interesting results. This ability can also be used to find lost objects, calling out to the energy that is already stored in the object to bring about its return. At one point, Wilcock had lost his high school ring for many months, and after"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"strongly visualizing its return, it was promptly found under the heat by his mother within two days. His mother had no idea that he had lost the ring or wished for its return. It could well be that he magnetized the energy stored inside the ring, turning it into a signal beacon which then influenced his mother’s subconscious to clean in that particular spot. This is, essentially, the process of creative visualization, or the idea, originally coined by Seth and by far his most famous quote, which has now become a New Age cliché but nevertheless is still very accurate: “You create your own reality.” All objects are essentially nothing more than thought forms. In other works, Seth repeatedly indicates that the body, and in fact all matter, is constantly turning on and off, or pulsating through the different dimensions. Each consciousness unit must cycle through all of the densities in the octave constantly, at tremendous speed, even though it remains “focused” in one density most strongly. What this proves is that there really is no such thing as a separate density: in one sense, they are all blending directly into each other constantly. What is so fascinating about this is the idea that it is our perceptions, our thoughts, which hold together the level of reality that we are on. Thus, our current bodies and minds are creating our world each moment, by allowing us to only focus on third-density. Yet, were we able to alter our focus to perceive fourth-density, then we would only perceive that realm. Our physical bodies would still exist in third-density, as that part of ourselves is focused there and belongs there, for now. In order to fully enter into a higher plane, we have to do it in a body that is essentially less physical, and more of a direct form of conscious energy. In fact, the Hindu cosmology associates the seven chakras with seven different energy bodies, and thus in a sense we have seven different bodies, of which we could use those above the third density for travel in higher realms. This is essentially what happens when we have a dream or an out of body experience. We leave our physical bodies where they belong in the third density, and use a higher form of body that is only conscious of those times when the geometric energy is focused in the realm of the cube, for example. In the series of books by Carlos Castenada about his workings as an anthropology graduate student with a Yaqui Indian from the Sonora Desert in Mexico, named Don Juan, we see this same point emerge. Don Juan was a shaman, a man who had free access to these higher dimensions. His method for entering into these higher realms is, interestingly, very close to what we are saying here. What Don Juan said you must do to enter these worlds is to stop your mind from all conscious thought. At first this seems only able to be done by the most intense Eastern gurus, after years of practice and meditation. This practice was referred to by the shamans as “Stopping the World.” Don Juan explained that we have different “rings of power” that we use to create the world that is around us, and that if we can stop thinking about physical reality, we will no longer be conscious within it, and our consciousness will move to higher levels. This process would basically be akin to stopping yourself from having any thoughts. Most importantly, in doing so you quite naturally get very close to falling asleep. Indeed, the whole key is not to fall asleep while"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"doing this. In order to short-circuit the process, Carlos Castenada went through a brutal initiation using hardcore psychedelic compounds discovered by the shamans, such as peyote, psilocybin mushrooms and Jimson weed. Don Juan would use these compounds to guide Carlos through an initiation into these higher worlds, with the idea that eventually the compounds would no longer be necessary for the access. Carlos was especially resilient to his training and thus he “tripped out” many times before he got the message. The author would like to state at this point that in Nature of Personal Reality, Seth makes it very clear that the ingestion of LSD can be of significant and long-lasting harm to the individual. Seth states that the whole personality structure is essentially shattered into many different scattered pieces in such an experience, pieces that must then be identified and reconstructed anew. Thus, despite the fact that Castenada’s initiation took on such a form, the use of any chemical substances of any kind for opening up “the doors of perception” is strongly contra-indicated by the author. You can indeed get the doors open with drugs, but it is dangerous and damaging, and does not represent “spiritual growth.” On the other hand, the rising frequency of aetheric energy surrounding us is now strong enough that these states may be accessed with ease in a good, solid meditation. Doing “the real work” is by far the preferred method – and the “binaural synchronization” techniques of the Monroe Institute represent a drugless way to induce out-of-body and mystical experiences using the properties of sound. In the next chapter, we will shed further light on our discussion of these “consciousness units” and their forces, by investigating another means by which these truths were being demonstrated to us – through the metaphor of the crop circle formations. "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 07: THE EMERGENCE OF THE MOTHER OF ALL CROP CIRCLES In this chapter, we zero in specifically on the efforts of Higher Intelligence to show us, in modern times, a precise image and description of exactly what a Consciousness Unit is, as well as the phase of the CU that we are now heading into. All of this comes about through the Barbury Castle 1991 formation, an image of incredible size and complexity that appeared literally overnight in a field of wheat. The entire story and background of the crop circles is explored in some detail, along with Gerald Hawkins' \"Crop Circle Theorems\" that show a clear connection between geometry and \"diatonic\" musical ratios, and other formations that reveal more secrets. CHAPTER 07: THE EMERGENCE OF THE “MOTHER OF ALL CROP CIRCLES” In opening up this chapter, let us again state that we have been investigating how the seen and unseen energies in the universe are all interwoven with a system of conscious energy that expresses itself in octaves. We can see these formations emerging in the sound spectrum as the basic structure of the Octave, in the light spectrum as Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet, and in the geometric form as the hierarchy of shapes that crystallize within the sphere. The reader will remember that earlier in the book we have cited physical evidence from Dale Pond’s Physics of Love that showed us that the harmonic ratios between the vibrations of sound can be expanded many times over to get the equivalent frequencies of the color spectrum of visible light. Later in this volume we will see that these same numbers underlie the cycles in the Sun and planets, and {?{we will show their presence within atoms and molecules as well.}?} And here in this chapter, we will give further evidence to show a connection between the frequencies of sound and color with geometry, again showing how they are literally crystallized vibrations. In the book Sacred Geometry by Robert Lawlor, he refers to the Platonic Solids as the “regular polyhedra” in the quote that we are about to cite. The image that Lawlor will be drawing off of is seen in Figure 7.1, as Kepler’s famous geometric model of the Solar System. In this model, Kepler erected a large half-sphere and placed a cube inside of it. Each of the nested Platonic solids is represented in a smaller half-sphere. Lawlor refers to the bowls, or half-spheres, as circles in this quote: “In this demonstration the regular polyhedra are determined by nine concentric circles whose pattern gives all the necessary information for the construction of these forms. Each volume is in a simple harmonic relationship to the others, and it is the same transcendental functions, [square root of 2, square root of phi and phi] that make up these patterns of relationships.... all volumes emerge simultaneously.... This is an image of the great Buddhist idea of the co-dependent origination of the archetypal principles of creation.” The very first thing that we can tell here is that Kepler would have obviously spent a lot of time working on such a massive sculpture. It is highly unlikely that he would have done so if he did not believe it to be very important. What"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"we suggest here is that Kepler was heir to the ancient Atlantean repository of knowledge, similar to that handed down to the Hindus. With his secret knowledge in place, he was trying to show us the geometric structures within the different ‘nested’ spheres of aetheric energy density in the Solar System. Ostensibly, since Kepler was an initiate of the Mysteries, he knew that it somehow had to be right, but he didn't know why it was right – and thus later scholars considered this model to be a complete failure. Kepler believed that the spacing between the shapes would map out the spacings between the planets, but he could never truly get it to work. We will show the harmonic functions that are responsible for the planetary positions in Volume III. Figure 7.1 – Kepler’s geometric model of the Solar System. For one who is more familiar with sacred geometry, it isn’t hard to see that Kepler only had a rough knowledge of how the Platonic Solids actually nested inside of each other. The most obvious problem is that all the Solids are “sitting up,” with the same north-south axis, when in fact they should have discrete angular rotations in comparison to each other. As one example, the tetrahedron should nest inside of the cube so that its edge ‘elements’ run exactly along the faces of the cube, the tips of the tetrahedron lining up directly with the tips of the cube. Then, the shape immediately inside of the tetrahedron should be the octahedron, then the cuboctahedron inside the octahedron. So, Kepler definitely gets an “A” for effort, but with more modern techniques for analysis we can see that there are mistakes in this model – and ultimately he gave up on it out of frustration. Again, knowing what we now know about Atlantis, it is very, very unlikely that he would have simply come"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"up with this burning passion for such an idea on his own – especially if he didn’t fully understand why he was doing it. If we look back to Lawlor’s quotation that we cited above, he mentions the mathematical progressions of phi, square root of phi and square root of 2 as the basic harmonic building block ratios that make up geometry, color and music. (We will go into detail about this aspect of the Platonic Solids in Chapter 13.) Lawlor’s book gives a wealth of information to show how these basic vibratory ratios emerge in all forms of life throughout nature, governing such things as the growth of shells, plants and even the proportions of the human body. (In Volume III we will go into much more detail about the connection between biology and aetheric energy.) In Sacred Geometry, Lawlor also shows repeated examples of Renaissance artwork that explored these sacred ratios, so it is clear that sacred geometry was a topic of great interest within the intelligentsia of the day. Again, there is ample evidence that those painters who incorporated these ratios into their artwork were inheritors of the Atlantean Mysteries; surprise, surprise. Up until this point, we have tackled the Platonic Solids in two basic ways: 1. They emerge within a sphere of vibrating fluid, or aether. 2. They are geometric forms created in the stresses between “node points” on the sphere’s surface. Things get a little trickier once we realize that spirals such as phi, the square root of 2, 3 and 5 are also emanating from the center of the sphere. As Lawlor said, these basic spirals determine the relationships between the different Platonic Solids. In order to explain this, we have to arrange it in a logical sequence. 1. Earlier, we showed how the Platonic Solids fit inside of each other. We can indeed build up the Hindu model in such a way as to have the entire Octave nested together into one giant series of nested spheres. So, we start by arranging all of these shapes inside of each other in their Octave order, like a jigsaw puzzle. 2. Then, we plot out where the vertices, tips or points of each shape are. With computer modeling, we could actually remove the shapes and just look at the points. 3. When we see just the points without being confused by the surrounding geometry, we discover that they give us perfect coordinates to show spirals that are emanating out from the center of the entire onionlike “nest” of spheres. These spirals are based on phi and the square roots of 2, 3 and 5. 4. Since we can clearly plot out these spirals, they obviously are “real” energetic structures, which precisely determine how the Platonic Solids “grow” from one into another. Just as a train will naturally follow wherever the train tracks curve, so too will the geometries naturally grow into the positions that the spirals create for them. Everything works together in perfect harmony. 5. The Russian research tells us that “torsion waves,” or waves in the aether, are always spiraling in their form. Therefore, we can state with confidence"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"that these spirals are indeed one form of torsion waves. 6. In the Law of One series, Ra says that the evolution of consciousness through the Octave of densities proceeds along “the upward spiraling line of light.” They also introduce the concept of nested spheres of energy density, pulsating movements and Platonic geometry. 7. Therefore, it is clear that Ra expressed deep knowledge of how this geometry actually works, which Carla Rueckert herself was still not aware of when we co-presented with her on the same stage in Louisville, KY in May of 2002. She confessed that they had hit a “total brick wall” in trying to understand what Ra was talking about when they mentioned the “spiraling line of light” – a conceptual block that had persisted for literally 20 years before she heard Wilcock’s solution to the puzzle – which he gained by his own follow-up work with Ra, primarily through dreams and visions. It has long been our contention that straight lines essentially represent the masculine polarity of energy in the Universe, and that the spiraling lines represent the feminine polarity. Both are equally important for Creation to exist, and they are indeed unified by the sphere, or the Oneness. Without the spiraling feminine lines in place for support, the masculine geometry could not build and grow. There are some very deep philosophical ideas about the relationship between the universal masculine and feminine principles that can be found by meditating on this arrangement, such as how the love of a woman can nurture and support a man. This may well be another layer of why the Vedic scholars had the god Purusha and the goddess Prakriti as the central figures of their system of sacred geometry. Perhaps the reader is still having trouble visualizing how these straight and curving lines interact with each other. In Figure 7.2, the diagram on the left shows us the nautilus shell, which is one of the best ways that Nature naturally demonstrates the “phi” spiral to us. The diagram on the right shows the mathematical progression of the same spiral, and how it forms a framework for the geometry of six triangles. These triangles could be seen either as expanding outward or as coagulating inward, depending on your perception. Each triangle is related to its immediate neighbor by the phi ratio, meaning that if you compare the surface area of one triangle into the next larger triangle, you will get a proportion of roughly 1:1.618 between them. This is a relatively basic and well-known mathematical principle."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" Figure 7.2 – The Nautilus shell (L) and phi spiral as it relates to the growth of triangles (R). Now when we look at the triangle diagram on the right, we can imagine that the tight center of the spiral would represent the center of the sphere. Then, we would see the spiral as coming out from the center. The smallest triangle would be the geometry in the center, and then with each larger triangle we are moving closer to the outside surface of the sphere. Since most of the Platonic Solids have triangular faces, the next step would be to visualize how there could be multiple spirals emanating in different directions from the center of the sphere at once, all forming a collective matrix for the geometries to expand through, somewhat like how an inflating soap bubble is held in place by a plastic ring and expands as greater and greater air is blown into it. Next, we will bring in another quote from Lawlor’s Sacred Geometry, which deals with the work of Dr. Hans Jenny, showing the important effect that he has had on the field. Thankfully, for the lay reader we have already explained Jenny’s experiments in far simpler language than what Lawlor uses here: It is in the work of Hans Jenny [Ph.D.] that we can begin to see the relationship of form and sound in the physical world. Jenny’s experiments"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"have shown that sound frequencies have the propensity to call into arrangement random, suspended particles, or to organize emulsions in hydro- dynamic dispersion [i.e. particles floating in a fluid] into orderly, formal, periodic patterns. In other words, sound is an instrument through which temporal frequency patterns [i.e. patterns in time, such as the number of cycles per second] can become formal spatial and geometric patterns. [emphasis added] That paragraph is a mouthful, with very technical wording, but it has all that we need. Again, Dr. Jenny’s research, known as Cymatics, discusses what happens to particles floating in a solution when they are vibrated by sound waves; the particles mysteriously assemble themselves into geometric shapes. Figure 7.3 shows us this “Cymatic” force in action, and the Platonic geometry inside is easily seen. In this case, it is the harmonic of the fourth density, namely the two interpenetrating tetrahedra in a spherical field. With Jenny's work we can clearly see the spiraling lines that underlie the geometries, as well as the “spheres within spheres” effect, as there are at least three major boundary areas that you could draw a circle around in this image. In a private conversation with sacred geometry researcher Gregg Braden in April 2002, we were informed that all of the Platonic Solids could be modeled from this formation, which is why so much attention has been given to it. It is easy to see the five-sided faces of the dodecahedron inside the central star, as one example. The image is still slightly “off” because the fluid was not a true sphere, but rather a droplet of water on a vibrating wave-plate. Figure 7.3 – One of many geometric structures formed by Dr. Hans Jenny’s “Cymatics” research, using a vibrating drop of fluid with particles suspended inside. So, Dr. Jenny’s research puts the final word in on the importance of the geometric shapes in the sphere, in case we doubted their relation to the Octaves of color (i.e. visible light) and sound. The ratios of phi and the square root of 2 are also responsible for the difference between the various tones in"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"the Octave, when measured as values of vibration in cycles per second. You can take one note in the Octave and compare it to the note next to it, and the two notes will always relate by one of these simple “spiraling” ratios. Therefore, we can now see that even though it seems strange at first, every sound truly has a three-dimensional, geometric component. The same would be true for every color. Some people, including this author, have been able to perceive this connection automatically in mystical states of consciousness, without necessarily understanding the vision. Many people who have had these visions send us email with great relief that they have finally understood why they were seeing such formations in their mind’s eye. As reported by Drs. William Becker and Bethe Hagens in their article “The Planetary Grid: A New Synthesis,” Dr. Hans Jenny’s crucial research was originally inspired by students of physicist Buckminster Fuller, who demonstrated the geometric structure of vibration within a fluid system. Fuller’s students created an experiment where a transparent spherical balloon was submerged in a bath of dye. They found that by simply vibrating the balloon at an even tone, the dye would well up in the areas where there was the least amount of movement on the skin of the balloon – i.e. the node points. We remember that all of the vibrations will “cancel out” in these areas, thus forming points of force that connect to form the Platonic Solids. Although most of what Fuller’s students perceived were the nodes or the tips of these geometries, in certain cases faint lines could be seen connecting the nodes together, literally forming these same shapes right in front of their eyes. Dr. Jenny wanted to find an even more direct and effective way to show this force at work, and he certainly succeeded quite admirably. It is quite apparent that outside forces are diligently trying to help us understand and acknowledge the existence of this universal harmonic system, because of its significance to our civilization. Crop circles appear to be one of the most fundamental means by which the geometries involved in these harmonic systems are being conveyed to us. It is marvelous to have such a directly scientific form of communication from beings of higher intelligence available to us in the public domain. What we see is an image of very large size that is created in a popular and accessible area, which obviously attracts a great deal of attention. Many of these formations clearly show that they could not have been “hoaxed,” though there are many good-quality hoaxes out there as well – and we will explain the difference. Though most researchers and observers do not really understand what these bizarre images are showing us, there are a few who have done quite well. Indeed, it is the work of mathematician Gerald Hawkins that inadvertently set out an entire theoretical framework for our discussion. Hawkins discovered an enormous repetition of mathematical diagrams of “consciousness units” without even realizing that this is what he had found. Hawkins knew that most of the geometric formations seen in crop formations were somehow incorporated into a circle. Though the circle was occasionally hidden with other images, he discovered that nearly all of the early 1990’s crop formations would take simple forms such as the triangle, square and hexagon and put them inside circles. As we shall see, these could certainly represent simplified “sketches” of three-dimensional shapes in many cases. Hawkins discovered something extraordinary when he took the surface area of the circles in the formations and divided it against the area of the square,"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"triangle or hexagon that would be located inside. The relationships between these numbers are the diatonic ratios, or the actual vibrational frequencies that make up the tones in the octave. In other words, these simple flat crop circles eloquently display musical frequencies. Since the musical octave is interchangeable with the light spectrum, the Circlemakers appear to be giving us the exact same clues we have already been exploring – a common link between sound, music and geometry. The importance of this find cannot be underestimated. Hawkins surprised everyone in the crop circle community by showing a completely new set of “geometric theorems” -- namely that the basic square, triangle and hexagon produced musical ratios when placed within circles. This mathematical work even attracted the attention of mainstream academics. But the implications behind this fundamental discovery never seemed to appear in Hawkins’ work; he thought that the main purpose behind the Circlemakers’ designs was that they were trying to illustrate these geometric theorems simply to draw interest and get us to \"solve\" the puzzles. On the surface this looks good, as by showing us a simple mathematical system of geometry and music that we did not yet understand, \"their\" higher intelligence is displayed. But why would they waste so much energy just making theorems for a few obscure mathematicians to decode? Indeed, the idea that they are simply theorems doesn’t quite seem to be enough; the theorems must be there to show us something that is much more fundamental, a form of universal law. These Circlemakers would obviously want to create information that would have a very practical use, given the universal emphasis that Hawkins demonstrates that they have received in the mysterious crop circle portfolio. To anyone who doubts that repeated examples of \"consciousness units\" in the crops exist, please visit www.cropcircleconnector.com, and check the photo archives therein. Or, any other source that shows pictures of crop circles will do equally well, as literally almost every formation attempts to convey the same basic information. So, what the Circlemakers actually were doing was showing us a simple sketch of the architecture of the universe, as we have now been exploring it. The 2D geometries of circles and triangles quite naturally can be expanded into 3D spheres and tetrahedra. As Fuller demonstrated with his vibrating ink- filled balloon and Jenny demonstrated with a simple solution in water, the musical and geometric ratios of the octave are still preserved when we blow out our diagrams to 3D. Thus, most of the flat crop circle diagrams that show these basic shapes are simply blueprints for designs that are obviously much more complicated to render; designs that are drawn to indicate three dimensions. And since we visualize these crystalline geometric energies as three-dimensional shapes, there should be an example where the Circlemakers did in fact try to render an accurate picture of a “consciousness unit” such as a tetrahedron within a sphere. Miraculously, there is such a rendering, and this formation still stands as one of the most fantastic ever to be impressed into the English countryside. This image has stirred up massive amounts of interest and research, including that of Joe Mason, the researcher who first introduced the author of this book to the “Breath of the Divine” and Consciousness Units. From all of the evidence, we will show that although the American media and metaphysical / UFO community has largely turned a blind eye to the entire phenomenon, there is"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"much, much more to it than a series of successive hoaxes. THE REAL STORY OF THE CROP CIRCLES In the movie Contact, which many of us have seen, satellite engineers who were looking for messages from the Beyond tuned in to a radio frequency that was being beamed out from the star Vega. Once decoding the signal, it first provided personal information about us; namely our first televised broadcast, which happened to be from Nazi Germany. The alien signal then proceeded to give a complex series of blueprints. The scientists puzzled and pored over this information for a long time, and could not figure out what it meant. It was only when the cigar-chomping billionaire in the movie realized that the flat blueprints needed to be expanded into three dimensions that the meaning suddenly popped into place - in this case a cubical matrix of specific images. Ultimately, humanity was given a tool that would allow our civilization to have access to these unseen realms where the Vegans lived. The three-dimensional cube of images provided blueprints for a concretely physical piece of technology – a giant set of spinning rings that created a spherical ball of light in their center, which then opened up a wormhole through space and time. Carl Sagan was obviously tapping into the collective unconscious when he first wrote his book about this fictional SETI discovery, which the movie was based on. However, we don't need SETI at all; the Extraterrestrials are already here on Earth, and we have already been given the blueprints that the movie refers to. Furthermore, there are uncanny parallels between Sagan’s machine that the Vegans designed and the way in which we might expect a giant “consciousness unit” to look; a giant, wildly pulsating sphere where lines can be made out inside. The pod itself in the movie was a sphere with a dodecahedron superimposed over it - the actual geometry of the sixth dimension. Perhaps Sagan and the makers of the movie were aware of more than they outwardly alluded to, and there is evidence from Dr. Richard Boylan that Sagan was on a \"black-ops\" scientific team and payroll. The more we think about it, the more it all fits together. In Contact, this giant machine was the entryway into something that was surprisingly similar to what we might expect Ascension to be like; a dramatic shift to a different frequency of energy, and a heavenlike new world emerging. So, Sagan's work falls perfectly in line with the idea of obtaining information from the Collective Unconscious; many science fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke have inadvertently predicted future events and technologies. So, just as Contact postulated a set of diagrams and blueprints from extraterrestrials, the crop circle phenomenon gives us the same thing in true reality. Indeed, it has been going on continuously in Europe since at least 1976. What we now have is a huge library of cryptic visual images that do not appear to have been solely generated by humans. The case is similar to the rediscovery of Egyptian hieroglyphics; scientists knew they had to mean something, but they were at a loss to crack the code until the discovery of the infamous Rosetta Stone. This clay document showed a set of identical writings in Greek, Aramaic and in hieroglyphics, and since the researchers understood the Greek, they were able to decode the hieroglyphs. The Rosetta stone for crop circles is geometry, mathematics, symbol and metaphor. The American and European corporate media very carefully indoctrinated us"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"with the belief that these magnificent designs were the work of Doug and Dave: “two portly English gentlemen, a few pints of beer, a funny cap, and a string and board”. According to the legend, these delightfully mischievous old chaps took great pleasure in taking time off from work, getting trashed all night and sneaking out to farms all across the English countryside. In their mirthful stupor, with the ingenuous tactic of wooden planks for shoes and long strings for a giant compass of sorts, they joyfully stumbled about, stamping down fantastic geometric shapes overnight, occasionally doubling over in laughter at their cleverness. Their portfolio includes perfectly executed depictions of fractal mathematical equations such as the Mandlebrot Set, the Julia Set and the Koch Snowflake. They would plan the next fractal over the stench of thick brown beer, as toothless mouths excitedly spouted new ways to display advanced theoretical mathematics graphically. How, then, does the debunking media explain that this also has happened literally all over the planet? India alone recently announced the appearance and cataloging of some 10,000 crop formations since the 1970’s, and circles have appeared in almost every major country on the globe, whether in rice paddies, grain crops, mud, dry lake beds or even ice. In the \"Awakening to Zero Point\" videotape, Gregg Braden shows an image of a spiral formation that actually emerged in an underwater sandbar. Despite all of these appearances, there are literally only a handful of American websites that are fully authorized to display these images, and all we have from India as of Feb. 98 are line drawings of three formations. The astounding complexity of the most recent batch of formations from summer 1997, 98 and 99 defies even the most hardened scientific minds from explaining them away. The old-fashioned explanations of “localized plasma vortices” or “an army of hedgehogs running round and round” simply do not hold weight. In most true crop circles, the stems are usually bent at the growth nodes, not broken, and they exhibit measurable radiation and signs of being heated. This has led most serious crop circle researchers to conclude that they were formed by some sort of microwave radiation that cooked the joints. This cooking turns the water in the crop into steam, which causes the growth nodes to become pliable and bend. (Hessemann, 1996 and others.) Indeed, seeds and plant fragments are often found that look as though they have been burned in a microwave oven. But how could you possibly use heat on something like dry grass and expect it not to torch up on you? Interestingly enough, large amounts of nearby underground water have been known to spontaneously disappear after a circle is formed. This fact has been confirmed through the use of infrared photography by the crop circle researchers. It certainly appears that the water was being drawn out of the land to keep the fragile crops from burning. No known microwave technology exists that could be beamed and executed with such precision, forming beautiful patterns, while simultaneously drawing upon underground water as a coolant (CCC website.) Desperately grasping for a more comfortable solution to these radiation mysteries than the notion of extraterrestrials or some similar outside intelligence, we could propose a top-secret government project. This would mean that someone is obviously making a tremendously secret effort to get us to decode these shapes; yet all documented covert government involvement seems geared towards discrediting and / or hoaxing the phenomenon. This can be seen in the total denial in American media that this"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"is happening at all, even in the many X-Files-type television programs and documentaries, as we previously mentioned. It is as though one of the most fantastic communications from the realm of the spiritual forces has completely left Americans in the dust, through their apathy and simple belief in what they are told by the authority figures in the media. It goes without saying that numerous crop circle formations have been directly correlated with phenomena such as UFO sightings and dogs going crazy the night before. Thus, they do not simply “show up;” the evidence points to the fact that outside forces are involved. It would appear that the natural tendency would be for the UFO cover-up to continue, and it is amazing how well of a job \"they\" are doing. Even legitimate UFO researchers with great interest in the field have often turned deaf ears to the discoveries from the crop circle camp. Furthermore, since the crop circle researchers have strict copyrights and controls on any outside display of their pictures, very few people have actually seen what is going on out there with any serious level of redundancy. Furthermore, there are clear indications that someone is handsomely paying people such as our drunk and friendly English gentlemen Doug and Dave to lie. Every year there are a greater number of sophomoric, manmade crop circles in an attempt to make the entire phenomenon appear to be fabricated. Even some well-versed metaphysical friends of this author have hissed, \"Ah, it's a bunch of college kids\" when presented with the topic. Doug and Dave were cut to pieces in interviews where they were asked how they duplicated various forms, openly admitting that they were not responsible. The fake crop circles can usually be spotted almost immediately upon first glance, as they generally lack the sharp edges and incredible mathematical perfection of the true formations. There are other, more scientific ways to spot a \"real\" formation as well, which we shall discuss in a moment. We therefore should not run from an unsolved puzzle that appears to be coming from an outside intelligence. Historically speaking, the crop circle phenomena have just gotten better and better every year. They started in the late 70’s and early 80’s as nothing more than gigantic, perfectly round circle shapes. Then, in the mid-1980’s, “agriglyphs” began appearing, which were straight-line formations that connected two or three circles together in various designs. The formation we will be discussing, Barbury Castle 1991, was one of the first major departures from these agriglyphs; it ushered in an entirely new era of complexity in the formations. This was the Mother of All Crop Circles: a formation that appeared literally overnight, and was of fantastic size - 31,680 square feet."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" The impeccable quality of this image clearly illustrated that it was really meant to catch our attention. One of the first things noticed was that the square footage of the object, 31680, was the number given in the Bible for the size dimensions of the New Jerusalem. John Michell writes about this in great detail in his books. The New Jerusalem was written of as being the city that represented the “Golden Age” to come after the return of the Messiah; and the number 31680 was intended to be profoundly symbolic, indicating a dimensional shift, if you will, into a whole new kingdom that was much closer to Divine Light. The number 31680 appears in another form directly related to the New Jerusalem, and that is in the harmonic, vibrational science of gematria that we had mentioned. If you vibrate air at 3168 times per second, you will create a musical tone, and therefore the number can be directly transposed into a dimensional \"energy density\" in our harmonic aether system as well. Early Church fathers working with these sacred numbers declared the number 3168 to be the number of Jesus Christ. Thus, by removing the zero from 31680 to get its harmonic equivalent in 3168, which can be done in the base-ten counting system, we have another allusion to a Messianic message of some sort, plus a flagging of the same \"harmonic numbers\" we have mentioned here before."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"And so, with the exact footage corresponding to the number for Jesus Christ, the coded message in the formation might very well be “The messianic revival of the Christ, ushering in the New Jerusalem, the age of heaven on earth.” This starts to make even more sense when we discover that the combined area of the three circles on the outside of the diagram have the exact same area as the inner circle. This gives us a further meaning, which could be seen as “Three in One.” According to Joe Mason among others, this appears to be an allusion to the view of Creation held in Christianity as the Trinity, in Egypt as Osiris / Isis / Seth, and in many other similar world mythologies including Buddhism. The Gnostic Christian diagram shown here clearly indicates that the concept of the Trinity was directly associated with a tetrahedral \"frequency object\" that Jesus was pictured as holding in his hands. The metaphor was further strengthened by the fact that he was given three faces. These three faces hold remarkable similarity to Hindu and Buddhist designs. So what exactly is this trinity, anyway, and why did the Gnostics want to associate it with the hyperdimensional geometry that we have been investigating? This ‘three in One’ concept quite literally means that from the One springs the Two, duality, such as male and female, yin and yang, light and dark, et cetera, which then generates the Three, expressed as the beginning of life and matter. More simply, according to mythology historian Joseph Campbell, this triple design would represent the archetypal idea of the Father, the Mother, and the androgynous son. These three principles are the fundamental archetypes that make up all of our personalities, the Father being the active principle, the Mother being the intuitive principle, and the Son being the fusion of these elements into the life experience. [The Holy Sprit is not generally referred to as a mother “god” in Christianity, but great evidence supports the fact that this is the archetype.] These could also be seen as the three syllables in the Hindu AUM, the word"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"intended to convey the total nature of Creation as a sound vibration; the A being the Father, U being the Mother, and M being the Mahem, man, or Son. It is outside of the present scope of this book to delve further into this particular discussion at this point, but Joe Mason has written numerous articles on these topics, and his knowledge on the subject certainly piqued and expanded the author’s interest. Mason's writings are on his and Dolores Finney's website, www.greatdreams.com. So far, we have a message that could be taken to be very Christian in origin, with the Messianic revival, the New Jerusalem and the Trinity or Three-in-One; but we also have the harmonic geometry of the next dimension above our own, which it appears that we are now moving into. From Joe Mason, we get another point regarding this symbol that is not usually discussed. It now appears that the exact day when it was formed was intended to convey powerful symbolic meaning as well. Genesis 8:4 describes the Ark of the Covenant as appearing on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. Interestingly, it was on July 17th that this all-important formation appeared! Therefore, through careful timing it seems that someone wants us to view this all-important symbol as the Ark. So what exactly is the Ark of the Covenant, you ask? In the Bible it is referred to as a coffin-shaped golden object that possessed tremendous power for those who knew how to harness it. Many authors have speculated that it was a technological device from an extraterrestrial civilization, possibly using radiation as a source of power. This device could produce fabulous power to those who knew how to use it, but it also could cause great harm. According to Bible legends, no one was able to touch the Ark without suffering a fate that reads very much like electrocution. Therefore, the symbolism of the Ark in this formation could refer to the fact that the diagram has some sort of universal secrets contained within it. The Ark therefore has vast symbolic importance in Christian myth, representing the mysterious forces of God being harnessed into manifestation. Our original point of entry into the discussion of the tetrahedral shape in Jesus' hands is how it pertains to our EE units as given by Seth in previous chapters here. These EE or consciousness units are also the same as the basic geometric shapes being placed within the sphere. Our discussion gets much more interesting as we begin looking at the Barbury shape itself, and start to notice what it is only slightly hiding from view."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Here we can see that by gradually clipping out different sections, this image clearly outlines the shape of a four-sided pyramid, or a tetrahedron. Mathematically, this is the simplest three-dimensional shape that can be made. As we have shown, the tetrahedron is the organizing energy that forms the fourth dimension, which we now appear to be heading into. We can then begin to understand why Jesus was shown with a tetrahedron in his hands;"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Jesus could see the fourth-density energy that forms the Kingdom of the Father. The other, even more obvious form of this geometric knowledge expressed in the Hebrew tradition is the Star of David. This religious symbol is rendered just like a crop circle, where we have a two-dimensional image that perfectly details the appearance of the interlocked, or star tetrahedron, within a sphere. The interlocked tetrahedron is an even more accurate depiction of the actual “appearance” of Fourth Density energy. Remember that in order for these dimensions to be navigable by entities such as ourselves, there has to be a simple and perfect order to everything. This explains why in Seth’s readings it said, “We created these cubes to be used as guides.” In short, through this geometric ordering, you can actually see the energy that you are working with. It appears that this was part of the plan that the One Mind of God originally had for us. Thus, the tetrahedron, with all of its symbolic trimmings, illustrates the fourth dimension as being the “Kingdom of the Father” that was promised in the Bible as coming to replace the current \"heaven and earth\" that we have right now. Though we may never actually “see” this form in the physical plane, the foundation structure of all physical matter has already been “upgrading” to this frequency in the 20th century. As Ra often indicated, it is only the diehard three-dimensionality of so many humans on Earth that stops our physical environment from already being transformed. As one final note for this chapter, we can point out that the design itself was showing us a dimensional cosmology. If you look back to the photograph, you will see three circles at the corners of the tetrahedron. The first circle has nothing within it but a line extending out to its center point. This would symbolically illustrate the first dimension, or the point, or the Oneness. The second circle has a series of spiraling lines, indicating the \"fanning-out\" of the point into two dimensions. This is the point where motion is introduced, and the basic framework of vibration for physical existence is first created, as we have already indicated in previous chapters. Then, our glyph for the third dimension is quadrilateral in nature. What it depicts is the top half of an octahedron, shown in the spiraling, spherical form of its energies, and we have already seen that the octahedron should represent the third density or dimension in the Hindu geometric cosmology. If we were to make a paper cutout of this form and pull it up from the circle in the center, we could certainly see the three-dimensionality of this shape. And here, we have an image that shows exactly how this would work- the \"hidden\" shape pops out as though it was always meant to have been there."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" So, what we have in the outer circles is a geometric progression of the first, second and third dimensions, illustrated for us in a field of wheat. The fourth dimension is the focal point of the entire formation, represented by the tetrahedron within the sphere in the center. The fact that the three outer circles all add up to the inner circle must also indicate that this fourth dimension is the summation of all that had occurred before it. It is also interesting to point out that the crop was extremely green when this formation was made, indicating the passage to the green-ray vibrational level of the fourth dimension. More recent formations have dramatically indicated even higher-dimensional geometries such as the cube within a sphere, such as in this immensely satisfying photograph from Steve Alexander. This is the naked truth of our physics model displayed to the world, spheres within spheres and Platonic Solid geometry, including the depiction of a central axis for the spherical torus, for “those who have eyes to see.” In the next image, also from 1999, we can see that we were given the idea of the third-density octahedron being \"unwrapped.\" Some have told us not to use"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"this image, as there were signs that it was a hoax, but nevertheless we include it for your consideration: The next image is of the \"Triple Julia Set\" formation from 1996, represented by the circles, supplemented with a series of straight lines and a spherical globe around the outside. By adding in these extra lines, we can perceive the intended hidden message very easily - a pulsating tetrahedron, emerging from a center point and ratcheting outward. We also see how the curving lines of the formation itself correspond to the lines seen in the previous image from Dr. Hans Jenny's research with sound frequencies in water. These curving lines should be visualized as though they were outward-curling flower petals originating in the center of the diagram: Crop circle diagram by Ed and Kris Sherwood, with permission, with added outer sphere."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"So with formations such as Barbury Castle and others, we have seen different hyperdimensional geometries emerging, including tetrahedra within spheres. Richard Hoagland and his team, then known as the Mars Mission, turned their attention towards these formations for that very reason, as they had found the tetrahedron in their own way- namely, encoded into geometric ruins that they found in Viking photographs from Mars."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 08: RICHARD HOAGLAND AND THE MESSAGE OF CYDONIA In this chapter we go in very specifically to look at the life and research of controversial frontier scientist Richard Hoagland. We take a brief look at the case for there having been a lost civilization on the planet Mars, building pyramidal structures as well as a gigantic edifice carved into the shape of a human face. Most significantly, we explore how Hoagland's team showed that this entire \"City\" complex of formations reveal all of the basic mathematical principles of the fourth-dimensional phase of the CU - namely, a tetrahedron within a sphere. We can then see how this knowledge of the physics of the CU is not confined to Earth civilizations. CHAPTER 08: RICHARD HOAGLAND AND THE \"MESSAGE OF CYDONIA\" As any reader can discern from Wilcock's personal data, a profound and life- changing event occurred when he was a sophomore in college, during the year 1993. David had a friend who was told by his physics professor, in no uncertain terms, that UFOs were real and that we had reverse-engineered their technology. Some of the data and details were similar to the material that was later released by Colonel Phillip Corso in 1997, in the book The Day After Roswell. Corso's book, which also discusses reverse-engineered ET technology, provided an excellent validation of the facts that David had initially received. David was deeply and permanently transformed by receiving this information. He decided that the only possible choice he had was to devote his entire life to understanding and explaining this phenomena, as nothing else could possibly be more important. This personal transformation took place over a few weeks, as he walked around and interacted in daily college life. With the new knowledge of the reality of the UFO phenomenon, everything was changed forever, in an irreversible manner. There was no going back to the way he had looked at the world before; it was a complete \"paradigm shift.\" The weight of evidence threatened to burst forth from him wherever he went. The people around him now seemed like puppets in a gigantic, cosmic shell game, manipulated by an invisible hand they would never see, much less even imagine. The world governments were jealously guarding the greatest revelation in the history of humanity as college students sucked on \"cancer sticks\" in the Food Court. When he tried to tell them what was going on, their emotions ranged everywhere from terror to ecstasy to rage. One person even asked him with deadpan seriousness if he was a member of a cult. Obviously, he tended to favor those whose reactions were ecstatic. A few months after the initial discovery, the same friend again visited David, only this time the information added fantastic new dimensions to what had already been said. David's beliefs had already stretched quite a bit in order to allow the reality of extraterrestrial life to sink in, so he was very eager to learn more. This new era of revelation came when his friend was given a copy"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"of the Richard Hoagland / Mars Mission Briefing to the United Nations in 1992 as a gift from his grandmother. This videotape was a complete summary of the research being done by Hoagland's team, then known as the Mars Mission, regarding \"The Monuments of Mars\" or \"The Martian Enigmas.\" It was a videotape of a live presentation given directly to the United Nations on their own turf- so obviously, this information was attracting some attention. By now, most people are aware that an enigma of sorts exists. The Mariner 1 probe photographed unmistakable tetrahedral pyramidlike forms back in 1971, referred to as the Elysium Pyramids. This in turn spurred research at SRI International with remote viewing, involving JJ Hurtak, Ingo Swann and others. This was the very first phase of consciousness-related work that suggested that a civilization had been there. This work was later included and enhanced in Hurtak's epic work Keys of Enoch, which pre-empted Robert Bauval's discovery of the Orion-Giza connection by more than fifteen years. Then, in 1976, the Viking Orbiter 1 satellite was photographing of the Martian surface, and on the thirty-fifth pass over the lunar surface, frame 35A76, the apparent visage of a human face stares up blankly from the surrounding desert. From what little can be made out in the unenhanced original, it appears to be a giant formation of rock, hardened lava or sand in some form or another. The NASA scientists at the time dismissed it out of hand, and did not prioritize any further time with the Viking probe to photograph it before the probe \"died\", running out of its limited fuel supply. They simply could not accept that it was anything other than a curious and unimportant Martian feature. The \"face\" image would lie uninvestigated for years as situations developed that would eventually bring the reality of its existence to the masses. True, NASA did release fuzzy photographs of it early along, and David remembered seeing it in copies of Odyssey Magazine, an astronomy journal for young people, when he was in second grade. He remembers being completely shocked the first time he saw it, and felt that there was some fantastic truth out there waiting to be discovered. Richard Hoagland fulfilled this task, and may well be the single most important historical figure in alerting the public to these enigmas. In 1965, at the age of only nineteen, when most young people were still chasing after the opposite sex and enjoying their newfound freedom to drink beer legally, Hoagland became curator of the Springfield, Massachusetts Museum of Science. Obviously Hoagland was a \"boy genius\" of astronomy to have secured a job like this at his age. His creativity and desire to \"think big\" led him to design and produce a giant commemorative event for Mariner 4's flyby of Mars - the first time that our species had sent a probe to another planet in the Solar System. He had an audience of 2000 people at the museum, and 5000 more press and scientists watching at JPL in Pasadena, California. Clearly this was no small feat for a man at an age where most people are lacking in self-confidence or knowledge of what they really plan on doing with their lives. Then, when Hoagland was only 20, he served as a consultant to NBC regarding the first soft-landing of a human-built probe on the lunar surface. Subsequent opportunities emerged, leading to a spot on The Tonight Show among other things. This is the obvious reason for why Hoagland did not"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"pursue \"higher education;\" he was already at the cutting edge. Then, in 1968, after another \"good move\" in Hoagland's career by becoming Assistant Director of Gengras Science Center and Planetarium in West Hartford, CT, Walter Cronkite took him in as a consultant to CBS News. This gave him the unique position of explaining the science behind the Apollo missions to the American public at age 22. By 1971, he had been involved in several other prestigious efforts, and with Eric Burgess, he designed the famous engraved plaque designed to tell other species of intelligent life what we look like and where we live. Carl Sagan was able to make it happen and get it mounted on Voyager, and acknowledged their effort in the academic journal Science. Then, according to his introduction in Monuments of Mars, \"Since 1971 Hoagland has held a number of editorial, managerial, and consulting positions in the space-science world.\" In the January 1980 issue of Star & Sky, Hoagland set forth his \"Europa Proposal,\" where he cited evidence of water ice on Europa as leading towards what editor Terry Dickinson called \"The first new plausible location for life in the Solar System in ten years.\" Then, in 1981, Hoagland went to a conference in Boulder, Colorado, and there he met Vincent DiPietro and Greg Molenaar. DiPietro is the one who needs to take the claim of being the first to actually devote serious attention and intellectual study to the Face on Mars. His career is as an electrical engineer, focused in digital electronics and image processing. He had first seen the Face in a magazine of \"extraterrestrial archeology\" and promptly dismissed it as a hoax. It would take two and a half more years before he would again come across the photograph while he was searching through the NASA archives of the Viking images. Soon Greg Molenaar was also brought in on the game, equally fascinated by this enigmatic object staring up from the picture frame. Molenaar is a computer scientist with a similar background as DiPietro, and they were both good friends and colleagues by this point. Together, they strove to improve the resolution of the Martian face image, and this eventually led them to design a pixel-by-pixel image enhancing process called \"Starburst Pixel Interleaving Technique\" or SPIT. This technique paved the way for their realization that the Face was indeed symmetrical; the SPIT processing brought out details on the shadowed side of the photograph that would otherwise be impossible to see. Later they would discover an additional frame of interest, 70A13. This provided them with more detail that was vital to their investigation. Among other things, 70A13 directly paved the way to the discovery of a gigantic five- sided pyramidal object that was situated in very close proximity to the Face, a mere ten miles to the southwest. This object was later dubbed the \"D&M Pyramid\" in their honor. The SPIT processing showed that this object was of fantastic interest, almost certainly artificial due to its amazing geometric structure."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Furthermore, they became aware of a large Egyptian-style pyramidal object that was also approximately ten miles due west of the Face. This sharp-edged, symmetrical pyramid also was surrounded by a host of other roughly pyramidal mounds gathered closely together, and hence the whole area was named \"The City.\" The appearance of this one particular enigmatic object on the Martian sands is literally identical to aerial photographs of the Great Pyramid. In the following image, Hoagland's team included the arrow on the original to indicate how the Face would have been viewed from a series of four mounds in the center of the city itself. The gigantic pyramid cannot be missed, directly above the arrow, flanked by what appear to be two significantly smaller pyramids, one to its western corner and one to its northwestern corner. Other enigmatic formations including \"The Fort,\" to the east of the giant pyramid, can be seen as well, and it is possible that the entire area is a series of pyramids, most obscured by sand buildup."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The most recent NASA photographs have only increased the resolution of this area, but this was never even discussed in the mainstream media with any seriousness until 2000, with the release of the Mission to Mars film from the Disney corporation. Although Hoagland was presented with this material in 1981, he took no further action upon it until 1983. (Keep in mind that by this point, the Ra contact had already ended and questioner Don Elkins would soon die. Nevertheless, we will see how Ra spoke of this ancient Martian civilization later in our discussion.) This polite refusal to pay attention was the typical reaction from the scientific community, which stymied any effort made to get this material out to the public. Hoagland eventually got back in touch with DiPietro and Molenaar as a direct result of his own work on \"The Thing in Saturn's Rings,\" a large object that emitted very high levels of radio frequency for no apparent reason. As he refined his search, Hoagland was attracted to the edge of the rings, where he could barely make out a series of small satellites, or objects, which might provide a further clue to the mystery. (It is good to note here that after Hoagland dropped the ball on the \"Thing in the Rings,\" Richard Boylan, Ph.D., [who strongly suggests that it is an extraterrestrial spacecraft of some sort, due to its erratic maneuvers and enigmatic properties,] picked it back up.) Hoagland was interested in DiPietro and Molenaar for their knowledge of image enhancement. He wanted them to process the images of the enigmas in Saturn's rings, but his agenda would soon change. The researchers mailed him much more recent, updated versions of the photographs and their analyses, and while he studied them at home, it finally hit him with the arresting force of a planetary collision. Says Hoagland in Monuments:"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"I realized that I was looking at something that was either a complete waste of time, or the most important discovery of the twentieth century if not of our entire existence on Earth. Hoagland quickly took DiPietro and Molenaar on board and formed \"The Mars Mission.\" This was not to say that it was easy for Hoagland to acclimate to the possible reality of this data; in his own words, he was \"dragged kicking and screaming\" to the truth of such an incredible postulate. But slowly and gradually, the pieces started fitting together. Hoagland himself made important contributions to the data, including the discovery of the \"Fort,\" situated directly northeast of the Egyptian-styled pyramid and \"City\" as we have just shown. It is quite clear to see that the \"Fort\" is a highly geometric object in the image. It looks exactly like two adjoining sides of a square building with a center courtyard, connected together at a near-perfect 90-degree angle. More recent photographs have indicated that what appeared to be a courtyard is actually an upward-slanting mound that cast a shadow, but even in the new images the clear geometry of this formation can be seen. Furthermore, the placement and positioning of the \"Fort\" makes it a prime piece of real estate to directly observe the Face from one edge and the five-sided D&M Pyramid from the other. Hoagland continued to make discoveries, including the fact that the Face was positioned with a great deal of ritual significance. The sunrise on the Equinox would occur directly behind the Face, and a mound of earth many miles to the east of the Face seemed to serve as a means to deflect glare and make this Sunrise even more sudden and powerful to behold. In short, all the pieces were fitting together that suggested that this was a lot more than just a bunch of \"stuff.\" It was, for all intents and purposes, a stunning looking glass into a mysterious and unknown past, on a planet in our Solar System that was not \"supposed\" to have life on it. Another \"multidimensional shift\" in progress would come in 1988 with the addition of Erol Torun to the Mars Mission. Torun was an expert cartographer from the United States' own Defense Mapping Agency. Torun's job was to insure that he could tell the difference between a sand dune and a camouflaged enemy bunker. The best way to determine if an object was artificial was by applying fractal mathematics to the image, and Torun was an expert in just that. Using fractals, Torun could measure the degree of irregularity and change present within any object in a landscape. An artificial object would receive a much higher \"score\" than a natural one, due to the degree of sudden changes present within it. Torun soon discerned that the Face and City areas were by far the most highly fractalized, or random, areas of the entire vicinity. Torun's work proved of inestimable value to the mission. He was the first to \"orthographically rectify\" the Viking images. What this means to the lay person is that Torun applied his exacting scientific protocols to turn the frames in question into maps, with precision coordinates properly aligned North to South. This presented everyone involved in the investigation with an opportunity to make exacting measurements of the placement of different objects in the Cydonia region. But nothing could prepare them for the discoveries they would soon make."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Within a very short time, the evidence mounted to indicate that one of the main functions of this City was to give an encoded, geometric \"message\" to its future discoverers. As is explained in great detail in Monuments of Mars, as well as Hoagland's site, www.enterprisemission.com, the brunt of this message centered around the ratio of two fundamental mathematical constants; namely \"e\" and \"pi.\" The constant \"e\" comes from the study of exponents in trigonometry; it is a value that preserves symmetry in calculations where using exponents to a power of 10 would disturb it. We already know that \"pi\" represents the circumference of a circle when its diameter is a unit of 1. In the Martian city, there is a repeated suggestion to mathematically divide these two values together. The \"e/pi ratio,\" when expressed as a numerical value, comes out to approximately 0.865. With almost ceaseless repetition, pairs of adjoining measurements in Cydonia would have this same exact ratio between them. The most common of all was the angle relationship of 22.5 degrees to 19.5 degrees. Without much delay, the Mars Mission team realized that these angles and ratios were demonstrating something much larger than they could have ever imagined. They seemed to illustrate, in Hoagland's words, ...\"the fabric of Reality\" - how Matter, Time and Energy are woven into the tapestry of Everything... from stars... to planets... to atoms... to living systems... to Intelligence itself.... \"Cydonia\" turns out to be \"\"nothing less than an architectural affirmation of the fundamental physics of the Universe - the ultimate embodiment of a grand, \"universal Architecture\"... at the most archetypal level. The reason behind Hoagland's sweeping statements is the following: the Cydonia Investigation has now found multiple examples of The Message of Cydonia - identically \"coded\" elsewhere in the Solar System... including, here on Earth! What the \"Message of Cydonia\" reveals, which Hoagland discusses above, is the fundamental, multidimensional nature of - you guessed it - the consciousness unit. We had said that the consciousness unit's fundamental existence is expressed as a sphere that pulsates through the differing Platonic Solids as it \"breathes.\" The next dimension above our own is home to the simplest shape of all, which Plato associated with the element of fire - namely, the tetrahedron. And, it is a statement of fact that Hoagland's team discovered the unmistakable mathematical signatures of a circumscribed tetrahedron - a tetrahedron placed within a sphere. As we will show in later chapters, they found striking evidence of this energetic configuration in many of the bodies in our Solar System. Then, the plot really thickened when the same mathematical figure was seen as being expressed in an enigmatic formation in a modern-day crop of wheat. Hoagland’s team took the Barbury Castle crop formation discussed in the last chapter and discovered literally identical mathematics as those of the circumscribed tetrahedron. For example, the three rings in the center gave all the proper angle measurements to indicate that they represent a sphere. This was done by comparing the angle of each ring against the vertical circular line"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"that would define the sphere [see diagram.] When coupled with the plainly visible tetrahedron, it becomes immediately apparent that we are seeing a precise mathematical depiction of one of our “consciousness units.” [Note: The lines that gave Hoagland the 19.5 and 49.6- degree values in the picture were from where the tetrahedron shape itself crossed through the rings.] So what we see is an outside force drawing us a geometrically precise map of an energy field that covers everything from protons to planets. At this point, the truth behind this law of the Universe is becoming more and more crystal clear. There are many different sources coming together, and they are all trying to give us the same information. In Hoagland's book The Monuments of Mars, great detail is given to the precise analysis of these geometric relationships in the city, and it is strongly recommended for anyone pursuing further studies on this issue. In the next chapter we will explore another researcher's completely different and remarkable mapping of these energies on the physical sphere."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 09: THE CATHIE GRID This chapter explores the work of Bruce Cathie, which illustrates how the observed flight paths of UFOs reveal that they are following a \"Grid\" over the earth, shaped in the form of a cube and octahedron- two of the seven fundamental geometric phases of the CU, representing the third and fifth dimension. We go into great depth to explore the significant harmonic mathematical discoveries that Cathie has made from the study of this grid, including his most stellar achievement of all: Cathie solves the Unified Field paradox of modern physics, revealing that all of the Creation is simply a function of Light. We also take excerpts from the Ra Material to help develop these ideas concerning the expanding and contracting CU in their \"cosmic context.\" CHAPTER 09: THE CATHIE GRID The modern scientific history of the Global Grid starts with the work of a researcher named Bruce Cathie. Though he is not commonly known in UFOlogical circles, his work is of paramount importance. Cathie writes about very complicated mathematical ideas as though they were as simple as grade-school arithmetic, then humbly insisting that he \"isn't a scientist or mathematician.\" In the midst of this complexity, his work is utterly brilliant, but it leaves all but the most fastidious readers in the dust. So, in this chapter we will look at how this man and his theories fit in to our overall discussion, which is the Great Cycle and how it relates to the dimensions and consciousness units as we know them. Cathie grew up in New Zealand, which is situated “Down Under,” near Australia. He was working in the military when he had the first of a series of UFO sightings. For obvious reasons, he became very highly interested in the fact that he was seeing these craft in clear sight, and wanted to know more about them. Being on a large ship at sea, he was able to quite clearly see for a long distance around him, and it was over time that he began to notice that there was a seeming regularity to the flight path of the UFOs. This regularity fascinated him, so Cathie decided to pursue as much knowledge of it as he could uncover. He carefully investigated different people’s sightings and tried to figure out which way the UFOs had been going. Over time, he realized that there was, indeed, a pattern present; it appeared that the UFOs were following certain specific straight-line paths that were always the same. The pursuit of this data later led him to the work of French researcher Aime Michel, who had been studying UFOs for many years and had determined some of the standard flight paths that they would follow in various parts of Europe. UFO sightings would occur time and time again along these \"tracklines,\" and Michel determined that the average distance between these lines was 54.46 kilometers. When converting this over to nautical miles, Cathie discovered to his own surprise that the tracklines were exactly 30 nautical miles apart. Again, 30 is a fundamental \"harmonic\" or frequency number. If this doesn't seem important, or appears nothing more than a coincidence, it"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"is important to remember that a \"nautical mile\" is exactly one minute of arc on the Earth's surface. Sixty minutes of arc, or sixty nautical miles, would then equal one degree of arc, and as everyone knows there are a total of 360 degrees in any circular or spherical body. Since the Earth itself once may have had a 360-day year, and Hoagland's team demonstrated this same degree measurement system used on Mars, it is safe to at least assume the ubiquity of the use of 360 degrees for a circle. We know that 360 is one of the most fundamental \"frequency numbers\" in the Universe, and its derivation may have been a direct result of the observations that could be made surrounding its natural existence on the Global Energy Grid. Again, this is speculation, however let's look at a few facts. First of all, in future chapters we will take a look at Carl Munck's work, known as \"archeocryptology.\" This work unquestionably demonstrates that the Ancients were using a 360-degree system when building their monuments on Earth. Hoagland's team discovered that the distance between the \"Face\" and the \"D&M Pyramid\" amounts to precisely 1/360th of the pole-to-pole diameter of Mars. This discovery led to many other stunning breakthroughs that would only come about in a 360-degree based system. In Part Three of this book, we will point out the fact that the Earth year seems to be a key timekeeper in the Solar System, locking in and describing many other cycles. In the case of Cathie's discoveries, we find that the lines of magnetic force that made up the Global Grid are always 30 arc-minutes apart. Based on this, we might wonder if it is not simply a system of maps that the UFOs are using to travel, but rather a visible system of energy lines. If this is true, the adaptation of 360 degrees to a planetary sphere may simply be an observation of the organization of its lines of force. This might also help to better explain why we have seen this number in so many other places as well. So, from Cathie's discoveries, we know that every half-degree of arc on the Earth's surface was a potential UFO trackline, for a total of 720 latitude lines and 720 longitude lines. Says Cathie: I found that by using units of 30 minutes of arc latitude north-south, and 30 minutes of arc longitude east-west, on my Mercator's map, a grid pattern was formed into which a great number of UFO reports could be fitted. I eventually had a map with sixteen stationary and seventeen moving UFOs plotted on grid intersections and tracklines. Having satisfied myself that my reasoning and plotting were not false, I considered that I had good proof that New Zealand, possibly other countries, and probably the whole world, were being systematically covered by some type of grid system. Thus, when one looks into the history and origin of Cathie’s work, that person invariably sees a map of New Zealand with a series of straight lines on it. That might prove as a stumbling block to Americans, simply because it has not been done over a map of New York State, for example. However, it is a suitable and definite system that Cathie was observing, made more interesting by its identical connection to the work of Aime Michel, the French UFO researcher who also discovered \"tracklines\" in Europe. The next major item of interest in Cathie’s work was an object that was photographed clear at the bottom of the sea, at a depth of 2,500 fathoms, or"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"13,500 feet, by the naval survey ship Eltanin. The object was located in an area 1,000 miles west of Cape Horn. What this ship photographed is what appears to be a large metal staff coming straight up out of the sea bed, with an ascending spiral of small bars coming off of it at right angles to the original. The image could be thought of as a series of crosses spiraling upwards. [See the image on next page.] The entire shape has a very obvious artificial, geometric design; the distance between each set of bars is the same, and the width of each set is the same. The seven bars strongly suggest a relation to Octave-based harmonics, with the smaller bars at the top completing the idea. Furthermore, the end of each"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"bar ends in a small sphere, as though it was intentionally polished into that shape. The officers of the Eltanin tried to insinuate that it was nothing more than a marine organism, but when Cathie pressed one of them on the topic, he admitted that it looked like a genuine artifact. Obviously, no one desired this knowledge to get out to the public, as it crossed into the lunatic fringe with such things as UFOs and pyramids. But Cathie was determined not to let this one slip by; instead, he saw it as an object of great importance. It would later become a crucial piece of evidence in discovering the map of the Global Grid. Obviously, in Cathie’s time there was no submarine that could possibly have gone clearly to the bottom of the entire ocean, below the point where the continental shelf drops off. This object was obviously fashioned by some sort of intelligence, and Cathie himself had seen and heard reports of UFOs that would fly directly into the water. He also had a sighting of a UFO that fired a glowing, rodlike \"object\" into the ocean. This object did not glide forward on its descending path in an arc as you would expect, but rather followed a precise straight-line path, apparently violating the natural laws of acceleration that should affect a body in free-fall when it has an initial velocity at the time that it was released. This led Cathie to believe that the UFO had precisely aimed the object to land on the sea floor at a distinct point, and that the object could very well be the same as the one that he had seen a photograph of. Thus, he concluded that the photograph from the Eltanin showed an object with all the hallmarks of intelligent design of one form or another, and most likely not of humankind. The next thing that caught Cathie’s attention was that the object itself appeared to be fashioned like an antenna, as though energy of some sort was going through it. This was further supported by the idea that the direction of each bar could correspond to a direction of energy; each bar seemed to be approximately 20 degrees offset from the one beneath it. So, Cathie thought all of this through, and realized that there had to be some kind of a connection to the UFOs he was seeing that seemed to effortlessly travel under the sea as well as in the air. But what could it be? The answer came when he realized that this object could well be an antenna or a focuser for the same global energy formation that he was now beginning to chart out through the flight paths of UFOs. He was able to obtain the coordinates that the Eltanin was on when it made the photograph, and thus was able to deduce the exact position of the object, which he then started referring to as an “aerial.” Cathie’s work only gets more and more intriguing as it progresses. From this aerial along with his other coordinates that he developed, he was able to figure out a simple, planet-wide form for the shape that the energy lines the UFOs were traveling on. In a true Eureka-style frenzy of insight, he grabbed his child’s toy ball and graphed out the formation with a felt tip pen; a picture of the ball is given on the back of his first book entitled Harmonic 33. The ball illustrates a series of circles that surround the planet, and those circles intersect at certain distinct points."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Perhaps at this point it should not surprise us that these points perfectly illustrate a cube and octahedron within a sphere, where its points are defined by the intersections of a series of perfect circles. Point A represents the true magnetic north pole, whereas point B represents the more ideal “grid pole.” Once again, we are seeing two of the geometries in our “consciousness unit” forms emerging on the Earth, entirely through the graphing of the flight paths of UFOs and an apparently artificial object located on the sea floor. Since this time, Cathie has produced several books, and the degree of precision that his grid has to such things as the siting of nuclear power plants, UFO sightings, ancient sites and other paranormal phenomena is highly significant. This is covered in much better detail in Cathie's books, such as The Energy Grid. In the early stages of his work, Cathie believed that this Grid energy was essentially being created and upheld by the “aerials” themselves. (He would later rescind this point.) He believed at the time that the entire Global Grid was built by the extraterrestrials, and that it was somehow responsible for balancing the energy on Planet Earth. He theorized that the extraterrestrials were frantically going around and repairing their grid whenever they could get the chance, desperately trying to balance our electromagnetic and magnetic disturbances from things like underground nuclear testing. Cathie believed the energy we created in these cases could tear the Earth to pieces if we were not given outside assistance. Thus, Cathie believed, it was a very valiant service that the visitors were providing. And, even though we can see that they did not \"build\" the Grid per se, these \"aerials\" certainly could represent their technological efforts to balance it. Over time, as we just briefly went over, Cathie began to make some serious connections between this grid and the energy that it produces. Without question, his single greatest contribution to the future technology of human civilization is his \"cracking\" of the code behind the Unified Field Theory of Physics. This theory, as we have stated in the past, would unite gravity and electromagnetism among other things, giving us the opportunity to create gravity with electricity, producing propulsion systems similar to those found in"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"UFOs. Einstein's own equation of relativity gets very close to this Unified Field in and of itself. Almost everyone knows that the equation reads as follows: Energy equals Mass times The Speed of Light (C) squared, or E=MC2. What Einstein hoped to do was to solve this equation for the Speed of Light alone. He believed that the value for mass could eventually be substituted as a measurement of light. If this was done, then all of Creation could be expressed as being made up of Pure Light -- mass and energy entirely a function of Light. This is the true \"unified field\" that Einstein was searching for. As amazing as it must sound, Cathie solved this problem. In the Grid, he discovered an expression of Mass that was phrased in terms of the Speed of Light. (At the end of this chapter, we will print his solution. Further information can be found in his publications.) However, even though Cathie \"cracked the code\" of the Unified Field Theory, what is actually more interesting and important to us is the discoveries that he made along the way. As Cathie approached the solution to the puzzle, he unearthed many fundamental discoveries that forever change our understanding of \"sympathetic vibrational physics,\" and the precise numbers involved in studying these universal vibrations that determine the behavior of \"zero-point energy\" or aether. The Speed of Light as we now know it is measured in seconds. One of Cathie's initial discoveries involved coming up with a different way to measure time, in order to equate it more precisely with the harmonics of the Earth's Grid itself. Right now, our system of seconds works quite well for us, counting in a 60- based system. We have a day of 24 hours. Cathie discovered that the harmonics of the math for the Grid become much simpler if we have a day of 27 \"grid hours\" instead of our usual 24. This is simply done by factoring in an 8 to 9 ratio- in other words, for every eight hours in our current system, there are nine hours in the \"harmonic\" system. Since this is a very simple adjustment, it certainly is possible that this is a natural aspect of the Universe- in other words, both the 8-based system and the 9-based system will show different types of harmonics. Eight is the basis of the Octave, and nine is the basis of the Diatonic musical scale. So, to arrive at this new time value, all you would do is increase the number of hours in the day. You would leave the same values of 60 minutes per hour, and 60 seconds per minute. Obviously, this would change the values for hours and minutes, making them shorter, since you now have to squeeze 27 hours into our regular day of 24. So, if we solve for the number of \"grid seconds\" in one \"grid day,\" we come up with 97,200 grid seconds total. (27h x 60m x 60s.) If any reader decides to start dividing 97,200 by fundamental \"harmonic numbers\" such as 9, interesting things will happen. 97,200 divided by 9 equals 10800, a harmonic of 1080, which is the fundamental Gematrian number for the Moon. (666 is the number for the Sun, 1080 for the Moon and 1746 the \"fusion number\" between the two. 666 is the number you get if you count 1-36 and add all those numbers together, and 36 is also a key harmonic number in the Diatonic musical scale as we have shown.) 1080, the Moon number, is also precisely half of the Moon's diameter in regular English miles, and that is an important point. The 2160-mile diameter of the Moon is quantitatively identical to the 2,160-year age of the Zodiac. In future chapters we will discuss the fact"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"that 12 of these zodiacal \"ages\" add up to 25,920, the same number as our Great Solar Cycle and the long-term wobbling cycle of the Earth known as precession. So this is our first \"hint\" that the ancient measurement of the inch, foot and mile may be directly connected to this universal harmonic system. In chapter 17, Carl Munck will make this point much more visible for us. If we divide 97,200 by 9 again, we get 1200, another fundamental number as the harmonic of 12. Anyone who wishes to \"play\" with this and knows a little about harmonic numbers will quickly be satisfied. You can try a series of divisions by 6, by 5 and by 3 to see the interesting results -- repeating numbers and other \"harmonic\" values. We can definitely see why Cathie favored the 9-based number 97,200 as the harmonic ideal for the number of \"grid seconds\" in one Earth day - an absolute number for how much distance in harmonic time that the Earth has traveled. Although this does not correspond with our current measurement of time rooted in the number 8, it appears to be the best way to rectify the Earth's orbit with the harmonic system. We will show as we go along that 97,200 \"grid seconds\" is a very important number for charting the pulsating frequencies of a CU. Furthermore, the harmonics of Cathie's number for the Earth grid in seconds, our 97,200, also reduces down to 972. This is another multiple of 36, again showing us its harmonic nature as a musical frequency, fundamentally connected to the Diatonic scale. 972 divided by 36 is 27, the number of hours in a Grid day. So, we can clearly see that planetary harmonies emerging, expressed in elegant harmonic numbers for their orbits. Richard Hoagland revealed at a MUFON conference in 1997 that the orbit of Mars had been exactly 666 Martian days long in the past, due to the changing gravitational interactions of the planet with its two moons, so this is yet another way for us to see this in effect. Cathie then ties these \"grid seconds\" together with the speed of light, and recalculates this value based on harmonic mathematics. When we think of our current value for the speed of light, this value is based on the mathematics and time that we now use. When we change those seconds into harmonic or grid seconds, introducing the transcendental properties of the ratio of 9, (which again is the building block of the Diatonic series as well as the master frequency number of the Maya,) the value of the speed of light will also change. What we never could have expected is the amazing, fundamental harmonic number that the speed of light changes into! In order to \"set up\" our final point that will tie into the Solar Cycle in later chapters and our study of the consciousness units, we need to explore Cathie's discussion of light waveforms and how they would work in the atom. Cathie informs us of the fact that the true atom would not look like a Solar System as we think of it, but rather as a spherical mass. Light travels in a circular, three-dimensional wave, a wave that spirals to a certain height and a certain depth. You could graph this in two dimensions as a regular \"sine wave,\" with a horizontal line for its midsection."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" If you picture this light wave moving forward at a set speed, you can visualize how a sphere would be formed. The light spiral would begin at the midpoint of the wave, which would be the North Pole of the sphere. The wave spirals out to maximum height and \"lowers\" to the median again as it reaches the sphere's equator, forming the first hemisphere. Then, the second hemisphere is formed the same way, as the wave \"lowers\" to its lowest point and again rises to the median. See the diagram for support in visualizing this. The numbers at the bottom represent the harmonics that Cathie discovered as being associated with this movement. Naturally, you could measure it as a \"particle,\" namely the sphere, or a \"wave,\" namely the waveform making up the sphere. So, with this conceptual invention, Cathie provided a solution for what is known in Physics as the \"wave-particle duality,\" where light can appear as either a particle or a wave depending on how you observe it. He also indicates how antimatter is formed as a result of the spiraling motions involved. We remind the reader that this system bears remarkable similarity to our own theory regarding the inner workings of \"consciousness units.\" Cathie displays this as a rather two-dimensional system, essentially moving left to right and right to left in a spiral. Cathie uses a \"wave\" for the diagram, and we now know from studies such as those of Dr. Michio Kaku that the \"waves\" are actually superstrings, which we assert to be lines of energetic force in a unified \"sea\" of aether energy. We also have reason to believe, from various psychic and physical sources that we have listed, that these \"waves\" must originate from a center point or Oneness and move outwards as the energy expands, then collapse back inwards yet again as it contracts. So, with only a very slight tweaking, we can see how Cathie has discovered \"consciousness units\" in his own right, as atoms. All we have to do is see them as being formed of superstrings that travel in spirals, expanding outward in a spherical form from a central point or nucleus. Cathie's atom is formed almost exactly the same as he thought it was; only the vector or direction of the spirals needs to be changed. Since we know the Earth to be a gigantic consciousness unit as well, providing a spherical \"field\" to hold these energies, this explains why Cathie's grid shows us two of the Platonic Solids - the octahedron and cube. We have already said that the tips or corners of each of the Platonic Solids represent the points where the spirals all converge, giving them greater gravitational / energetic strength. This interplay of forces at the \"nodes\" shows up as straight-lined magnetic fields within the expanding sphere, all harmonically spaced. This harmonic spacing is the fundamental"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"definition of all the Platonic Solids we have been discussing. THE HARMONIC SPEED OF LIGHT We have now determined that Cathie set up a basis for measuring time using a system of \"grid seconds,\" where the normal 86,400 seconds in a day based on a harmonic of 8 are expanded into 97,200 seconds, based on a harmonic of 9. In so doing, one day of Earth's rotation was split up into 27, or 9 x 3 \"grid hours.\" The number of \"grid seconds\" per day comes out to be the extremely harmonic number of 97,200. This is how Cathie achieved the first step towards putting the Speed of Light in grid terms; getting a time measurement based on grid seconds. The Speed of Light as we now express it is measured in miles per second. We have already seen how Cathie converted the value of a second into its harmonic ideal, the Grid Second. We now also need to convert our regular system of miles into a grid-based measuring system. As we remember from the discussion of the work of Aime Michel and the UFO tracklines that were symmetrically spaced apart from each other, Cathie used the system of \"nautical miles\" to determine where the \"grid lines\" were placed. We also know that one nautical mile is equal to one minute of arc on the Earth's surface, and that there is a \"grid line\" every 30 minutes. So, what we need to do is change the miles in the speed of light equation into nautical miles, or minutes of arc, as the two are interchangeable. Therefore, the \"grid speed\" of Light would be expressed as (x) minutes of arc per grid second. The incontrovertible truth of Cathie's findings is that the \"Grid Speed of Light\" is EXACTLY 144,000 minutes of arc per grid second in free space. As we are about to see, this becomes one of the most important points in the book, as it shows us that there is a direct connection between light frequencies and sound frequencies - the mathematics of the numbers are literally identical. Twice the value of 144 is 288, which is the first value in the Diatonic scale that we have been investigating. As we look into this even further, we can see that the fundamental, harmonic value of 144,000 for the speed of light is precisely the same as the fundamental harmonic values for many different things, including: - the Mayan Calendar's baktun, at 144,000 Earth days; - the Bible number of the 144,000 souls who will Ascend; - the fundamental \"building block\" of all sound vibration frequencies, 144; - the fundamental Gematrian \"frequency number\" for light, 144; - And, of course, the harmonic of 12 times 12. So, the Gematrian meaning for the number 144 is 'light.' Obviously, we must question if these archaic designers of this Biblical numerological system were aware of the same information as Cathie; we now see that they were right: 144 really is light! As another interesting harmonic point, physicist John Nordberg reveals that"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"current physics still uses a time unit based on a traditional second, and this unit is a direct statement of how fast the second hand moves through a 360- degree circle on a clock face as opposed to how fast the Sun moves in one 360-degree circle through the sky. There are 86,400 seconds in the Sun's 360-degree arc, representing one day of time. So, to get the amount of relative movement between one second in the 360-degree clock face and one second in the Sun's apparent 360-degree movement, we divide 86,400 by the number of seconds in one 360-degree circle, or one minute, which is 60 seconds. The ratio that we are left with is 1440, which represents our current perception of time: in other words, one second of our time is 1440 times faster in its movement through its arc than the movement of the Sun through the arc it traces in our sky. When we combine this with Cathie's true harmonic value of 144,000 arc-minutes for the Speed of Light in one \"grid second,\" we can see that there are quite interesting harmonic parallels there. More importantly, the speed of light is harmonically the same as the speed of the baktun measuring units in the Great Cycle, as we will see in later chapters. It also is a function of the harmonics making up the consciousness units [CUs.] So, there is a fundamental relationship between Light itself, Sound, and the Solar Cycle. (The Solar Cycle is a pulsation of Light, expressed through planets and star rotations. This Light pulsation works in octaves, giving us the dimensions.) Cathie had just told us above that light forms spheres as it travels, and a CU is a spherical energy that pulsates. We have also suggested that the sphere of a planet can provide a large-scale harmonic for the pulsation of the CU, and now Cathie has resolved our basic \"planetary measurement values\" such as the mile into fundamental Grid harmonic terms that help us calculate the true harmonic passage of time. One of Cathie's most impressive \"harmonic\" renderings of the Earth as a CU is the distance from the center of the earth to the average height of the atmosphere. This value is given as 4320 arc-minutes, which reduces down to 432, the number of \"Consecration\" and the fundamental vibration for the sixth node in the octave. So, it would appear that the arc-minutes are indeed vital in demonstrating the Earth's harmonic proportions. Now that we have solved for the speed of Light in harmonic time and arc-minutes, we can see why; it comes out to an exact harmonic of 144. So essentially, by using this system of Grid mathematics, Cathie has determined how a consciousness unit is mapped out at the most minute, fundamental levels - using 360-degree-based \"grid seconds\" and minutes of arc. Not only do we see the mapping of a CU, we also see its fundamental relationship to Light, and the harmonics of Light. Since the harmonic principles of the CU are literally identical between the Earth and the atoms, we will also see that the cycles of the Solar System are also a harmonic function. The planets move through space not in two-dimensional circles as we usually see them, but in spirals, since the Galaxy is also rotating and moving the Solar System forward as a unit. If you looked at a planetary orbit in non- moving, empty space, it would travel in a spiral. So, the planets spiral in a harmonically identical fashion as the superstrings within a consciousness unit, only much slower. The planets originated from the center, the Sun, as super- hot gas and dust, and are now spiraling outward from the Sun at a slow, predictable and harmonic rate of speed as planets. Similarly, the CU starts at its center and spirals outward in superstrings. So, the Solar System is indeed"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"a giant, harmonic consciousness unit. Let's take a quote from Ra here to illustrate the point. We will start with an excerpt from Ra that clearly illustrates the connection between their definition of the Solar Cycle that we will be discussing in future chapters and their definition of a consciousness unit. Here is that quote to get us started: Q: The way that I understand the process of evolution is that our planetary population has a certain amount of time to progress. This is generally divided into three 25,000-year cycles. At the end of 75,000 years the planet progresses itself. What caused this situation to come about with the preciseness of the years in each cycle? RA: I am Ra. Visualize, if you will, the particular energy which, outward flowing and inward coagulating, formed the tiny realm of the creation governed by your Council of Saturn. Continue seeing the rhythm of this process. The living flow creates a rhythm which is as inevitable as one of your timepieces. Each of your planetary entities began the first cycle when the energy nexus was able in that environment to support such mind/body experiences. Thus, each of your planetary entities is on a different cyclical schedule as you might call it. The timing of these cycles is a measurement equal to a portion of intelligent energy. This intelligent energy offers a type of clock. The cycles move as precisely as a clock strikes your hour. Thus, the gateway from intelligent energy to intelligent infinity opens regardless of circumstance on the striking of the hour. This quote will be drawn upon much more in future chapters. What we can see here is that they refer to the \"outward flowing and inward coagulating\" nature of intelligent energy that is on a particular cycle. This cycle can be measured very precisely, and it determines when a \"frequency shift\" will occur on any planetary body. Now, since we are knee-deep in a discussion of consciousness units, it is more appropriate for us to bring out the rest of Ra's quotes. The next quote, from pg. 6 of Law of One Book II, continues the concept we have just seen above. Intelligent infinity has a rhythm or flow as of a giant heart beginning with the central sun as you would think or conceive of this, the presence of the flow inevitable as a tide of beingness without polarity, without finity; the vast and silent all beating outward, outward, focusing outward and inward until the focuses are complete. The intelligence or consciousness of foci have reached a state where their, shall we say, spiritual nature or mass calls them inward, inward, inward until all is coalesced. This is the rhythm of reality as you spoke. This quote does sound quite familiar to the one from Walter Russell, which we reprinted at the beginning of this book: In My universe there is but one form from which all forms appear. That one form is the pulsing cube-sphere, two halves of the heartbeat of My dual thinking. All forms pulse, therefore, all forms are two, one form for the inbreathing pulse, which generates, and one for the outbreathing, radiating one. The cube is the sphere expanded by the outward breath to black rest in cold space, and the sphere is the cube compressed to the incandescence of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"white-hot suns by the inward breath. Then, on page 10, Elkins asks Ra a question based on their previous statements and his own understanding of the physics of Dewey Larson. (We are told in the introduction to Law of One: Book II that \"For those who may wish to study Larsonian physics, The Structure of the Physical Universe is a good book with which to begin.\") Dr. Elkins' question does indeed set out the fundamental basis for \"consciousness units\" as we have discussed them so far. What is important for us right now is that Ra affirmed the correctness of this statement, for our own galaxy. Q: ...I think that possibly we are at the most important part of what we are doing in trying to make it apparent how everything is One, how it comes from one intelligent infinity. This is difficult, so please bear with my errors in questioning. The concept that I have right now of the process, using both what you have told me and some of Dewey Larson's material having to do with the physics of the process, is that intelligent infinity expands outward from all locations everywhere. It expands outward uniformly like the surface of a bubble or a balloon expanding outward from every point everywhere. It expands outward at what is called unit velocity or the velocity of light. This is Larson's idea of the progression of what he calls space / time. Is this correct? (It is very important to remember that Ra refers to this expanding movement of Light as \"upward spiraling Light;\" in other words, it travels in a spiraling motion within a spherical field, thus forming the spherical geometries of the CUs as we have said.) RA: I am Ra. This concept is incorrect as is any concept of the one intelligent infinity. This concept is correct in the context of one particular Logos, (galaxy,) or Love, or focus of this Creator which has chosen Its, shall we say, natural laws and ways of expressing them mathematically and otherwise.\" So what we can see from Ra in this quote is that these \"sacred mathematics\" are all a function of the laws that are present within our own galaxy. That raises up the unique question of how and why they might be different in another galaxy! We won't tackle those questions in this book, as they are not central to the discussion. Elkins' question on page 12 gives us the answer that we were looking for, showing us that the Solar System is a crystallized consciousness unit. Q: When does the individualization or the individualized portion of consciousness come into play? At what point does individualized consciousness take over working on the basic light?\" What Elkins is really asking is how we, as human entities, end up working with these expansive energies in our own consciousness. We need to note that Ra's answer to this question starts out by telling Elkins that there is no \"point\" of time when this actually starts, since all time is ultimately simultaneous. We have edited out that brief section, since there are terms in it that haven't been defined in this book, and we then move forward to the pertinent part of the answer."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"RA: I am Ra... The experience or existence of space / time comes into being after the individuation process of Logos or Love has been completed and the physical universe, as you would call it, has coalesced or begun to draw inward while moving outward to the extent that that which you call your sun bodies have in their turn created timeless chaos coalescing into what you call planets, these vortices of intelligent energy spending a large amount of what you would call first density in a timeless state, the space/time realization being one of the learn/teachings of this density of being-ness. Thus we have difficulty answering your questions with regard to time and space and their relationship to the, what you would call, original creation which is not a part of space/time as you can understand it. So, if we look closely at Ra's above quote, it would appear that our existence as a Solar System of planets is carefully perched on the platform of physical manifestation. In order for space/time to exist, the coalescing, compression force has to \"begin to draw inward,\" and this is what we call gravity. Remember that Einstein showed us that space/time assembles itself into a fabric, and that gravity is a function of the curvature of the fabric. Ra resolves this \"gravity paradox\" with the notion of the CU on pg. 19 and 20 of these same sessions, by telling us that gravity \"may be seen as the pressing towards the inner light / love, the seeking towards the spiral line of light which progresses towards the Creator. This is a manifestation of a spiritual event or condition of living-ness.\" In other words, gravity is simply the reverse motion of the expansion of the CU. Gravity is the compression of the CU showing itself in the physical. Also be aware that this excerpt refers to the spiraling nature of these lines, or superstrings of light. Ra indicated that their answer to Elkins' question was designed to incorporate the metaphysical principles behind gravity as well as the physical. Gravity, as a metaphysical concept, is the motion towards the center, or Unity. A bit later in the book, we get the following interesting exchange between Ra and Elkins about gravity, which explains this even better. RA: I am Ra...When all of creation in its infinity has reached a spiritual gravitational mass of sufficient nature, the entire creation infinitely coalesces; the light seeking and finding its source and thusly ending the creation and beginning a new creation much as you consider the black hole, as you call it, with its conditions of infinitely great mass at the zero point from which no light may be seen as it has been absorbed. Q: Then the black hole would be a point at which the environmental material has succeeded in uniting with unity or with the Creator? Is this correct? RA: I am Ra. The black hole which manifests third density is the physical complex manifestation of this spiritual or metaphysical state. This is correct. So, what we can see here is the metaphysics of gravity. Each geometric layer of the CU above our own is a higher level of spiritual density, and that means that it is moving closer and closer to the One. Remember that by the time the consciousness units have reached the point of the sphere, or the Octave, they have compressed back down into a single \"point.\" With this quote from Ra, we can indeed see that this is true, and that the black hole is the best physical example that we can see of this process at work. So, as we Ascend, even as"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"we expand in frequency, we are in a sense compressing the CUs in our bodies into a form that is closer to God. (We are informed by these forces that this is not at all a painful process... we might not even know that it has happened at first.) Since Ra tells us that gravity is a function of the spiraling expansion and contraction of a CU, we can see why these shapes have an effect on Earth's gravity, forming the grids such as the ones that Cathie's UFOs were flying upon. As we go forward in this book, we will see many more examples of the geometry of the CU showing up as physical gravitational stresses on the Earth. This point will be most clearly expressed in the chapter on the Becker / Hagens grid. When we look at all of the material we have just quoted from Ra together, we can see that consciousness units change their frequencies, or dimensional levels, at predictable, cyclical rates. As we move into Part Three, we will tie this all together so that we can see that our own Solar System is a consciousness unit on a specific cycle that is about to rise in frequency. And so, to summarize, we started this chapter by looking at the work of Bruce Cathie, and most recently at his discovery that light waves create spheres as they travel. According to Cathie, what we perceive as our three-dimensional universe is a phase of matter and anti-matter, with no gaps in between. (Obviously there are gaps, representing the other dimensions; but it appears to us in 3D that there are not.) We now remind ourselves that Cathie made an incredible discovery. The harmonic speed of light, phrased in minutes of arc per grid second, is a function of 144 - the Gematrian number for light. Cathie tells us that since our Creation is made up of a matter / antimatter cycle, we need to double this harmonic - each pulsation actually must spend half of its time traveling in the antimatter plane. (See the earlier diagram of the spherical light wave to help visualize this.) According to Ra, this plane would be the reverse of spacetime, known as \"timespace,\" where the basic properties of space and time are reversed -- supposedly space is much more inflexible whereas time is much more flexible, unlike our own spacetime where we can move through space easily but not through time. So, when we double the harmonic of the speed of light we get the harmonic number 288, which as we said is the beginning of the fundamental Diatonic scale of vibrations. Time after time, we are referred to in metaphysical literature as a dimension that is painfully slow. This slowness is measured by our measurement of the fundamental speed of light as being \"only\" a harmonic of 288, or the first-dimension vibration. Einstein's paradox of \"light speed\" is that as you approach it, mass becomes larger and larger, to a point of infinity. But as Cathie has solved the relativity equation for light alone, we can then see that the only threshold we would ever reach would be a function of C, the speed of light itself. Therefore, there really is no mass, only Light. Or, as Ra says, we gain \"spiritual mass\" which compresses us back to the Light of the One. Obviously, this \"spiritual mass\" is Light, not physical matter. The point here is that Light speed is NOT an infinite boundary that cannot be crossed, it just requires your FREQUENCY to change. Think of the atom with its eight positions for electrons. Were a ninth electron to be released from the nucleus, it would have no choice but to transition into the next octave of frequency, since the octave structure cannot be"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"superceded. So, when the speed of Light reaches its \"critical mass\" in our third dimension, it \"jumps\" to the next level, or frequency, in the octave. So, we will postulate here that as this boundary is breached into the next higher dimensional frequency, the speed of light would fundamentally increase into its new notch. We remember that with Cathie's opposing antimatter / matter cycle, the actual light harmonic is 288. We can see this dimensional shifting action of the Speed of Light within the progressions of sound, as we can raise the pitch of a D at 288 cycles per second to an E at 324. Cathie tells us that these light-waves form spheres, and thus if the speed of Light increases, the sphere formed by that light-wave would be at a \"faster\" frequency - and this would be a faster geometric frequency as well. Thus, one could perceive the different Platonic solids as forming in different dimensions, even though they are only a visual representation of rising frequencies. As we have already indicated, Cathie was able to completely transform Einstein’s theory of relativity with a \"grid function\" that expressed that mass in terms of the speed of light only. By solving the Relativity theory for \"c\", Cathie essentially \"cracked the code\" of the Unified Field theory by removing the mass variable and resolving Einstein's entire equation into light; hence Energy Equals Light. Thus, all seen and unseen material in the Universe is a Unified Field of what is ultimately Pure Light. This is a scientific \"discovery\" of exactly what Ra and other spiritual sources have told us all throughout time. Again, these unified field equations suggested ways in which the energy could be utilized for such things as anti-gravity and free energy. Indeed, as a result of this ongoing research, Cathie drew some very serious interest from the highest levels of the Secret Government. After all, he had solved the Problem of All Problems, the answer to Unified Field Physics. With this knowledge properly applied, all ET-related sciences were wide open to explore, including dimensional warping and teleportation. According to his literature, government agents would come and ask him many different questions, wanting to know how he was able to figure all of his information out. He was hounded and followed, phone lines most likely tapped, et cetera. Many tempting and profitable offers have been made for him to work solely for governmental entities and not release the information to the public, apparently extending right through to the recent past. Yet, Cathie was undeterred, and unlike many other researchers of similar caliber, he was never killed. Instead, they continued to cooperate with him, and as time went on he could tell that they knew a great deal about what he was studying, and were using his research to further their own experiments. It seemed that he was discovering crucial details for a system that was being put into much more practical use than he could have ever imagined. In the next chapter we will discuss how such a system may have been implemented. Footnote: Cathie's primary harmonic equation for the Unified Field Theory is as follows: Einstein E = MC2 Cathie M = C + 1 / sq rt C"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Therefore E = (C + 1 / sq rt C) C2"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 10: THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT AND ASCENSION In this chapter, we begin to examine the basics behind how this system of hyperdimensional physics could actually produce a spontaneous disappearance of a physical body. We deeply examine the case history of the Philadelphia Experiment, wherein a Naval ship was allegedly \"teleported\" back and forth from Norfolk, VA to Penn's Landing, PA. We suggest that this experiment was an early, crude proof of the fact that if a magnetic field of sufficient strength is configured to produce the higher-level geometries of the CU, you may very well be able to transform the matter phase of everything within that area to a higher dimension. We also suggest that the Sun is naturally producing this same effect, only on a much larger and more long-term scale. CHAPTER 10: THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT AND ASCENSION The effects of the Philadelphia Experiment can demonstrate the fact that at least partial knowledge of the Global Grid was available to the insiders already. The Philadelphia Experiment, as many of us already know, was a case where the United States apparently dematerialized an entire ship at the port of Norfolk, Virginia, transported it up to Penn’s Landing Area near Philadelphia, and then brought it back to Norfolk again, in 1943. The total distance of the trip exceeded 400 miles. Again, there are many different sources that confirm the reality of this having happened, and it is the lack of study on behalf of most skeptics that would allow them to brush it aside. The most recent reports from Lt. Col. Philip Corso, reprinted on Dr. Steven Greer's CSETI website, indicate that almost everything in the description of the Philadelphia Experiment was true, except that in order to protect the story, a different ship was used than the one normally described to the public. The actual ship was a minesweeper, not a destroyer. Therefore, it makes sense that when aging crewmembers of the Destroyer Escort U.S.S. Eldridge were queried about this, they remembered nothing of the sort. Although the evidence now suggests that the Eldridge was not the ship, we are told that the experiment itself apparently did occur. What we are told is that this ship was made invisible and quickly transported by an extraordinarily powerful, pulsating magnetic field that it generated on board. This magnetic field was the product of several tons of specialized electronic equipment that had been installed within it. To those who ignore this aspect of the \"big picture\" of UFOlogy / metaphysics / government cover-ups, we need to remember a few facts surrounding the event. If the ship had simply remained safe and secure in the harbor as the Navy claimed, there is no apparent reason for the families of several crewmembers being told that their loved ones, the sailors from the crew, had died that night. There doesn't seem to be a plausible explanation for why the entire rest of the crew involved received discharges from the Navy for being \"medically unfit.\" Furthermore, the death of Morris Ketchum Jessup, a U Michigan astronomy and mathematics professor investigating the affair,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"seems a little too coincidental to be a \"suicide.\" In many ways, his death reads similar to the now-famous Vince Foster case associated with the Clinton Whitewater investigations. Jessup, born in 1900, had an interesting career. While completing his doctorate at University of Michigan, he discovered and cataloged many binary stars in the night sky. His first decent job, caught during the Depression, was with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to seek out sources of crude rubber in the Amazon. This job in turn led to archeological expeditions into the Mayan ruins in Mesoamerica, where he worked as a photographer. He was fascinated by what he saw, and progressed onward to Peru to study the ruins of the pre- Incan cultures there. By studying the megalithic size and mathematical exactness of the ruins, Jessup concluded that the only plausible explanation for their construction was some sort of levitation process. He proposed that this must have been done by a non-terrestrial influence, a race of intelligent beings with access to flying craft that could levitate the blocks. By proposing this theory, he was ousted by employers and colleagues, having become an early proponent of the \"Ancient Astronauts\" theory. Fueled by his own savings, Jessup stayed in the area, and began studying the enigmatic craters near the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico that are now cited as evidence of the asteroid collision that killed the dinosaurs. Jessup eventually ran out of money and came back to the United States in 1954 to be able to raise funds to continue his research. He soon realized that the flying saucer phenomenon that everyone was talking about was indeed plausible, as he had already uncovered evidence that suggested it. He was most interested in determining their methods of propulsion, since they disobeyed all known laws of physics. Jessup had already completed his first manuscript by January of 1955, based on this new research; he called it The Case for the UFO, and sold it to Bantam Books. It did quite well in bookstores and was printed in paperback by the fall of the same year. After the book was out on the shelves, Jessup received a series of letters from Carlos Allende, alias Carl Allen. The letters were written in several different colors of ink, and many words within the sentences were capitalized for no apparent reason. It was obvious that Allende was not the most literate person in the world, but his story was certainly a fantastic one: he had been present at the Norfolk Docks to witness the disappearance of a ship, erroneously referred to as the U.S.S. Eldridge, during the \"Philadelphia Experiment.\" Allende commented on some of the information in Case for the UFO where Jessup had encouraged the public to put legal pressure on the government, in order to demand research into Einstein's Unified Field Theory. Allende was quite angry about Jessup's desire to do this, because of the harmful effects that this theory had on human beings as a result of its testing in the Philadelphia Experiment. You can imagine that for any planetary society, the early days of teleportation must be quite difficult, costing innocent, brave and pioneering lives. Although Einstein claimed to have never finished his Unified Field Theory, Allende opens up the letter by telling Jessup that Einstein had indeed finished it, and had retracted the work due to the effects that it might have on people. Those effects were later demonstrated by the Philadelphia"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Experiment. Says Allende: [Einstein's] Later computations, done strictly for his own edification & amusement, upon cycles of Human Civilization & Progress compared to the Growth of Mans General over-all Character Was enough to Horrify Him. Thus, we are told today that the Theory was \"Incomplete.\" Dr. B. Russell asserts privately that It is complete. He also says that Man is Not Ready for it & Shan't be until after W.W. III. Nevertheless, \"Results\" of my friend Dr. Franklin Reno, were used... The Result was & stands today as Proof that The Unified Field Theory to a certain extent is correct. Beyond that certain extent No Person in his right senses, or having any senses at all, Will evermore dare to go. Next, we will examine Allende's observations of the field that was generated and what happened within it: The Field Was effective in an oblate spheroidal shape, extending one hundred yards (More or Less, due to Lunar position and Latitude) out from each beam of the ship. Any Person Within that sphere became vague in form BUT He too observed those Persons aboard that ship as though they too were of the same state, yet were walking upon nothing. Any person without that sphere could see Nothing save the clearly Defined shape of the Ships Hull in the Water. PROVIDING of course, that that person was just close enough to see yet, just barely outside of that field. If we take Allende's letters as being factual, it would seem from the above paragraph that there was a fundamental difference between what would happen when you saw a physical object in that state as opposed to a living human being. People in the field \"became vague in form but... [they could see each other, even though the others looked like they] were walking on nothing.\" This suggests a fundamental difference between a human entity and an inanimate object when this \"dimensional projection\" is made. Other reports of those who have traveled out-of-body have reported seeing other entities as being vague in form. Inanimate matter like the ship's hull and deck may simply not be visible in higher realms. According to Allende, this experiment apparently had a quite devastating effect on the men involved in it. The men got stuck between dimensions, as it were, and some were unable to find their way back to the physical plane. In the worst-case scenario, some of these men actually burst into flames. These poor souls, if rescued, described the in-between feeling as Pure Hell, where they were stuck in a seemingly eternal Slowness and did not know how to escape. According to Allende, there were various levels of this \"freeze,\" illustrated in the following verbatim quote: A Highly complicated Piece of Equipment Had to be constructed in order to Unfreeze those who became \"True Froze\" or \"Deep Freeze\" subjects. Usually a \"Deep Freeze\" Man goes Mad, Stark Raving, Gibbering, Running MAD, if His \"freeze\" is for More than a Day in our time. I speak of TIME for DEEP \"Frozen Men\" are Not aware of Time as We know it. The are Like Semi-comatoese person, who Live, breathe, Look & feel but still are unaware of So Utterly Many things as to constitute a \"Nether World\" to"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"them. A Man in an ordinary common Freeze is aware of Time, sometimes acutely so. Yet They are Never aware of Time precisely as you and I are aware of it. The First \"Deep Freeze\" As I said took 6 months to Rectify. It also took over 5 Million Dollars worth of Electronic equipment & a Special Ship Berth. It is worth speculating as to why these psychological effects occurred when the men shifted in their matter phase. We have descriptions of men going \"gibbering, running mad,\" combined with the idea of \"semi-comatose [people] who... are unaware of so utterly many things as to constitute [their entrance into some sort of a] \"Nether World.\" When we look at this from the perspective of abnormal psychology, what we seem to have are effects similar to schizophrenia. One of the things that comes across in Allende's reports is the feeling of a \"Slowness.\" It is very interesting to note here that reports from purported extraterrestrial sources invariably refer to the discomfort of “compressing” and “slowing down” into our own frequency. Thus, it seems that the soldiers were being transported to a higher frequency, and thus were going “too fast” for Earth, their physical bodies still stuck here in the \"molasses.\" So, what was only a minute to us could have been the equivalent of one subjective week of time to them. The prolonged efforts of the soldiers to rub the skin of a \"frozen\" person may have only taken effect after days or months of their own subjective, relative time. Furthermore, the energetic results of this magnetic field on the body seem to have altered the consciousness units making them up. One can certainly speculate that the very intense, pulsating magnetic field actually increased the natural frequency of the conscious energies that made up their bodies. Once the \"consciousness units\" were exposed to those higher frequencies, they became configured to accommodate them, in a similar fashion as the spherical shape of the Earth accommodates them. What probably started out as nothing more than an experiment in magnetic “stealth” cloaking turned into a multidimensional disaster. Most people who have studied this account are familiar with the regional Philadelphia newspaper article from October 1943 entitled \"Strange Circumstances Surround Tavern Brawl.\" The article reads as follows: Several city police officers responding to a call to aid members of the Navy Shore Patrol in breaking up a tavern brawl near the U.S. Navy docks here last night got something of a surprise when they arrived on the scene to find the place empty of customers. According to a pair of very nervous waitresses, the Shore Patrol had arrived first and cleared the place out - but not before two of the sailors involved allegedly did a disappearing act. \"They just sort of vanished into thin air... right there,\" reported one of the frightened hostesses, \"and I ain't been drinking either!\" At that point, according to her account, the Shore Patrol proceeded to hustle everyone out of the place in short order. A subsequent chat with the local police precinct left no doubts as to the fact that some sort of general brawl had indeed occurred in the vicinity of the dockyards at about eleven o' clock last night, but neither confirmation nor denial of the stranger aspects of the story could be immediately obtained. One reported witness succinctly summed up the affair by dismissing it as nothing"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"more than \"A lot of hooey from them daffy dames down there.\" Who, he went on to say, were just looking for some free publicity. Damage to the tavern was estimated to be in the vicinity of six hundred dollars. Then, we also want to consider an excerpt from another of Allende's letters. Although written in all caps, we have converted it to normal \"sentence case:\" How would you like to actually speak to (or some of the men) a man who was once an invisible human being? (May become so in front of your very eyes if he turns off his hip-set.) From the newspaper article, we can see some possible evidence suggesting a public display of the personal effects of this magnetic / dimensional shift. It is certainly interesting to note the fact that the Shore Patrol apparently cleared everyone out of the bar very soon after it started happening. Then, in Allende's excerpt, there is a suggestion that a \"hip set\" which ostensibly radiated some sort of stabilizing field was being worn by some of the men to prevent this from happening again. This seems to indicate that certain magnetic frequencies could possibly prevent the men from \"disappearing.\" But exactly how could these men have disappeared when they were no longer in the field itself? Here is one possible theoretical answer. We have already discussed how neatly the octave theory of dimensions fits into the idea of the Holographic Universe. One of the properties of a holographic plate is that no matter how small of a piece you cut off of it, the same identical image will show up when laser light is shined on it. The image might be faded, but it still emerges nonetheless. Therefore, part of the holographic theory is that patterns can be stored as information, much in the same respect that DNA stores a blueprint of the body. The new magnetic field, with its massive strength, could have changed the hologram of the consciousness units making up the physical body. They received a modified geometric pattern that was somewhere between an octahedron and a tetrahedron, probably asymmetrical in design. As Seth explained to us in previous chapters, the consciousness units are formed by emotional energy. Thus, the presence of strong emotions, perhaps similar to the panic that they felt when their bodies first assumed this configuration during the Experiment, could trigger a pattern memory within the units themselves. Returning to their in-between spot might require only a greater input of emotional energy for the units in the body complex to expand into it. Indeed, the Ra Material starts to make sense when it says that early fourth-density souls have not yet learned to camouflage themselves from the third. They might not have enough personal power to constantly maintain the new configuration, and thus occasionally slip back to the former pattern that their Ascended bodies remember. In David Hatcher Childress’s Anti-Gravity and the World Grid, our main source for this information, Harry Osoff shows that the path the ship traveled in was precisely the same as one of the lines of energy in the Global Grid. William Becker and Bethe Hagens, whom we will meet later, referred to this line as \"Grid Line #18.\""},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Osoff goes on to show how the actual points of arrival and departure fit in beautifully to many of Cathie’s natural Earth resonant frequencies, such as the speed of light and the electron spacing in the nucleus. [Interested readers should refer to Childress’s book for more precise details.] Thus, the magnetic force literally transformed all the consciousness units that made up the ship into a higher level of vibration. Once having done this, the ship no longer had physical mass, and could then ride the flowing energy of the magnetic field, the same as Cathie’s UFOs did. BUT, it was very important that it needed to be done in the right place on the Earth if it was going to work at all. This natural energy flow could be likened to a current in the ocean, and as we will see, it is at least partially responsible for these currents and many other things including weather. Thus, a natural energetic current carried the now higher-frequency ship across the grid line to the next nexus point in Philadelphia, where a similar machine must have been constructed. Perhaps this materialization was incomplete, and the ship was still on a slightly higher frequency level, although visible to shocked onlookers. It would then have been possible to reverse the magnetic fields between the two machines in the ship berths and draw the ship back across the same grid line, overcoming its natural cyclical flow. Another interesting point was that a green mist was associated with the dematerialization process. This green mist was also seen surrounding objects in the Bermuda Triangle in the books of Charles Berlitz. The Triangle is another area of mysterious disappearances, and as we are about to see, a major grid point. Interestingly, in his recent book Notes from the Cosmos, Gordon Michael Scallion again describes the same green mist as relating to the manifestation of spiritual forces. In a vision that he reported on the Art Bell show, he described a sudden change in the Sun’s energy, which he perceived as a green mist that descended on the Earth and rendered all the electronic equipment unusable. At this point, the careful reader should see the connection that we are making here. Referring back to an earlier chapter, the Seth entity said that the air itself is made up of these consciousness units, which are the energetic forms that make up all matter. We also know that these geometric forms represent sound and color frequencies. We also know that our own dimension would be the yellow frequency and the fourth would be the green. Thus, what we see here in this green color is the change in the vibratory rate of the consciousness units themselves that make up the air. Scallion’s sources appear to have hit the nail right on the head. When we apply this new knowledge to Cathie and the Global Grid, we can see that the Philadelphia Experiment was clearly trying to use this hyperdimensional force of energy. We can see that since magnetism is another form that the consciousness units can take, it can be used to essentially force the natural third-density formations into assuming the fourth- density vibration. All one would need to do is assemble the appropriate geometric energy field. Obviously, there are problems with this, as the harmonics were not pure enough to insure a clean transition into the fourth dimension. There were great human complications, owing to the fact that the men were not actually contained within any one dimension during the experiment, but stuck in a halfway point between two."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"It is probably safe to say that this type of technology could be perfected, in order that such distortions would be lessened or eliminated. Even then, there is a serious question as to whether the souls of the people going could actually handle the vibrations, if they were not “ready” for them. According to Ra, you don't go into the higher realms unless you are spiritually capable of handling the intensity -- otherwise it can literally destroy you. Ra also indicates that with the right energy or focus of consciousness, higher- level entities can use such a technology to “downgrade” their vibrations and become visible to beings that normally could not perceive them. Thus, UFOs mysteriously appear and disappear in the sky, and abductees or contactees are floated through walls or see the beings doing so. Indeed, in one book there is a story of a woman getting a violent cut on her leg from bumping into her automobile, which the visitors had rendered invisible to her. They explained that they could do this by thought alone, but they had machines designed to do the work for them. The Philadelphia Experiment crudely showed us that the idea of a dimensional shift is not at all outside the realm of possibility. Magnetic fields that vibrated at the proper frequency caused major changes in all physical matter within that space. The Sun, being such a large object, obviously has a magnetic / gravitational / consciousness field much larger than that created locally in the Philadelphia Experiment - after all, the Sun holds all the planets in place. As the sunspots can be shown to cause magnetic disturbance including solar and terrestrial pole reversals, the Great Cycle of the Sun obviously has massive implications for the magnetic fields surrounding the earth. We are already seeing how these energies manifest through geometry, and how easily their frequencies can be changed. Such frequency modulations can actually render a physical body invisible, by translating it into a higher mode of vibration. This was done not only in the case of the Philadelphia Experiment, but also in such modes as the Ascension of Jesus. There are also numerous cases in Eastern faiths of mystics and yogis spontaneously leaving the physical plane in a flash of light, leaving behind a lump of clothing. In the Cayce readings, the Atlantean priest Ra-Ta is said to have used the natural energy spirals harnessed by the Great Pyramid to ascend in a similar fashion. DETAILS FROM THE \"EXPERIMENT\" The apparent suicide of Jessup came after he had contacted government officials, when he got a copy of his own book mailed to him with many liner notes written inside. Further analysis demonstrated that Allende was the author of the liner notes. These notes revealed an extensive knowledge of the UFO field, containing many facts that were never published. From this information, we can see that even though his writing skills were not the greatest, Allende obviously had high enough clearance to have learned something about the UFO phenomenon from inside sources. What is most interesting is that some of Allende's short comments show that \"they\" were aware of the Global Grid. The most interesting of these words include: - \"Little Men\" - \"Gravity Fields\""},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"- \"Measure Markers\" - \"Scout Ships\" - \"Sheets of Diamonds\" - \"Cosmic Rays\" - \"Clear Talk\" - \"Telepathing\" - \"Nodes\" - \"Vortices\" - \"Magnetic net\" If we look at how a few of these terms fit together, we can infer that Allende was aware of a gravity field on Earth, composed of a magnetic net of nodes and vortices that appeared to look like a sheet of diamonds. Cosmic Rays had an effect on this gravity field, and scout ships would drop in from time to time to repair Cathie's aerials, or measure markers. The way that these little men piloting the scout ships would telepath would be by a process where you hear the words in your mind, known as clear talk. All of the above data fits very nicely with the information now coming out about the UFO phenomenon in the recent past. The clear indications of the knowledge of the Global Grid are very apparent. So, it would seem that through work like Cathie's, many government officials did know exactly of the Grid's existence and of how to utilize it. So what we can see here is that the geometric theory of dimensions is starting to make more and more sense. We can see plausible, although unpopular, examples that these energy fields do exist and have real, measurable effects. In the next chapter, we will round out our ideas about the global grid from an entirely different perspective: that of Carl Munck as well as Richard Hoagland, whom we started with in Chapter 13. This will help our geometric theory stand on its own two feet, and solidify once and for all that these energetic forces do really exist throughout the entire solar system."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 11: GLOBAL GRID II: HYPERDIMENSIONAL CRYSTALS BEGIN TAKING SHAPE ON PLANETS Now, we return to the implications of Hoagland's work with the Cydonia \"City\" complex on Mars. A tetrahedral, geometric energy force expressing itself through a sphere is shown on many of the planets in the Solar System, including Earth. Then, we head directly into an in-depth study of the work of Carl Munck, who revealed that almost every single pyramid, earthwork and \"sacred site\" worldwide uses a simple code to describe its exact position on the Grid. We definitively show how Munck rediscovered this Atlantean planet-wide system of geometric coordinates, similar to our own but with the central longitude line passing through the Great Pyramid of Giza. David brings in the work of his own readings in order to help answer the paradox of how to integrate together the works of Munck, Cathie, Hoagland and other \"Grid\" pioneers. CHAPTER 11: GLOBAL GRID II: HYPERDIMENSIONAL CRYSTALS BEGIN TAKING SHAPE ON PLANETS In order for the harmonic / geometric theory of the energy \"densities\" in the universe to stand on its own, we need some form of physical evidence that we can see and measure. Cathie satisfies this point by demonstrating to us that the spherical Grid has a cube and octahedron shape inside of it. As we saw in previous chapters, Richard Hoagland and his team mathematically decoded the Barbury Castle 1991 pictogram. This pictogram, The Mother of All Crop Circles, showed a tetrahedron inside of a sphere. Much in the same way that Cathie would measure a cube and octahedron in the earth, Hoagland’s work shows energy upwellings as a tetrahedron. It is humorous at this point to notice that Cathie strictly adheres to his cube/ octahedron model, and Hoagland strictly adheres to his tetrahedron model, but both of these shapes exist together with the rest of the Octave. Since the tetrahedron is the next density above our own, its shape should also be among the strongest in its energetic effects, leading to the most obvious physical observations. Hoagland’s team has studied these tetrahedral energies exclusively, measuring the tetrahedron inside the sphere with great precision in order to locate where the greatest stresses should emerge. In short, Hoagland showed us that the bottom points of the tetrahedron emerge at 19.5 degrees above or below the equator of the planet or sphere, depending on where you put the “top” of the figure."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Hoagland then takes tetrahedral measurements, including this 19.5-degree energy point, and demonstrates their presence on nearly every body in the Solar System. On the Sun, for example, the sunspots never drift beyond about 19.5 degrees North or South. More recently, Hoagland showed us where the top of the tetrahedron would be, publishing the results of a satellite survey of the Sun that indicated a perfectly round ring of energy surrounding the north magnetic pole. Going further out, great energy upwellings can be seen in a pair of volcanoes on Venus, also at 19.5 degrees. On Mars, we get Olympus Mons, a shield volcano that is three times the size of Mount Everest, also at 19.5. On Earth, Hoagland indicates Hawaii, but we will show that there is another placement for the tetrahedron here that is even better. As we move out to gas planets, the energetic effects are seen more in spiraling form, and less as crustal disturbances or volcanoes. Indeed, many people unfamiliar with Hoagland’s work will be surprised to discover that the Great Red Spot of Jupiter is also at 19.5 degrees below the equator. This massive spiraling vortex is a storm that seems to perpetually occur, and it is large enough to maintain two Earths within it. This shows us much more clearly what the grid points of the tetrahedron look like when causing a physical effect on gas. Moving out to the next big gas planet, Saturn, there are dark bands of clouds located at 19.5 degrees North and South of its equator. Obviously, these demonstrate the interlocking tetrahedron, or the fact that you have to include two tetrahedra back to back to fully represent the energy. Also, Saturn has a mysterious circular formation over its North Pole that neatly assembles into a pentagonal star shape within it, with a thin hexagonal cloud also inside of it. This helps to show us in gas form where the crystalline energies are first entering the planet."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"(Look especially at the bottom right picture frame to see the five-pointed star. The hexagonal cloud is not made of dark lines like the star - it is visible at a distance halfway between the edge of the circle and the center of the circle, perfectly circumscribed. Hoagland reprinted this in Monuments of Mars, and it was originally published in 1988 by D.A. Godfrey from a series of computer- rectified, oblique Voyager images of the polar regions of Saturn. The title of the work it came from is \"A Hexagonal Feature around Saturn's North Pole.\") Neptune shows us both a Great Dark Spot at 19.5 degrees such as Jupiter, as well as a cloud band such as Saturn. The most recent pictures of Neptune, in a special edition of Scientific American in March of 1998, show clearly how a thin band of white clouds continually surrounds the entire circumference of Neptune at the same latitude as the Great Dark Spot. No explanation or guess is ventured for why this would be. Uranus has not been adequately photographed to determine if a similar spot exists there, but given the evidence in all other gas planets, it appears to be nearly certain that a similar one will be found. The implications of all of this are very significant. We have taken great pains to demonstrate how these simple geometric shapes make up the smallest “units” of pulsating energy within the Creation, and we are now seeing them emerge as stress points of circulating energy on much larger spheres, those of our planets. So far, denouncers of Hoagland have been loath to provide alternative hypotheses for why these energy upwellings would show up on these other planets. Should Hoagland be “proven” correct, it would invariably lend credibility to his other work with Mars. As we had said, Hoagland showed repeated examples of the 19.5-degree angle and e/pi ratio in the relationships between objects in the Cydonia region of Mars, where all of the anomalies such as the pyramids and Face are located. These have also been demonstrated in crop circles, as we have already shown in previous chapters."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Returning to our study of the dynamics of the tetrahedron in the sphere, the Cydonia complex is almost exactly 120 degrees, or one third, of the way across Mars from where the giant Olympus Mons volcano is. As anyone can see, 120 is exactly one third of 360. Thus, we can see that the distance between two tetrahedral points on a globe should be 120 degrees, as the tetrahedron would divide the globe into three equal parts. The question then becomes, why would anyone want to build Cydonia, a complex of pyramids, in that spot? We must assume that they were somehow harnessing energy that the tetrahedron was emitting. However, Cydonia is well above the 19.5-degree point. [Although Hoagland's team points out that the latitude at the top of the D&M Pyramid is exactly 40.87 degrees, which is precisely the arctangent of e/pi, or 0.865.] Here is one possible answer. Even though the Cydonia complex is not built upon the upwelling itself, there may be a sort of energy longitude line that extends directly upwards and downwards, crossing the point of the tetrahedron. If this were true, we should expect that the tetrahedron would create vertical bands of usable energy that would all be separated from each other by 120 degrees, and would run north to south. The arctangent of e/pi might well be another focus point or energy node that was very useful at the time of Cydonia's \"construction.\" This same phenomenon appears on the Earth. This can be seen in the work of Carl Munck, our global grid researcher who discovered a system of coordinates that includes nearly every sacred site on earth. In his book, The Code 1997, he shows how all of the Egyptian pyramids can be lined up into a very narrow strip that runs straight north and south."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" The first thing that we should see in the image is how closely the Nile River follows along with the grid line. This follows along quite well with our idea that the grid lines carry flowing currents of energy. These same currents cause spiraling vortices to be formed in the gas planets, such as the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Furthermore, if we draw a “node point” similar to the circles on the edges of the tetrahedron in the Barbury Castle crop circle, it precisely describes the boundary of the Nile River delta to the ocean. Since Gizeh is at exactly 30 degrees North latitude, we will soon see that this becomes the node point of the intersection of two other Platonic solids. From the effect of this point on the Egyptian coast, it appears that the strength of these forces not only cause volcanoes, but they actually shape and mold the land around themselves. Munck then shows us that if you go exactly one third of the way around the Earth, you come to Mesoamerica, home of the Aztecs and Maya. A literally identical grid band shows up exactly where we would expect it to be – 120 degrees from Gizeh, as we see in the image on this page. Clearly the entire pyramid complex of Tikal conforms to the north-south grid line configuration. If you extend the line further north, it also encompasses an obscure pyramid and related artifacts that were found submerged under Rock Lake in Wisconsin. Munck goes into much greater detail about the significance of these artifacts than we will here. Later we will see how these shapes precisely define where they are on the Grid through their measurements. The reader is encouraged to purchase Munck's material for further information."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" So, if a grid band represents a stress point in the energy that is creating every molecule on the Earth moment by moment, then we should expect that an area of higher stress would mold the shape of the land around it. If you look closely at the Yucatan area of Mesoamerica where the line rises, you see that the entire peninsula behaves as though a force of some kind had called it into alignment with the grid band itself. It neatly follows it between the lines and cleaves off in an almost horizontal straight line. This is more evidence of the force that the harmonic energy of the grid band really has. The main grid line passing through Gizeh also obviously has similar power, as it might be responsible for centering the entire landmass of Africa. After all, the longitude line passing through Gizeh has the largest amount of land touching it at any point on Earth. The main point that we want to show here is that the Rock Lake area appears to be harnessing energy. As Munck writes, ...it is common knowledge around Rock Lake that people see things that aren’t really there, like great rocks floating on top of the lake, only to vanish a few hours later. Ice fishermen trying to start their chainsaws out on the ice can’t get them to run. Once back on the shore they run fine, but returning to the ice, they again refuse to start. Scuba divers, trying to film the submerged"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"pyramids, can’t get their cameras to work near the pyramids. Back ashore, they work fine. Other scuba divers, as they prepare to enter the lake, are suddenly filled with a sense of dread. So, just from Munck’s brief description, we can see that there is apparently an energetic disturbance going on in this area that is strong enough to cause both mechanical failure as well as effects related to consciousness. As our idea here is that these areas represent stress points of higher-dimensional, intelligent energy, both theories would fit. The higher frequencies of energy would render such things as spark plugs for chainsaws and batteries for electronic cameras inoperable, as it would actually change the vibratory rate of electromagnetic frequencies in that area, thus making them incompatible with ordinary devices. This is a literally identical result to the observations that have been made when a UFO closely approaches an area; all mechanical / electrical items stop functioning. So, the same higher energy forces that the UFO is capable of harnessing will also arise from the Earth more powerfully in certain locations. These frequencies would also be occurring on the consciousness level, thus possibly causing hallucinations and emotional reactions. A similar reaction seems to occur in the presence of UFOs, leading people to have \"screen visions\" and anxiety, as well as euphoria and the sense that \"all time had stopped\" or become silent. It appears that the builders of the Rock Lake artifacts were harnessing usable energy, and modern people have yet to be able to put it to good use for feats of consciousness. So just to better orient ourselves, let us look at what we have so far in terms"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"of our grid bands. The following map from Munck’s book will help us to see clearly where everything is. We will also introduce the tetrahedron into the diagram in order to help visualize its proper placement. Now we know that Rock Lake has demonstrated anomalies. But what about Tikal? Carl Munck discusses the main pyramid at Tikal, which is at the lower portion of the American grid line at the Yucatan, indicating that it is unique in several ways. First, its depth shows an exact harmonic of the equatorial circumference of the Earth in feet - 24.9015, which is a harmonic of 24,901.5 statute miles. He goes on to show how the Tikal pyramid encodes the exact measurement for the surface area of a sphere, which will always be 41252.96127 square degrees. When we multiply this sphere number by three, representing the three staircases on the pyramid, one discovers the pyramid’s exact longitudinal coordinates on the Grid! This looks very curious, as we are taking a number representing a sphere and using it in a set of three. This is just like our tetrahedron dividing the spherical Earth into thirds. CARL MUNCK AND THE SCIENCE OF ARCHEOCRYPTOGRAPHY A good introduction to Carl Munck's work can be found here , in his Code books or videotapes and in any of the Laura Lee Show broadcasts where he has appeared as a guest host. Further independent research can be found from Joe Mason et al.'s study group known as \"The Code Gang\" at www.greatdreams.com/gem1.htm, and they also appeared on the Laura Lee Show. From all of these sources, what we basically learn is that Munck has single-handedly derived a complex system of mathematics that shows a worldwide grid system in use. But this is not like any other grid system we"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"have been dealing with! It is interesting to point out that Munck was initially inspired by the work of Edgar Cayce. In one of the Cayce Readings, a questioner asked if we would ever be able to understand the pyramids. The remarkable reply was that we would first have to understand the \"mathematical precisions of the Earth.\" And, as Munck puts it, \"To me, that says two things very loudly: Math and maps.\" From this interesting point of departure, Munck takes us on a mathematical joyride, where synchronistic numbers of the Earth's measurements seem to emerge everywhere he looks. Munck asserts that the ancients used a 360-degree system, the same as we now use. Furthermore, his evidence indicates that the Prime Meridian was once located in a different area, which actually appears to be a far more appropriate area, as we shall see. Our current positioning of it in Greenwich, England is basically due to the early years of European conquest and scientific hegemony. Munck's work shows conclusively that the Ancients used Gizeh, Egypt as zero longitude or the Prime Meridian. Were a society able to perceive the crystalline energies running through a sphere, it would be obvious to put the Prime Meridian at the point where all of them were balanced together. Munck indicates this point to be in Egypt, straight through the Great Pyramid. The reason for this being the \"balance point\" is easily seen with the distribution of the continents, as Gizeh, Egypt is the only place on Earth where \"Great Circles\" around the Earth's circumference can be drawn in every direction and the total amount of land that they cover, as opposed to ocean, is higher than any other spot. In other words, Gizeh is the true center of gravity on the Earth's surface, a \"node\" that all of the continents seem to resolve to. So, there is no other intersection point on Earth where these great circle lines will cover a larger amount of planetary landmass than Gizeh. Most pyramid researchers think that the Egyptians built the pyramid at this spot simply to map out the planet and impress us with precision. What we are saying here is that the builders had no choice but to build the Great Pyramid exactly where it is, if they wanted it to work properly. The reason why it is the gravitational balance point of the world’s continents is that the harmonic crystalline structure of the Earth's vibrations arranged them that way, in the same manner as how it curved the land surrounding the Nile Delta. The Great Pyramid is built over the single most powerful vortex on the entire planet, where the lines of the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron all cross. Drs. William Becker and Bethe Hagens will show us this in the next chapter with their Grid map. So, although Munck doesn't delve into the Platonic solids, he has determined where their center point is. Munck has not made a worldwide geometric \"grid map\" per se, in the sense of a diagram that can be easily charted over the Earth's surface from which physical observations and / or predictions can be made. But, in The Code, we do see smaller examples of four or five sites that fit together with straight lines in what Munck calls \"kite-shaped\" patterns. So, if there is no \"grand map\" in his model, why does Munck call it a \"grid?\" How do we visualize a grid without a precise map of it? To make the summary statement of Munck's work more precise, we could say that what Munck has actually discovered is a ubiquitous, planet-wide system of coordinates. According to Munck's startling evidence, this coordinate"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"system was mutually agreed upon by almost all builders of Sacred Sites on Earth, regardless of where these sites may be. This coordinate system works off of a 360-degree sphere, with the Great Pyramid, or the center of the Platonic Solids on Earth, as the Prime Meridian. The next question that immediately arises is how the Ancients could have put coordinates into their monuments. Clearly they did not carve the latitude and longitude numbers into the sides of their temples, or else we would have found them already! While the Ancients certainly could have tried to do this, their true method was far, far more elegant. What these ingenuous architects did was to work the coordinates into the actual structures of the objects they built! All over the world, Munck shows how the actual structure of the sacred object, the number of faces, stairs, sides, terraces and other features that it contains, reveals its code numbers. In other words, the basic \"numbers\" for an object are acquired by simply counting up its visible features. Many of the Mayan temples have large numbers of stairs, and Munck eloquently shows how these numbers add up together. So again, the actual shape and structure of the object itself gives its crucial coordinate numbers. Once this is done, the numbers are combined with some basic and obvious form of addition, multiplication, subtraction or division, and then combined with a special \"constant\" that we will discuss in the next chapter. This forms a larger number that Munck calls the \"Grid Point Value.\" It is this number that provides the key to the coordinate position, for Munck shows that a simple mathematical operation on the latitude or longitude coordinates will come up with the same exact number, down to many decimal places! This simple operation is conducted by adding, multiplying or dividing the number of degrees by the number of minutes by the number of seconds in the coordinates. So again, once you get the basic formula from the structure of the object itself, your next step is to factor in certain basic mathematical constants. All of these constants, such as pi, would be universal throughout all planetary societies. No matter where you live, if you assign a circle a diameter of 1 unit, the circumference will measure 3.14159 units. Since numbers like this represent mathematical laws that cannot be altered, they were used to interplay against the basic measurements of the structure itself. And what we are left with is a truly ingenuous system that transcends all language barriers. When Munck's formula is used to factor in simple, universal constants to the outside features and measurements of the sacred site, the results are very significant. All over the world, with extreme redundancy, all manner of different sacred sites will literally describe exactly where they are on the Grid, in terms of a 360-degree coordinate system with the Prime Meridian at Gizeh. The basic units of length measurement that are used in Munck's system are miles, feet and inches, and it is these \"English\" units that provide the remarkable results. Obviously, this forces us to believe that these units are a lot more archaic than we normally would think, as in most Pyramidological literature, ancient measuring units are often seen as \"Primitive Inches,\" \"Cubits,\" \"Stades,\" \"Furlongs\" and the like. The article that we referenced above on Laura Lee's website shows some of Munck's simplest and most impressive work in decoding the Mayan Pyramid of Kukulcan. The author of this book pondered for a long time about why Munck didn't boil everything down to a visual map of some sort, involving a series of interconnecting lines, as this was what he had expected to see when he first"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"received his copy in 1997. Since the Platonic Solids clearly seem to be in effect, the question became this: how would we get Munck's sacred sites to work with the Grid that we do know about? This question was actually one that Wilcock's own extraterrestrial telepathic sources posed to him when he was in trance, back in Spring of 1997. At this time, he was simply told to \"combine the work of Carl Munck and Bruce Cathie together.\" As we have just seen in the last chapter, Cathie's work is quite complex, and Munck's work certainly is as well. At the time of this writing, nearly two years after the fact, David's sources finally answered the original question in a reading. By this point, David had finally done enough research to be able to receive the answer, and he was now also aware that he was in contact with Ra, the same extraterrestrial group that created the Law of One series with Don Elkins, Carla Rueckert and Jim Mc Carty. Reading 53-29 started with a dream that David had awakened from, featuring a canary that was perched on a piece of concrete inside an attic. A huge explosive noise happened outside, and the shock wave seemed to travel through the air, killing the canary instantly. At the same time, the number 1080 flashed in gigantic form, taking up his entire view. Then, it stopped, and he woke up soon afterwards. After dictating this part of the dream, he made this first initial statement: D: I am getting the metaphor here that this dream has something to do with the lunar number 1080, the climate canary dying, indicating upcoming danger, caused by something at a distance that ruptured the ground right in front of the canary. It sounds like a formula, again, telling me of an earthquake, and with the number 1080, telling me that it has something to do with when the moon is going to be full, possibly giving us a time. I don't know. All this dictation must have started around 3:28 a.m. Right away, Ra proceeded to answer the question about what the dream might have meant. In this part of the reading, there is a prediction of further major earthquakes that would occur in 1999, which was certainly seen after the reading was transmitted -- 1999 was the most intense seismological year in recorded history, with several very severe earthquakes above seven points on the Richter scale. Furthermore, we can see that the dream may well have been speaking of the alignment of the Moon with the Sun on Aug. 11, and the substantial land shifts that occurred soon afterwards. In that sense it was very accurate! True to form, the spherical mass of gravity will become more regularized as a constant in the approaching months and years. In order to do this, it has to renew and revivify the connection to the instreaming fourth density positive solar energy. This comes about indirectly through the polarity of the inhabitants, and more directly through the inevitable realignment of the global grid itself. This aspect of change is not necessarily malleable, although with the harmony of the inhabitants, it can be met at a much slower speed, hence much less disastrous. The connection we have is to the Source Self of All Beingness; we are that Light as well. Know then that this contact will continue to occur as the greater effort is then made to seeking the Christ Light within you. All you need to do is begin imagining the unutterable name of the One, and you will then be on your way to arriving home."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"These [consciousness] units are comparable to a host of other multilayered presences, and in so doing, they encompassed a single unit in and of themselves, which was a function of the interaction between large and small, the planetary field and the individual (or apparent individual) entity field. Separation does not exist, as there is a consciousness unit formed from this unity, even as the global grid is formed. Now this appears to be a most interesting comment that Ra wanted to interject as we have discussed consciousness units and the global grid. What they seem to be telling us here is that we as human \"entities\" are also part of the Global Grid, and together with the planet, we all fuse together into one, gigantic consciousness unit in our own right. Obviously, this is a very dynamic phenomenon, affected by population centers, human travel from one location to another, et cetera. So, we construct and affect the grid by where we choose to position ourselves. The next sentence below is obviously working off of Hoagland's work, where the measurements of the Cydonia complex on Mars show us the mathematics of the circumscribed tetrahedron. Then, Ra addressed David directly, regarding the assembly of this book. Those ancient monuments [on Mars] have kept the ball rolling for hundreds of thousands of years, and now you are accurately discerning their message of physics with relation to rotating spherical mass and to the inscribed geometric shapes therein. Do not fail to realize importance of what you are now doing. To an onlooker from another plane, it is quite extraordinary to see you becoming able to put all these things together. That fact alone has made us very happy. Part of why we mentioned 1080 in this dream is in order for you to be able to give some of the basic information indicated by John Michell regarding the harmonic proportions of the earth and moon in miles, as this will help round out the idea of the true harmonicity of the Earth's polar surface in times past. As we touched on already, Michell's work shows us that the Moon's diameter in statute miles is exactly 2,160, or 2 x 1080. Through some special mathematics, he shows the fundamental harmonic relationship between the Earth and the Moon. As one example of Michell's unique work, he reveals that we are the only planet where the Moon is precisely big enough and at just the right distance to produce total solar eclipses with a visible corona. Other moons are usually too small to do this, based on the relative position of the planet to the Sun. Never before have I been able to speak so closely to you, and it is with my consciousness that we are able to meld as One, and merge into the depths. So now as we come closer to understanding this Oneness, we feel compelled to shake off the boundaries that have surrounded us as we have studied the circumscribed tetrahedron within the sphere and other things. Instead, realize that it does all make sense, it does all fit together, and you will indeed be coming home very soon. We underline and stress the word very. The moment by moment transformation of your very existence is wondrous for us to behold, as we see you are completing paths of karma that might indeed have taken thousands of years otherwise. [David,] your romantic"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"seclusion with self has indeed been productive of a great number and variety of ways for you to remain whole and complete in a short period of time in the present. As a result of this, the next time we have to look into the looking glass, we will have come even farther and made even more progress, conducted even more readings, lived more fruitful, more fully energetic lives. The \"romantic seclusion with self\" that they are speaking of represents David's own ability to face the issues within the self over a long, extended period of almost complete solitude. That solitude and \"alone time\" has provided substantial benefits, including this book and other works. All too often, we surround ourselves with distraction, including TV, radio and the presence of others, and we never enter into true silence. Know right now that it's different. You are able to walk and talk a deliberate continuum of events that includes the discrete past as well as the discrete future. The hoarders of this information have not given it to you in the way in which you would like. Rather, they continue groping blindly forward, lacking direction and substance in their meanderings. Let's focus more on the addendum to the author's preface, and see the transformation that must occur now waiting in the wings. Saturn and its rings beckon you to rejuvenate your full contact with the Council therein. Many times David's readings will say things that are not immediately understandable, rather phrased in metaphorical language that must be personally decoded for meaning. And thus, we interpret the \"hoarders of this information\" as representing those people who have allegedly channeled material, but it is actually coming from their conscious minds. This is obviously a very common phenomenon, and as a result a great deal of contradictory information abounds on the Internet and elsewhere. Since the main topic is Earth Changes, we can see that Ra is explaining that it is our own consciousness and focus that determines how quickly these changes must occur. In the next paragraph, Ra speaks on David's own reluctance to receive any psychic material related to Earth Changes. To know these blessings is a great gift, and we achieve it second by second as you feel this sense of belongingness. Do not worry about how all of this will happen, or about why you feel that it is necessary to run and hide with regard to Earth Change prophecies. Instead, see the whole issue as a volleyball game with Spirit. Both sides of the net are trying to keep the ball up into the air, but it is Spirit that has created both sides, as well as the net, the ground that surrounds it, and the air that the players breathe. The forces in the earth are like the two sides of volleyball team, pushing and pulling, giving you a summary of different stresses. The discarnate forms of the enlightened could be construed as part of this game, with conscious humanity on the other side. Know then that in our heart of hearts, we only want the best for you. We only want what is right. We are also aware that the 75,000 years of your karma is ending, and a gateway more massive and spectacular than anything you could have ever imagined is now extraordinarily soon to open. The seeds become simpler, then, when you understand how to sow them. In order to create the necessary learning experiences to positively polarize the entities upon your plane in a short time, we have been mandated by the flow of energy from within each of you to continue to guide your planetary sphere"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"in this direction. So we have a cavity of sorts developing. A cavity that needs to be filled, a blemish on the tooth that must needs be drilled out and filled in with porcelain. In order to keep you are aware of revolution, both human revolution and the revolution of the music of the spheres, it is necessary to begin asking some very simple questions: Who am I, where did I come from, and where am I going. The information superhighway is up and running, and we are but one example of how it is that a planet of information resounds around you in this Creation. As we prepare to venture deeper forward into higher realms, we also know and understand that the most anyone can do is to aspire to God. So, we have a unique balancing beam act that we must portray - we delicately point out the ways in which your own equilibrium and balance as a planet is kept with such great care and determination. From this point, David directly tackles the topics already being discussed in these chapters by asking Ra a series of precise questions about this work. His biggest question was how to rectify the difference between Bruce Cathie's units of harmonic time and distance with the figures shown in Munck's work, relating to traditional English inches, feet and miles. D: I would like to ask a question. I have been doing some pretty involved work on trying to fit together Richard Hoagland, the work of Bruce Cathie, which I have expanded upon considerably, the work of Carl Munck and also Becker / Hagens. So here's the catch-22. Bruce Cathie uses a system that seems to be derived based on, predominantly based on, division, addition, subtraction and multiplication, those four basic operators. There are some square roots in there, and I guess that there are squares and cubes as well. So, the operators are basically the same, but there are no trig functions as I see it. I haven't seen any tangents, secants, any of that stuff. Actually, it is usually tangent, cosine, sine. Anyway, this system of measurement seems to be based completely on units of arc, a degree measurement system based on 360. That is how he measures everything. And, that system of measurement is connected with the harmonic values for Light, and that is how I am using it now, to express the harmonicity of our mathematics with regards to the dimensional frequencies. And then on the other hand, we have Carl Munck, who has accurately set the prime meridian at Giza, and we have such fantastic redundancy in his numbers as to be truly stunning. Now in his case, he is using a system of feet and inches and miles to derive his measurements. There is definitely some stuff that makes the idea of using [the English system of inches, feet and miles] look good, specifically the [measurements of the] moon. I think I am starting to get the answer here already. Could you please explain how we rectify these two differing systems of measurement together, since you had asked me to combine this data? [And now, we get the answer:] When one utilizes an advanced function of research like this, we need to keep in mind that the answers are more difficult than the questions. Understand,"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"then, that what we are looking at is indeed two overlapping systems, wherein the grid measured by Cathie is in effect, and can indeed be mapped with great precision upon the Earth's surface. What you have in the case of Carl Munck is the rediscovery of the cosmic or Atlantean influence upon modern measurements; that influence centered more purely and concretely in the regular foot, inch and mile measurement. As you have seen, the harmonic values of the Moon's diameter, the 2160 miles, et cetera, are all very good. And thus, we do not wish to confuse you, merely to state the following. When it comes to the spherical mass of the Earth, relative to its grid and so forth, it is necessary to view this grid by and large as occurring within the 360-degree system. So therefore, although your terrestrial scientists have referred to one minute of arc as a nautical mile, it is better to understand that this is in a sense its own animal, its own form of measurement. What we have with Munck's discoveries is a reaffirmation of the validity of one of the two major rediscoveries of modern human civilization; namely, this lost system of notation. At this point, the flow stopped. From what small amount David could follow as it came through, he could tell that the question was not answered with very much specificity. So, he probed them for more information. D: Well, okay. Do you have any further knowledge as to how to resolve these two grids together? Understand that to a large degree, many of the earth works that you see were designed simply to worship and honor the Earth itself. And thus, certain harmonic points on the globe were indeed a function of the global grid in its various forms. It was at these points that the monuments were chosen to have been built. There is some intricate-level work that could be done on all of this, and we will leave that to future authors. What we can say is that you have already given us far more to be proud of you for than we could have ever imagined possible. The important point is to remember Munck's main discovery, which is this. The ancients devised a system that was very simple, a system of mathematics. This system enabled them to encode the positions in degrees upon whatever earthwork or stone object was in question, with relation to the global grid. This global grid's prime meridian was, as we said, centered through the Great Pyramid of Giza, and this is based upon the mathematical precisions of the Earth with relevance to the interplay of the various geometric shapes and their various frequencies and foci - two tetrahedra back to back, et cetera. Upon continuation of this concept, we then see that the fifth harmonic interval on the musical scale plays an important part. As it sounds well to your ears, so too does it resonate well with the grid. This is indicative of why the Cathie grid as charted out, obviously by Bruce Cathie, favors so strongly the geometrical positions of the octahedron for your own level and the cube for the fifth. This does illustrate a certain balance/imbalance now present within the Earth's temporary equilibrium. We would like to think of the fifth density energy as lying dormant in potential for your people now, although very strong and close to the surface for us."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Therefore, we see Cathie's discoveries regarding UFO tracklines and the like strongly favoring this particular shape, as it is the easiest to use, and by far the strongest to see. The other shapes do have an effect, and have had their effects in the position of landmasses and the various gravity anomalies that you have seen. So, it is important to look at everything here on the drawing board. As we have said, Munck's discoveries involved counting the number of visible features on the earthwork, pyramid or temple in question, and then multiplying or dividing these numbers by some of the fundamental constants Munck has discovered, such as 1.177245771, cetera. The cube root of double pi is another such constant. This point in the reading can be clarified more precisely by reminding ourselves that Munck's measurements come about by multiplying or dividing the numbers within the degree, minute and second coordinates of the earthwork in latitude and longitude. One simply multiplies or divides the number of degrees by the number of minutes by the number of seconds. This operation (usually) produces a single irrational number, or a number with a decimal point. Then, when you multiply the visible features of the earthwork together with one of the basic constants that we mentioned, you end up with this same number. It is the two systems working together that produces the accurate Grid coordinates. Munck calls these \"sum numbers\" the Grid Point Values for any earthwork. Now, the reading continues: By working together these disparate sources of information, and working in the basic constants, we may indeed then see, as Munck has accurately noted, that time after time, again and again, literally all major stone works or earthworks upon the Earth's surface have precisely encoded their coordinates upon the grid in latitude and longitude. This is by no means a small feat, but indicative of the amazing degree of precision and fastidiousness with which those who built pyramids have been involved, among others. D: Okay, well I guess that was the end of my question. Let's see if I can refine it a little bit. Would Carl Munck's discoveries work better with the Becker / Hagens system, or the Cathie system, and if there is a difference, could you please explain what the difference is? [Note: The Becker / Hagens system employs all of the Platonic Solids together as one, and we will examine it in the next chapter of this book.] In order to understand this coordinate system, it will be necessary to study more concretely the interplay of various forces integrated as a whole, including diamagnetic energy vortices, and the summation between magnetic lines of force and plate push. This was all well illustrated by Dr. Richard Lefors Clark. Lest you be frightened by the size or volume of this data, we remind you that there are no worthless paths in the Creation. All paths are part of the One Creator, and all will lead you back home. The siting of these ancient monuments reflects quite nicely the system of physics that was understood, and the careful encoding of certain areas on the grid's nexi of electromagnetic instreaming force. The work of Dr. Clark will be discussed in our next chapter, and the source of the article that they are referring to is in David Hatcher Childress' book, Anti- Gravity and the World Grid. Dr. Clark shows that in addition to studying the"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Global Grid, we also need to consider the shape of continents and the directions that the plates are moving in order to figure out where the greatest energetic upwellings will be. He expresses these \"stress lines\" as bowtie- shaped \"diamagnetic energy vortices,\" and we will cover this in the next chapter. So, what Ra is telling us in this reading is that these earthworks were not simply built on \"node points\" of the Global Grid, but on complex intersections or stress points between the Grid and the other forces at work on the planet. And thus, these earthworks were not so much built according to one single Grid map, but rather constructed where they needed to be built. As the reading goes on, we will see why they were so necessary. These separate points had structures built around them in order to make them useful for the purposes of healing and / or planetary balancing. These were the two primary functions, as we have already stated in the Ra Material. So therefore, in going about this in the most complete way possible, we can see that without having done this to such amazing fastidiousness and precision, then the system itself would have been incomplete. In many cases, it was the structure itself that was of highest import, not as much the way that it was built, which was to encode its grid latitude and longitude position. The structure itself was necessary to be built along certain lines in order to regularize the energy flows therein. And thus, you do see a great many stone circles, or earth circles, as in certain cases, the circle is by far the most adequate energy regularizer for grid fluctuations. Remember that these grid fluctuations are caused largely by the consciousness of the planet's inhabitants. And thus, in the ancient civilizations of the past, these fluctuations were being offset by higher level races coexisting with those in a much more primitive state, who were not capable of discernment, and did create disharmony to a large extent. Munck writes a great deal about the \"Mound Builders\" in North America, and shows his Grid mathematics coming into play in the construction of many large circles of earth, most of which are in Florida. And now, we have seen the Miami Circle as well, an \"inverse Stonehenge\" where there are sockets in the ground in place of standing lintels. Hoagland has already cited preliminary evidence that there are standing stones designed to fit within these sockets located nearby, thus equipping it as an observatory much as Seth had referred to Stonehenge, which he called \"Stockridge,\" previously. Now, Ra is telling us that the purpose of these circles was to balance and redistribute chaotic Earth energies. And so, when a man tries to reach 0 degrees longitude and 30 degrees latitude, he will come upon the Great Pyramid. In this way, then, all other objects do encode their position relative to the Great Pyramid, and this measurement is stored by the construction method itself. You might then ask why this is necessary. Our answer is thusly stated: By inducing an appreciation for the Code's measurements among the populace, the ancients were able to indeed preserve their records. The most important reason for why this coordinate system was done was to insure that the proper usage of the Grid be maintained for future generations; namely, the accurate setting of the Giza pyramid as the Prime Meridian. It was for this reason that it was done, as it was important that those who would come in later decades of Divine days, shall we say, would then be able"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"to reconfigure the global grid based upon the coordinate point of the earthwork they had found. Here they refer to the Bible quote, \"a thousand years are but a day in the eye of the Lord.\" So, a \"decade\" would be 10,000 years. They are obviously dating these monuments by making that statement. And so, this was indeed a very important way of keeping track of their own system of measurements, to then have a living file index, if you will, that allows for the necessary information to be reconstructed at will if even one earthwork was found, and the code then understood to the initiate in dreams and visions and the like. Archeocryptographer Carl Munck has indeed exceeded our expectations quite well, and has gone beyond the normal boundaries of ordinary reality to prove those things that might seem far above simple to you. It is for this reason that we commend him as having a major part in the rediscovery of Atlantean physics, mathematics and science. This grid encoding system was indeed very valuable, and thus wherever you look you will find it. This is the reason why Munck has continued to discover such amazing feats of geometry and mathematics wherever he looks. This also has to do with why he has found similar connections with the Cydonia complex [on Mars,] then linking it to Earth. As the overseeing spiritual forces in both areas are the same, so too have they built or collaborated in the building of the earthwork structures for the various inhabitants of these points. Remember then that this is, as you would term it, an alien science, given by the Council of Saturn and the Confederation of Planets at large, to whomever might be of the presence of mind to use it. This system is so applicable and so effective in its format that it is, in a sense, the universal standard: to simply count the faces up of the object in question, to take its measurements and then work in those measurements against known fundamental mathematical universal constants, then encoding its grid position based on the 360-degree coordinate system that is an aspect of Divine Creation in its usage of fundamental frequency numbers of sound, geometry and light. And thus, the Law of One is satisfied in whatever form necessary, and you see a passive planetary science being introduced into the various societies and civilizations therein as they approach readiness. And thus, there are many similarities, and Munck is indeed accurate in setting the Martian prime meridian in Cydonia, at the point of the D & M pyramid, the giant five-sided mound that was home to so many entities at one time. We now take our leave of you, and remind you that this work you are doing is of paramount importance to the future of human civilization. Do not fail to underestimate the power of your contributions and their significance, as it will all become readily apparent in the very near future. You may indeed reprint this reading into the transcript of your book, in order to help discuss Munck's work more clearly. We thank you. Peace be with you in the Light of everlasting Love. D: The time now is 4:33. It has been about an hour."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"And so, with this reading and the data concerning Munck that we have discussed, the implications are quite significant, as it indicates that literally the entire world’s collection of sacred sites were created and mapped precisely by what had to have been a global culture. And, the erection of these monuments had a discrete and perfectly understandable science behind them -- the balancing and harnessing of planetary energies. We also were given a hint as to the connecting link between Munck's work on these monuments and our Platonic, consciousness-unit based Global Grid. Complex stresses are at work, and the monuments were built where they were needed to be located to provide for the balancing of Earth energies. The design of the monuments was crafted in such a way as to illustrate their coordinates. Our initial point of entry into this material was to show how these \"grid bands\" showed up on both Mars and Earth. We had printed a map of the Egyptian and American \"grid bands\" above, and demonstrated their value in determining the siting of ancient monuments. We also could see how the gravitational energies of the Earth itself seemed to be affected, by the structure of the Yucatan in Mexico and the placement of the Nile River and its delta in Egypt. So let’s refresh our memory on the grid bands with a quote from Munck, as we pursue the real meaning behind them. ...It appears most of the pyramids between 120 and 121 degrees west of Giza will show us constants in the same way. Just why they do I am not yet certain, but 120 degrees is 1/3rd of the way around the world from Giza, hence 1/3rd of a full 360 - degree Earth. It could be as simple as that. If our model is correct, the entire tetrahedron should show itself on the planet through grid bands. Yet there is nothing in Munck’s books about the third band, which as we can see in the earlier diagram would be right near Japan. As we investigate this concept further, a few points should become obvious. The Japanese islands are volcanic, as everyone knows. Hoagland shows us Olympus Mons on Mars, a volcano three times the size of Mount Everest that is right on the grid point of the tetrahedron. So, if we look at the entire structure of Japan, we see that it is essentially a big strip of land that runs nearly parallel to where our grid band would be, and actually crosses over it at the top. Near to where it crosses is the island of Okinawa. And it is right near this area that we find our next clue to the mystery. Laura Lee was the first major media outlet to reveal pictures of submerged megalithic structures off the coast of Yonaguni, a small island near Okinawa. The Japanese researchers working on this are unanimous in agreement that they could not have been above water for at least the last 12,000 years. Though not true pyramids, the structures have amazing rectilinear geometry to their design and easily dwarf the scuba divers swimming around them. They also are built with successive layers of massive blocks that taper inwards as one goes higher up the sides. This portion of the structure looks very similar to a step-pyramid or ziggurat, as well as being a parallel to the Central American designs such as Tikal."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Therefore, with Japan we can see that our third grid band is satisfied. The Ring of Fire, which is the violent intersection of various continental plates, follows closely to the band and crosses it at Japan. Massive geometric energy forced the land / ocean barrier around Gizeh into a circle shape and causes one of the world’s largest rivers to flow \"upwards,\" or South to North, unlike the Mississippi, which is North to South. Similarly, the mighty tetrahedron grid band shows its muscle by causing tremendous upward force on the continental plates at the Far Eastern side of the Asian continent. So, we can see yet another example of a massive site that was built in an area that would allow it to balance and harness chaotic Earth energies. We can certainly see the chaos in an area like the Ring of Fire, with such strong volcanic activity. Obviously, when the full structure of the Yonaguni megalithic stonework can be determined, it will give us its Grid position based on the multiplication of its faces, terraces and steps, together with a fundamental Earth Grid constant. Once a researcher is familiar with Munck's system, they know what they are looking for. That is why the Miami Circle yielded its Code secrets to Munck and his associates so quickly in 1999."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" The 12,000-year minimum age of the Yonaguni structure clearly shows us that this Grid system was in operation during the Atlantean time period. This archaeological finding certainly conjures up images of Lemuria or Mu; another area of land in the Pacific that sources such as Edgar Cayce’s readings insisted was above water at one point. The works of James Churchward go into great detail to legitimize the story of Mu. Indeed such ancient sites as Nan Matol and Easter Island, among others, help to show that a megalithic stoneworking culture lived there at one time. The islands are simply too small now to maintain the number of people necessary to have been able to build the structures. Our point of going into all these details regarding grid bands and energy forms is to fully explain how the Ancients were aware of its presence. This gives us concrete scientific evidence that a consciousness unit naturally harmonizes to the size of a planet, and that it produces energy with measurable effects. Certain ancient cultures appear to have built pyramids and other energy- focusing structures on these grid points and bands in order to stabilize and harness the energy that is created there. While this energy could have physical uses, sources such as Ra indicate that it has profound implications for spiritual consciousness. Such pyramidal “machines” apparently help attune people to the necessary vibrations to make a dimensional shift or energy change. This could explain the oft-cited mystery of the sudden disappearance of the entire Mayan civilization in early AD. We might hypothesize that they were able to calculate the timing of a solar / astrological event, which provided enough outside energy for them to use such structures for the purposes of making such a shift. In the next chapter, we will complete our entire discussion of the Global Grid as we bring in the Becker/Hagens evidence, showing that the other Platonic solids of the Octave also emerge in quite amazing ways. We will show repeated examples of this grid that were discovered in various scientific studies, and explain how we need to view all of the Platonic shapes together in"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"order to really “see” the grid."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 12: BECKER / HAGENS: THE GLOBAL GRID SOLUTION In this chapter, we put the capstone on our investigation of the CU's expression as the Global Grid, through the initial work of Ivan P. Sanderson, followed by three Russian scientists and culminating with the professors William Becker and Bethe Hagens. We show how the final Grid puzzle is solved when all of the basic Platonic Solids in the CU are plotted over the Earth's sphere. We see how the structure of continents and landmasses are shaped by this. Furthermore, we investigate reports concerning the mysterious disappearances and hyperdimensional effects shown in certain \"node points\" of this Grid. CHAPTER 12: BECKER / HAGENS: THE GLOBAL GRID SOLUTION We already have seen the cube and octahedron in the Earth from Cathie, and the tetrahedron across the Solar System from Hoagland. That only leaves us with the task of locating Purusha and Prakriti, the icosahedron and dodecahedron, in order for our Global Grid to be complete. It is William Becker and Bethe Hagens who ultimately solved the puzzle for us. At the time their work was published, Dr. Becker was a Professor of Industrial Design at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and Dr. Hagens was a Professor of Anthropology at Governors State University. Together, they demonstrated how these two shapes were first discovered, and then how they assimilated into the ultimate Earth Grid, which they called the Unified Vector Geometry 120 Polyhedron, or the UVG 120 \"Earth Star.\" Although we had said before that the modern history of the Global Grid may start with Bruce Cathie, the former husband-and-wife team of Becker and Hagens have a different idea. They ascribe this discovery to the work of Ivan P. Sanderson, who was the first to make a case for the structure of the icosahedron at work in the Earth. He did this by locating what he referred to as \"vile vortices,\" or areas of the Earth where mysterious disappearances, mechanical failures and time-space distortions were seen to occur. Obviously, most readers are aware that the Bermuda Triangle reports from the east coast of Florida would fall into this category, but Sanderson looked at other, less popular areas as well. These areas were often referred to as \"Devil's Graveyards,\" since many explorers simply disappeared if they crossed over them at the wrong time of year, apparently with the wrong lunar and planetary alignments activating that particular area. What initially led Sanderson to this work is the case of, as Charles Hapgood referred to them, The Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. We now know that during the time of Atlantis and perhaps much earlier, the entire Earth's coordinates had been mapped out by the construction of the different pyramids, temples and earthworks on the Earth's surface. Carl Munck demonstrates this beyond all possible doubt. Therefore, it is almost inevitably obvious that there must have been many Atlantean maps of the world at one time. These maps would have been very precise, given the level of sophistication that we have seen in the precise execution of Munck's worldwide \"Code\" of coordinates."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"We can speculate on how these maps might have been handed down, based on a variety of sources of information. We are told that after the last pole shift 12,500 years ago, the main body of Atlantean land sank. The survivors from the Atlantean priesthood kept themselves in a tight-knit, secluded monastic community, since most of the rest of humanity had descended into barbarism. Since most of the land disappeared, with only a few survivors left, it is clear that only a select few of these maps remained as well. The Sumerian civilization may have been the Atlanteans' first attempt to rebuild society to any significant degree, and this was started circa 6,000 BC- roughly 8,000 years ago. As Zecharia Sitchin and others have pointed out, the Sumerian civilization certainly seemed to spring up quite spontaneously and dramatically. In a very short amount of time, they had written language, education, laws, agriculture and running water, for example. We know that the Sumerians had the Constant of Nineveh, the cycle we discussed earlier. Then, when we factor in Dr. Zecharia Sitchin's deeper work as well, we realize that a group that had access to incredible technology aided the Sumerians, a group that possessed flying machines, lasers and other exotic equipment. A very advanced understanding of science and physics was present as well, including the knowledge of the full spectrum of planets in the Solar System. We are also told in the ancient Hindu Vedas and the Cayce Readings that Atlanteans did indeed possess flying machines, so this checks out. (It also could be that the Atlanteans were cooperating with Space Brothers that they had interacted with as well, given the preponderance of \"Ancient Astronaut\" data that is available. Sitchin's data very strongly suggests the existence of the Annunaki, or \"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came.\") The maps were kept within the high ranks of the priesthood well after the start of the Sumerian civilization, and eventually, they were secreted into the Library of Alexandria in Egypt, and later into the academic halls of Greece. It is believed that only those who were members of the secret brotherhoods knew of the existence of these maps. The argument for the secret brotherhoods' existence is extremely strong, and the best book Wilcock has ever found on this topic is The People of the Secret by Ernest Scott, Octagon Press, London 1983. Scott's work leaves no doubt whatsoever that this Brotherhood existed, that it secretly allied the major religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, and that it still persists in the present moment as a positive group that communes with Higher Intelligence and seeks to gradually unveil the Mysteries to our civilization. So, these secret brotherhoods sent out seafaring explorers to rediscover the lands that were hidden on their maps, to eventually rebuild a great, technological civilization like Atlantis. Francis Bacon, the father of modern Freemasonry, declared the American continent to be the site for the \"New Atlantis.\" And, in order to set this plan into action, the explorers themselves would need to copy over the maps, at least in part, so that they would have something they could work with. Certain authors including Hancock in Fingerprints of the Gods speculate that Columbus had access to these maps, and therefore knew that the Earth was actually round, and that new lands would be found overseas. All of this proved to be quite interesting to Ivan P. Sanderson, the \"father of"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"the Grid,\" and now we will see why. The first explorer that we are aware of who copied over one of these maps is Admiral Piri Reis, in 1513 AD. This map focuses on Africa's west coast, South America's east coast and the northern coast of Antarctica. What is so interesting is that it shows the Antarctic Queen Maud Land area as an ice-free coast. And, as Hancock writes in Fingerprints, in order for this coast to have been surveyed without ice, it would have to have been mapped between 13,000 and 4,000 BC! Modern humanity did not know the outline of this coast until 1949, as a result of a comprehensive seismic survey by a joint British-Swedish reconnaissance team. (Hancock 1995, pg. 12.) The man who put all of this map information together is Charles Hapgood, however his theories did not initially start with these maps. Hapgood was a History of Science professor at Keene College in New Hampshire, although his areas of inquiry obviously went far beyond simple history. Hapgood's basic theory concerns Earth crustal displacement, a close analog to the idea of \"pole shift,\" where the surface of the Earth actually changes position. Hapgood says that the entire surface crust of the Earth \"may be displaced at times, moving over the soft inner body, much as the skin of an orange, if it were loose, might shift over the inner part of the orange all in one piece.\" This theory drew the attention of Albert Einstein as well, who contributed the forward to Hapgood's 1953 book. Einstein's quote, reprinted on pg. 10 of Hancock's book, is definitely worth inserting here: \"I frequently receive communications from people who wish to consult me concerning their unpublished ideas [Einstein observed]. It goes without saying that these ideas are very seldom possessed of scientific validity. The very first communication, however, that I received from Mr. Hapgood electrified me. His idea is original, of great simplicity, and - if it continues to prove itself - of great importance to everything that is related to the history of the earth's surface.\" Einstein also expressed his own ideas as to how this earth movement might occur: \"In a polar region there is continual deposition of ice, which is not symmetrically distributed about the pole. The earth's rotation acts on these unsymmetrically deposited masses, and produces centrifugal momentum that is transmitted to the rigid crust of the earth. The constantly increasing centrifugal momentum produced in this way will, when it has reached a certain point, produce a movement of the earth's crust over the rest of the earth's body...' And so, Hapgood's theory explained that at various points in time, the landmass of Antarctica would move out of the coldest regions, by Earth Crustal Displacement. And, he certainly wins \"brownie points,\" since the best scientist who ever lived substantiated his theory. In later chapters we will see that these facts harmonize with the information from Gregg Braden regarding the rise in the Earth's \"heartbeat\" and decrease in its magnetic field strength. Braden reveals that these phenomena have always occurred directly before cases of magnetic pole shift in the past, which could well be \"Earth Crustal Displacement\" in action. We can see that if Hapgood's theory is correct, the Atlantean inundation was"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the most recent example of this displacement, as prior to this point, many maps were drawn of Antarctica without ice. Therefore, the shifting Earth's crust must have positioned Antarctica in a warmer area before the most recent displacement. So, Hapgood's model is the best conception that we have for why Antarctica would be in a warmer region. Along with Fingerprints of the Gods, the book When the Sky Fell by Rand and Rose Flem-Ath is also an excellent source for further scientific detail on these points. The other maps that also showed Antarctica under the ice included the Oronteus Finaeus map of 1531. In this case, we get a complete view of Antarctica, with the edges largely uncovered by ice. Rivers and mountains are clearly visible. Another very similar map was produced by Gerard Kremer, known to the world as Mercator, the author of the modern Mercator map projection that is now so commonly used. Hapgood concludes that Mercator had access to other source maps besides those used by Oronteus Finaeus, since many recognizable features of Antarctica are more clearly visible in his work. So, it appears that there were definitely several copies available during those times. Another mapmaker who demonstrated equal sourcing and knowledge was Phillippe Buache, a French geographer of the eighteenth century. His 1737 map shows us a version of Antarctica that apparently has no ice on it at all! As we can see, there is a clear waterway that runs straight through the middle, dividing the continent into two main landmasses, one large and one smaller, perhaps a fifth the size of the larger. What makes this even more amazing is that the Buache version of Antarctica is nearly identical to what we actually discovered in 1958, as a part of International Geophysical Year. In this case, a comprehensive seismic survey"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"of the \"subglacial topography\" of Antarctica was conducted. And indeed, the separation between the landmasses, shown in the Buache map as a waterway, is in almost exactly the same place. Both the smaller and larger landmass in the Buache map are very closely approximated by the findings of the scientists in 1958. So obviously, this is a highly interesting phenomenon, and it goes hand in hand with the work of Carl Munck. Hapgood's work, which again caught the academic interest of Einstein, provides the foundation for understanding why the Ancients would have known the global coordinates as exactly as they did. We now come back to Ivan P. Sanderson, who also studied Hapgood's work and was mystified by these incredible pieces of evidence. Sanderson sought to figure out how these ancient mapmakers were able to plan out a full, global map. What type of models would they need to have in order to do something like this, and use it? How did they divide the Earth's surface up into measurable units? And furthermore, was there anything that was physically observable and measurable in the vastness of Earth's oceans, so that these mapmakers would actually know where they were in the middle of the sea? Sanderson worked on this puzzle with several associates throughout the 60s and into the 70s. He tackled huge volumes of data, mostly from anomalous reports declared by hundreds of pilots and mariners, and systematically organized them. His results proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that some very interesting anomalies were visible in certain areas of the Earth's oceans. These anomalies are all very familiar to us, as being those commonly reported in the Bermuda Triangle. This was certainly one vortex that interested Sanderson immensely, although there were other areas that were much more neglected as well. Using statistical analysis to crunch all the data together, concerning all the different places where these events occurred on the globe, Sanderson was able to derive twelve common points of anomalous occurrence on the Earth. Amazingly, these twelve points were all equally, harmonically spaced from each other! The effects of these \"vile vortices,\" as he called them, included not only disappearances but apparently time-warping events as well. Many of these were recorded in books such as Charles Berlitz's The Bermuda Triangle, but Sanderson found evidence for these time-space disturbances in the other vortices as well, not just by Bermuda. For example, one of Sanderson's vortices was located near Hawaii. He found a report of a pilot, flying with passengers very near this zone, who suddenly lost all of his instruments as well as radio communications. This is called a \"dead zone,\" or \"flying blind,\" with no ability to radio for help or to determine altitude, position, et cetera, except by \"eyeballing\" it. The pilot continued to fly for roughly 350 miles in this \"dead zone,\" without being able to connect with anyone on the radio; anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on his speed. Finally, the bizarre experience came to an end, and he was very relieved to be able to get in touch with the tower yet again. We can imagine the panic and astonishment that must have been in his voice, narrowly avoiding danger and wondering what the heck had just happened. What was so amazing and unexpected was that according to the tower officials, no time had elapsed between his radio contacts! In other words, at one moment he was speaking to them normally, and ten seconds later he was"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"in a panic, telling them that he had flown 350 miles without any instruments! As amazing as it must seem to our \"common sense,\" all passengers aboard this aircraft must have passed into a higher dimensional frequency, where they were not affected by time. The cause of this effect was the hyperdimensional energy that was harnessed by the \"vile vortex\" they were flying through. By now, the reader should not be surprised when we restate that Sanderson's twelve symmetrically spaced vortices do indeed graph out one of the Platonic solids, namely the icosahedron. This is indicated in the following illustration from Nicholas R. Nelson's book Paradox (Dorrance & Co., Ardmore, Penn. 1980,) reprinted in David Hatcher Childress' book, Anti-Gravity and the World Grid (Adventures Unlimited Press, Box 74, Kempton, Illinois 60946: 1987, 1995.) (We digitally altered the image to preserve its simplicity in this small format.) Sanderson's popular work certainly ignited a firestorm of interest worldwide. The problem was quickly picked up and tackled by a group of three Russian scientists: Nikolai Goncharov, a Muscovite historian, Vyacheslav Morozov, a construction engineer and Valery Makarov, an electronics specialist. These three scientists worked directly off of Sanderson's research, and the twelve points of the icosahedron were placed in almost the exact same location. But, these scientists also added 50 more points, by superimposing a dodecahedron onto the Grid as well. Their results produced the following map, first printed in the popular Soviet science journal Khimiyai Zhizn, (or Chemistry and Life,) reproduced in Anti-Gravity and the World Grid:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"These three scientists worked off of their combined talents to determine this \"matrix of cosmic energy\" that encircles the Earth. With this new formulation of the Global Grid, Becker and Hagens write: \"These new lines and points, in conjunction with Sanderson's, now matched most of the earth's seismic fracture zones and ocean ridge lines as well as outlined worldwide atmospheric highs and lows, paths of migratory animals, gravitational anomalies, and even the sites of ancient cities.\" Becker and Hagens' attention was drawn to this research through the work of Chris Bird, who wrote his article on the \"Planetary Grid\" in the New Age Journal of May 1975. They were so overwhelmed with this new information that they eventually set up a meeting with him to discuss the work. Soon after this, they \"completed\" the Grid, making it compatible with all the Platonic Solids, by inserting a creation from Buckminster Fuller's work. In the following quote, they explain in precise terms exactly what they did: \"We propose that the planetary grid map outlined by the Russian team Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov is essentially correct, with its overall organization anchored to the north and south axial poles and the Great Pyramid at Gizeh. The Russian map, however, lacks completeness, in our opinion, which can be accomplished by the overlaying of a complex, icosahedrally-derived, spherical polyhedron developed by R. Buckminster Fuller. In his book Synergetics 2, he called it the \"Composite of Primary and Secondary Icosahedron Great Circle Sets.\" We have shortened that to Unified Vector Geometry (UVG) 120 sphere... We use the number 120 due to its easy comprehension as a spherical polyhedron with 120 identical triangles - all approximately 30, 60 and 90 in composition.\" And now, the moment we've all been waiting for: the Becker / Hagens grid, which finally \"cracked the code\" of the Platonic Solids' positions on Earth. Right away, you should be able to see the amazing correspondences of this Grid to the physical forms of the continents, among other things."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The following credits need to be given when reprinting this photo: The Planetary Grid System shown [here] was inspired by an original article by Christopher Bird, \"Planetary Grid,\" published in New Age Journal #5, May 1975, pp. 36-41.

It becomes immediately obvious that this Grid indeed controls the positioning of continental landmass on the Earth. Our favorite examples, both of which combine \"nodes\" and force lines, are South America and Australia. In the picture to follow on the next page, we can clearly see the detail that reveals the precision of the structuring of Earth that is occurring from this interplay of"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Grid forces: So, it should be visible to \"those with eyes to see\" that the Global Grid is very obviously shaping these land structures. If you look at South America, for example, you can see the extremely obvious effect of this particular \"grid triangle,\" in literally forming the continent around itself. In looking at the southernmost tip of South America, you can see how the force of node number 58 pushes the land away from its due south trend and towards the east. Then, if you look at node 49, on the middle of the East Coast of South America near Rio de Janeiro, you can clearly see how the force of the node has pushed the landmass of the continent into a rounded shape. Then, looking at Australia, you can clearly see that the whole continent, and especially the northwest side, forms very precisely within the stretching forces of this area of the Global Grid. Here, if we look to the exact north and middle of Australia on point 27, we see a circular \"node point\" displacing the land around it and forming the Gulf of Carpenteria. Again, the nodes themselves have shaped the land into circular \"vortices,\" repelling the continental mass from themselves and in this case, also shaping the outline of the island directly above Australia. These circular forms, as we shall continue to see, are consistently visible in conjunction with the Global Grid. We saw them in Egypt on our chapter regarding Carl Munck, forming the Nile River coastline on the Mediterranean. Also, node 44 is precisely aligned with the bottom of Antarctica, and we see either edge \"drooping\" to the right or the left from this. According to Richard Lefors Clark, this is the \"bowtie\" energetic configuration showing itself in the Australian landmass, which he calls a \"diamagnetic energy vortex.\" We will examine how such a shape could be formed by the curved, spiraling energies that make up the grid below. Clark also shows us that the Gulf of Mexico follows this same curving energetic organization, as well as the two coastlines of the continental United States."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" Next, look at Africa, and see the combined action of two larger triangles, one with the point facing downwards on the African continent and its neighbor pointing upwards, girding the Indian Sea: The downward-pointing triangle certainly describes Africa well, and the extra land on the western side can be explained by the pressure coming from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is almost precisely the same as the Atlantic grid line formed by points 10, 19, 37, 38, 39 and 50. The east coast of Africa and Saudi Arabia follow the eastern side of the triangle very nicely, on the grid line from point 41 to point 12. We can also see how node point 22 gently pushes in on Africa's east coast, causing it to dip inwards as it travels and forming the Somalia Basin. We can also assume that the \"cracks\" separating Africa and Saudi Arabia were caused by the expansion of the Grid, forcefully pulling the land into alignment. The \"crack\" to the immediate left of point 12 follows the grid line exactly. And finally, the upward-pointing triangle can be clearly seen to cut its way right into the land, with Africa's coast defining its left side and India's coast defining its right. In the illustration above, we can see how point 21, in the center of the African continent, works with its above-right partner point 20 in providing a framework for the bow-shaped energy vortex that shaped the northeast coast of Africa. Point 20 is the only \"vile vortex\" that is significantly inland; 41, near South Africa, and 42, near India, are the only others that touch land at all! This is probably due to the incredible strength that they possess, which seems to repel landmasses. We can see how the northeast coast of Africa is indeed very circular, and point 20 is directly at the center of this \"bowtie\" of energy. Again, we see Dr. Lefors Clark's bow-shaped \"diamagnetic energy vortex\" shaping the land in a smooth curve. We can also see the same curving formation created by the east coast of India and the west coast of the China / Korea / Vietnam area of Asia. This vortex is balanced between points 24 and 13. We remind ourselves that these smooth curves illustrate the spiraling nature of the superstrings that make up these geometric energy fields, here"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"expressed as spiraling lines of magnetic force. Let us remind ourselves that Clark's primary example of this bowtie energy is that which occurs in the general area of the Bermuda Triangle, with its opposite pole forming the eastern coast of Mexico. According to Dr. Clark, the point at the center of the \"bowtie\" becomes a magnetic null zone of zero gravity when appropriately triggered by the right geometric positions of the Sun, Moon and Planets to the Earth. In those moments of conjunction, there is a \"hyperdimensional bleed-through,\" and we then get time dilations, disappearances, gravity loss, levitation and other related phenomena. In the next three pictures, the circular grid energy formations surrounding the east coast of China and surrounding area are easily seen. So, we can see that when you know what you are looking for, and you have the Grid map, these formations cannot be hidden. In picture number 1, we have our straight grid map of China for comparison. Picture 2 has three circular vortexes in it. We have already discussed the bottom left vortex in India and China. Then, the center vortex shapes the East Coast of China, based off of and emanating from point 13. The uppermost and largest vortex in Picture 2 shapes the entire Japanese and Russian archipelago, and is centered in and emanating from point 4. Finally, in picture number 3 we have a vortex centered in Sanderson's \"vile vortex\" near Japan, the \"Devil's Sea,\" here listed as point 14. This vortex is \"equalized\" by points 25 and 26, both of which are equidistant from the edge of the circle. And obviously, the Philippines precisely traces the bottom left of the circle itself. This is obviously a very strong vortex to be able to shape the land of the Philippines from where it stands. According to Becker and Hagens, Another area of continuing disappearances and mysterious time-warps is the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Devil's Sea located east of Japan between Iwo Jima and Marcus Island. Here events have become so sinister that the Japanese government has officially designated the area a danger zone. This area was significant enough to the work of Bermuda Triangle author Charles Berlitz that he wrote a whole book dedicated to it and the \"bigger picture,\" entitled The Devil's Triangle. It is becoming more and more clear that our geometric shapes, expressed as the consciousness unit expanded to a planetary scale, are far more than abstract concepts of theoretical physics. What we have here are direct, quantifiable and measurable phenomena, and these geometry-based Grid patterns are simply the simplest, and therefore the best solution to the problem. If the reader wishes to see more of the connections between the Becker / Hagens grid and the landmasses, simply stare at the map for a while and they start popping out. The reader will remember that in previous chapters, we showed the \"grid bands\" on the Earth and how their effects shaped the Ring of Fire, the flowing of the Nile River, the \"node point\" of the Egyptian northern coast centered in Giza, and the vertical structure of the Yucatan Peninsula. Now, with the full map of the Becker / Hagens grid, we can see a great deal more from the effect of these straight longitudinal lines. As one example, by referring back to the main map, the reader can clearly see that the entire Eastern side of Hudson Bay in Canada precisely follows the line from 18 in Florida to 9 in the Bay to 61 at the North Pole. Furthermore, all of England is precisely within the line created by point 20 in Africa, through point 11 in England to point 61 at the North Pole. So, there are a variety of ways to see this energy at work on Earth. One can begin to visualize this Grid energy as a living net of \"wires\" that are tightly stretched over a thin balloon. It is obvious to us that what we think of as randomly placed continents are actually conforming to this massive energy. As we look at the different diagrams of how these geometric energies show up on Earth, we do indeed get a sense of the massive forces that are involved with this Grid. We know that gravity is not the full extent of these forces, either, as they can be shown to have profound effects on human consciousness. Becker / Hagens explain how these Grid points also seem to attract large population centers. We have shown that a pyramid is actually a physical, crystalline structure that is built to be identical to our own native dimensional frequency of the octahedron, for the purposes of harnessing energy. The Wilcock reading in chapter 17 told us that the circle shape of stoneworks like Stonehenge and earthworks like the Mound Builders' creations in Florida also work to harmonize with this upward-spiraling Earth energy. Again getting back to our discussion of Dr. Clark's information, we can look back to the South American landmass. Not only does it fit perfectly within our \"Grid Triangle,\" but we can see yet another example of this circular, \"bowtie- shaped\" energy at work in the actual shaping of the landmass itself."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" This \"bowtie\" is nearly centered within the diamond that is formed between points 18, 35, 37 and 49. We already saw the African \"vile vortex\" shaping a similarly large \"bowtie\" in the above diagrams. The offset of the South American landmass from being precisely within this \"diamond\" again could be accounted for by the pushing of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which follows the lines of the Global Grid with amazing precision. Looking back to the Becker / Hagens map, it is quite easy for us to see how this line clearly demarcates the separation between the continents, just as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the point of expansion between the two continental plates. We have just examined the circular energy formations caused by the Grid in the Asian area of the Pacific Ocean. And here, we can see what happens when we draw an even greater \"great circle,\" based strictly on the island formations in the Philippines area of the Asian Pacific. Here we can see that an elliptical-shaped gravity field is clearly visible when the center is placed directly in node 15. If we use any standard image editing program and \"drag out\" an ellipse using point 15 as a center, we can indeed align it precisely with the island formations to the far west of our diagram. We can try other center points besides 15, but the ellipse will not fit anywhere else as precisely as it does right at that spot. Right away, we should see that this very large energy vortex seems to provide the clearest Grid counterpart for the existence of the Ring of Fire, which is a ring of volcanoes and tectonic activity surrounding the Pacific Ocean. When we look at this \"grid ring\" carefully, we can see that it represents the perfect fusion between the Earth's landmasses and the Global"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Grid. Going clockwise from the 12:00 point, the ring will perfectly touch a \"square\" of grid points, as 7, 31, 27 and 5. (Node point 27, near Australia, is the only one that isn't touched exactly, and this is probably due to distortions in the map projection.) We can also see that this ellipse is well defined by points 14 and 16, again Sanderson's powerful \"vile vortices,\" the points of the icosahedron. We have already seen how the gravitational force of these \"vortices\" was able to shape the entire upper Western half of Africa into an elegant, circular shape. Now, we are seeing two of these vortices working together to form an even larger shape. The ring forms part of the East Coast of China, as well as a good part of the upper Russian coastline surrounding node 5. It also defines part of the southern coastline of Alaska. Perhaps most interesting of all is that the combination of forces that are demonstrating themselves in this map look very familiar to a microscopic formation in nature. Take another look and you will see it... Cell Mitosis! We can certainly see that Mother Earth is giving all Her secrets away, right in front of our very eyes, if only we understand Her Grid. The grid points 14 and 16 would be akin to the two poles of the dividing cell. The gridlines provide us with a simplified depiction of the \"spindle fibers\" that form in cell mitosis. The actual ring of energy that is created forms a precise analog of the nuclear membrane of the cell, as it continues its expanding, elliptical process of division. If this is interesting, it becomes even more interesting when we look at page 31 of Robert Lawlor's book Sacred Geometry. There, he has printed a diagram showing the eight stages of cell mitosis. Eight is the number of the octave, hence Lawlor's quote: From one cell to two there is a cycle of change, in eight phases with seven intervals, analogous to the musical octave, or the spectrum of light. Seven symbolizes such cycle; the lunar month, a perfect example of graduated phases within a continuous process, is dominated by seven and its multiples... The functional pattern of the human nervous system is also sevenfold... In other words, we can see a very direct analog of the \"consciousness unit\" yet again in the cell; a process of division with eight stages in seven intervals. The human nervous system, as Lawlor explains in his book, also shows us this octave structure. Now, we can see the Grid counterpart to this, which occurs through hyperdimensional geometry that is octave-based. So, you might be wondering, what does this mean? Why does it matter if there is an octave pattern in cell mitosis or the human nervous system? We can look back upon previous chapters and see all the clues. Sources such as the Cayce Readings and the Ra Material tell us that we live in an octave- based, eight-dimensional universe. We then observed the world of cutting- edge, modern \"superstring theory\" physics and discovered that with one slight adjustment, they have discovered the same thing. Srinivasa Ramanujan's divinely inspired 'modular functions' are all octave-based. We have cited numerous spiritual works that tell us that the One originated as Pure White Light, and fragmented down into the octave or spectrum of frequencies or dimensions. Each discrete interval represented a different"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"aspect of this Wholeness. We know from basic intuition, as well as sources like the Ra Material, that Nature will provide us with physical metaphors to explain the metaphysical. Look at the structure of the seashell and its depiction of the phi spiral, for example. In Lawlor's book Sacred Geometry, we can also see numerous examples of the Renaissance scientists making clear connections between these harmonic ratios and the proportions of the human body. As we continue to explore these issues, we can indeed see what transcendental significance the human body actually has, built directly into its design. Or, as the saying goes, \"Man is the measure of all things.\" We can now see that the cell division is another natural example of these sacred, octave-based mathematical principles showing up in the physical universe. The original cell would represent the sphere, or the first note of the octave. There are then seven stages, or frequencies, that cause cell division to form. Then, at the final stage, the eighth, we now have two cells, and the division is complete- the original form has again emerged, only now having produced a precise copy of itself. This also is akin to the octave structure in the atom, where each electron that is released puts the atom through different isotopic stages. Once you break the \"octave\" threshold, the atom metamorphoses into the next element in the Periodic Table. In other words, this process of energetic expansion, emerging from the central core, or nucleus, or Sun, produces an evolution in the actual form of its entire structure. This is the way that all consciousness units operate, whether it is sub-microscopic, atomic, cellular, planetary or even Solar System-wide. We know that the system of geometry for the CU is also harmonic and octave- based, and thus we see these Platonic forms emerging in minerals, in the organization of cells in a developing zygote, and in the planetary grids themselves. We also know that these frequencies are governed by very simple, harmonic numbers. These numbers show up when we measure the vibrations of sound frequencies in air. Therefore, when we see these same frequency numbers for the CU emerging in the Great Sunspot Cycle in later chapters, we can see that a similar division and enhancement is occurring in our Solar System as a part of this fundamental, interweaving system of energetics. This is yet again another reason to see why we are so quickly heading into a spontaneous dimensional shift here on Earth, or the Single Greatest Moment of All Time."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 13: THE MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS OF THE SPIRAL IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS UNITS In this chapter, we find the quintessential link between the three-dimensional geometries of the CU and the harmonic, mathematical \"frequency numbers\" of the Octave. This link comes to us through the work of Mr. Carl Munck. We will see how Munck discovers that all of the \"Gematrian\" frequency numbers that indicate sound vibrations have only two commonly shared tangents. He then shows how the Speed of Light, in seconds, is a precise function of these same two tangents. This gives us a solid background upon which to establish a fundamental mathematical connection between light, sound and geometry, adding great weight to the reality of this theory, and therefore the reality of Ascension as well. CHAPTER 13: THE MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS OF THE SPIRAL IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS UNITS Part One: So what is a Diamagnetic Vortex, Anyway? Since we have been looking at Dr. Richard Lefors Clark's \"bowtie\" shaped vortices in great detail, it is important for us at this point to make mention of Dr. Clark's theories of diamagnetism and magnetic null zones. After all, the Wilcock reading in Chapter 17 suggested that these energy forces had a lot to do with the siting of ancient monuments. This was given as the \"answer\" that would rectify the positioning of certain stone and earthworks in Munck's system with a mappable, planet-wide grid system. According to Dr. Clark, the newest advances in the science of magnetism have shown that there is a positive / negative polarity reversal that occurs in the center of a magnetic field (see below diagram.) It is at this point, called a \"Bloch Wall,\" where the spiraling energies of the north pole meet the spiraling energies of the south pole, and they overlap. At the overlap point, we get the \"bowtie\" shape that we see on Earth in the above examples. The point of magnetic flow reversal, or the \"Bloch Wall,\" creates what we now term as anti-gravity, nulling its effects and / or changing its direction. Dr. Clark shows in Anti-Gravity and the World Grid how magnetic scientists have actually studied and measured this \"Bloch Wall\" phenomenon using electromagnets. As we look at the above illustration, we should keep in mind that the lines on"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"the Global Grid provide the organization for these spinning magnetic fields. In other words, the lines on the Grid are flowing like rivers, due to the spiraling nature of the energies that make them up. And thus, if we look back to the diagram of the Bermuda Triangle vortex, we can see that the north-south vertical line that intersects Grid Point 18 next to Florida would be the \"organizer\" for the magnetic energy flows. Then, the magnetic polarity will reverse at the exact center of the bow-shaped area. It is here that we will get our \"Bloch Wall\" effect produced, then causing the Bermuda Triangle anomalies, as well as providing exceptional spiritual energy. It is no surprise that many people will want to go to Florida to retire - the youthful energy explodes in abundance there! If it were truly possible that the Earth's magnetic field could produce such spirals of energy, then we should expect there to be places where it would be very evidential that something anomalous was occurring. Certainly Sanderson's work on the \"vile vortices\" like the Bermuda Triangle satisfies this, as does Munck's mention of the anomalies surrounding Rock Lake in Wisconsin. There is another area that also obviously falls under this effect, and that is the area known as the Oregon Vortex. William Childress featured the Oregon Vortex in an article for the industrial newsmagazine \"Compressed Air,\" which has been circulating in print for over 100 years. As this is a reputable, mainstream scientific journal, it would be unlikely for them to print a study that was considered to be \"fringe\" science. Instead, it appears that their investigation of this vortex came from a genuine interest in trying to uncover and understand anomalous Earth phenomena. Childress' article starts out by describing the most crowd-pleasing feature in the Oregon Vortex / House of Mystery. A 100-year old shack was built over the vortex, and within this shack, a broom is \"standing rigidly straight in the middle of the room, untouched by anyone or anything, as if it were a spear stuck in the middle of the floor.\" The record time for the broom to remain standing, according to those who run the House of Mystery, is 36 hours! Again, we see the harmonic numbers emerging, this time in the number of hours involved. In another area of the House of Mystery, a golf ball is placed at the bottom of a trough, and it will roll uphill when released. On the \"Superman Platform,\" a person can lean very far forward without falling, and thus appear to look like Superman in flight. Other stunts that are demonstrated at the Oregon Vortex include height discrepancies, where two similarly tall people will walk in opposite directions and have noticeable and opposite changes in their height. A similar effect is demonstrated when a long plank is placed across two seven-foot tall posts; on the south end, the plank appears to be higher by a good three inches. According to Childress, \"in some way still not understood, a kind of \"gravity warp\" appears to make vertical objects taller or shorter as long as they are in the force field.\" If we think about this on a much larger scale, we can visualize the expansion and contraction of landmasses, producing the structures that we have been examining above. What is actually most interesting to us is the effects that are reported at the area called the \"Vortex Post.\" As Childress indicates, \"people standing next to the post tend to sway in a circle like some bottom-weighted toy.\" From this piece of information, we can indeed see the spiraling nature of the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"gravitational fields at work! Also notable is a passage in Charles Berlitz's Bermuda Triangle where there were reports cited of mariners encountering spiraling motions on their compass that became faster or slower depending on how close they were to the center of the vortex. At these certain times, the spiraling energy from the vortex was actually stronger than Magnetic North, and overtook the normal operation of the compass. It is also interesting that the owners of the Oregon Vortex / House of Mystery do not permit video cameras. They did not explain to Childress why this was so, only stating that regular cameras were permitted. This falls perfectly in line with the Rock Lake information from Munck, and shows us that these vortices repetitively show their effects on electronics. We again remind the reader of the similar effects demonstrated by the UFOs in thousands of sighting reports. Anyone who wishes to actually go out and see the Oregon Vortex for themselves can contact them through the following information: Oregon Vortex / House of Mystery, 4303 Sardine Creek Road, Gold Hill, OR 97525, (541) 855-1543. The tours are open from April through October. And so, with the addition of physical information to back up the diamagnetism theories of Dr. Richard Lefors Clark, we have to consider that there is more to the Global Grid than just straight lines. We have pieces of evidence like the bow-shaped structures of the landmasses indicated above, and now the spiraling, anomalous gravitational effects that can be seen in various spots. Although the above diagram of the diamagnetic field was drawn in two dimensions, Dr. Clark makes careful notice of the fact that these lines of force are indeed three-dimensional spirals. These spirals are very important to study, as they form the basis for all of the Platonic Solids that we have spent so much time discussing. And looking in again on the extended version of the \"Triple Julia Set\" formation from 1996, this can clearly be seen: Part Two: Simple, Harmonic Relationships In earlier chapters, we discussed how these universal spirals of energy"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"generally fall into two main categories; namely, the square root of 2 and phi. One of our postulates is that Nature, or the physical world that we can see, will show us all of the secrets in the metaphysical world. Therefore, these spirals are not only simple mathematical concepts in our own dimension; they reach their fruition in the functions of the dimensions. Now that we can see these spirals in action, mapped out for us by the Global Magnetic Grid and its effect on the shapes of continents, we can explore how each of the Platonic Solids \"fit in\" to these spirals. As is written in Robert Lawlor's book Sacred Geometry, the Platonic Solids are in a \"simple harmonic relationship\" to each other. As we can see in Table II below, that simple relationship is expressed in terms of phi and the square root of 2 in spiral form. Lawlor gives us a complete breakdown of the Hindu \"spectrum\" of shapes, with the harmonic proportions for each one of them. The measurements listed are comparisons of the length of each side of the Platonic Solids. Since every line on any Platonic Solid will be the same length, these measurements are the universal standard for each shape. 1. Sphere [no edges] 2. Central Icosahedron 1 / phi 2 3. Octahedron 4. Star Tetrahedron 5. Cube 1 6. Dodecahedron 1 / phi 7. Icosahedron Phi 8. Sphere [no edges] Table II. Harmonic Proportions of Platonic Solids. In order for these proportions to be established, the researcher must determine where the \"1\" is going to be. We must remember the simple fact that if you have a square, and each side has a length unit of 1, the diagonals will measure out to the square root of two. Similarly, if you assign a unit value of 1 to the diameter of a circle, the circumference will measure out to pi, or 3.14159 units. In order to compare the Platonic Solids to each other, we also need to assign a straight value of 1 to the sides of one of the shapes. In order to have the basic harmonics work out simply and perfectly, the value of 1 needs to be assigned to the length of the side of the cube. All other proportions as indicated above represent the exact numerical value that we"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"receive when comparing their lengths against the cube. As we are on the subject of phi, it is also interesting to point out here that the \"solar number\" of 666 and the \"lunar number\" of 1080 also express the phi ratio when divided into each other. John Michell's work shows how many ancient monuments used these proportions, and we also see it in nature as well, being the harmonic relationship between such things as the size of planets. Since phi seems to be of such penultimate importance, we can see yet another reason for why the Hindus ascribed such religious significance to Purusha, or the icosahedron. Now that we can see the actual mathematical structure of the spiraling energy that makes up the CU, we no longer need to wonder about whether they are, in fact, crystallized frequencies. We have seen it on the planetary level, and now we can see it on a mathematical level as well. Hoagland's team made the connection between these geometric shapes and the frequencies of the dimensions, and many might wonder exactly how he did that. The answer to that question actually helps us even more in understanding the true physics behind these harmonic, geometric shapes. On his website , Hoagland has printed an early essay that he composed on hyperdimensional physics back in 1989. In this essay we have the clearest picture of how the Enterprise Mission team tied together the physics of higher dimensions with the abstract concept of Platonic geometry. This article is also located at www.lunaranomalies.com/Message.htm . The \"Message of Cydonia\" First Communication from an Extraterrestrial Civilization? By Richard C. Hoagland and Erol O. Torun Copyright (C) 1989 All Rights Reserved [We are only going to reprint the part of this article that directly concerns us here.] ...If in the \"Cydonia tetrahedral mathematics\" we are truly seeing the deliberate communication of demonstrable astrophysical effects of a long- sought \"Unified Field Theory,\" this in itself would be remarkable confirmation of current efforts to discover such fundamental mathematical connections between Nature's elemental forces. For, most provocative: one leading mathematical approach to successfully modeling such connections is essentially based on a tetrahedral model, and a resulting mathematical expansion into \"higher-dimensional, n-space relationships\" (recently discovered) between the five Platonic solids (Sirag, 1989). It is very important to note here that Mr. Saul-Paul Sirag, referenced below, has referred to ALL of the Platonic Solids in his model of \"higher dimensions,\" not just the tetrahedron. The work of Tony Smith also built upon Sirag's geometric models, and a direct reference to Sirag's work is made on Smith's website. In particular, these studies relate tetrahedral geometry as being topologically equivalent to three-toruses -- tori extending into \"one more dimension than"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"our familiar three.\" [Many current efforts in pursuit of \"unified field models,\" such as the much-acclaimed \"super-string theory,\" routinely involve up to ten mathematical dimensions. Some more recent theories are exploring twenty- six (Sirag, ibid).] As we have already stated in previous chapters, by breaking the \"symmetry\" of the strings in Superstring Theory, we arrive at an octave-based, 8 or 24 (8 x 3) - dimensional universe. This lines up with Srinivasa Ramanujan's \"modular functions.\" Phrased in simple terms: The routine mathematical representation of vorticular flow in more than three dimensions -- a three-torus -- by means of three-dimensional tetrahedral models, opens up the possibility that the demonstrable geophysical effects of the \"Cydonia tetrahedral message\" are attempting to communicate the reality of additional dimensions (as opposed to mere mathematical abstractions) -- and the observable reality of vorticular energy flow between adjoining \"n- spaces.\" So, if we plug in our own discoveries in this chapter to what Hoagland and Torun have said here, and use the language that they expressed it with, Dr. Clark's bow-shaped \"diamagnetic energy vortices\" would be another physical example of \"the observable reality of vorticular energy flow between adjoining \"n-spaces.\"\" Hoagland's hyperdimensional physics asks us to visualize the spiraling energies making up the shapes themselves as being connected together to form a three-torus, which really is nothing more than what you would see if you removed the tetrahedron from the intersecting, spiraling lines that formed it. When a number is assigned to a torus as in this case, it refers to how many visible \"sides\" the curving line produces. Thus, a three-torus is essentially like a triangular knot in its appearance. Such totally unexpected (to non-specialists) and remarkable mathematical correlations -- between as yet unpublished theoretical work into Unified Field Models, and the specific tetrahedral geometry apparently intended at Cydonia -- gives added confidence that such a linkage was in fact intended. If so, there may be an additional confirmation of such a radical \"Cydonia Unified Field Model\"-- In the continuing, puzzling departure of some celestial objects from strict \"Newtonian\" mechanics. And now, we check in on the References section to get a clearer picture on Mr. Saul-Paul Sirag: References: Mr. Saul-Paul Sirag, for furnishing important references linking tetrahedral mathematics with \"two and three-torus topologies,\" and for providing examples from his own research of not only Schuster's Hypothesis as potentially applicable to a Unified Field Model --but for specifically referencing tetrahedral mathematical topology and the Platonic Solids as directly applicable; and finally, Mr. Stan Tenen (The Meru Foundation), for introducing us to Saul-Paul Sirag, for furnishing examples of his own research into the"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"historical importance of the Platonic Solids (tetrahedra, in particular), and for valued general discussion of some of the more controversial aspects of our work. [Note: Schuster's Hypothesis relates to more recent published material from The Enterprise Mission regarding the energetic flow between bodies in the Solar System.] It is important to point out here that the work of Stan Tenen, often referred to by Hoagland, gives us yet another layer of depth to explore in these matters. Tenen has discovered that the Torah, or the section of the Old Testament that was apparently dictated to Moses by God, has precisely encoded the formulae for constructing the Platonic Solids in its passages. From this same Biblical scripture we also see the bizarre synchronicities that emerge with apparent mathematical certainty in the work of The Bible Code, explained in the book by Michael Drosnin of the same title. (The Bible Code appears to have given us written prophecies of events 2000+ years in the future, in our own modern era. Drosnin's biggest \"claim to fame\" with the Bible Code was the precise prediction of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The perfection of the mathematics involved in this, and the fact that it does not show up in any other books of the Bible, has excited mathematicians worldwide. It obviously helps strengthen the faith of Hebrews in the Torah as well!) The work of Stan Tenen, showing us the mathematical encoding of the Platonic Solids within sacred text, gives us yet another interesting clue as to how the physical fundamentals of Universal Law and hyperdimensional physics were preserved as knowledge for us to use by Higher Intelligence. Obviously, Tenen's work is another major area of inquiry, and we leave it up to our readers to investigate the Meru Foundation on their own at the Meru website . The one point that we need to mention here is that Tenen's work also shows us a very interesting principle at work in the formation the Hebrew alphabet. Tenen explains that the Hebrew alphabetical characters represent different shadows of a single geometric figure. That single geometric figure is, believe it or not, a spiral shape contained within a tetrahedron! As amazing as it must seem, all we have to do is rotate the tetrahedron into different angular positions and then draw the shadows that result. All of the Hebrew letters will show up in a quite natural progression as a result of doing this. We remind ourselves that the science of Gematria also started out in the Hebrew language, giving each of these tetrahedral rotations, or alphabetical letters, a sequential number. The founders of this science seemed to have full awareness of the frequency numbers that underlie the dimensions, as well as their meanings. We remember as one example that 144 was said to equal Light, and now we can see through the work of Bruce Cathie that light speed, in harmonic terms, is indeed 144. And now, we can see that the same authors of Gematria also knew of the Platonic Solids, as well as the fact that they have an inner, spiraling nature! The actual structure of the Hebrew alphabet was intended to show us this. If we look back to the work of Carl Munck, we can see that the Ancients were very much concerned with the traditional English inch, foot and mile"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"measurement when building their sacred sites. The work of John Michell, which we have not explored in detail here, also shows very significant relationships of the Great Pyramid and Stonehenge to the inch / foot / mile system. We also remind the reader that the Sumerians gave us the Constant of Nineveh, and that it was a value expressed in seconds. We also remind the reader that the Speed of Light, in conventional terms, is also expressed in miles per second. In the chapter on Bruce Cathie, we demonstrated how the harmonic of Light shows up precisely when we solve the Speed of Light for (x) minutes of arc per grid second. The value that we end up with is 144,000 minutes of arc per grid second for the speed of light in free space. This puts it into the simple harmonic terms that the Universe works off of, and that the minds of the ETs navigating our globe can understand. Now, we can see here that the values of miles and seconds are also important in harmonic terms as well, to the Atlanteans and their cohorts. So, we wonder to ourselves, could the Speed of Light also have harmonic significance when expressed in miles per second? We do find that this is indeed the case. Not only that, but it ties in directly with the science of Gematria, which we have just been re-examining here. It also ties in with the work of Carl Munck, our pioneer archeocryptographer who discovered a universal coordinate system being used within all sacred sites worldwide. It also ties in with the fundamental, spiraling nature of the geometric forms that the authors of the Gematrian sciences were very much aware of. Carl Munck was studying the Gematrian \"frequency numbers,\" and started to notice that there was a definite mathematical redundancy to them. The redundancy came when he started calculating the tangents of each number, and found out that they were all the same! If we remember from trigonometry class in high school, the tangent function is used to measure the intersection between a straight line and the very edge of a circle. This also could obviously be the intersection of a straight line and a curve as well, thus mapping - you guessed it - a spiral. We now go directly into a reprint from Mason et al.'s Gematria page, which explains this point, and eventually tells us how these numbers harmonically tie into the Speed of Light, measured in miles per second. Here is Mason et al. to explain. Carl figured a certain logic was demanded by these [Gematrian frequency] numbers, so he arranged them into two separate scales, organizing them by their tangents, and marking the numbers that came from the ancient systems with asterisks (*), and filling in the \"blanks,\" with appropriate numbers, something like this: ________________________________________________________________ _______ + 3.077683537 72* 252* 432* 612 792 - 3.077683537"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"108* 288* 468 648* 828 ________________________________________________________________ _______ ________________________________________________________________ _______ + 0.726542528 36* 216* 396* 576* 756* - 0.726542528 144* 324 504 684 864* ________________________________________________________________ _______ In the newsletter, Carl had a longer list of these numbers in vertical columns. He also drew in sine waves connecting the numbers, which seemed to be suggested by their logic. He noted the consistent differences between the various numbers in the top two rows of 36 and 144, such as 108 - 72 = 36 and 252 - 108 = 144. The differences between the bottom rows are 108 and 72, such as 144 - 36 = 108; and 216 - 144 = 72. The suggestion of sine waves, Carl said, is very, very obvious. Did the ancients know about sine waves? Did they have oscilloscopes? Were they suggesting a certain frequency? [Part Three:] A Frequency of Light Carl was shocked when he multiplied the two Gematrian tangents: 3.077683537 x 0.726542528 = 2.236067977 He knew that 2.236067977 is the square root of five!!! That's the pyramid codex talking!\", Carl says. He asks, \"Why does the square root of five answer the sine waves of the Sacred Numbers? What was the reasoning behind it?... [The reasoning was that] the square root of five is itself a Tangent; the Tangent of 186234.09485, which is the speed of light in air!!! Carl points out that the speed of light in a vacuum is 186282.5894 miles per"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"second, but when light travels through air, it is slowed down to 186234.09485 miles per second. Enter this speed-of-light-in-air number into your calculator, and then press the tangent key, to see that it is very close to the number arrived at by multiplying the two Gematrian tangents... [Here we remind ourselves that the tangent is a mathematical function that can be used to map out a spiral. The Speed of Light has a tangent of the square root of five, and this in turn has a tangent that harmonically relates to ALL frequency numbers making up the light / sound / geometric structure of the Octave of dimensions. You simply multiply their two commonly shared tangents together to get this number.] Carl concludes - And there we have it, the reasoning behind the Sacred Numbers of Gematria, the same ones preserved in eastern metrology and western calendrical computing; square roots and tangents - all keyed to the terrestrial speed of light - and delivered through the pyramid codex in nearly the exact methodology they used in keying the earth's equatorial circumference to the cube root of double-pi when they built the Great Pyramid at Giza. Munck's work quite well explains how the Great Pyramid was built to unify the Earth's circumference at the equator with the \"constant\" of the cube root of double pi, and it is also explained on Mason et al.'s Gematria page, from which this was excerpted. No communications across ancient oceans? No prehistoric writing that makes any sense? Ignorant stone age progenitors? I'm afraid I'm not buying anymore, not when I can so easily find this kind of mathematical evidence to the contrary. Someone back there had it all; maps of enviable accuracy, a complete knowledge of every inch of our planet, a thorough understanding of mathematics and, yes, even calculators and computers we take for granted today - because without such tools, they could never have put it all together. Why do I say that? Because the U.S. Geological Survey advises me that they have the only computer in the United States which is programmed to calculate accurate distances between widely separated points anywhere on the planet - which means - that before the ancients could have marked out the pyramid grid system, they required a computer of the same caliber! And so, from this excerpt, we can see very clearly how Carl Munck has discovered a similar harmonic function for the Speed of Light in miles per second, as Cathie did in his own harmonic system. The most amazing point of all was not addressed by \"The Code Gang\" in this article, though, and that is the centering on the square root of five as being so important. What we see, when investigating Robert Lawlor's book Sacred Geometry, is that the internal measurements of all the Platonic Solids are a function of phi, square root of two, square root of three and square root of five. And so, the connection is obvious - the hidden mathematical properties of light reveal that it is traveling in a spiral formation, which is exactly what Ra tells us in the Law of One series. These spiraling lines or \"superstrings\" in the sea of energy known as the \"aether\" then form the framework for the different Platonic Solids."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Remember that we just showed above how the lengths of the sides of the Platonic Solids can all be expressed in terms of phi and the square root of two. However, a cube with a side length of 1 will have a diagonal of the square root of two on each of its faces, and if you draw a diagonal through the center of the cube between two points, its value is the square root of 3. In addition, when we measure the diameters of these shapes, and their harmonic relationships, one of the most important ratios of all is indeed the square root of five. In Lawlor's words, The square root of five is the proportion which opens the way for the family of relationships called the Golden Proportion, [or the phi ratio.] The Golden Proportion generates a set of symbols which were used by the Platonic philosophers as a support for the ideal of divine or universal love. It is through the Golden Division that we can contemplate the fact that the Creator planted a regenerative seed which will lift the mortal realms of duality and confusion back towards the image of God. So, the connection of the square root of five to the Platonic Solids is the fact that the phi ratio grows directly out of it. Now we can see from the work of Carl Munck that the Speed of Light is also directly a function of the square root of five, and furthermore that the square root of five is directly a function of the Gematrian Numbers. This is the cornerstone that we have been waiting for. We have already expressed the harmonic link between these \"perfect\" harmonic numbers for the vibrations of sound in air. These \"perfect\" numbers only come about when we measure them against one second of time as we now have it. If our seconds were shorter, the harmonic ratios would still be preserved, but they would not be whole numbers any longer. It appears that the second of time that we now use from the Sumerians gives us perfectly round numbers for the vibrations of each note in the Octave. This alone suggests a high level of scientific knowledge that went into this apparently archaic system of measurement. That only further strengthens the case for why we will see in later chapters that they also formulated the Constant of Nineveh, a number that allows all planetary orbits to be quickly calculated, as being expressed by a value in seconds. It is only with the second that we now use that these frequency numbers are all round and rational. And, that second of time is a precise harmonic breakdown of one Earth day of 24 hours of 60 minutes with 60 seconds each. We know that the Gematrian Numbers are all based on the number 9 as a foundation. Cathie showed us that if you convert our time units from a ratio of 8 to a ratio of 9, at 27 \"grid hours,\" then we have a measurement of \"grid seconds\" that shows us the harmonic \"frequency number\" of 144 as the Speed of Light in free space. We also see the \"frequency numbers\" coming out much clearer in the division of the number of Grid seconds per day. So, in short, we now have a quite sufficient amount of scientific proof to show us that the Platonic solids are indeed a function of the mathematical expansion and contraction of curving superstrings in a spherical energy field, forming natural shapes such as what Hoagland would refer to as a \"three-torus\" when constructing a tetrahedron, for example. This same information regarding spiraling lines of light was revealed to us by Ra and other sources, and now"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"we have gone in and directly seen it mathematically. These superstrings travel at the speed of Light, and now with the work of Cathie and Munck we can see how the spirals themselves are functions of Light. The harmonic frequency numbers, expressed in Gematria, are completely woven into this \"fabric\" of space and time. So, what we essentially have here is a bullet-proof mathematical design that incorporates all of these various points together. We can see how these consciousness units function in their \"inward coalescing\" capacity by their effects on a planetary energy field. Just as Ra told us that the consciousness units' inward expansion creates gravity, so too do we now see with the Becker / Hagens grid that gravity demonstrates in a quite literal fashion how these various Platonic shapes emerge. The actual lines of force created by the shapes have a direct effect on the shaping of continental landmass. TETRAHEDRAL HARMONICS Further information has now come our way regarding a direct mathematical connection between Platonic geometries and the harmonic number sequence. As we briefly mentioned before, at the end of a MUFON conference in 1997, Richard Hoagland gave a sneak-preview of unpublished research that revealed that the orbit of Mars had once been exactly 666 Martian days in length, which is a clear harmonic number. We already know that the Earth's orbit could well have been 360 days exactly at some point in the past, and that this might be one explanation for why we have used 360 degrees in a circle. So, Enterprise Mission associate Erol Torun decided to see what would happen if 666 degrees were used in a circle instead of 360. They already had a collection of all the significant angle relationships between the various sections of a tetrahedron circumscribed within a sphere, and with few exceptions these were decimal-point values. Hoagland revealed that when 666 degrees are used, all of these values become whole numbers! In the table on the next page, we have demonstrated this with our own calculations, based on Hoagland's suggestion. The first column shows the tetrahedral angles in a 360-degree system, the second column shows what the exact figure must be to harmonize with a 666-degree system precisely, the third column shows the value in the 666 system and the fourth column indicates how \"harmonic\" the 666 value is. 360 Harmonic Val. 666 Y/N 4.0 3.783783783784 7 Y 19.5 19.45945945946 36 YYY 22.5 22.70270270271"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"42 Y 34.7 34.59459459459 64 YY 45.0 45.40540540541 84 YY 49.6 49.72972972973 92 NNN 52.0 51.89189189189 96 YYY 55.3 55.13513513514 102 NNN 60.0 60.0 111 NN 69.4 69.18918918919 128 Y 85.3 85.40540540541 158 NNN 90.0 89.72972972973 166 NN 94 94.05405405405 174 N 184 183.7837837838 340 NA As we can see from the chart, the more \"Y's\" there are, the more harmonic the number is, and the more N's there are the more non-harmonic the number is. If we look at the column of Y's and N's, we can see that a clear waveform is visible. [No information was available on our harmonics chart regarding the last number, hence the NA.] In order to truly see it well, we would have to graph the N's as indicating force points in the opposite direction. Therefore, it is very interesting for us to see that the true harmonics"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"of the tetrahedron shape appear to be a combination of very harmonic numbers and very non-harmonic numbers. In the cases where the N's emerge, there are very few numbers that divide into the number itself, and in the cases with many Y's the numbers are harmonic, meaning that they have a maximum number of divisors. Considered together, this information reveals a tremendous amount. We now have solid mathematical proof from the Enterprise Mission that connects the angles of one of the main Platonic geometries (and almost certainly the others as well) to the harmonic number series. Furthermore, the singularly important \"19.5\" number, representing the most significant portion of the circumscribed tetrahedron, is the precise harmonic of the number 36, which is by far one of the most harmonic numbers of all. In the triangle-shaped \"tetracys\" from Pythagoras, there are 36 rows of dots starting with one dot at the top and ending with 36 dots at the bottom. Together, this forms a triangle, and it also represents a simple system of harmonic counting. When we summarize all the dots in the triangle together, we come to that same cornerstone 'solar' number, 666. Therefore, as we look at harmonic numbers showing up in the Solar System in Part Three, we have more reason than ever to see that they can be directly connected with Platonic geometries. Even the speed of light itself appears to describe a harmonic spiral that Cathie equated with 144 in his harmonic time system based on a proportion of nine. But before we enter into our final discussion regarding time cycles, we will finish out our look at the history of this knowledge. By examining the trickle-down effect of Atlantean knowledge into past and present \"secret societies,\" we can indeed trace how it was that literally all of the knowledge that we have been discussing was carefully preserved. We will explore how it was that ancient peoples chased after these Grid energies one line at a time, through the amazing study of \"ley lines\" and how they emerge all over the planet. We will also explore an amazing twist to the story, by showing how a present-day secret society still exists which has never lost this knowledge. This secret society was responsible for the formation of the United States Government, and lent its hand quite directly in the building of the United Nations Meditation Room. We will show the amazing quality of this room, and suggest that it is indeed a hyperdimensional \"machine,\" built on the premises of this carefully guarded secret knowledge that is gradually becoming available to the public."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 14: GREAT CYCLE, GLOBAL GRID AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL PHYSICS: THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE In this chapter we discuss the idea of secret societies having preserved knowledge from the time of Atlantis regarding these planetary cycles and grid formations, as well as the entire field of harmonic physics in general. By examining little-known facts such as the United Nations Meditation Room mural and the symbols and writings on the obverse side of the Great Seal of the United States, we begin to see how these secret societies still persist, and apparently have a working knowledge of many of the principles we have explored in this book. We then explore the work of one Dr. Scott, who may well have discovered a treasure trove of artifacts from Atlantis and is still waiting for the proper time to unveil these outrageous findings to the outside world. CHAPTER 14: GREAT CYCLE, GLOBAL GRID AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL PHYSICS: THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Our objective in chapter 12 was to show how the Becker / Hagens grid \"cracks the code\" of the planetary energy systems that we have been going through. We now can see quite clearly how the combined effects of all the dimensional frequencies and their geometric counterparts affect our physical sphere. In this grid, everyone is satisfied, from Hoagland and his tetrahedron to Cathie and his cube / octahedron, to Sanderson and his icosahedron and the Russians with their icosa / dodecahedron. Now that we have seen beyond any reasonable doubt that this grid exists, it also makes sense that others would have known about it before. This would be especially true with the existence of an advanced technological society such as Atlantis or Lemuria. A whole new area of inquiry stems out of this, and it involves looking back to the past. These lines and vortices have powerful effects on human consciousness as well as gravity, and are capable of causing time-space dilations and spontaneous shifts in spiritual consciousness. Now, we will see that the people who lived around them put a lot of energy into determining their precise locations. With the proper constructions in place, the energies of these lines could be harnessed and utilized directly for effects such as levitation and planetary balancing as well as experiments in human consciousness. So if the Ancients were keeping track of these lines in any form, how would we know about it? The most obvious answer would be that they would mark them and build on them, in order to keep track of where they were. These marks and sacred constructions occur along what is commonly referred to in Europe as \"ley lines.\" The idea of \"ley lines\" throughout the European countryside is a very old one indeed, and there are hundreds, if not thousands of dolmens, menhirs, standing stones, earthworks and great stone circles in England, France and other areas, including Avebury and Stonehenge. What many people are not aware of is that these \"ley lines\" were also actually carved into the land itself. Serious attempts were made those who were aware of these lines to make"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"them easier to follow. In the huge field of ley line research, covered well in John Michell's The View Over Atlantis and other works, we can see how ancient architects actually carved the lines as \"dips\" into the valleys and mountains so that you could sight them from far distances. They also erected standing stones to mark their passage. Invariably, places of worship would be built on these lines, and they were also used for their fertility in planting crops. Alfred Watkins, the modern \"discoverer\" of these ley lines, was privy to a trance vision where he stood on a mountaintop and was actually able to see these lines as luminous energies crisscrossing the Earth. According to an article by Joseph Jochmans in Atlantis Rising magazine (Issue 7, Spring 96) entitled \"Earth: A Crystal Planet,\" the case for human mapping of ley lines goes far beyond just the English countryside. Says Jochmans: In Ireland they are remembered as fairy paths, and in Germany as holy lines. The Greeks knew them as the Sacred Roads of Hermes, while the ancient Egyptians regarded them as the Pathways of Min. The Chinese today still measure the Lung Mei or dragon currents which affect the balance of the land, as practiced through the ancient art of Feng-shui. Much in the same fashion as the application of acupuncture needles in Chinese medicine helps the flow of Chi or life force in the human body, so the placement of pagodas, stones, trees, temples and houses in the environment was regarded as a way to heal the Earth. Jochmans goes on to describe \"dream paths\" followed by Australian aborigines, and \"te lapa\" being observed by Polynesians as \"lines of light\" in the ocean that could be used for navigation! He then goes on to say the following: [The Incan Empire organized itself into] wacas or sacred centers situated along ceque lines which all converged at the Coriconcha or Temple of the Sun in ancient Cuzco. Similarly, the Mayas of the Yucatan interconnected their pyramid-sancutaries by means of Sacbes or raised white roadways that were built in dead-straight segments through the jungle swamps. We can also note here that in William Becker and Bethe Hagens' article in Anti-Gravity and the World Grid, they make the comment that the Piri Reis map of 1513 has a series of lines that are practically identical to the current placement of the UVG 120 gridlines. In the book, they actually trace over the Piri Reis map to make this demonstration, and then take that portion of the grid and highlight it on the larger \"Earth Star\" grid as a whole. We remember that this map and others like it had to have been drawn up at a time when Antarctica had no ice; and thus, it is obvious that these ancient Atlantean mapmakers were well aware of the same Grid that we have been looking at. In Jochmans' article, it says that over 3,300 ancient sacred sites have been found along the lines of the Russians' icosa-dodeca grid that we mentioned above. Slightly later in the article, Jochmans mentions the Hopi Elders describing the Earth surface as being similar to the back of a spotted fawn. As the fawn grows, the spots move and change number. Similarly, every time the Earth Mother sings a new song or enters a new vibrational shift, Her power"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"centers also change to a new configuration, interconnected by a more complex sacred geometry. Jochmans then describes the Buckminster Fuller-inspired experiments that we have already discussed, where a balloon submerged in dye and vibrated at certain frequencies will show distinctive \"grid patterns.\" He then says, When the frequency was turned higher the original dye points first quickly dissolved and then a greater number of dye points began to slowly form, joined by lines in a more complex configuration. So, Jochmans is telling us that we can expect that the Grid itself to expand and metamorphose as a result of the higher-frequency planetary cycles that we are now involved with. In this book, we have attempted to show in quite some detail exactly how these cycles operate. But if the Grid really does expand from one form of geometric order to another, how could we ever know about it? Is it possible that we could find proof for this as well? You bet! Jochmans' article is of vital interest to us, as he demonstrates unique pieces of evidence to suggest that the Earth has already made serious changes from one geometric form of organization to another. A study of map projections and world-wide geological patterns conducted in 1976 by Athelsan Spilhaus, consultant for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOM), revealed that when the super-continent Pangaea first broke apart approximately 220 million years ago forming the rudiments of our modern-day continental masses, the breakup occurred along equidistant lines forming the edges and points of a tetrahedron... Based on the research of Hanshou Liu of the Goddard Space Flight Center, who analyzed stress lines in the Earth caused by polar and land movements over the last 200 million years, Spilhaus found that what was next outlined in the planetary structure was a combination cube and octahedron. It is very interesting that this cube / octahedron shape, which is obviously many millions of years old, still appears to be in great use by the UFOs that we now see, according to Bruce Cathie. Perhaps this Grid was plotted and designed from a realm outside of linear time, and this \"historic\" example was greatly studied and calibrated as a result. More importantly, the work of Spilhaus appears to be showing us that our planet gradually has been moving through areas of higher and higher \"density\" of harmonic energy. As these areas are moved through, the frequency of the Earth cannot be held back from expanding, and the Grid changes accordingly. With the work of Gregg Braden and others that show us how much energetic stress the Earth is going through at this time, we have every reason to believe that this is going to happen again - and we will look at the time cycles involved in this when we move into Part Three. At this point in the article, Jochmans discusses material that we have already presented here, regarding the team of Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov and their icosa-dodeca grid pattern; this could be construed as the next, or most recent formation of the Global Grid. Jochmans' list of the various planetary elements that this grid contacts is the best that this author has seen, and so we will repeat it here:"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"1 High and low barometric pressure areas in the Earth's atmosphere, where storms originate and move along the crystal lattices. 2 The centerpoints for major ocean currents and whirlpools. 3 Areas of highest and lowest solar and electric influx, along with regions of highest and lowest geomagnetic gauss strength. 4 Points of magnetic / electric anomaly, which serve as gateways into other dimensions. 5 Major planetary fracture zones, where the tectonic plates come together and create seismic and volcanic activities. 6 Major concentrations of ores and petroleum. 7 Planetary hotspots where the internal magma surges closest to the surface. 8 Migration routes of land, air and sea creatures. 9 Locations of major life breeding grounds and genetic pool regions, where new species have originated. 10 Concentrations of human population centers, both past and present. 11 Birth-places for human religions, philosophies, sciences, arts and architectural forms. It is important to note here that this material was printed in Atlantis Rising as an excerpt from Jochmans' book, then still in progress, called The Earth Grid: Re-Discovering Gaia as a Living Evolving Energy Structure. At the end of the article, it says that if you wish to receive a full listing of books by Joseph now available, you can write for his Spring Catalog and Time Trek packet, from: Joseph Robert Jochmans, Alma Tara Publishing, P.O. Box 10703, Rock Hill, SC 29731-0703, or call 803-366-8023. So, when we think about the power that these lines have, it becomes very clear to us that the effects on human consciousness can be profound and almost unbelievably fantastic. If you include the Bermuda Triangle / time shifting effects as well, then we can start to see that these sacred constructions may have actually served as time machines as well. Therefore, if you stay within the sacred structure at the proper moment of time, you might just be in for the ride of your life! These feats of sacred engineering obviously would not be squandered, if they could be used for positive and spiritual effects. It is for this reason that the question of the French cathedrals such as Chartres is especially interesting. France was the home of the Mergovinian kings, a group that some authors claim to be the direct descendants of the bloodline of Jesus Christ. Sir William Spencer, who tackled the question in Bloodline of the Holy Grail from his own access to the records of the Knight Templars, recently covered this enigmatic story. The famous book that most people are aware of concerning this subject is called Holy Blood, Holy Grail. From studying this material, it is clear that the Templars were another offshoot of the original Atlantean priesthoods and their secret knowledge, which was preserved down through the ages. What we actually see is that the cathedrals themselves might have been a function of very \"advanced\" technology indeed. There are many ways to see how this would have been possible. The stained glass windows in the cathedrals visually expressed the sacred ratios of phi"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"and square root of two, as well as other forms of crystallized music, or sacred geometry. Lawlor's book and many others make this point very clear, and we have an image of this on the next page -- in this case, from the main stained glass window in the cathedral of Chartres, with added lines drawn in to indicate how it is connected to \"sacred geometry.\" The music that was played within the cathedrals was Gregorian Chant, which is very tonal and pure. So, right away you are visually seeing a mandala to organize your visual centers into the sacred proportions, and hearing the sacred intervals in your ears as sound. Then, the actual structure of the cathedrals was sized in direct proportion to the measurements of the Great Pyramid of Giza! This also might have helped to preserve the harmonic properties of the pyramid's structure, as well as paying homage to \"a complete set of records of sacred mathematics encased in stone.\" Finally, the domed ceilings of the cathedrals directed the natural spirals of energy back downwards and into the gathering. In The Law of One, Book Three, Ra discusses how there are many different examples of this type of energy harnessing being done, including the use of the teepee and the pyramids. Ra told Elkins et al. that these constructions will dramatically speed up an entity's spiritual growth process as it uses them, and that it is therefore important to exercise extreme caution when experimenting with such structures. The reason for caution is that the more personal issues one needs to \"burn off\" to further their spiritual growth process, the harder it would be for them to work in such a structure. The heightened energy that would come to them would make their \"blockages\" dissolve much quicker. In the long run, this is for the best, but in the short term it is very stressful -- and this is exactly what the Solar Cycle that we will be discussing is doing to all of us right now. Wilcock's readings along with most others of similar quality will repeatedly address this point. Another example of this sacred technology being put to use by various secret societies is in the construction of the United Nations Meditation Room. This is written about in the very one- sided and Fundamentalist Christian-slanted book called The Cult of the All- Seeing Eye by Robert Keith Spenser, published in April 1964 by the Christian Book Club of America in California. The book takes ceaseless \"pot-shots\" at"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"almost everything and everyone imaginable in the field of international government and metaphysics or esoterica. For example, at one point they zero in on the gentle Thomas Sugrue, who wrote the well-known book There is a River, which exponentially increased Edgar Cayce's popularity in the few remaining years prior to his death. Their attack was based on an esoteric symbol that he placed on the books in his library. Sugrue's symbol was designed from his initials TS, the T being the \"Tau Cross\" and the S being the \"serpent of wisdom,\" which to Spenser's team could only mean the Devil! Even though this book is alarmist, conspiratorial and fundamentalist, we actually can pick up some interesting information along the way. It is important to note here that we are not necessarily condoning all actions that have been apparently undertaken by secret societies throughout time. There are clearly going to be opposites in these groups, just as there are in people. (For example, Adam Weishaupt's \"Bavarian Illuminati\" certainly appear to have all the hallmarks of highly self-serving or \"evil\" intentions.) We feel that it would be foolish to simply make a blanket assumption that all secret society members in positions of power are part of some vast, evil conspiracy. Remember that we briefly said that The People of the Secret by Ernest Scott focuses on the positive aspects of these groups, in their ongoing communication with Higher (or extraterrestrial) Intelligence to direct humankind towards greater spiritual awareness. What we do see in All-Seeing Eye is specific data regarding a room that is built with all of the same harmonic specifications that we have just discussed in relation to the cathedrals. The simple existence of this room directly implies that the United Nations has maintained at least a fair portion of the knowledge of these secret traditions. First of all, the Meditation Room has a very bizarre-looking mural within it, and in All-Seeing Eye they demonstrate that this has a great deal of 'sacred geometry' and ancient symbolism in its construction. The builders insisted that it did not have any specific symbolism, but Spenser paints a dark and foreboding image of a massive cult that seeks to subvert Christianity into a larger religious faith steeped in pagan traditions. This group committed the unpardonable sin of wanting to unify the spiritual beliefs of the world so that everyone could agree with each other. So, let's look at the picture of the room and its mural for starters:"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The seats in the room are in the back, where the photograph was taken. The room itself is built in the shape of a truncated pyramid, which is certainly a \"sacred shape,\" as a function of Pyramidal geometry. This truncated pyramid shape was worked into the mural in several different places, as was the full pyramid with capstone as well. We can also see that the geometric form of the altar in the center of the room is preserved in the mural through rectangles that are of the same size and proportion. The very geometric and colorful mural helps to organize the meditator's visual centers with sacred geometry, just as we have seen with the Chartres image on the previous page. Music piped into the room helps to organize the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"meditator's mind, again duplicating the effects in the cathedrals. And last but not least, what is that big stone altar doing in the middle of the room? Surprisingly enough, it is a piece of naturally magnetic metal or magnetite, and is indeed the largest natural piece of magnetite ever mined. Even more interesting is the fact that its foundation goes straight into the bedrock of the Earth underneath the floor of the room. (According to All-Seeing Eye, the lodestone was the largest of its kind ever mined, and was given to the United Nations by the Swedish in 1957. The public does not have access to the room underneath.) If we look closely, we can see that the circle in the middle could be construed as the Earth, with its tilted axis clearly visible. What is then interesting is that once again we see a spiraling energy, this time in the diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left that has a snakelike curve in it. And furthermore, there are three large rectangles that can be made out in the diagram, and they are undoubtedly in a spiraling pattern with relation to each other - one being left to right, one being diagonal and one being top to bottom. This does certainly look like the phi spiral is being implied herein. Other symbols are hidden within this mural as well, including the circle with a dot in the center, the astrological symbol for the Sun. Obviously, the architects of the UN Meditation Room had this harmonic system down to a science. A minor grid line not visible on the Becker / Hagens map directly overlies Geneva, Switzerland, so that satisfies the global energetic location requirements. We have the proper room structure, the proper visual structure and the proper musical structure. We then have a gigantic piece of natural magnetite, which obviously has a tremendous magnetic field. Why would the architects of the UN Meditation Room wish to import such an expensive material if it didn’t \"do\" anything? Wouldn't it make a lot more sense that this magnetite actually helps to harness and enhance the natural spiraling magnetic Earth energies in the room? In our next book, Convergence Book One, we will see that magnetism is the primary means to harness aetheric energy, just as we can see with the Earth's magnetic field. We can definitely start to see that by those who know, this technology was indeed never \"lost,\" only kept hidden. By meditating in a room with a giant magnet in it, the natural hyperdimensional energies from the Earth are greatly enhanced. This certainly explains why the architects made sure that this \"altar\" had a foundation that went straight down into the bedrock of the land below. Who knows what remarkable functions of consciousness could occur in this room with a properly-tuned group of meditators at the proper time of the year? We may not know the answer to this question, unless we can afford the trip to Switzerland to go and check it out for ourselves. And now we come to the most interesting part of all of this - the famous All- Seeing Eye that is printed on the reverse side of every American dollar in circulation, as well as on the cover of this book in modified form. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams adopted this symbol after they were given the task of creating a seal for the United States of America on July 4, 1776. A French West Indian portrait painter named Eugene Pierre Du Simitiere, who was commissioned by Thomas Jefferson, rendered the original design."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The All-Seeing Eye is unanimously agreed upon as being a \"Masonic symbol.\" There are voluminous materials available to show that the founding fathers of the United States of America were all Masons. Freemasonry is a \"fraternal order\" that traces its origins far back into antiquity. The work of Manly P. Hall covers the subject of Freemasonry quite considerably, especially in his incredible \"encyclopedic overview\" entitled The Secret Teachings of All Ages. Those who are familiar with this book, or with any of Hall's work, should be well aware of the gigantic amount of information that is available on these and other \"secret societies\" throughout time. An environment of such secrecy is perhaps the only way that such a daring American Revolution could have been organized in the first place. Many different sources point out that the Boston Tea Party was a Masonic-driven event. This historical event protested against Britain's tea tax, where a large group of men dressed as Native Americans boarded a British ship in the harbor and dumped out all of its onboard tea boxes into the ocean. In the Time-Life book Secret Societies from the Mysteries of the Unknown series, there is a reprint of a picture that someone had sketched of the Masonic meeting hall that night. For some inexplicable reason, the building was empty, even though the scheduled meetings were normally kept with almost religious observance. At the bottom of the sketch, the artist writes: \"We all went out for a cup of tea.\" What is particularly interesting to us is the obvious connection between the All-Seeing Eye within the triangle and the basic form of the \"consciousness units\" that we have discussed so frequently. If we look back at illustrations such as the Barbury Castle crop circle, we can clearly see that the predominant design is a triangle with a dot in the middle. As we now know that this dot represents the One, or the Octave, we can understand why it would be given the symbol for Deity, or the All-Seeing Eye. Now, if we look back to the United Nations Meditation Room mural, we can see that this same symbol was carefully and secretly encoded within it:"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"What we see in the image is that the central circle, divided into quarters to symbolize the four elements, is directly framed within a triangle. Although this triangle is extended, the image is the same. Furthermore, when you continue the circular line to the left of the central circle as we have done, you can see that this forms a larger circle that precisely circumscribes the smaller one. This is the classic astrological symbol for the Sun. By putting a line through the central circle on the exact same diagonal angle of tilt that is implied by the surrounding shapes, we can indeed see that it represents the Earth, tilted away from the Sun with one half illuminated with daylight. And then, to top it all off, we have the suggestion of a spiraling line that is at work on the central circle. So, we can see that there is a definite reference to the circle within a triangle, the universal symbol for the \"consciousness unit\" that shows up in many different ways, including the crop circles. We can see that the mural implies a spiraling quality to these consciousness units, which we have now discussed in great detail. We can also see that the consciousness unit is also indicated as being the Earth. So, this is obviously a symbolic construction, although the UN Review of 1958 simply referred to it as having been designed \"to conform with the purity of line and color sought, for what Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold has called 'a room of stillness'.\""},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Interestingly enough, the harmonic numbers that we have been studying are worked into its construction as well. Spenser tells us that there are 72 geometric figures in the diagram altogether. 72 would obviously be half of 144, which we have now seen over and over again to be fundamentally related to both sound and light and the Great Solar Cycle - remember that there are 144,000 days in each baktun. The spiral in the diagram has nine sections, and this is also a fundamental number, the \"building block\" of the entire Gematrian system of frequencies. So, if we look back to the symbol on the dollar bill, we can see that it is comprised of a truncated pyramid. Interestingly enough, if we count the blocks on the pyramid, we will discover that there are 72 of them altogether - again, the \"cornerstone\" frequency number. The All-Seeing Eye and its positioning in the Great Seal refers to the symbolism inherent in the Great Pyramid's construction, which we will read about in Chapter 20 when we discuss Peter Lemesurier's epic work, The Great Pyramid Decoded. According to this number series, the number \"six\" indicates preparation or incompleteness. The message of the Pyramid's inner passageways has entirely to do with humanity's motion through incompleteness towards spiritual perfection, completeness or Ascension. This is symbolically accomplished when the Pyramid is turned into a five-sided, instead of a six-sided object. This is done quite simply, as the Pyramid as it now stands has a flat top, which makes it a six-sided object. When the capstone is put back in place, it becomes a five-sided object, and five indicates perfection and initiation. So, what we have here is a symbolic glyph for the instreaming fourth- dimensional energy used as the \"capstone\" for a Pyramid with 72 blocks! It is actually a quite ingenuous symbol when you really think about all the information that it contains. Clearly, the sum total of knowledge that could be achieved from a continent such as Atlantis is indeed vast. We have seen evidence that much of this knowledge has been passed down age after age. The work of de Santillana and von Dechend, as we will see in Part Three, shows us that in almost every culture in the world, a \"flood myth\" exists which preserves all of the crucial \"frequency numbers\" responsible for the Earth's wobble, known as precession -- a number that is of fundamental importance to us. The standard \"precessional number\" of 25,920 years is also a Gematrian number, an expression of the same frequencies we have been discussing as the speed of sound vibrations per second in our atmosphere. (It reduces to 2592, which is a higher harmonic of the same octave-based number set.) When we look to the Maya, we can see a culture that might very well have preserved a great deal of Atlantean knowledge over time. Nowhere is this more apparent than in their amazing preservation of a system of precise data regarding Sunspot cycles. The work of Maurice Cotterell will give us the hard science to back up the Mayan numbers. So, when we learn from Mayan codices that their Calendar cycles chart the beginnings and endings of ages, the pieces do indeed start fitting together very nicely. The Maya had a system of mathematics so exact that we are still trying to catch up to them today, and figure out exactly how they came about all of this information. Now that we are looking at the data regarding the Great Seal of the United"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"States, we must ask if it is possible that the knowledge of this same Great Cycle was preserved throughout the Western civilization and its secret societies. If this were so, we might better understand why the Pyramid symbol was placed on the Great Seal of the United States. What we can see is that this Pyramid eloquently combines the \"frequency number\" of 72 with the diagram of the \"consciousness unit\" of the upcoming fourth dimension, also seen in the Barbury Castle crop circle of 1991 and many hundreds of others. And finally, we have the clear-cut metaphor of the re-establishment of the Pyramid's capstone, which symbolically refers to the Ascension of the human species. It is very interesting to point out here that the Egyptian Board of Antiquities, spearheaded by the efforts of Dr. Zahi Hawass, has now said that they will place a golden capstone on the Great Pyramid on the night of Dec. 31, 1999. Even though most people don't really understand the symbolism of this, we can certainly see it now. This piece of information makes an even greater case for the knowledge within the secret circles that we are at the end of our present age, and ready for Ascension or a hyperdimensional shift. So, if the Great Seal's symbolism is not a coincidence and the American founding fathers did indeed have this knowledge, there should be some other glaring clues. One of these clues is in the pattern of stars above the Eagle in the obverse side of the Seal. If we look closely at this pattern, we can indeed see that it is fashioned as the Star of David. And, we have already seen how the Star of David is a two-dimensional diagram of the star tetrahedron within a sphere, the energetics of the Fourth Dimension. We are also told in All- Seeing Eye that the national bird for the US was not originally the Eagle, but the Phoenix, symbolizing the death of the old and the rebirth of the new. And that is certainly not all. Almost everyone has seen the Latin words that surround the symbol of the Great Pyramid on the dollar, but very few actually understand what they mean. The words are \"Annuit Coeptis\" and \"Novus Ordo Seclorum.\" Both of these are quotations from Virgil, a Greek mystic and philosopher. The first statement, \"Annuit Coeptis,\" means \"He [God] has looked with favor upon our beginnings.\" We can see the physical counterpart of this in the foundation of the United States being \"spiritually blessed,\" but we can also see a larger, more metaphysical explanation that would have to do with the origin of humanity as a whole, as a Divine species. But now, let's look at the bottom portion: \"Novus Ordo Seclorum.\" The meaning of this phrase is given to us in Spenser's book through a quote from C. A. L. Totten, a 1st Lieutenant in the 4th artillery of the U. S. Army, who communicated his views on the seal to Charles J. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury, on February 10, 1882: The All-Seeing Eye is one of the oldest hieroglyphics of the Deity. The triangle also is a cabalistic symbol of the most remote antiquity... The descent of the mystic eye and triangle in the form of a capstone to this mysterious monument [the Great Pyramid of Gizeh] of all times and nations, is to us as a people most pregnant with significance. The motto, Novus Ordo Seclorum, is a quotation from the 4th Eclogue and was borrowed in turn by Virgil from the mystic Sybylline records."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The entire quotation is as follows: 'The last age of Cumaen song now comes. (Novus Ordo Seclorum altered from Magnus Soeclorum ordo), A mighty order of ages is born anew. Both the prophetic Virgin and Saturnian kingdoms now return. Now a new progeny is let down from the lofty heavens. Favor, chaste Lucina, the boy soon to be born in whom the iron age shall come to an end, and the golden one shall arise again in the whole earth'. This passage is indeed quite revealing. What we learn is that \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" does not mean \"New World Order\" as many conspiracy theorists would claim, but actually \"A mighty order of ages is born anew.\" When we think of a mighty order of ages, we immediately think of the precessional cycle, comprising of the 2,160-year ages of the Zodiac. Then, if we think of this \"mighty order of ages\" as being \"born anew,\" we could well expect that this would be signified by the ending of the entire cycle, which we are making a very strong argument here as being related to Ascension, or the Shift of the Ages. But does this statement from the 4th Eclogue and Virgil back up the idea of such a shift? Read carefully. The last age... now comes. A mighty order of ages is born anew... Now a new progeny is let down from the lofty heavens. Exactly what is this new progeny? A new life, a rebirth, an entire group of Ascended human beings? It certainly would appear to be that way, in the same sense that the Cayce Readings said that we are about to form the fifth \"root race.\" We then go on to read the statement, The boy soon to be born in whom the iron age shall come to an end, and the golden one shall arise again in the whole earth. Since we could certainly argue that we are still in an \"age of iron\" and machines even now, it is not hard to see that this passage refers to the end of our own age and the beginning of the New Age, an age of light or \"enlightenment.\" Furthermore, the fourth-density souls are indicated here as looking \"golden.\" There are numerous spiritual sources that attest to the fact that this is indeed how an Ascended being would look, the most obvious being the Bible indicating the appearance of the Ascended Christ. Now, with a source of guidance such as the Cayce Readings, we can see a comprehensive study of the true meaning of the Christ Spirit, which is that Divine spark within each person. The Second Coming of Christ is actually the rebirth of this Christ Self within each individual entity, and the Shift of the Ages represents the \"completion\" of the same curriculum that Jesus patterned for us. So, this notion of the \"golden one\" arising in the whole earth certainly could be an Ascension metaphor. Perhaps what is even more interesting is that this passage suggests that extraterrestrial forces are involved in all of this as well. \"Both the prophetic Virgin and Saturnian kingdoms now return.\" We are told in Spenser's book that Saturn was the father of Osiris, and that the All-Seeing Eye is the symbol"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"of Osiris. As this was the highest god in the Egyptian pantheon, we can certainly wonder if there might be an extra-terrestrial connection to all of this. HANCOCK AND BAUVAL One thing that we do know from the work of Robert Bauval, including The Orion Mystery and The Message of the Sphinx (co-authored with Graham Hancock) is that the three pyramids of Gizeh indicate a precise \"terrestrial map\" of the constellation Orion in the sky. Bauval also tells us that to the Egyptians, the Orion constellation was the symbol of Osiris. Furthermore, we can see from Bauval's work that the only time that the terrestrial, pyramid- based Osiris and celestial, star-based Osiris could have been in perfect alignment was 12,500 years ago. And as we will continue to see, we are at the end of yet another precessional cycle, which Osiris has been carefully marking out for us year by year. By Dec. 22, 2012, we will have completely entered the next cycle. So, it is possible that the \"Virgin and Saturnian kingdoms\" could also be a coded reference to Osiris and the passage of the ages. But, if we choose a more adventurous approach, it could also mean that two different extraterrestrial \"kingdoms\" return to Earth at this time. If this is what it means, then certainly the evidence is all around us, as UFO sightings and \"leaked\" information continues to build up on all sides. We may never know exactly what this quote was really trying to tell us, but we can certainly see how all the major clues are laid out for us to see. EDGAR CAYCE AND THE HALL OF RECORDS The next bit of \"historical\" information worth covering in this chapter is the notion of the Hall of Records. This was referred to in the Cayce Readings as a set of written records as well as technological artifacts from the Atlantean civilization. The readings said that we would find a room under the right paw of the Sphinx that would lead to the Hall of Records, and since the late 1980's the existence of this room has been confirmed. Numerous groups have used advanced technology such as ground-penetrating radar to prove that there is very much indeed a room present down there. Even more recent \"secret\" bulletins authored by Graham Hancock and others have suggested that there appears to be an entire complex of underground tunnels and rooms beneath the Gizeh plateau, including one room that is the \"size of a giant cathedral.\" Some of these passages and rooms were actually admitted to exist on the Fox TV special, The Opening of the Tombs. In this March, 99 broadcast, Zahi Hawass gave the world its first glance at what was believed to be the Tomb of Osiris, contained within a room tunneled over 100 feet below ground. The program also suggested that other passageways could lead out from this one, although it was not directly confirmed. Many people, including Wilcock, feel that this is only a small portion of the knowledge that is actually available at this point in time. If Cayce's readings are indeed accurate, then there is much more waiting for us under all of that Egyptian sand. When skeptics lash out against Cayce's idea of Atlantis, they forget the simple fact that Cayce's readings had unparalleled accuracy in the medical arena, far beyond any possibility of chance. Many of us are far too quick to pick and choose among what these or"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"other readings may say, only accepting what we want to accept and refusing the rest. If we take the Cayce Readings' validity on faith, then we indeed have proof of the existence of Atlantis. However, all of that might now be changing. We remember that Cayce's readings said that the Hall of Records would be opened in 1998. We will suggest that this actually DID happen, just not in Egypt, even if very few people are aware of it. We DON'T have to take Cayce's readings \"on faith,\" as a group of people have actually come up with hard, physical evidence to prove that his readings were right. And furthermore, those who have unearthed this evidence have apparently already made very significant discoveries that will change our idea of life on Earth forever once they are released. In short, it appears that someone really DID find the Hall of Records \"on time!\" Although very few people seem to be aware of this fact, Aaron Du Val, Director of the Miami Museum of Science Egyptology Society, claims to be in close contact with a group that has indeed discovered the lost records of Atlantis. This work stems off of the work of a Professor Scott, who apparently discovered an amazing series of submerged pyramidal structures in the general area of Bimini off the coast of Florida. Cayce's readings had said that early signs of Poseidia, one of the last islands of Atlantis to sink, would \"be seen to rise\" in this area in 1968. And indeed, it was in this same year that Dr. J. Manson-Valentine was flying over the area and noticed rectilinear structures in the water. Dr. Manson-Valentine's findings included what has come to be called the \"Bimini Wall,\" a gigantic set of cyclopean stones that were assembled into what must have been a gigantic seawall to protect a coastline at one time. Obviously, we can now tell that it didn't hold up against the rising tides. Many other megalithic stone discoveries also suggested a lost civilization of some sort, although this material has been largely ignored since the 1970s. Dr. Scott's discoveries seem to have gone well beyond those of Dr. Manson- Valentine. Dr. Scott's pyramidal structures apparently have painted maps of our Solar System that are still visible inside, as well as a veritable treasure trove of other archeological discoveries. The group of researchers that has continued to work on these findings has released very little information about the site, and for good reason. They fear that treasure hunters and plunderers would immediately dive in and try to steal everything they can, were they to know the location of the area. And, they are quite possibly correct in assuming this. So, we are left with the uneasy position of \"trusting\" that this group is indeed going to eventually release this material on their own. Since early 1996, there have been the occasional Email messages from Mr. Du Val, indicating the progress of the group. All of this seemed very low-key, and there were few, if any, radio appearances or publication of these possible findings. The group had been planning to release a good portion of their material in the summer of 1998, and those who did know about this work obviously got very excited. According to Du Val's letter, there were personal injuries and sickness, threats and intimidation, and they ended up backing off completely. The conference never happened, and thus Cayce's prophecies for the Hall of Records being opened in 1998 \"failed!\""},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Wilcock had basically lost interest in the group after they failed to present their findings as they had promised. Since they had released so little in the way of concrete information about their findings, the most common reaction was simply to dismiss them out of hand. Wilcock's readings had indicated that this group's findings were indeed genuine, but he really hadn't paid much attention to that fact. It is certainly interesting to note that this group has now been studying this site since 1995, and has steadfastly refused all offers of big money or mainstream publicity about these findings due to the gravity of the discoveries that they are making. If they were truly \"faking it,\" they certainly don't seem to have a motive for profit or fame! By December of 1998, this author had been seriously wondering what had ever become of Aaron Du Val and his crew. The thought came to him quite spontaneously one day while he was working on transcribing his readings at the computer. Only one day later, he received an Email directly from Aaron Du Val that literally \"blew his doors off.\" In the letter, there was a summary of all 1998 mailings from the group, none of which Wilcock had yet read. The most interesting fact that came out of the study of these bulletins is that Du Val's group has apparently found two of the three sets of the Hall of Records! Edgar Cayce's readings indicated that there was a set in Egypt, a set in Bimini and another set in the Yucatan. Du Val's mailings indicate that they were able to decode the messages from the findings at the Scott Stones site, which in turn led them to discover a set of records in Egypt. This was not the Hall of Records referred to by Cayce, but it was indeed something that was equally interesting. Says Du Val: 23 May 1998 ...‘There’s a lot of talk these days about the possibility of finding ancient records, especially around Giza; but everyone seems to have forgotten about the original records of Sais.’ The explorers say they’ve identified the long-lost chronological records used by the priest of Sais, who first informed Solon, back in the sixth century BC. “The existence of these records was confirmed, as you may know, following the days of Plato; but, they subsequently fell into obscurity. The explorers say they’ve located and deciphered these very records; and that these Egyptian records correlate with the records found at the Scott Stones! The record is THE SAME, they say, ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OCEAN! and the Sais/Solon/Plato-account for the end of the AtlanteanEmpire can now be INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED!’ Obviously, if this is true, it is highly interesting, as it puts Cayce's prophecies for these records being discovered in 1998 into a whole new light. We can then skip ahead to the next bulletin, and see how the findings of this group continued to gather tremendous weight throughout that same year: 30 September 1998 ...‘We are extremely happy, today, to be able to report that another MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH HAS BEEN MADE. On the 23rd of September, by carefully following guidelines laid out by"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Professor Scott, the explorers were finally able to vault a formidable barrier, making it possible to begin deciphering an ancient form of writing which apparently goes all the way back to Atlantis itself! The explorers say they are “thrilled, awed, and humbled” by the information they are recovering. They warn, however, that there may be many who will see this information as quite “shocking or up-setting.” The explorers also say that the unthinking and inconsiderate attitudes of some, to both the relevance and the fragility of these discoveries (not to mention the inevitable complications involved with governmental entanglements) leave them little room to reveal much more at this time and still insure the responsible protection of these sites. It is for this most obvious reason that the exact location of both of these sites MUST, for the time being, remain a secret; pending the institution of proper protection and supervision.’ Obviously, this Email was another very tantalizing piece of bait, whetting the appetite of almost anyone with an interest in lost ancient civilizations such as Atlantis. The next relevant Email produced even more significant leads: 30 October 1998 ...‘As progress continued in translating an ancient form of writing found in Egypt, it was realized, to the surprise (and joy) of the explorers, that at some point in time, a SIMILAR SET OF RECORDS had actually been carried to the area of the Yucatan! A full explanation of how this was determined from actual records in Egypt will have to wait. But the important news, for now, is that by matching the available clues, the explorers were able to locate (on the 23rd of October) a MATCHING SET OF RECORDS IN THE YUCATAN AREA! This latest find is very exciting; and the explorers say that as translations continue, it may be possible to locate other sites with matching records, as well. Records which have been translated, so far, deal with prophecy, historical events, dimensional shifts in time, and the religion of Atlantis. It is estimated that a full translation of records found, to date, could take years to accomplish. But the fact that the very same information is found in both hemispheres can only be seen as a RESOUNDING VERIFICATION as to the authenticity and intention of these records!’ Immediately, this bulletin caught Wilcock's eye. What these researchers are proposing here is that the Hall of Records that they discovered had to do with, in their exact words, \"dimensional shifts in time!\" One has to wonder exactly how these records were able to discuss such things, and have it understandable enough that these researchers knew what they were looking at. Even though we might automatically throw this out, since we just have to \"take Du Val's word on it,\" the material in this book starts to make this idea look a lot less preposterous, even obvious in hindsight."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"It becomes quite clear, then, that we are seeing another possible confirmation that the Atlanteans knew exactly what this Great Cycle of the Solar System would do. We will soon see that de Santillana and Von Dechend in the book Hamlet's Mill showed us how the precessional numbers were encoded throughout almost all cultures on Earth, through mythology. We have also seen the Maya as possible inheritors of Atlantean calendrical cycles that precisely charted out these Sunspot and precessional cycles. And now, if Du Val's information is correct, we can see that the Atlanteans must have been very well aware of the effects of this Cycle. It is our contention that the information in this book will help this group of researchers greatly in understanding their findings. The next Email update also included new information that makes the entire situation even more compelling. This update suggests that the findings of this group of researchers are precisely dovetailing with the results in the Edgar Cayce Readings. 21 December 1998 ...‘What’s more, the explorers (although independent and having no connections whatsoever with the A.R.E.) are saying that: “It cannot even be debated (probably much to the rancor or chagrin of some) that the actual INFORMATION contained in these records DOES POSITIVELY CONFIRM things which Edgar Cayce supposedly saw, including: startling new information concerning a predicted RETURN!’ Exactly what do they mean by this return? It is hard to tell, as there are at least three different possibilities. One would be that the Cayce Readings referred to this time in our history as being that of the Second Coming of Christ. Two is that they referred to the return of John the Beloved as John Peniel. (An individual claiming to be \"Jon Peniel\" has written a book that he is selling via Internet entitled \"The Children of the Law of One.\" While this person has definite spiritual ideals, it is highly unlikely that this is the \"genuine\" article.) And three is that the Cayce Readings referred to the return of Ra-Ta the priest in 1998, who was apparently a past incarnation of Cayce's. So, no matter which one of these three possibilities turns out to be the one that they are referring to here, it is certainly a very interesting proposition to consider. Unfortunately, as of April 2000 the group still has not been forthcoming with a disclosure of their material, as they are working diligently to decode it and have not yet secured what they feel to be adequate protection for the site. And so, now that we have come to the end of this chapter, we can move directly ahead into Part Three of the book, where we will investigate the actual harmonic time cycles that are responsible for bringing this event about. We will start by re-investigating the readings of Ra and Cayce for further details on the operation of this harmonic system of physics as it relates to cycles of time."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 15: CAYCE AND RA SPEAK ON THE GREAT SOLAR CYCLE Here we check in on the remarkable works of Edgar Cayce and The Ra Material. Cayce's readings specifically mention a Solar Cycle, and we investigate that question against the backdrop of other information in the Cayce Readings. Then, we go through an in-depth analysis of a series of excerpts from the Ra Material, giving us a precise outline of what we might expect as a result of Ascension, or what they refer to as the \"harvest. CHAPTER 15: CAYCE AND RA SPEAK ON THE GREAT SOLAR CYCLE September 22, 1939: Sleeping Prophet Edgar Cayce is finally becoming well known in the public eye. The world is soon to be in war. Tensions are high and patience low. For thirty years or more, Cayce’s information had been quite astounding in its own right. He had captured the interest of the academic world through fantastic medical readings, correctly diagnosing illnesses and prescribing natural treatments. It is now a well-known fact that with nothing more than a name and address, Cayce could go into a trance state and precisely describe any medical ailment facing a person, with a 99-percent accuracy rating. With no formal education, his \"readings\" used all the mainstream anatomical and medical jargon of his day. Absolutely no one can argue these points, and thus Cayce's medical readings are essentially \"bullet-proof\" to the prying eyes of the devoutly skeptical. The readings would also prescribe a huge range of natural remedies to cure these problems, involving everything from diet to exercise to homeopathy to chiropractors, masseurs and osteopaths. They designed many new medical remedies that had never before been seen, precisely describing what ingredients to use and in what combinations. They also designed new devices for healing, including the Wet Cell, the Radial Appliance and the Violet Ray. For the time period he was in, and indeed any time period, Cayce's results were extraordinary in scope. It seemed that there was a limitless access to all manners of spiritual information, similar to Ramanujan's access to mathematics. However, for almost the first twenty years of Cayce's psychic career, the topic of reincarnation was never mentioned once, nor many other metaphysical facts and concepts that were largely controversial at the time. But now, in 1939, Cayce is now on the opposite end of a major personal breakthrough - he decided to lighten up on his diehard Fundamentalist Christian beliefs and begin accepting many metaphysical things that his readings had wanted to tell him for years. This information included things such as past lives, astrology and even life on other planets. Had the forces revealed this knowledge earlier, he would most likely have declared them evil and possibly shut down the entire process. In the midst of this new information, Cayce’s sources reveal the possibility of epic, unprecedented changes centering around the year 1998. It is on this day, September 22, 1939, that perhaps the single greatest puzzle piece in the entire Cayce saga was granted regarding this issue. READING #3 FOR CLIENT # 1602, QUESTION 8"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"8. (Q) Three hundred years ago Jacob Boehme decreed Atlantis would rise again at this crisis time when we cross from this Piscean Era into the Aquarian. Is Atlantis rising now? Will it cause a sudden convolution and about what Year? Keep in mind that the author has purposefully italicized the part of the above question wherein the client specifies the \"crisis time\" as being that of the transition of the Piscean Era into the Aquarian. As we will explore in later chapters, this time period is almost exactly the same as that of the 12 / 22 / 2012 ending date of the Mayan Calendar. Therefore, if this were the only date to be concerned with, we should expect that the Cayce Readings would mention it. We will see the enigma of the fact that they have NOT mentioned 2012 immediately below.] (A) In 1998 we may find a great deal of the activities as have been wrought by the gradual changes that are coming about. These are at the periods when the cycle of the solar activity, or the years as related to the sun’s passage through the various spheres of activity become paramount or Catamount to the change between the Piscean and the Aquarian age. This is a gradual, not a cataclysmic activity in the experience of the earth in this period. - 1602-003 9 / 22 / 39 The original question was essentially this: “Is the sunken land of Atlantis going to rise again? If it does, will it cause a sudden convolution, a shifting in the landmass? What year could we expect something like this to take place?” Notice that the wording of the answer does not indicate a definitive answer to any of these questions. It does not definitively state that Atlantis will rise, nor that California will sink. It does say that this event is a gradual, not a cataclysmic activity during this period. Therefore, although other Cayce readings did indicate disaster in 1998, this one clearly does not. Let us focus on what we did get in this reading, as it is extremely important. Paraphrasing the answer in the readings, one might come up with the following statement: “A great deal of the gradual, (not cataclysmic) changes surrounding the transition into the Aquarian Age may occur in 1998. It is a [Great] Cycle in the Sun’s activity that brings in this new age. Or, more precisely, it is the passage of the Sun through other spheres of activity that creates this solar cycle.” Our crucial question in unfurling the puzzle then becomes “What other spheres of activity does the Sun pass through?” In other words, “What does the Sun revolve around?” The obvious answer, based on the system of physics that we have been investigating, is that the forces are referring to the spherical harmonics of various \"consciousness units\" existing as force points in the Milky Way Galaxy. As time progresses, we will bolster this idea with greater evidence, including that of a mathematical nature. Let us paraphrase again. “1998 will bring many of the great awakenings that lead into the Aquarian Age. This is being caused by the Great Cycle of the Sun. This great solar cycle is in turn caused by the revolution of the Sun through the various spheres of activity in the galaxy. This cycle is a gradual activity; it does not occur all at once.”"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Wilcock's own readings explain clearly that through events such as the Jonesboro school shootings, the popularity of the movie Titanic and its ability to cause spontaneous emotional release, and the public \"crucifixion\" of President Clinton, major awakenings within the public were made. Indeed, now that it has passed, we might not see 1998 as being such a crucial year, yet an event like the Clinton scandal is truly unprecedented in world history. Through Internet, the private life of the world's most powerful man was exposed in excruciating detail to the public. This, in turn, has led to powerful realizations within the populace of the reality of how wrong these extra- marital sexual behaviors really are. We learned a powerful lesson in not hurting our own loved ones, in this case our spouses. In the \"group mind\" of humanity, massive changes did indeed occur. The next problem here is twofold. We know that Cayce's reading listed above refers to a solar cycle. We are given almost nothing to go on regarding this cycle, except that the Cayce readings put strong weight in the year 1998. We will tackle the question of how 1998 relates to the Solar Cycle in later chapters, but for now, we will focus on the first part of the problem. If this Solar Cycle is in fact a tangible, measurable phenomenon, there should be certain clues in the Cayce Readings that steer us in this direction. We will now go digging for those clues and see what we can find. First of all, if we look back to the reading, we can see that this Solar Cycle is clearly associated with the passage from one age to another. We know that we are currently in the 2,160-year Age of Pisces, and will move into the Age of Aquarius at a point in time calculated by French scientists as occurring in the year 2011. So right away, we see that there is a possibility that these ages of the Zodiac figure in to our equation. As some of us may or may not know, there are a total of 12 ages, for the twelve signs of the zodiac. And 12 times 2160 is 25,920. Thus, one complete or Great Age of the Zodiac would be 25,920 years. Someone might wonder why this number was chosen, since it might appear to be arbitrary. Actually, it is not arbitrary at all. This number is actually an observable astrological cycle that the Ancients have known about for thousands of years. It is referred to as the precession of the equinoxes. This means that the position of certain stars that appear to be fixed will actually precede through the sky in a set motion every year. You would measure the position of these \"fixed stars\" each Equinox, and after 72 years, you could indeed observe that all the stars would have shifted in their positions by one degree of arc in the night sky. Of course, the number 72 is twice that of 36, so right away we can see the harmonic systems at work. We remember that in the last chapter, the designers of the Great Seal of the United States put exactly 72 bricks into the Pyramid. 12 and 2160 are also perfect harmonic numbers, along with the \"master number\" of 25,920. In order to visualize the one-degree movement every 72 years of precession, we must look at Polaris, which we normally would consider to be fixed and immovable. This is the \"North Star\" that we all know and love, because it appears that all other stars in the heavens rotate around it during the course of the night. However, precession will eventually move Polaris out of this position. For example, the star Alpha Draconis, in the nearby constellation Draco, was at one time also in this position. The movement of the earth that"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"accounts for this phenomenon is the precession. Since the questioner for this reading asked for specific details regarding the passage of these zodiacal ages, we can see a direct connection to the 25,920- year precession of the equinoxes. Cayce's readings attribute it to a solar cycle, although current scientific opinion has it that this precession is caused by a \"wobble\" in the Earth's axis, caused by an interplay between the Sun's gravity and the Moon's gravity, having a very slow effect on the Earth's orbit. The effect is said to be the product of Earth acting as a gyroscope. Many people know that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather an \"oblate spheroid,\" meaning that it bulges at the Equator. And so, due to the uneven distribution of weight, the Earth experiences a very slow counter-rotation in the opposite direction to its normal counter-clockwise, or west to east rotation. The same thing can be seen to happen in a spinning top that has broken its regular upright rotation and is about to grind to a halt. Let's say your top represents the Earth, and you start it spinning counterclockwise. You can watch it go along for a good bit of time and everything will be fine, but before too long it will shudder and start a slow opposite-spinning motion as it also continues spinning at its normal speed. This shudder will occur in a clockwise direction, opposite to that which you started your top with. You will see a slow but precise circle traced out as it continues to slow down. So, even as it continues spinning very fast, once it destabilizes, it also traces a circle very slowly in the opposite direction. We can tell from looking at this that it obviously has to do with a gravitational effect. There is no question that the strongest gravitational factors on the Earth are the Sun and Moon, and thus modern astrophysicists explain that this motion is caused by the interplay of these gravitational forces. But this still doesn't get us much further in terms of understanding why this cycle is 25,920 years. There doesn't seem to be any causative mechanism that is specific enough to explain the precise length of this motion. Clearly the image of precession is a complicated picture to visualize, and the best way to do it with the Earth would seem to be through the notion of a visible axis. If the Earth were reduced to the size of a basketball, and you could walk up to it as it spins, you could visualize a giant axle going through the Earth in a north-south direction. Let's say that you could touch and move the axle without disturbing the Earth's rotation, similar to a gyroscope. The Earth would be on its 23.5-degree tilt, inclined away from being straight up and down. If you went up to this axle and grabbed it on the top and bottom, you could spin it in a slow, deliberate circle in the opposite direction from its counter-clockwise rotation. It would be similar to stirring a giant pot of food with a spoon, making one complete circle. The time that it would take you to complete this circle would be, in Earth terms, one Precessional Year of 25,920 years. So, that is our official explanation for how to visualize precession, and how long it is. Now we have a Cayce Reading that seems to be indicating a solar cycle that is coming to the end of its age, not strictly an Earth cycle. If there is indeed a cycle in the Sun that governs the precise length of precession, we have yet to officially discover it. In future chapters, we will present very compelling evidence that a researcher by the name of Maurice Cotterell has done just that, to an amazing degree of accuracy. Cotterell has also tied this"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Solar Cycle in directly to the enigmatic Mayan Calendar. But for now, our concern is the Cayce readings themselves. If they are indeed referring to a cycle roughly 25,000 years in length, then there should be some other clues in the readings that point us in this direction. So, we need to discover if the Cayce Readings do in fact refer to any turning points of previous ages, and then see if the numbers jump out at us. Without getting into tedious detail, and for the purposes of keeping this chapter brief, we can summarize the following information. Anyone can cross – validate this data in a variety of means, including the numerous Edgar Cayce books that are available as well as going directly into the readings themselves to find it. We will quickly see the implications of the actual information that the Cayce Readings have given us as we study the events that are listed for these various periods of time. Here are the approximate values in years for the Cayce cosmology of ages: 10,500,000 BCE: First apelike humans living in caves that separated into families. These formed the bodies for modern humanity. [2665-2] [5748-2] 200,000 BCE: Entrance of extraterrestrial-like spiritual entities to Earth plane, forming original Atlantis. [364-4] Entities are “much rather of the nature of thought-forms” that could “push out of themselves... in the way and manner as the amoeba” [364-3] The entities in question are hyper-dimensional or non- physical beings. 100,000 BCE: Amilius, a spiritual entity present at the time, notices that a crisis is forming. The thought-form entities are becoming separate from their spiritual roots, and may become “hardened.” [364-3] 75,000 BCE: Thought-form entities become “hardened or set much in the form of the existent human body of the day.” The hyperdimensional thoughtform presence suddenly begins occupying the human bodies on the Earth, as well as animals. Spiritually conscious humankind is born, and with it comes a forgetting of its original heritage. Amilius begins a massive program to free the hyperdimensional entities by joining them in the physical form to teach them who they really are. This incarnation of Amilius is called Adam, the “First Man.” [364-3] [Note: The Cayce Readings do not specify exactly when this \"hardening\" took place; the Ra Material, on the other hand, gives us the date we have listed.] 50,000 BCE: First major human technological civilization on Earth collapses from pole shift. Near-total destruction of Lemuria and partial sinking of Atlantis. A worldwide conference had just decided to use a radiation-type device designed to kill predatory animals in very large numbers. After the polar shift itself, the inhabitants discovered that their use of radiation only exacerbated a cycle that was about to complete anyway. 25,000 BCE: Second major inundation of Atlantis. Civilization falls yet again. 12,500 BCE: Third major inundation of Atlantis. Great Pyramid is built in part to preserve the records. 0 BCE: Amilius / Adam returns to Earth for final physical incarnation as Jesus"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"the Christ. He then completes His obligations in getting humanity to recognize how to escape materiality through the process of Ascension. This sets the pattern for all others to follow. 2001 ACE: Magnetic pole shift on Earth, also associated with dawning Second Coming of Christ. As we can see from the chart, there is a lot of interesting metaphysical information that can be developed as a result of all this. The reader is encouraged to ponder on these matters, and look further to the many books about Cayce and Atlantis for more details regarding these things, such as The Egyptian Heritage, Edgar Cayce on the Origin and Destiny of Man and Mysteries of Atlantis Revisited. For now, the immediate focus should be in seeing that the cycle we are looking for in the Cayce Readings cosmology of ages is indeed divisible into roughly 25,000-year units. Thus, we can aptly demonstrate a fundamental connection between Cayce's \"solar cycle, or the Sun's passage through the various spheres of activity\" and our approximately 25,000-year figure for precession. While we have the data right in front of us, it is good to point out some other things in this Cayce cosmology that are now backed up with modern science. In the Cayce timeline, the entrance of human bodies to the Earth is cited as being some ten million years ago. This falls precisely in line with the latest research that has been done by Thompson and Cremo regarding historical cases of fully human skeletons that have been found. The epic work that catalogs these discoveries is called Forbidden Archaeology, and their assertions are backed by hard, definitive science. Their conclusion is that the entire Darwinian theory of evolution is wrong and modern humanoid-styled beings have been on Earth in one form or another for approximately the last ten million years. The entrance of extraterrestrial-type spiritual beings to the Earth is cited in the Cayce readings as being some 200,000 years ago. It is quite interesting to note that modern genetic researchers have concluded that the human DNA can be traced back to a single Eve who lived some 200,000 years ago. This fact is referenced most completely in Zecharia Sitchin's book, Genesis Revisited. The work of Richard Hoagland and others regarding the possible extraterrestrial ruins on Mars, which we have already explored in previous chapters, also points towards the time of 200,000 years ago. This was perhaps the most recent time that Mars could have endured a cataclysmic asteroid collision that led to its destruction. There is overwhelming evidence that Mars was very similar to Earth at one point in its past, with fertile oceans, blue skies, clouds and rain. The evidence, from researchers such as astrophysicist Thomas Van Flandern, is very strong in suggesting that a colossal explosion caused by an asteroid was responsible for the demise of Mars. Another resource for this data is found in Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval's The Mars Mystery. Interestingly, the most recent \"Mars Meteorite\" being examined in Europe as having possible evidence for bacterial life also traces back to 200,000 years ago. It is certainly possible that this planetary cataclysm might have been what jogged the rock loose. Going back to the essential point raised in the Cayce Readings, it would appear that all modern humans have \"fallen\" from a more spiritual and"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"energetic form of life. These lifeforms are referred to as \"thoughtform beings ... capable of pushing themselves out in a matter similar to the amoeba.\" We are not told very much about these beings in the readings, but the implications are that they possessed vast intelligence, enough so that it allowed them to be able to project into animals in the first place. The inescapable conclusion that we are faced with in the Cayce Readings is that the intelligent energy of these creatures caused a modification in the DNA of the existing hominids on the planet. By entering into bodies in the way that they did, they might have had a definite effect on the DNA structures. Cayce tells us that their complete \"hardening\" by 75,000 BCE in turn led to the production of modern humanoids. The modification of the DNA structure would therefore be the \"hardening\" or \"setting\" referred to in the Cayce Readings above. Cayce's slant on the story would tell us that the vibrations of the entities themselves must have had a direct effect on the structure of the human DNA molecules. This does harmonize with the interesting facts about DNA that we have already discussed. It has been repeatedly demonstrated by scientists, including one of the original discoverers of the DNA molecule itself, that the design is far too complex to have come about through the random processes of evolution espoused in the Darwinian model. Therefore, the scientific paradigm is increasingly moving in the direction of \"intelligent design.\" Furthermore, as we have already stated, Gregg Braden cited research that proved that a DNA molecule, when inserted into a cylinder of light, would attract the photons within and cause them to spiral along with itself. And we remember that he also said that this spiral will continue once the DNA has been removed. So, since we now have seen that the \"spiraling line of light\" is the fundamental building-block of the Consciousness Unit, and the Consciousness Unit according to Seth is the formation of all intelligent perception, everything starts to become clearer. Each one of us is truly a \"hardened\" wavelength of a form of consciousness that at one time was a form of pure spiraling Light! Since we learned in the late 20th century that the DNA of modern humanity can be traced back to an origin 200,000 years ago, we have to accept the fact that there is an increasing body of scientific evidence that fits Cayce data very well; data that came in advance of these more recent discoveries. One thing that is a definite fact is that Cayce's medical accuracy cannot be disproven. So for now, let us continue to work with this timeline. The actual combination of these thoughtform entities with the physical humanoid bodies on the Earth took place in 75,000 BCE. Therefore, this would be when the cycle of human incarnations began in proper. We will see a little later that the Ra Material covers this in great detail. From this we can then see that if the cycle length is roughly 25,000 years, there have been exactly three cycles leading up to the present. The fall of Atlantis, occurring 12,500 years ago, would be exactly at the halfway point of the most recent 25,000-year cycle. Therefore, each cycle appears to be divisible in half, and the ending point of either half might produce stressful tectonic activity. The sinking of a landmass like Atlantis could be explained through the idea of magnetic pole shift, which we previously discussed as being sanctioned by no other than Albert Einstein, upon reviewing the work of Charles Hapgood. In Hapgood's model, the entire Earth's magnetic field suddenly reverses its"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"polarity, causing a sudden change in the location of magnetic North and South as well as causing the Earth's outer crust to slide over the liquid mantle inside. Obviously this process would cause immediate and very serious trouble on Earth for those who still remained in the third density - and that is the key phrase. Researchers like Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky in his book Worlds in Collision have definitively tied the notion of a Pole Shift into the immediate, wholescale destruction of much of the animal life on Earth in the past. Velikovsky's data includes the discoveries of huge numbers of prehistoric animals that lived in temperate climates showing up twisted, mangled and dead in Arctic regions. The carbon-dated time for these disasters is identical to the time of pole shift. Facts like this point Velikovsky and others to the notion that what happened on Earth was so fast and so catastrophic that the surfaces of the Earth itself literally changed from tropical to Arctic in a matter of minutes, depending on where they were located. In other words, the Earth completely shifted its position in the heavens. And furthermore, it is commonly known that the last major magnetic pole reversals that have been recorded occurred roughly 75,000, 50,000 and 25,000 years ago. So again, we can see a very precise dovetailing between the collapses of the purported lost civilizations in the Cayce Readings and the actual dates for the pole reversals. The Cayce Readings also referred to these collapses as occurring through \"a shift in the magnetic poles of the earth.\" It should be no surprise that the Cayce Readings indicate another polar shift occurring in 2001. The epic work of Michael Mandeville, also available from the Laura Lee Radio Bookstore, provides conclusive geological evidence to support the idea that Cayce's predictions will come true. Now note that in this book we are not predicting any doom. The larger implications of the Great Solar Cycle indicate that a fundamental shift in the nature of consciousness and energy itself will naturally transition us to a level where this would not affect us. THE RA MATERIAL AND THE GREAT CYCLE At this point we will again give some background information regarding the Law of One material remind ourselves of the significant points of this development in the field of “psychic readings.” This author stands behind the opinion of fellow author and friend Dr. Scott Mandelker in saying that the Ra / Law of One Material is at the cutting edge of channeling, and is second only to the Cayce Readings in terms of its strength. And in many ways, it surpasses it, since you do not have to go digging through 14,000 different obscure readings to find all of the important information - everything is contained in five books. Mandelker's comments on Ra are gleaned from Appendix 3 of his book From Elsewhere. He states the following: Without a doubt The Ra Material is the single most important source of written teaching I've ever encountered. The Ra Material is the first of four volumes of channeled text, organized into 100 question-and-answer sessions over a two and a half year period. Having said this, it becomes difficult to organize my thoughts on a subject whose personal influence has been so tremendous, such a revolutionizing and"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"redefining experience. For anyone interested or sympathetic to the extraterrestrial perspective, I believe it's difficult to come into contact with The Ra Material without its having a profound impact on one's personal civilization and feelings. Indeed, I believe one's complete outlook on the universe will be altered. The Ra Material was the end product of over twenty years of channeling work done through a woman named Carla Rueckert. In this work, Rueckert was rendered completely unconscious, just as Cayce was in his own work. [This is not the typical pattern for “channeled” literature, which is usually done from at least a semi-conscious state.] Rueckert had no memory whatsoever of what she said in the Ra contacts, whereas her earlier experiences had always been through the process of \"conscious channeling.\" Ra spoke directly through Rueckert and was questioned by Don Elkins, Ph.D., a former airline pilot and University of Louisville physics professor. Mandelker is not the only published author to express the utmost praise for the Ra Material on the printed page. Also in this camp is retired USAF Lt. Col Donald Ware. Col. Ware's account of the Ra Material is given in the book UFOs and the Alien Presence- Six Viewpoints by Michael Lindemann, published by The 2020 Group, CA, 1991. At the time the book was published, Col. Ware was the Eastern Regional Director of MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network. Ware played a key role in MUFON's investigation of the now-famous Gulf Breeze sightings in Florida. MUFON concluded that the photographs from Gulf Breeze were indeed authentic. Lindemann clearly did not expect that Ware was going to get into the topics discussed in the Ra Material, and it seems that Ware's own information gleaned from Ra was quite surprising, even amazing, to Lindemann. Ware states the following in his interview with Lindemann: ML: You speak of the larger reality. I'd like to know what you mean by that. DW: The larger reality is the basis of all the major religions of the world, and all the secret societies. It's knowledge that was so heavy that only a few could comprehend it, and not thoroughly at that. The larger reality is coming through to us in many different ways now, most of them telepathically. I think the clearest description that I've read in the last couple of years is in the four books of The Law of One, which are the transcripts of 104 question- and- answer sessions that Don Elkins had with an entity called Ra between 1981 and 1983. [Note: The fifth book in the Ra series, a collection of personal material, was released for the first time in 1998.] The information contained in The Ra Material is vast, but so was the toll that it took on Carla's body. As we already mentioned in the chapter on Ramanujan, when we look at the field of psychic readings as a whole, there are repeated examples of people who suffer considerable damage to the body as a result of their work. These include Jane Roberts, Paul Solomon and Edgar Cayce, all of whom had deep connections and died at a rather early age. Similarly, the Ra connection was enormously draining on Carla’s physical and vital energy, exacerbating pre-existent arthritis pains and kidney dysfunction. By the end of the fourth book in the series, this reader was practically in tears over the toll"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"it finally took on her. It appears that she may well have died if they had tried to continue it any farther than they did. But apparently, this physical toll in vital energy was part of Carla’s gift, in order to be able to bring in this unique information for the world. Ra is indicated to be an extraterrestrial group that aided in the founding of high civilization in Egypt after the fall of Atlantis. The words that emerged from Carla’s lips are arguably more complicated and intricate than any other material in existence, and yet remain 100 percent consistent in data from one session to the next, throughout all five books. The Ra Material was not dictated as a book as much as a long series of question and answer sessions between Ra and Don Elkins. The complexity of the Ra information was so high that it frequently stumped Elkins, who was obviously very well educated and had researched the UFO phenomenon for more than twenty years. The group itself was in control of what questions were asked, and they were routinely chided for venturing into areas that were \"off-topic,\" which Ra called \"issues of transient importance.\" It is quite evident from reading Ra that the only topic they wished to discuss was the Law of One, as this was the most powerful law that anyone could ever hope to understand. The law states that all entities, places and things in all dimensions of the creation are One, and there is no actual separation between any of them. Ra explained that the single most important thing we can learn to support the Law of One is the notion of service to others. That is the one term almost invariably used when Ra describes the positive polarity, or the positive path. The term used for the negative polarity is those who choose the path of service to self. Therein lies the distinction. It is the author’s own experience that a half-hour can be spent on one page, reading, rereading and digesting the material, before it can be understood. To read and begin to understand all five books is no small feat. The main arguments in this book that you now read are the end result of two years of intense study of certain portions of this material, so in a sense, the author has taken the liberty to analyze the literature and compress the main points into simple chunks. Indeed, due to the overwhelming difficulty that it presents, Ra is not for everyone, and the author himself never gave it a second look when first perusing a copy of Book Three in a bookstore. It certainly appears that no human intelligence could ever really understand everything said in the Law of One material; we can simply stand on the outside and point a finger at the most obvious parts. According to these readings, Ra is a \"social memory complex\" from the sixth dimension, which they claim is actually the equivalent of an entire planet worth of beings that have fused into one identity. Their planet of origin is in our own solar system, and very long ago in our terms they had a third-density civilization there -- the planet is Venus. Several scientific studies have pointed towards the fact that Venus may have been much more Earthlike in the distant past, making it suitable for life. This was the topic of a feature article in USA Today in 1996, with the headline, \"Venus may have had life millions of years ago.\" Of course, both the Cayce readings and Ra would agree that Venus is still quite suitable for higher-dimensional lifeforms. The Ra group often used words far outside the range of Carla’s own vocabulary, forcing them to use dictionaries afterwards. Though this body of"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"material is far less recognized than the Cayce Readings, there is every reason to believe that in many ways it is an improvement in information quality over them in the sense of providing a comprehensive \"cosmology of dimensions\" with the physics to go along with it. But we should also say this: it is a discrete fact that Cayce apparently was going to a higher dimensional level than Ra to obtain the information; namely the octave, or eighth. Ra indicated that they were a sixth-density source. No other reliable “channeled” information appears to be coming from anything higher than the fifth density, besides Ra and Cayce. Cayce’s extreme fundamentalist beliefs only allowed him to obtain esoteric information after more than thirty years of strictly medical-based psychic readings. For years, Wilcock had felt that an immense, untapped knowledge was hiding behind the Cayce readings, with only the briefest glimmers coming into view in such cases as the solar cycle reading given above. The forces were never actually allowed to simply explain everything they really knew, as Cayce wouldn’t have tolerated it. Plus, the readings were done for paying customers who wanted to find out about their own lives. Our statement that the Ra / Law of One material could be construed as a better source is not meant to attack or undermine the credibility of the Cayce Readings one bit. However, it is safe to say that the Ra contact improves greatly upon the same information that is only hinted at in Cayce’s work. The main difference in the Ra Material is twofold. Cayce’s readings were quite obscure, and this was due to the fact that he sent a portion of himself individually to these higher realms to obtain the information. Thus, in conducting these information searches, all he had was the resources of one entity, namely himself. With the Ra Material we are told that we have a whole planet worth of entities involved. These entities naturally live in that level, and thus have much more experience putting the material together and being able to communicate it in an accurate and reliable fashion. The second reason why the Ra / Law of One material is more useful is that there were no apparent limitations in the flexibility of the beliefs with the group doing the work. Cayce’s inflexibility posed a tremendous and ongoing problem to the forces working with him. In the work with Ra, it seemed that almost nothing that came through any session could upset or shock Elkins, (with a few exceptions journalized in Book Five,) as he was extremely open- minded and had studied the phenomenon very intensely. Before the contact had started in earnest, over twenty years of previous channeling and UFO research had been done. The channeling had always been done on the conscious level. It was the arrival of Mc Carty into the group that directly provided the catalyst for the unconscious-level Ra contact to be born. Clearly many would think that these statements supporting the Ra Material’s excellence might be overinflated. But the simple truth of the matter is that Ra was able to answer every question the physicist could produce, no matter how complex or intricate. The level of intelligence displayed in the contact is so high that it is literally impossible to fathom that Carla could have produced it on her own. The source often makes Elkins appear ridiculously inadequate in his understandings. Among other things, Ra resolved many paradoxes in physics that Elkins had been working on already. These solutions included a Unified Field theory, which bolstered the findings of a little-known physicist named Dewey Larson. Ra confirmed that each dimension of space also had its"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"own dimension of time. Our current model of physics does not supply a different dimension of time for each level; time is seen as a third-dimensional phenomenon only. The other main breakthrough in physics that came through the Law of One material has been the cornerstone of this book: the fact that the dimensions themselves are organized into an octave structure. Just as we have seen, Ra informs us that each dimension corresponds to a sound frequency, a light frequency and a geometric, structural “frequency,” and even the most cutting- edge physicists such as Tony Smith have produced models that indicate almost exactly the same thing. This author has found that the more research he does and the more he understands his research, the more the Law of One series explains. RA SPEAKS ON THE GREAT SOLAR CYCLE It is important to keep in mind that Cayce and Ra are literally the two biggest players in this whole story. Cayce himself had an important incarnation as the Egyptian priest Ra-Ta, who coordinated the efforts of the survivors of Atlantis and helped design the Pyramids and the Hall of Records to preserve their knowledge. The name “Ra-Ta” is indicated in the Cayce readings as meaning “Sun-Earth.” But clearly the Ra we are talking about here cannot be the same as Ra-Ta. We are told that Ra exists out of linear time altogether in the sixth density, and is millions of years ahead of us in terms of evolution. In one section of the Cayce readings, a list of holy names are given to invoke for prayer and protection. In this list of names, there is a “Ra” as well as a “Ra-Ta.” This is our only clue in the Cayce readings that there is another force involved besides Ra-Ta himself. Therefore, if our sixth-dimensional group of entities had the name Ra, the name “Ra-Ta” may well have been taken by their contact on Earth. Again, we are told that “Ta” means “Earth,” so this name could mean “Ra on Earth.” Cayce must not have been presented with this information about the external Ra because of the effect that it would have on his fragile beliefs in esoterica, and thus this portion of the story was deliberately omitted. The story of Ra-Ta’s activities was simplified in order for it to get through at all. Near the beginning of the very first session with Ra, they say the following: The identity of the vibration Ra is our identity. We as a group, or what you would call a social memory complex, made contact with a race of your planetary kind called Egyptians. [Others from our density made contact at the same time in South America...] We spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One.” What better name for this entity than “Ra-Ta,” or “Ra on Earth? And then, in Session Two, we get a timeline for this arrival, as well as a summarization of some of Ra’s activities. We are those of the Confederation who eleven thousand of your years ago came to two of your planetary cultures which were at that time closely in touch with the creation of the One Creator... We attempted to aid them in technical ways having to do with the healing of mind / body / spirit complex distortions through the use of the crystal, appropriate to the distortion, placed"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"within a certain appropriate series of ratios of time / space material. Thus were the pyramids created. We will explain what this section means in a moment. In the Cayce readings, Ra-Ta is said to have designed the Great Pyramid with the help of Hermes, an earlier incarnation of Jesus. The timeline given for this being done is approximately eleven thousand years ago, which is perfectly in sync with what Ra tells us here. Obviously this was another way that Ra worked cooperatively with Ra-Ta on Earth; Ra provided the pure hyperdimensional power necessary to construct the Great Pyramid. Right away, we can see in the reading that the pyramid is a “crystal appropriate to the distortion [of healing] placed within a certain appropriate series of ratios of time / space material.” The crystal portion is quite interesting and revealing. The Pyramid is the same shape as the top half of an octahedron, one of the five basic Platonic solids. These Platonic solids, in turn, form the geometric structures that organize and provide a foundation for each of the different dimensions. The pyramid would then be a way to physically build this “crystal” on Earth. The “ratios of time / space material” could very well refer to the positioning of the Great Pyramid on Earth, relative to the Global Grid. Later on in the book, Elkins asks a question about where Ra came from, and they tell him the planet Venus, many millions of years ago in our terms; they have since gone on to the sixth dimension. They describe how they were seen as luminous beings when they appeared on Earth. Elkins then asked them how they were able to appear on Earth. Since they were sixth-dimensional beings, how were they able to appear in the third? This will prove to be an interesting answer that will also provide more questions. Q: How were you able to make the transition from Venus? Did you have to change your dimension to walk upon the Earth? RA: I am Ra. You will remember the exercise of the wind. [This was a process regarding opening the pathway to higher consciousness.] The dissolution into nothingness is the dissolution into unity, for there is no nothingness. From the sixth dimension, we are capable of manipulating, by thought, the intelligent infinity present in each particle of light or distorted light so that we were able to clothe ourselves in a replica visible in the third density of our mind / body / spirit complexes in the sixth density. We were allowed this experiment by the Council which guards this planet. Again, what Ra seems to be referring to here is that they are taking each “distorted particle of light,” and manipulating its frequency to a lower vibrational level in order that they might become physically visible to us on Earth. What they are obviously referring to is consciousness units, which have been central to our discussion. Ra then seems to hint at some form of cosmic government or Council that allowed them to do this. Naturally, Elkins jumped on the opportunity to ask about this. Q: Where is this Council located? RA: I am Ra. This council is located in the octave, or eighth dimension, of the planet Saturn, taking its place in an area which you understand in third-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"dimension terms as the rings. Naturally, it would only make sense that intelligent, hyperdimensional forces that work in our solar system would organize their efforts. The Cayce Readings did indicate in no uncertain terms that there was life on the other planets in the solar system, only of higher dimensional levels. What Cayce probably could not have dealt with at the time would have been the truth regarding other physical civilizations, which might have left behind other physical artifacts. Within only the last few years, researchers such as Richard Hoagland and Thomas Van Flandern have been examining this very evidence; physical artifacts on the planet Mars, and the idea of an artificial explosion of an inhabited planet that is now the asteroid belt. Understand that this is by no means idle speculation, but hard science. The Martian hypothesis is supported with increasingly convincing pictorial data of structures, including the most recent batch of photographs that provide an even better view of the pyramids there. And as for Van Flandern, the discovery of a common origin point for all comets and the discovery of asteroids with smaller fragments orbiting around them are two facts that support his \"exploded planet hypothesis.\" More recently, an asteroid has been found that shows stratified geological layers, which essentially proves to even the mainstream scientists that it had to have come from a larger planetary body that exploded. The Ra contact gives us valuable insight into the actual civilizations behind these disasters, if we choose to believe it. Also remember that this book was channeled in 1981, well before the word was out to any significant degree on either the Mars Face or the Exploded Planet Hypothesis. QUESTIONER: Are there any people such as you find on Earth on any of the other planets in our solar system? RA: I am Ra. Do you request space/time present information space/time continuum information? QUESTIONER: Both. [David's Note: I laughed when I first read Elkins' response. But I then thought to myself that with a question as serious as this, if they offered you two choices, you would have said \"both\" too.] RA: I am Ra. At one time/space, in what is your past, there was a population of third-density beings upon a planet which dwelt within your solar system. There are various names by which this planet has been named. The vibratory sound complex most usually used by your peoples is Maldek. These entities, destroying their planetary sphere, thus were forced to find room for themselves upon this third density which is the only one in your solar system at their time/space present which was hospitable and capable of offering the lessons necessary to decrease the mind/body/spirit distortions with respect to the Law of One. [So right away, we see that Ra provides the perfect explanation for the \"exploded planet hypothesis\" of Van Flandern, years before it was ever put before the public. The planet's explosion was due to the fact that its own people destroyed it.]"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"QUESTIONER: How did they come here? RA: I am Ra. They came through the process of harvest and were incarnated through the processes of incarnation from your higher spheres within this density. [Understand that Ra has made this statement without having explained what harvest was at any point in their work so far.] QUESTIONER: How long ago did this happen? RA: I am Ra. I am having difficulty communicating with this instrument. We must deepen her state. This occurred approximately 500,000 of your years ago. QUESTIONER: Is all of the Earth's human population then originally from Maldek? RA: I am Ra. This is a new line of questioning, and deserves a place of its own. The ones who were harvested to your sphere from the sphere known before its dissolution as other names, but to your peoples as Maldek, incarnated, many within your Earth's surface rather than upon it. The population of your planet contains many various groups harvested from other second-dimension and cycled third-dimension spheres. You are not all one race or back ground of beginning. The experience you share is unique to this time/space continuum. [Now, we can clearly see that Ra is referring to a form of planet-hopping, which they are calling harvest. They are also implying that most people on Earth had lived on other planets in the past and were harvested from them. Since harvest was not yet explained, Elkins took the opportunity to try to figure out exactly what it was. Italics are the author’s, for emphasis.] QUESTIONER: I think that it would be appropriate to discover how the Law of One acts in this transfer of beings to our planet and the action of harvest? RA: I am Ra. The Law of One states simply that all things are one, that all beings are one. There are certain behaviors and thought-forms consonant with the understanding and practice of this law. Those who, finishing a cycle of experience, demonstrate grades of distortion of that [higher-dimensional] understanding of thought and action will be separated by their own choice into the vibratory distortion most comfortable to their mind/body/spirit complexes. This process is guarded or watched by those nurturing beings who, being very close to the Law of One in their distortions, nevertheless, move towards active service. [And so, to translate what Ra is saying here, harvest occurs when an entity “finishes a cycle of experience,” which we will soon learn from Ra as being our 25,000 year interval. At that point, the entity can make a freewill decision to go into a higher dimensional frequency, or a “vibratory distortion most comfortable to [its] own mind/body/spirit complex.” Furthermore, we learn that this process is not automatic, but rather coordinated by “nurturing beings very close to the Law of One,” or what we would term either extraterrestrials or angelic beings.]"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Thus, the illusion is created of light, or more properly but less understandably, light/love. This is in varying degrees of in tensity. The spirit complex of each harvested entity moves along the line of light until the light grows too glaring, at which time the entity stops. This entity may have barely reached third density or may be very, very close to the ending of the third-density light/love distortion vibratory complex. Nevertheless, those who fall within this octave of intensifying light/love then experience a major cycle during which there are opportunities for the discovery of the distortions which are inherent in each entity and, therefore, the lessening of these distortions. [You have to read that paragraph carefully, as the implications of what Ra is saying are vast. An entity could be “very, very close to the ending of the third density,” but if the entity is not ready for the fourth level, the entity must experience another “major cycle” of the third dimension. Obviously there is a quite good reason to overcome your lessons of third-density polarity and karma!] QUESTIONER: What is the length, in our years, of one of these cycles? RA: I am Ra. One major cycle is approximately 25,000 of your years. There are three cycles of this nature during which those who have progressed may be harvested at the end of three major cycles. That is, approximately between 75 and 76,000 of your years. All are harvested regardless of their progress, for during that time the planet itself has moved through the useful part of that dimension and begins to cease being useful for the lower levels of vibration within that density. [So this paragraph is perhaps the single most important statement we can glean from Ra to point in the direction of the reality of this cycle. It says that any planet in the cosmos with intelligent life apparently goes through a 25,000-year “major cycle” as part of the functioning mechanism of the universe. This cycle obviously determines when the entities there are “harvested.” Plus, we learn that no planet has to “put up” with more than three of these cycles. Obviously, third-density life is very hard on a planet; the Maldek entities even went so far as to destroy the entire planet. Luckily, we haven’t done the same thing here.] QUESTIONER: What is the position of this planet [Earth] with respect to the progression of cycles at this time? RA: I am Ra. This sphere is at this time in fourth-dimension vibration. Its material is quite confused due to the society memory complexes embedded in its consciousness. It has not made an easy transition to the vibrations which beckon. Therefore, it will be fetched with some inconvenience. [As you can already see here, and becomes even more obvious later, Ra is saying that we on Earth have almost finished our passage through three major cycles. It is so close to us now that the fourth-dimension vibration is already extremely strong. Ra speaks of the \"inconvenience\" in our transition to the higher vibrations; this fits very nicely with the Cayce information regarding Earth Changes and pole shift as we approach these turning points.] QUESTIONER: Is this inconvenience imminent within a few years?"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"RA: I am Ra. This inconvenience, or disharmonious vibratory complex, has begun several of your years in your past. It shall continue unabated for a period of approximately thirty of your years. [Since the Ra Material was written in 1981, this indicates that the target timeframe is 2011-2012. After that point in time, the inconvenience is over, because the cycle itself has ended. After Dec. 22, 2012, the Earth will be 100 percent fourth-dimensional vibration, and all life upon it will be fourth- dimensional or higher. We can again see how the Ra Material is fitting perfectly with all the data that we have before us. This data correlates perfectly with the ending date of the Mayan Calendar, and vastly increases the knowledge gleaned from the Cayce Readings regarding these cycles.] QUESTIONER: After this period of thirty years I am assuming that this will be a fourth density planet. Is this correct? RA: I am Ra. This is so. QUESTIONER: Is it possible to estimate what percent of the present population will inhabit the fourth-density planet? RA: I am Ra. The harvesting is not yet, thus, estimation is meaningless. [Wilcock’s own sources indicate that the numbers are still lower than they should be, however many of the great Earth Changes prophesied for 1998 in other readings by Cayce have not come to pass. Hopefully, more progressive spiritual events will occur in our societies to raise the numbers of people who are \"harvestable.\"] QUESTIONER: Does the fact that we are in this transition period now have anything to do with the reason that you have made your information available to the population? RA: I am Ra. We have walked among your people. We remember. We remember sorrow: have seen much. We have searched for an instrument of the proper parameters of distortion in mind/body/ spirit complex and supporting and understanding of mind/body/ spirit complexes to accept this information with minimal distor tion and maximal desire to serve for some of your years. The answer, in short, is yes. However, we wished you to know that in our memory we thank you. [What we can see from the above paragraph is that the whole reason for a contact like Ra to occur now is to prepare this planet for harvest, or Ascension. This is literally identical to what Ra keeps saying through Wilcock as well. We are at the most crucial turning point of the entire 75,000-year cycle. Notice that Ra said that 2012 was the completion of the planet’s progress into the fourth density; they did not say that it was the first time that human entities would be able to Ascend. They tell us that the “inconvenience”, or Earth Changes, will last this whole period of time. And now, we jump ahead to the next quote, where Ra reveals the true scope of the organization and vastness of the multidimensional or extraterrestrial forces that are around us at this time.]"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"QUESTIONER: Do any of the UFOs presently reported at this time come from other planets, or do you have this knowledge? RA: I am Ra. I am one of the members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. There are approxi mately fifty-three civilizations, comprising approximately five hundred planetary consciousness complexes in this Confeder ation. This Confederation contains those from your own planet who have attained dimensions beyond your third. It contains planetary entities within your solar system, and it contains planetary entities from other galaxies.* It is a true Confederation in that its members are not alike, but allied in service according to the Law of One. *Ra often uses the word \"galaxy\" where we would say planetary system. This meaning is listed in the unabridged dictionary but is not in common use. [Interestingly, this is the exact same type of information that Dr. Courtney Brown received in his remote-viewing experiences, even though he had no previous interest in UFOlogy of any kind. He also was not even told consciously what it was that he would be viewing, but still managed to receive accurate data that fit the \"target.\" Brown’s data also indicates a “Galactic Federation,” and there are fantastic parallels between what is written in his book Cosmic Voyage and what Ra is telling us here. So now we can start to understand that there could be a great deal of intelligent life surrounding us and guarding over this harvest. We know that this intelligent life is organized into a “council” or “confederation.” We also know that we are at the end of three major cycles of 25,000 years, and that the process of “harvest” is now imminent in our future. Now that Elkins has all of this in mind, he asks a question, seeking to know why it would be that the time measurement is so precise. By all accounts, it is an excellent question, and it will give us far more insight into what Cayce was describing when he said, “the cycling of the Sun through the various spheres of activity.”] QUESTIONER: The way that I understand the process of evolution is that our planetary population has a certain amount of time to progress. This is generally divided into three 25,000-year cycles. At the end of 75,000 years the planet progresses itself. What caused this situation to come about with the preciseness of the years in each cycle? RA: I am Ra. Visualize, if you will, the particular energy which, outward flowing and inward coagulating, formed the tiny realm of the creation governed by your Council of Saturn. Continue seeing the rhythm of this process. The living flow creates a rhythm which is as inevitable as one of your timepieces. Each of your planetary entities began the first cycle when the energy nexus was able in that environment to support such mind/body experiences. Thus, each of your planetary entities is on a different cyclical schedule as you might call it. The timing of these cycles is a measurement equal to a portion of intelligent energy. This intelligent energy offers a type of clock. The cycles move as precisely as a clock strikes your hour. Thus, the gateway from intelligent energy to intelligent infinity opens regardless of circumstance on the striking of the hour."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"[Note that Ra refers to the energy as “outward flowing and inward coagulating.” This is an indication that the Sun itself is a giant, pulsating consciousness unit, existing in all dimensions and pulsating throughout them. This provides a very tidy explanation for the 'cycles of the solar activity' referred to by Cayce. And as we can repeatedly see from Ra, this pulsation takes on a geometric and geographical counterpart. This pulsating cycle of the consciousness units is so exact, according to Ra in this quote, that it can be precisely timed and measured. This might also be related to the precision of our modern atomic clocks, which we now use as an absolute standard for timekeeping. We also see from the above statements that each planet, since it occupies a different position in the Solar System, also has a different “cyclical schedule.” The above excerpt makes it very clear that there is a harmonic order to the movement of large-scale planetary, solar and galactic bodies, an order which determines the length of time that it takes them to move very precisely. As we move towards the conclusion of this book, we will cite mathematical evidence, including never-before-seen findings of Wilcock's own, that provide a much firmer basis for this understanding. In the next excerpt, Elkins tries to obtain more information on exactly how it is that harvest takes place, in terms of the “planet-hopping” we had been discussing.] QUESTIONER: When graduation occurs at the end of a cycle, and entities are moved from one planet to another, by what means do they go to a new planet? [Notice that Elkins asks a question in the plural; “entities.” His answer is in the singular: “... totality / beingness.” In other words, the planet’s intelligent life is One.] RA: I am Ra. In the scheme of the Creator, the first step of the mind/body/ spirit/totality/beingness is to place its mind/body/ spirit complex distortion in the proper place of love/light. This is done to ensure proper healing of the complex and eventual attunement with the totality/beingness complex. This takes a very variable length of your time/space. [It is important to note that Ra tells us in other places that a mind / body / spirit / complex / totality / beingness is the full summation of a planet worth of beings as one identity. So to translate this, the individual entities are referred to here as “mind / body / spirit / complex distortions;” they are distorted forms of the whole that are only apparently individual. So what we see is that the whole group consciousness of the planet places its apparent individual entities into “the proper place of love / light” in order to “ensure proper healing.”] After this is accom plished the experience of the cycle is dissolved and filtered until only the distillation of distortions in its pure form remains. At this time, the harvested mind/body/spirit/totality/beingness eval uates the density needs of its beingness and chooses the more appropriate new environment for either a repetition of the cycle or a moving forward into the next cycle. This is the manner of the harvesting, guarded and watched over by many."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"[What we can see here is that it appears that the entire planet of entities chooses what its mass karmic lessons are, or what it needs to learn. If it needs to incarnate as a whole on a different planet as many apparently separate and individual entities, then it will do so. If it hasn’t fulfilled its evolutionary obligations to, in our case, the fourth density, it might choose to find another third-density planet for “a repetition of the cycle.” And again we are reminded that this whole process is “guarded and watched over by many.” So what this means is that there are entities in the universe that are powerful enough to guard and watch over an entire planet worth of beings as their group-mind decides what to do in this harvest situation.] QUESTIONER: When the entity is moved from one planet to the next, is he moved in thought or by a vehicle? RA: I am Ra. The mind/body/spirit/totality/beingness is one with the Creator. There is no time/space distortion. Therefore, it is a matter of thinking the proper locus in the infinite array of time/spaces. [Our next excerpt of questions shows us that since we are so close to the end of the cycle, our world is almost completely in fourth-density already. The only thing holding it back now is our own consciousness. But once the cycle completes, the changes will be permanent, as Ra has said.] QUESTIONER: What is the density level of our planet Earth at this time? RA: I am Ra. The sphere upon which you dwell is third density in its beingness of mind/body/spirit complexes. It is now in a space/time continuum, fourth density. This is causing a some what difficult harvest. QUESTIONER: How does a third-density planet become a fourth-density planet? RA: I am Ra. This will be the last full question. The fourth density is, as we have said, as regularized in its approach as the striking of a clock upon the hour. The space/time of your solar system has enabled this planetary sphere to spiral into space/time of a different vibrational configuration. [Again, remember Cayce's line, 'the cycle of the Sun's passage through the various spheres of activity' in describing this same cycle. We can clearly see the parallels here.] This causes the planetary sphere to be able to be molded by these new distortions. However, the thought-forms of your people during this transition period are such that the mind/body/spirit com plexes of both individual and societies are scattered throughout the spectrum instead of becoming able to grasp the needle, shall we say, and point the compass in one direction. Thus, the entry into the vibration of love, sometimes called by your people the vibration of understanding, is not effective with your present societal complex. Thus, the harvest shall be such that many will repeat the third-density cycle. The energies of your Wanderers, your teachers, and your adepts at this time are all bent upon increasing the harvest. However, there are few to harvest."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"[In our next Ra quote, Elkins has asked if it indeed is true that in our third dimension, “there is actually no past or future, that all is present. Would this be a good analogy?” The answer is surprising.] RA: I am Ra. There is past, present, and future in third density. In an overview such as an entity may have, removed from the space/time continuum, it may be seen that in the cycle of completion there exists only the present. We, ourselves, seek to learn this understanding. At the seventh level or dimension, we shall, if our humble efforts are sufficient, become one with all, thus having no memory, no identity, no past or future, but existing in the all. [If we look closely at this, we realize that the goal of any entity in the universe is to merge with the One and to lose any sense of individuality or separateness. Ra’s answer reveals that they do indeed have some sense of time, some sense of a forward progression of events, even if it is nowhere near as strict as our own. Thus, even though they can move through time and see the different potentials, they are not currently exempt from a feeling of linearity in at least some form.] QUESTIONER: Does this mean that you would have awareness of all that is? RA: I am Ra. This is partially correct. It is our understanding that it would not be our awareness, but simply awareness of the Creator. In the Creator is all that there is. Therefore, this knowledge would be available. [And now that Ra has explained the seventh density and the one-pointedness of mind therein, Elkins seeks to elicit a similar understanding for what we ourselves are heading into; the fourth density. Ra’s answer should help us start to understand what we have to look forward to in the now very near future.] QUESTIONER: Thank you. Is it possible for you to give a short description of the conditions in the fourth density? RA: I am Ra. We ask you to consider as we speak that there are not words for positively describing fourth density. We can only explain what is not and approximate what is. Beyond fourth density our ability grows more limited until we become without words. That which fourth density is not: it is not of words, unless chosen. It is not of heavy chemical vehicles for body complex activities. It is not of disharmony within self. It is not of disharmony within peoples. It is not within limits of possibility to cause disharmony in any way. Approximations of positive statements: it is a plane of type of bipedal [humanoid] vehicle which is much denser and more full of life; it is a plane wherein one is aware of the thought of other-selves; it is a plane wherein one is aware of vibrations of other-selves; it is a plane of compassion and understanding of the sorrows of third density; it is a plane striving towards wisdom or light; it is a plane wherein individual differences are pronounced although auto matically harmonized by group consensus."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"[In the last line, Ra says that “individual differences are pronounced,” but that the group mind automatically harmonizes these differences. It is clear that the closer you are to approaching true Oneness, the less you have any individual sense of identity. That would explain why in the seventh density, there is no apparent self-consciousness, only the consciousness of the One. With the next question Elkins asks, we get some insight into the causative forces behind the Earth Changes as we head towards harvest or Ascension.] QUESTIONER: We are now in the fourth density. Will the effects of the fourth density increase in the next thirty years? Will we see more changes in our environment and our effect upon our environment? RA: I am Ra. The fourth density is a vibrational spectrum. Your time/space continuum has spiraled your planetary sphere and your, what we would call galaxy, what you call star, into this vibration. This will cause the planetary sphere itself to electro magnetically realign its vortices of reception of the in- streaming of cosmic forces expressing themselves as vibrational webs so that the Earth thus be fourth-density magnetized, as you may call it. This is going to occur with some inconvenience, as we have said before, due to the energies of the thought-forms of your peoples which disturb the orderly constructs of energy patterns within your Earth spirals of energy which increases entropy and unusable heat. This will cause your planetary sphere to have some ruptures in its outer garment while making itself appro priately magnetized for fourth density. This is the planetary adjustment. [So, what Ra is saying here is that the Earth will “electromagnetically realign its vortices of reception” with what is emanating from the Sun. This same realignment is indicated in the Cayce Readings and many other sources as a shifting of the poles. Elkins’ question specifically asked for events within the next thirty years, not at the end or afterwards. This would fit in well with the Cayce Readings indicating a date for polar shift of approximately 2001 or thereafter.] You will find a sharp increase in the number of people, as you call mind/body/ spirit complexes, whose vibrational potentials include the potential for fourth- vibrational distortions. Thus, there will seem to be, shall we say, a new breed. These are those incarnating for fourth-density work. There will also be a sharp increase in the short run of negatively oriented or polarized mind/body/spirit complexes and social complexes, due to the polarizing conditions of the sharp delineation between fourth-density characteristics and third-density self-service orientation. Those who remain in fourth density upon this plane will be of the so-called positive orientation. Many will come from elsewhere, for it would appear that with all the best efforts of the Confeder ation, which includes those from your peoples' inner planes, inner civilizations, and those from other dimensions, the harvest will still be much less than this planetary sphere is capable of comfortably supporting in service. [This last sentence exemplifies the problem that we, as Lightworkers, are still trying to solve in the present. The data about the “sharp increase... of negatively oriented [entities]” is very similar to Cayce’s description of the end"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"of Atlantis, with the battle between the Sons of the Law of One and the Sons of Belial. It is becoming more and more obvious that great tensions between people are developing, and this answer helps to explain why. One must then ask, if the harvest is so low, as Ra is indicating, what can we do? Is there anything we can do, and if so, how do we do it? Ra’s insights with regards to the form of the solution are quite interesting.] QUESTIONER: Is it possible by the use of some technique or other to help an entity to reach fourth-density level in these last days? RA: I am Ra. It is impossible to help another being directly. It is only possible to make catalyst available in whatever form, the most important being the radiation of realization of oneness with the Creator from the self, less important being information such as we share with you. [Again, Ra defines “catalyst” as the outside circumstances and energies that lead people towards the Light of Everlasting Love; sometimes with subtlety, other times with great intensity. Earth Changes are a form of intense planetary \"catalyst\" to get us out of our houses and to start living and cooperating with each other.] We, ourselves, do not feel an urgency for this information to be widely disseminated. It is enough that we have made it available to three, four, or five. This is extremely ample reward, for if one of these obtains fourth-density understanding due to this catalyst then we shall have fulfilled the Law of One in the distortion of service. We encourage a dispassionate attempt to share information without concern for numbers or quick growth among others. That you attempt to make this information available is, in your terms, your service. The attempt, if it reaches one, reaches all. We cannot offer shortcuts to enlightenment. Enlightenment is, of the moment, an opening to intelligent infinity. It can only be accomplished by the self, for the self. With these few lines, we will end this chapter detailing Ra's insights on our solar cycle. It is made very clear here that even with how low the numbers are for harvest, there are many entities who are just not ready for it yet, and though might seem depressing to us, it is what it is, and we simply need to respect it. Our focus should really be on those who are on the edge, who are very close to remembering and understanding the truth, so that we might then steer them in the right direction. Therefore, if even one person makes the harvest as a result of our own efforts, we have succeeded in what we are here to do. And that realization greatly takes off the pressure. So now, with all that we have uncovered with Ra in this book there is a complete framework to understand this cycle. The problem, as we have said, is that this type of information does not appear at the outset to be \"empirical\" or \"provable\" in the sense that most physical data could be. However, it appears that this material predates a number of physical discoveries that were made by at least seven or eight years. This therefore adds great weight to the case that can be made for its validity. In the next chapter, we will start"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"examining the physical evidence that suggests the reality of Ra's complex statements regarding this Solar Cycle."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 16: MAURICE COTTERELL AND THE GREAT SUNSPOT CYCLE In this chapter, we check in on the groundbreaking work of Maurice Cotterell. We discover that Cotterell detailed a series of new cycles in the Sun, related to the activity of the sunspots. These newly discovered cycles fit perfectly with the information in the Cayce Readings and the Ra Material, as well as information from the Mayan Calendar. Furthermore, this solar cycle was only recently discovered, while the psychic works existed well before Cotterell made his first graph. CHAPTER 16: MAURICE COTTERELL AND THE GREAT SUNSPOT CYCLE We have now seen Cayce and Ra proposing a very interesting model for a sudden, multi-dimensional evolution in the human species. This does then become a model wherein all that we have previously learned about the structure of the dimensions becomes far more personal, far more real, far more of an immediate future that we are staring in the eye right at this very moment. The true energy of Consciousness itself, expressed as a fluid-like sea of Pure Light, does not simply have one speed of resonance or vibration in its pulsations. We are told by a variety of sources of Higher Intelligence that the speed of Light itself is not at all a constant, but rather is capable of harmonic change. According to Ra, what we measure here on Earth as Light is \"distorted light\" that has a certain \"true color\" even though it appears to be white to us, and each density in the Octave of dimensions represents a different \"true color density\" of vibration. And with Bruce Cathie and Carl Munck's work on the Speed of Light, we can see that this certainly appears to be the case. The Speed of Light can be shown to be two things: - One, a precise harmonic of sound vibration frequency 144 in a time system based on 9, using minutes of arc as the indicator for distance, and - Two, directly related to the shared common tangents of the sound frequency numbers (which appear to have dynamic, structured, wavelike movement) and the square root of five, which forms the building blocks for the Platonic Solids and / or the fundamental phi ratio. Furthermore, when we include Hoagland's new information about the angle relationships of the circumscribed tetrahedron being precisely harmonic or non-harmonic whole numbers when rendered in a circle with 666 degrees, we can see that the sound, light and geometry are precisely and undeniably mathematically interconnected. This point cannot be argued when the proof is so easily seen, including the simple Platonic geometries that emerged visually in Dr. Jenny's experiments with vibrating liquids. Therefore, we can infer that the speed of light has similar properties to these other harmonics, all of which are quite naturally capable of changing -- expanding and contracting in their frequency. The speed of light is simply another measurement of frequency, directly correlated with the relative density or strength of the zero-point or aetheric energy field in any given area. So when we have a highly harmonic"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"stress point such as 19.47 degrees, at the intersection of the tip of a tetrahedron to the surrounding sphere, we shouldn't be surprised to see that its \"666 harmonic\" value is 36, one of the most fundamental building blocks of the \"Gematrian\" diatonic musical scale. This essentially proves that the \"diatonic\" or \"Gematrian\" numbers have an internal, structured, geometric movement, and are not at all simply static numerical values as we may have once thought. So again, when we properly understand the speed of light, everything changes. Light is simply the fastest possible movement through a sea of \"aether\" or what Ra calls intelligent energy, at a certain density. The apparent movement of Light itself can increase as the speed of movement or vibration in the aether increases. Furthermore, new research in the \"Grand Unification Theory\" by John Nordberg reveals that the properties of time will work much better when they are reassigned as the speed of light itself, instead of our current use of the Sun's apparent movement in the sky to measure time. (We will have a lot more to say about this in Convergence: The Physics of Ascension.) And if we remember from the chapter on Bruce Cathie, the relative movement of one second of our time on the clock is 1440 times faster than the movement of the Sun in the sky. So again, all of this leads us to believe that time as we know it, either measured by the speed of Light or even the second itself, are all functions of simple vibration in movement, in this case harmonics of the number 144. So, if time is truly a harmonic movement that can change in harmonic intervals, then as the speed of Light changes, so too does our perception of time change, just as we saw in the cases involving certain Grid anomalies. If we remember, Sanderson's \"vile vortices\" on the Earth's icosahedral grid caused natural and painless time distortions for passengers who flew through them at certain times, whereas the results of the Philadelphia Experiment created time distortions that led to physical harm for some of the participants. In both of these cases, it certainly does appear that time is capable of changing, and new information continues to arrive that validates this proposition more and more. On April 13, 2000 Dr. Steven Greer posted an article to his well-known CSETI website from W.B. Smith, a Canadian military officer, which gave the same information. In this new article, Smith discusses his work on Project Magnet, the only officially-acknowledged government project that investigated the Global Grid. It became classified when they started to actually determine the shape and anomalous properties of the Grid itself. Smith's main contribution to the UFO field was that he was the author of an inadvertently declassified document that stated that the UFO matter in the US was \"classified on a higher level than the hydrogen bomb.\" As for the article itself, it was transcribed from a speech given at short notice to the Vancouver Area UFO Club on March 14, 1961, entitled \"What we are doing in Ottawa.\" In the article, it appears that Smith was in touch with human telepathic \"contacts which [his group] believed to be sincere,\" although this must be inferred from the excerpt that Dr. Greer has posted, as many researchers immediately discredit anything \"channeled.\" Smith then goes on to say that: Our technique of handling the contacts was to ask a number of rather general- type questions of all the contacts and then we compared the answers. We"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"found that in a majority of cases we got back exactly the same answers from all the contacts... We just confined our activities... to the contacts whose results we had been able to check. Among other things, the article describes that the contacts Smith was in touch with were accurate enough that he was able to glean knowledge about how the UFOs were powered as well as how to engineer a device that could measure changes in the Global Grid frequency strength. But what interests us the most for this chapter is what he said about time and the speed of light, fairly early in the document. We have added italics and underlines for emphasis: There is a great deal that we have that we have not yet been able to decipher. I think the trouble is with us, not with the info. Much of the info, which we obtained from these people, cast some serous doubts on the validity of some of the basic concepts of our science. For one thing they told us that the velocity of light was not a constant. As a matter of fact they seemed to be rather pointed in their statements that light doesn’t travel, it is. [Note: This is almost exactly the same sentence written by Dr. Elkins at the beginning of The Ra Material: \"[The ETs tell us that] light does not move, light is.\" He equates this directly with the physics of Dewey Larson, which state that time is motion and light is the primary motion that creates time.] And we told them that from our point of view, [light] appeared to travel with a certain definite velocity of 186,000 miles per second. They said that’s the way it looks to you because you are looking at it from a region having certain conditions, certain influences, but they said if you were to go away from this region you would find that a different set of circumstances prevailed. Another thing they told us cast a great deal of doubt on our ideas of time. They told us that time wasn’t at all what we thought it was, namely what might be marked off with the ticking of a clock, that time was, in fact, a field function, the result of there being a universe. That is, something which was derived from the basic primordial concepts which brought this universe into being, and that it differed as you went from one part of the universe to the other. Also it could be altered, sometimes by natural means, sometimes by intelligently-controlled means in various parts of the universe. So that in any given interval, which incidentally is what our clocks mark off, our intervals, not chunks of time, in these intervals we can have all sorts of lengths of time. In other words if one of you checks your clock with me and finds that they are synchronized and I climb into a flying saucer and take a little trip out well clear of this earth and I watch my clock and, say, come back in three hours time, and we again compare clocks, maybe your clock says I’ve been gone an hour, my clock says I’ve been gone three hours. Both clocks are strictly correct. You’ve experienced an hour in the time that hand went around once; in that same interval I experienced three hours—and they were three real hours, not an illusion. The theory of relativity talks about this dilation. But this leads to a paradox and I think that anyone who is at all mathematically inclined and has taken the trouble to look at the relativistic"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"time paradox is probably disturbed by it. According to the theory of relativity, if I climb into a spacecraft and start out from the earth, here, at a velocity very nearly the velocity of light and I go out to, say, Alpha Proxima, and then I turn around and come back, people on the earth say I’ve been gone something like 10 years. According to my clock I’ve only been gone a year. Now that is a result, apparently, of the time dilation in the theory of relativity in that the spacecraft was moving, relative to the earth at a velocity very nearly equal to the velocity of light. The paradox arises when you consider that relative to the spacecraft, the earth was traveling away at exactly the same velocity, so therefore, to the people on the spacecraft who are relatively stationary, 10 years should have passed and by the time the earth came back to them it should only have been away a year. So you can see right away the very premise on which the theory of relativity is predicated, namely, that if B is relative to A, then A must be relative to B, leads you to an impossible paradox. This paradox is resolved completely if you recognize the variable nature of time. As you move around from one part of the universe to the other, you encounter all sorts of values of time in certain given intervals. Now I find that this idea of the concept of the variable nature of time to be almost incomprehensible to most people because... every time we do something we check with the clock. We become slaves to the clock to the extent that we believe that the intervals cut out by the clock are time itself. So we find it very difficult to readjust. The most important sentence in this entire excerpt, which forms the thesis of this entire book, is that \"as you move around from one part of the universe to another, you encounter all sorts of values of time in certain given intervals.\" We must assume that these intervals are harmonic, and that they refer to the concentration of aether density in the surrounding \"space,\" and thus also the dimensional level in that area. According to Ra, these changes are relative to our position in the galaxy, and we will see the mathematics behind this in later chapters. The most immediate bleed-off of this changing frequency in our own area would be the visible effects on the Sun and Earth, and in this chapter we will focus on the Sun. So what we are about to see is that as the sun moves through different densities of energy concentration, it has energy shifts that profoundly affect its entire structure, and these energetic shifts are also dimensional shifts. Therefore, when we find the true hyperdimensional cycle of the Sun, we find a schedule for exactly when these dimensional shifts are going to occur, as it is a measurement of our progression through the varying layers of concentration. So then the question becomes this: How do we know where we are in terms of this movement through the intelligent \"background\" energy in the Universe? Is there a way to measure this precisely, and if so what would it be? Could the same hyperdimensional harmonic forces that have literally carved the shape of the continents into what they are now also exert force on the planets from afar, without actually being inside the planets as the Grid is? If the \"Consciousness Units\" are not bound by size, then how do we determine where we are in terms of our movement through these energy stresses? The information that we have already looked into suggests that the inheritors of the Atlantean legacy were well aware of this system, and that something"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"extremely important is going to happen here on Earth in our near future. The designers of the Great Seal of the United States, as well as the United Nations Meditation Room, obviously possess this knowledge. And since this appears to be a direct endowment from Atlantis itself, then it should make sense that the Atlanteans would have done anything they could to preserve this knowledge in many different ways for us, as nothing could be more important. And so, we have seen from the material suggested by Ra and Cayce, the timeline for these energy shifts can be measured by the Earth's natural wobble known as precession, at least in part. And it is a well-known fact in metaphysical circles that MIT History of Science professor Giorgio de Santillana collaborated with Frankfurt University History of Science professor Hertha von Dechend to produce an epic, bullet-proof research work entitled Hamlet's Mill, which showed how these precessional numbers were preserved all throughout ancient cultures, ostensibly originating with Atlantis itself and the \"flood myth\" that was created after it dropped beneath the waves of the Atlantic Ocean, its namesake. Graham Hancock discussed this epic research in his book Fingerprints of the Gods, and one excerpt from Chapter 30 of Hancock's book serves the point well: For some inexplicable reason, and at some unknown date, it seems that certain archaic myths from all over the world were \"co-opted\" (no other word will really do) to serve as vehicles for a body of complex technical data concerning the precession of the equinoxes. The importance of this astonishing thesis, as one leading authority on ancient measurement has pointed out, is that it has fired the first salvo in what may prove to be 'a Copernican revolution in current conceptions of the development of human culture.' Hamlet's Mill was published in 1969, more than a quarter of a century ago, so the revolution has been a long time coming. During this period, however the book has been neither widely distributed among the general public nor widely understood by scholars of the remote past. This state of affairs has not come about because of any inherent problems or weaknesses in the work. Instead, in the words of Martin Bernal, professor of Government Studies at Cornell University, it has happened because 'few archaeologists, Egyptologists and ancient historians have the combination of time, effort and skill necessary to take on the very technical arguments of de Santillana.' Therefore, Hamlet's Mill proves conclusively that mythologies from all over the world have encoded very similar pieces of information regarding this Great Cycle in the earth. Among the most important aspects of this information is a near-universal remembrance of a deluge or catastrophic flood and inundation of some kind. But even more importantly, as was just stated above, de Santillana and von Dechend show that precise information about our 25,920- year precession of the equinoxes was also being stored in the myths themselves. In the last chapter we discussed precession as a wobble in the Earth's axis. We also said that the best way to visualize it would be as if the Earth itself had a giant axle extending through it north to south. If you wanted to duplicate precession, you would need to slowly \"grind\" the Earth around in a circle, traveling the opposite direction from how it was rotating. After completing one circle, you would have the equivalent of 25,920 Earth years. In Hamlet's Mill,"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"de Santillana and von Dechend show how this conceptual idea was revealed over and over again in ancient mythologies all over the world as the concept of a grinding mill, or a very similar metaphor. Before the modern niceties of threshing machines and the like, almost every culture on Earth would have needed to build mills to grind their grain for bread making. So, the metaphor was easily applied and familiar to the people it was given to. If this was the full extent of the \"precession connection\" in these ancient myths, it might still appear to be easily be shrugged off. But the key fact, explained so well in Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods, is that the fundamental harmonic numbers of the precession themselves are also encoded into the myths. Numerous examples of this are presented. Also, these myths also invariably have the concept of the mill itself breaking down and causing great catastrophe, similar to the pole shift at the end of each cycle. Those who are interested are invited to consult Hancock et al's work for more information. In the case of Hamlet's Mill, it is something far too intricate and involved for even the world's finest academic historians to tackle in most cases. All that we need to know now is that for some unknown reason, a very specific set of information regarding the precession of the equinoxes was carefully encoded in mythologies all over the world. We also know that both Cayce and Ra's readings made a direct connection between the precession and a heretofore-unknown \"solar cycle\" which precisely matches the precession in the length in years. Scientist and mathematician Maurice Cotterell did just that, discovering a long- term cycle in the solar flares, or sunspots, which fits in very neatly with the exact same number of years as the precession. This cycle was discovered through a careful, scientific study of information from the Sun obtained via satellite. As we shall see in just a moment, Cotterell discovered this information through strictly scientific means, not myth, metaphysics or psychic \"channeled\" material. Obviously, since he made the discovery in the mid -1980's, it could not have been known by Edgar Cayce or Carla Rueckert of The Ra Material beforehand. It is equally unlikely that the scholarly Cotterell is aware of either of these connections, as they are never mentioned in his books. In order to determine the statistics for a solar cycle of any conceivable length, you need to start with some very specific measurements of how the Sun's various forces interact with each other. Cotterell had access to satellite data that provided him with just that information. What he did was to compare the known speed of rotation at the Sun's equator against the known speed of rotation at the Sun's poles. Because the Sun is a gaseous, fluid body, it moves quicker at the equator, and slower at the poles. It is the same analogy as if you stir up a big pot of soup. Where you stir it in the middle, the soup moves very fast, but it moves much more slowly around the edges of the pot. When we expand this information out to the Sun, the satellite data confirms that it takes 26 Earth days for the Sun to make one full turn at the Equator, and 37 Earth days for the Sun to make one full turn at the poles. Obviously, there have to be points where these two spinning cycles would intersect and land at the same point. This would be the basis of determining any cycle through which these magnetic fields might be operating. Cotterell"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"determined that the two variables would intersect every 87.4545 days. So, he decided to take \"snapshots\" of the solar data only when these two cycles intersected. He called this unit of 87.4545 days a bit. The next step was to compare the angular positions of the Sun's two fields at each \"bit\" against the period of one Earth year, namely 365.2422 days. The Earth year would be our only solid time reference here on Earth to compare and accurately measure the interaction of these two variables. So, Cotterell took each \"bit\" of these three figures and crunched them together with a supercomputer that he had access to at his new job at Cranfield Institute of Technology, now Cranfield University. As the output churned out, Cotterell had the shock of his life. Here is the quote from Mayan Prophecies: The computer plugged away at its sums for several hours before eventually spewing forth its vital data in the form of a graph. What came out was sensational. In a long printout of jagged peaks and troughs, looking like some erratic heartbeat, a rhythmic cycle could clearly be seen. This graph of interaction had the fingerprints of whatever it is that drives sunspots - for what could clearly be traced was an 11.49-year cycle marking periods of intense activity. This, however, was not everything. There were clearly other cycles implied by the graphs, spanning much longer periods of time. And here, we will include a sample of the first of Cotterell's graphs in order to help visualize what he saw, and how it was eventually charted: Before going further ahead, we remind the reader that Cotterell's definition of sunspots, shared by many other scientists, involves seeing the magnetic lines of force on the Sun as though they were actual \"wires\" being subject to intertwining. Some of these \"wires\" would run North to South, and others East to West. So, as the Equator spins at a faster speed than the poles, so too will the vertical and horizontal lines of magnetic force continue to twist and tangle up into each other like a giant braid. When the tension gets too high, there is a sudden snap, releasing the pent-up energy. This spontaneous release is visible as a sunspot, which usually shows up in two nearby places at once. These two spots correspond to the two edges of the sudden arc that is created when the magnetic, twisted braid of energy \"snaps\" out of the Sun. So, about every eleven years, the intertwining magnetic fields on the Sun reach their maximum tension, producing the highest number of visible sunspots on the surface."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"So, in analyzing the traffic of these intersecting magnetic fields, Cotterell was able to produce a graph, based on 87.4545-day units or bits. The first thing he saw is that the period of 8 bits, nearly 700 days, seemed to be very significant, and he called this a microcycle. Then, by taking six microcycles or 48 bits, he arrived at a longer cycle of 11.49299 years - a figure that was extremely close to the 11.1-year average given by mainstream science for one \"regular\" sunspot cycle. As Cotterell looked closer, he could see that the entire graph would repeat itself after 781 bits of time. This was one of Cotterell's fundamental discoveries, adding up to a period of 68,302 days (or 187 years) that he called the sunspot cycle. This amounted to 97 microcycles. (We remember that each microcycle was 8 bits in duration.) Cotterell discovered to his own surprise that five of these 97 microcycles were actually longer, containing 9 bits instead of 8. This led him to realize that this entire cycle was also shifting, and therefore indicating something even greater. Cotterell attributes these slow-moving solar shifts to what is known as the Sun's warped neutral sheet. This is a known area near the Sun's equator where magnetic North and South are in a precise equilibrium of balance, essentially canceling each other out and producing a null zone. Cotterell already had access to the latest research on what this sheet was believed to look like. Based on the complex interaction of the Sun's different magnetic fields, we can see that it appears as a sort of giant, spherical fortune cookie placed over the top of the Sun, with the points facing straight down."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" In the book, Cotterell says that: It seemed that the neutral sheet shifts by one bit every 187 years and that a particular shift bit would therefore shunt along through the whole sequence of 97 microcycles in a period of 97x187 or 18,139 years. [So, in visualizing the \"shift\" in the neutral sheet, you could say that every 187 years you move your fortune cookie one bit to the right of its original starting position.] This great period of magnetic interaction between the sun and Earth seemed to be the most important of all. It was, however, divided up unequally into three periods of 19 sunspot cycles and two of 20, making 97 in all. It seemed that each time one of these periods came to an end, so the Sun's magnetic field reversed. At last Cotterell seemed to have hit on what he was later to see might have been some very ancient knowledge. So, this \"most important pattern\" of either 19 or 20 sunspot cycles appeared to control when the Sun’s own magnetic poles would shift. The crucial 20-cycle length of time involved is precisely 1,366,040 days, or 3,740 years. [As stated above, the pole shift actually alternates between 20 sunspot cycles at 3,740 years or 19 at 3,553 years. This actually produces a much better fit with the precession numbers, as we shall see in a moment.] We will demonstrate very soon that this same exact cycle of 1,366,040 days was known and watched by the Maya. It seemed that when the Sun's own poles destabilized and shifted, the Earth was subject to serious cataclysmic activity. The Maya wanted to be good and ready for it. This Sun-Earth connection is very mysterious and by no means “common” scientific knowledge. It suggests a larger force of energy that is operating on, or through, the entire solar system. The question becomes this: if these sunspot cycles end up having an effect on the Earth’s relative stability or lack"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"thereof, we must speculate that the Sun’s forces are somehow causing these inundations. And based on our new understandings of aether energy and its changing harmonic concentrations, sunspots, or a greater function involving them, seem to exert control over the Earth’s magnetic field, which then affects Earth’s position in space. The Sun's gravitational energy is also hyper- dimensional energy as well. Sunspots are usually considered to be nothing more than magnetic disturbances, but Cotterell ties in the energy particles emanating from the sun to astrology, believing that the changing solar particles themselves have an effect on humans. Indeed, Cotterell and Gilbert’s book Mayan Prophecies shows many amazing coincidences between the peaks and troughs of the sunspot cycle that Cotterell discovered and other seemingly unrelated phenomena. This includes the degree of Carbon 14 radiation seen in tree rings year by year, the average yearly temperatures of the European climate, the severity of northern European winters, the advance and retreat of alpine glaciers, and, amazingly, the rise and fall of civilizations. It seemed that as the levels of C14 radiation decreased, the sunspot activity increased proportionally, and during these periods, ...it seemed that high solar activity... correlated exactly with the growth of powerful, sophisticated civilizations. Low sunspot activity seemed to be linked with periodic ‘Dark Ages’, which are marked by a general decline in the level of cultural achievement that has coincided with the fall of important civilizations. Thus, from this we can see that Cotterell’s theories suggest that solar radiation somehow has an effect on human consciousness, and in fact the growth and development of human civilizations as a whole. In Cotterell’s model, it is a physical effect caused by three-dimensional particles of radiation that effect humans and weather in very similar and mysterious ways. Yet, it is still unclear exactly how these periods of radiation cause people to essentially become more intelligent and make great advances, while simultaneously affecting weather “advances” on the Earth. Already we can see the case forming for the Sun's energy being hyper-dimensional in nature, bringing in higher consciousness. This hyper-dimensional increase reaches its full breaking point at the moment of Ascension, when we fully enter into an area of higher aetheric density and a faster relative speed of light. Cotterell likewise explains personal astrology in this solar radiation-based model. This does appear to have profound implications for Sun-sign astrology, or the basic effect that being born in a certain sign, or a certain month in the year, has on the personality. Cotterell shows that the Sun has two basic magnetic fields, one of which essentially divides the sun lengthwise, like a pie, into four equal quadrants. If we think for a minute about what this actually reveals, it is showing us that there is an octahedron \"harmonic\" inside the sun, with one tip for each pole and four evenly spaced around the equator (See image.) According to data from interplanetary spacecraft IMP1 1963, the equatorial stress points from the octahedron that form this four-way magnetic field cause the Sun to have a “sprinkler effect,” showering us with differently charged particles each month. Thus, each month could basically be \"positive\" or \"negative,\" based on what we now know to be octahedral streams of energy. (Cotterell did not point out the geometry in this.)"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Cotterell goes on to show a perfect correlation between the positive ion streamings and extroversion, or outgoing personalities, and similarly, negative ions and introversion, or personalities more drawn into themselves. This correlation was demonstrated by the Mayo / Eysenck study. Jeff Mayo was an astrologer who collaborated with Dr. Hans Eysenck, the \"father of the IQ test,\" to demonstrate this elusive and interesting point. The participants took a personality assessment of introversion / extroversion tendencies, and this data was then compared against their \"natal sign.\" The study demonstrated an extraordinarily high correlation between these two variables, for a relatively huge subject pool of over 2000 participants. Cotterell also warns us about the effect that sunspots have on our electrical, gravitational and radio systems. In Mayan Prophecies, he discusses a huge solar flare spewing X-rays that was witnessed on March 5, 1989, lasting for 137 minutes. Scientists from the Geological Survey Group in Edinburgh believed it to be the largest event of its kind in the 20th century, overloading the sensors they used to observe it. Cotterell indicates that sunspots were seen at the site of the flare shortly afterwards, showing a clear link between the two solar events. [These two solar forces haven’t been directly associated with each other in the past, and this event supports Cotterell’s theory that the sunspots are related to magnetic and radiation disturbances. The \"flare\" would be the visible breaking of the tension in the magnetic lines of force, followed by the sunspot.] But what followed was even more interesting. Three days later, on March 8, the sun began emitting a very large stream of protons, or positively charged particles. Cotterell indicates that the Earth’s magnetic field deviated by eight degrees within a few hours of this, compared to a normal deviation of only 0.2 degrees per hour. This event directly led to sightings of aurora borealis in very uncommon areas much farther south than normal, massive power surges that destroyed power grids in Canada and caused widespread damage, and a total scattering of radio waves, knocking out satellite communications."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"And now, in the present moment, growing contingents of astrophysicists are predicting major failures in our communication systems, surrounding the year 2000, right during and after the time when this book will be published. The typical 11-year sunspot cycle reaches its peak in 2000, and based on current observations, we can expect some very serious solar effects as a result. We have already seen these effects occurring to larger degrees, including the 1998 shutdown of the Galaxy 4 satellite, which resulted in the widespread failures of pagers all across the United States. The energy should only become more and more intense as we go along. So, with our brief overview of something Cotterell explains in much greater detail, we are starting to see a previously undiscovered law of nature at work. First of all, we have clearly seen the octahedral geometry at work in the positive and negative ion streamings emerging from the Sun, thus once again showing us these forces at work in the Solar System on a large scale. The Sun not only affects our weather patterns and the Earth’s magnetic and polar stability, it also affects the progress that we make as societies. With these higher points of progress must also come greater creativity, intuition and insight, those very human traits necessary to bring about massive social change. These social changes could be lumped into the elusive category of “spiritual growth.” There would obviously be a correlation with major advances in society and major personal advances in individuals. Spiritual growth is the founder of insight, inspiration and motivation, the breath of the Divine moving upon the still waters of the human psyche. Humanity is passing into the fourth density. So we can now demonstrate that the output of energy from the Sun is directly linked with spiritual advances in humans. We can also see that this mysterious sunspot cycle is related to the Earth’s 25,920-year precessional wobble, and no one seems to have figured out why. What we are postulating here is that there is a very good reason why the sunspots and the precession coincide; both of them represent the larger, multidimensional cycle alluded to by Cayce and Ra. This cycle is very mysterious, and we will continue to see through the course of this book that its purpose is to set a schedule for the ultimate spiritual advancements - Dimensional Shifts, the stuff of pure alchemy; changing matter from one vibratory phase to another. This is the \"physics of Ascension.\" Obviously, if we believe any of the material regarding Atlantis and even more ancient civilizations, it would seem that intelligent human life has been through at least one of these \"shifts\" in the past. Interestingly, many authors including Graham Hancock, who wrote Fingerprints of the Gods, insist that the ancients knew of this grand cycle and did everything they could to preserve the information in order to warn us. Warn us, you ask? Definitely. The author’s own contacts, along with other mystical sources, indicate that this 25,920-year cycle is sort of like a breath; the Sun “inhales” for ~12,500 years, stops, then “exhales” ~12,500 years. Each separate breath of the cycle is seen to end with a “shift point.” Indeed, we should be well-reminded of other \"breathing\" phenomena in the multidimensional universe, namely the pulsations of the Consciousness Unit. When this shift point in the Sun's breath happens, the Sun’s magnetic energy fields shift simultaneously with the Earth’s, and huge, epic changes go along with it; changes that many naturally interpret as whole-scale disaster if they don't"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"understand what happens to us in the process. Indeed, the last three major recognized polar displacements were roughly 84,000, 50,000 and 12,500 years ago, as seen on pg. 139 in Chatelain's \"Ancestors,\" which we shall discuss in the next chapter. While the first number is not exact, we can see the close correlations. This is a necessary part of the functioning mechanism of this dimensional transition that Ra and Cayce were referring to. In the Ra Material, for example, it is stated that the Earth will most likely shift approximately 20 degrees to accommodate the new \"fourth-density\" energy streaming in from the Sun, but they also said that these Earth Changes were \"very, very trivial.\" Even though the Atlanteans did not make it through a similar shift, we cannot automatically assume that we have been given a death sentence. GREGG BRADEN AND THE SHIFT OF THE AGES If it is true that the Sun is leading us through an unprecedented degree of change, we should expect all sorts of anomalies occurring in the Sun, as well as in the Earth itself. Much of this sort of data can be found in the work of professional geologist and metaphysical researcher Gregg Braden, Awakening to Zero Point, also available from Laura Lee Publications. So, let us cite a few examples of these anomalies. The first thing that immediately struck this author upon seeing Braden's video was that he cited scientific evidence that the iron core of the Earth is not actually molten; it behaves more like a crystal. What is even more interesting is that this core assumes the precise shape of a dodecahedron! So far we have not been able to find an image on the Internet to go along with the information, as this obviously is not being publicized -- too many people would start asking too many questions. It does, however, help us to see that the internal core of the Earth can have a separate \"consciousness unit\" frequency than the external, and these forces have actually created the shape precisely instead of simply shadowing it with the alignment of the continents. The core of Braden's work addresses the fact that as we head closer and closer to the end of the cycle, fundamental measurements of the Earth that were once thought to be constants are now being seen to change very rapidly. The first \"constant\" is the relative field strength of the Earth's gravity, measured in \"gauss.\" We have set a theoretical scale of 0 through 10 gauss in order to measure the Earth's magnetic field strength, 0 being the weakest and 10 being the strongest. We can show through fossil and mineralic records that at certain times in the past, the Earth's gravity field was at 10 gauss. 2000 years ago, it was at 4 gauss. However, as of mid-1998 it was down to 0.4 gauss, continuing to sink at a truly incredible rate of speed. The second \"constant\" to explore is the frequency, or rate of vibration, in the Earth's magnetic field. This value is represented in hertz. For a long period of time, the Earth's \"heartbeat\" of magnetic vibration was thought to be set squarely at 7.8 hertz. This heartbeat was important enough to the proper functioning of our bodies that it was incorporated into space travel for astronauts. Small onboard machines were designed to emanate this same magnetic vibration, in order to keep the astronauts' bodies from experiencing trauma. We now know from Gregg Braden that the Earth's own heartbeat has suddenly risen up to as high as 11.2 hertz, and in some places on the planet is"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"has gone up to 14! At the time he produced the Awakening to Zero Point video in 1996, it was measuring at 8.6. Clearly, things are \"speeding up\" at an incredible rate. Furthermore, it is also a well-known fact that the Earth's magnetic field is making some changes just in its own polarity. Most people are well aware that the Magnetic North is offset significantly from the Rotational North. However, we never stop and realize how strange and in some ways unsettling this really is. Furthermore, we now know that this is changing faster than ever before. Indeed, within just the last few years, the Magnetic North has been moving so fast that airport runways have to be completely redrawn in order to provide safe landings for the pilots. As everyone knows, the main navigational instrument for air travel is a compass, which measures the location of Magnetic North. Now that it is changing, serious and costly adjustments are being made at airports all over the world. These facts alone suggest that the Earth is destabilizing in a rapid format. The gravitational field is losing strength very rapidly, meaning that gravity is not balanced. The increase in the pulsation rate from the \"constant\" of 7.8 hertz also shows us that the Earth's magnetic field is destabilizing or \"wavering.\" Not only that, but the effects of El Nino and La Nina show us that the Earth's interior is heating mysteriously, then showing up in the oceans. This was also predicted in The Ra Material back in 1981, through the following quote, which is also reproduced here in Chapter Two: This [planetary movement into fourth-density] is going to occur with some inconvenience, as we have said before, due to the energies of the thought- forms of your peoples which disturb the orderly constructs of energy patterns within your Earth spirals of energy which increases entropy and unusable heat. This will cause your planetary sphere to have some ruptures in its outer garment while making itself appro priately magnetized for fourth density. This is the planetary adjustment. So, according to sources like Ra and the work of Gregg Braden, the current position that we hold in space is no longer going to hold us; the Earth will have to make an adjustment in order to right itself. As we have previously indicated, Charles Hapgood called this process \"Earth Crustal Displacement,\" where the entire outside of the Earth's crust slips over the molten inner core all at once. As is written in Fingerprints of the Gods, none other than Albert Einstein bolstered Hapgood's theory. And Braden explains that at every time in the previous historical record when the magnetic field strength has decreased and the gravity pulsations have increased, a polar shift has been the result. Furthermore, as geologist William Hutton points out in ARE Press's book Coming Earth Changes: The Evidence, it was recently discerned that the inner, dodecahedron-shaped core of the Earth is rotating at a faster speed than the outside. This in itself suggests a more complex interplay of forces in the Earth than we had ascribed to it before. But what is more important is that this same study also revealed that this fast-moving inner dodecahedron has already significantly displaced itself from the angle of rotation for the outside of the Earth! In other words, the inner magnetic poles of the Earth have already shifted, and are now on a separate angle of tilt! Thus, the inner core of the Earth could very well be setting a precedent for the future position of"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"the outside as well. As we move towards this new position, Magnetic North continues to drift more and more quickly in that direction, before the big, groaning adjustment actually takes place. Both Hutton and Laura Lee Publications' own Michael Mandeville indicate that a good case can be made in the Cayce Readings for this inner Earth \"pole shift\" as having occurred in 1936. There are repeated references in the Readings to some major Earth Change event that would take place in 1936. The eerie calm in that year didn't seem to make sense, based on Cayce's remarkable accuracy in all other areas. According to Cayce's readings, once this inner shift happened it was inevitable that the outer crust would also have to move in tandem. Again, Ra says that this movement should be approximately 20 degrees. Wilcock's deep-trance reading from Jan. 1999 also indicates that the Earth will indeed have to make this transition, and that more devastating earthquakes will follow as it occurs: True to form, the spherical mass of gravity will become more regularized as a constant in the approaching months and years. In order to do this, it has to renew and revivify the connection to the instreaming fourth density positive solar energy. This comes about indirectly through the polarity of the inhabitants, and more directly through the inevitable realignment of the global grid itself. This aspect of change is not necessarily malleable, although with the harmony of the inhabitants, it can be met at a much slower speed, hence much less disastrous. [53-29] But again, we are not dealing only with a phenomenon in the Earth; we are talking about a Solar Cycle as well. The data from the Sun also suggests that an epic change is on the way. Braden also points out that the Ulysses probe made the startling discovery that the Sun's own magnetic North and South poles are no longer detectable as of 1995! In addition, there has been a continual and incredible increase in the amount of solar flares, X-rays and proton storms year by year. These increases are so profound that they have often ended up being completely off the scale of the measuring equipment that our scientists had built to observe them. The SOHO satellite has been our main connection to observing these phenomena, and in 1998 it went down at least twice, ostensibly due to the increasing irregularity of the Solar radiation. These issues surrounding SOHO and the solar storms are very eloquently covered on Kent Steadman's ORBIT site, www.orbit.com. CYCLE SHIFTS AND THE MAYAN CALENDAR Enter the Mayan Calendar, a mysterious measurement system that was discovered carved into a giant stone disc in Mesoamerica. The Mayan Calendar was quite inexplicable to those who found it, as it meticulously charted a 1,872,000-day cycle, and at first no one could figure out why. The cycle was broken up into varying units of length, each with a separate name. One Earth day was a kin. 20 days was a uinal. 18 uinals added together gives us 360 days, which was called a tun. Twenty tuns added together gives us 7,200 days, which was called a katun. Twenty katuns added together gives us 144,000 days, which was called a baktun. So, the final structure of the Mayan Calendar was then comprised of 13 baktuns of 20 katuns each, leading us to a total of 1,872,000 days, or almost precisely 5,125 years. Right away, the harmonic, Gematrian quality to these numbers should be very easily visible."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The \"conventional wisdom\" on the Mayan Calendar still has not come up with any satisfactory explanation for why these particular lengths of time are so important to the Maya, particularly the 5,125 years. However, Cotterell might have been the first to notice that five of these Mayan Calendar cycles add up to the same ~25,920 years as the precession itself. Do we then assume that the Mayans were aware of the precession? If so, why did they chart it out so meticulously, and why only one-fifth of the entire period of time? If the reader will remember, we had discussed earlier in this chapter that Maurice Cotterell had made a major discovery concerning the number of years necessary for the sun's magnetic poles to shift. He called this the \"sunspot shift cycle,\" and gave it a value of exactly 1,366,040 days in length. It was precisely calculated through the graphing and mapping of the intersection of the Sun's orbit at the Equator of 26 days against its orbit at the poles of 37 days. This discovery was made as a result of satellite technology, combined with the best supercomputer number crunching that was available to Cotterell at the time; a product of modern, late 20th century technology as we strive further towards \"outer space.\" As unbelievable as it must seem to the uninitiated, Cotterell later discovered the exact same measurement as the sunspot shift cycle in ancient Mayan writings; the enigmatic figure known as the “super number” in the Mayan work entitled the Dresden Codex. Amazingly, he showed that when this \"super number\" was held up against his own sunspot cycle, [after giving it one balancing adjustment that we will discuss,] the two measurements were mathematically identical! Now this should certainly raise a lot of attention! How can our current models of history possibly explain something like this? As we have said, it was clear that the Maya had a vested interest in keeping their eye on this cycle, as it would lead to inevitable cataclysmic activities on Earth. They obviously knew about the Sunspot Cycles that were at work, or else they wouldn't have these exact, scientific numbers. Therefore, Cotterell’s research is actually nothing more than a rediscovery of something that was already known; something that even our best equipment had yet to betray to the minds of the mainstream scientific community. Remember that it was Cotterell's own ingenuity that led him to discover this cycle, and it has yet to be \"officially\" recognized by astrophysicists. So, the time charted by the Mayan Calendar was obviously held as being even more important of a cycle than the Solar pole shift -- the Solar pole shift number was only found in a codex, whereas the Mayan Calendar figure was the end result of their entire calendrical system of measurement. The Mayan Calendar fits into the precessional cycle by exactly one fifth; in other words, if you multiply 5,125 years by 5, you get 25,625 years, which is very close to 25,920. Amazingly, and obviously meaningfully, Cotterell's \"sunspot shift cycle,\" which is also a Mayan number as we have just said, also fits precisely into the precessional cycle of years; this time, it is exactly one seventh of the entire cycle. This is an extremely significant discovery that no other researcher besides Wilcock has been calling attention to, as it is buried in the appendix of Cotterell and Gilbert's book. So again, five Mayan Calendar Cycles and seven Sunspot Shift Cycles both add up to an identical figure -- the precession of the equinoxes. And, it is this 25,920-year figure that both Cayce and Ra indicated as being of penultimate importance to us all."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"If you remember, Cotterell's Solar graph would repeat itself after 781 bits of time, which was 68,302 days in length. He called this 68,302-day period the sunspot cycle. He also determined that units of 19 or 20 of these sunspot cycles were directly correlated to solar pole shifts. The basic solar pole shift cycle was 1,366,040 days in length. Cotterell shows that the Maya also knew that units of 260 days could be added to a cycle in order to provide the \"shift differential operator\" [SDO] that would allow these cycles to expand into their larger counterparts. The number 260 was very sacred to the Maya, so sacred that they even gave it a name -- the tzolkin. We will see this number more in the next chapter, as it was one of two main cycles used to count the number of days on Earth, allowing them to chart out ten rotations of the Sun's equator at 26 days each. Cotterell's discovery of its importance helps us understand why the Maya were so interested in it -- it directly transforms or shifts lower- order cycles into higher-order cycles. So, the Maya took two SDO or tzolkin units of 260 days to shift the solar pole shift number into their own Codex number of 1,366,560 days. In again illustrating the connection between the solar pole shift cycle, the Mayan Calendar cycle and the precessional cycle, we will let Cotterell's own words speak for themselves. This is listed on Page 300 in Appendix 7 of Mayan Prophecies: By flagging the number of 1,366,560 the Maya introduce us to the shifting nature of the neutral warp and solar magnetic reversals. So by flagging the number 1,872,000 [the 5,125-year Mayan Calendar cycle,] the Maya draw attention to: i) The precession ii) That the moment of seven collisions (5 during 97 shifts, followed by two during the next 39 shifts) following cycle commencement, is in some way significant, in collision terms. [The collisions Cotterell refers to here are the times when the 1,366,040-day Sunspot Shift Cycles collide with each other. Cotterell then shows how these numbers add to a precessional cycle that is slightly shorter than the common 25,920-year figure, at 25,627 years. (260 days are added to the value of 1,872,000 x 5 as a natural part of the shift cycle.) We then move onto page 303, where Cotterell explains why the Maya might be flagging this number:] So perhaps the whole point of the 1,872,000 cycle is to convey the message of pole shift or the earth tilts on its axis. This is exactly what we are seeing in the material presented in Hamlet's Mill and other sources, including the Cayce Readings. The precessional cycle itself seems to be connected to periodic cataclysms on Earth. Thankfully, we have other evidence that points towards this being more than just a case of everyone dying and being wiped off the face of the planet; we have a clear link in prophetic materials to the concept of the passage into the fourth- density. Furthermore, with Cotterell's data, we now have achieved what we were looking for: a direct connection of all this information to measurable, scientific cycles of time in the Sun, as well as evidence linking the numbers to an ancient civilization."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Clearly, the Maya put a great deal of work into this cycle, and it appears from their own writings that they were at least partly trying to warn us that this cycle causes periodic, massive cataclysms. And the near-unanimous conclusion is that the end date of the Mayan Calendar is December 22, 2012. The Ra Material indicates that the Earth will have become completely fourth- dimensional by this point. The French have calculated that the Earth will pass into the Age of Aquarius at this point. However, Cayce talked of 1998 and 2001 for the solar cycle, not 2012. Indeed, untold multitudes of reliable intuitive predictions seem to center on the few years surrounding 2000, not 2012. This is covered quite well in A.T. Mann's book Millennium Prophecies and Charles Berlitz's Doomsday 1999 AD. It also is obviously a featured aspect of Bible prophecy, as indicated in works such as Hal Lindsey's The Late Great Planet Earth. Again, 2012 seems relatively close, time-wise, to these predictions, but yet that date was almost never mentioned in any of them. The notion of Ascension appears, based on other sources of prophecy, to be out of sync with 2012, and very much in sync with the early years of the New Millennium. So, we may certainly speculate on the possibility that we will not wait as long as we might have otherwise believed. What we do know is that the approximate time for the turning from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius was calculated in France as ~2011 AD. Since the ages of the zodiac represent the Grand 25,920-year Cycle of precession broken up into 12 units of 2160 years, it would make sense that as we go from Pisces into Aquarius, so too would the Mayan Calendar hone in on that same period of time for the transformation. The work of John Major Jenkins in Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 has expanded our knowledge about why the Mayan Calendar may have targeted Dec. 22, 2012 as the date. Indeed, this piece of information may be the entire key to understanding why our own local area of \"energy density\" will peak out in its increase at this time. Jenkins has clearly shown that in the slow movement of precession, the Earth comes into alignment with the center of the Milky Way Galaxy at this \"triangulation point\" in 2012. Many of the Mayan myths, including their dramatic ball-court games, appear to have targeted this moment as the time when Earth is fully aligned with the womb of the Cosmic Mother, our Galaxy. Obviously, this womb signifies rebirth, and that is exactly what we are going through, based on the explicit guidance given to us in the Cayce Readings, and even more so in the Ra Material. Ra makes it clear that all of these cycles have to do with our relative position in the Galaxy, and that our Earth is definitely being reborn. Based on aether theory this idea of changing energy density relative to the Galactic Center is not hard to see. In aether theory, gravity itself is nothing more than the streaming \"aether wind\" of the background energy that is going in to create a large body like the Earth moment by moment. In this model, as we walk the Earth we are like mosquitoes traveling along a screen window that air is blowing in through. It is the actual movement of intelligent energy, according to Ra and many other sources, that creates this effect. In Convergence: The Physics of Ascension we will have a great deal more to say about this. For now, the most important point for us to realize is that the center of our Galaxy would obviously be the greatest force for this"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"instreaming cosmic energy. So, it is logical to assume that as the Earth becomes most precisely aligned with this central source of instreaming energy, we would also be most explicitly affected by its higher concentrations. This gives us a firm model for visualizing a movement into an areas where the Speed of Light, Time and spiritual vibrations in general are at their highest point, hence causing changes for us in our own Solar System. In the next chapter, we will start to uncover the deeper aspects of this Solar Cycle's function -- aspects that involve the orbits of the planets. This information will show us how the harmonics of the vibrating \"fluid\" of intelligent energy or aether will create very precise movements in the planetary orbits. Since the planets are a fundamental and interconnected part of this harmonic fluid, and they are in vibrational movement, we will see that their exact orbits should also be a function of vibration. What we might not have expected is how incredibly precise this function turns out to be."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 17: THE AMAZING SYNCHRONICITY OF CHATELAIN MAYAN CALENDAR Now, we check in on Maurice Chatelain. This chapter focuses on Chatelain's work in attempting to fit the fundamental counting unit of the Mayan Calendar, the ~20 year katun, into the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn. Even though we can demonstrate that Chatelain was wrong, the mathematical connection between the cycles graphed by the Maya and the Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions is undeniable. This lends considerable support to the idea that the millennial period will be a major \"gateway\" time as we head closer and closer into becoming a fourth- dimensional planet. CHAPTER 17: THE AMAZING SYNCHRONICITY OF CHATELAIN’S MAYAN CALENDAR Perhaps the single most interesting thing that we come across as we get closer and closer to understanding this solar cycle is the triangulation on the period before and after the year 2000. There are endless numbers of apparently reliable prophecies pointing to this discrete period of time as a point of major change. The Cayce Readings, referencing what has to be the exact same solar cycle as indicated by Ra and the Mayan Calendar, called attention to 1998. The question we must then ask ourselves is this. If 2012 is supposed to be \"it,\" then why are so many prophecies focusing on a time that is significantly earlier than this? If we look at the Great Cycle strictly from the perspective of the sunspots, we might then assume that the interest in 2000 could stem from the fact that the smallest \"sunspot cycle\" is known to operate in 11-year increments. We know that this 11-year cycle has an effect, disrupting radio communications and increasing solar particle emissions. Current calculations place the next sunspot peak date as occurring in May of 2000. That fact alone suggests strongly that there is a connection, as most people are well aware of the May 5, 2000 planetary lineup that will occur. This was made public in the opening episodes of the TV show \"Millennium,\" as well as Richard Noone's 5 / 5 / 2000: Ice, The Ultimate Disaster. Furthermore, in a 1999 Email conversation between Wilcock and John Major Jenkins, the author of Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, Jenkins revealed the following: In Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, my position is that the Maya intended their 13.0.0.0.0 date (December 21, 2012) to mark the alignment of the December solstice sun with the Milky Way. This occurs every 13,000 years. The Egyptian Zep Tepi material refers to the time this last happened. At that time, the December solstice sun was lining up with the thin and diffuse part of the Milky Way that runs through Gemini. That is the direction out of the Galaxy. Now, around 2012, the December solstice sun is lining up with the opposite part of the Milky Way - the part that runs through Sagittarius - where the Galactic Center happens to be. Vedic astronomy summarized by Sri Yukteswar in The Holy Science, though phrased in a rather obscure way, suggests the Vedic Yuga doctrine recognized the solstice-galaxy alignment as *the* transformative event in the cycles of human consciousness unfolding..."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"I think the entire transformation zone will be a process-oriented thing. You're looking into the details and identifying likely trigger points. The May 2000 date you mention is also significant because of the Sun-Pleiades-Zenith alignment over Chichen Itza's latitude. This latitude is 19.5 degrees, which is significant via Earth Grid Theory and the Platonic solids. Geographically, Yucatan is the tail of the serpent; it is where the Sun-Pleiades vibration descends and incarnates. On the exact opposite side of the globe, at the same latitude, we find the Mouth of the Ganges - the mouth or birth canal of Ganga, the Vedic Milky Way goddess. I believe this accentuates a 13,000-year astronomical process, mapped onto the Earth. The tail-mouth polarity is found in the reconciliation of the Galactic and Zenith cosmologies as proposed in my book, a reconciliation which culminates (cosmologically speaking) with the Galactic alignment of the early 21st Century. At the time of this book's publication, we are only weeks from this date -- and based upon the way that everything \"feels,\" we do not expect that anything overtly major will happen. There may well be earthquakes, as in the prior conjunction of Aug. 11, 1999, where there was a Grand Cross planetary conjunction in the sky as well as a total solar eclipse at exactly 11:11 a.m. GMT, we experienced a severe earthquake in Turkey only six days later. This earthquake occurred in the exact path where the eclipse had traveled over the Earth, and hence over the Earth's Grid also. We had predicted that there may be Earth Changes caused by this, and we were right. The image below was taken in England at exactly 11:11 a.m. GMT, showing the Sun in full corona. The Great 11:11 Conjunction The fact that the Aug. 11 conjunction occurred at 11:11 a.m. did not seem to be an accident -- it was a number that many people had been seeing on the clocks for years and did not know why. Revelations 11:11 spoke directly of an energy shift, saying: \"After the 3 1/2 days... God appeared on a cloud and said, \"Come up here,\" and they were borne up into the heavens...\" According to researcher Joe Mason, the metaphor of the 3 1/2 has to do with humanity's leap from the third density into the fourth. Obviously, nothing happened on that day. It is certainly possible that each of these conjunctions do represent discrete increases in energy, as this author definitely noticed. However, if we are only going to wait for the \"final moment\" itself, we may be disappointed and not notice all the other important things that are happening to us. The period of May, 2000 is likely to be a similar case."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Elkins never asked the question of the 2000 date in the Ra Material, so we have to find out for ourselves why the Cayce Readings targeted it. We can see right away how neatly this ties in with the Biblical notions of the Second Coming of Christ ushering in 1000 years of peace. It now appears that the church fathers may well have adjusted Jesus' birth to coincide with a date that they expected to be one of great power - the harmonic year 5760 in the Hebrew calendar. 576, of course, is another Gematrian number. However, the main purpose of this chapter is to illustrate an even deeper aspect of the Solar Cycle that has never before been seen by anyone but the author of this book. We will cite the efforts of another Maurice C., this time not Maurice Cotterell but Maurice Chatelain, a former NASA scientist and astrophysicist from France. The synchronicity between these two names is another interesting \"hint\" of a connection in some higher sense. In his now rare, out of print book from 1971 entitled Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space, Chatelain makes an apparently airtight scientific and mathematical case for the Mayan calendar being dated incorrectly. Before we explain his case, we need to qualify all of this by stating that we now know that Chatelain was indeed wrong, in one sense. Chatelain reconfigured the Mayan Calendar based on new information that he himself discovered. Even though the reconfigured dates were wrong, the information itself is vitally important in understanding this cycle. What we learn as a result of Chatelain's work is that in order to understand this cycle, we need to watch Jupiter and Saturn, specifically when they go into conjunction with each other. It is for this reason that even greater interest is associated with May of 2000, as Jupiter and Saturn reach conjunction on May 28th, 2000. This will prove to be the \"missing link\" we were searching for, allowing us to \"bump up\" to an even higher level of energy. Remember that Ra refers to the \"outward expanding and inward coagulating\" energy that is responsible for our Solar Cycle. Ra's quote makes it clear that we have to go beyond simply studying the Sun - this \"pulsating energy\" would represent the harmonic forces that have organized the entire Solar System in the same way that they organized the Global Grid. Therefore, we do indeed need to consider the cycles of ALL the planets in order to see how this cycle functions. Since Jupiter and Saturn are the largest planets, we can also expect that they will exert the greatest force on this cycle. It is for this reason that we need to pay very close attention to them. CHATELAIN'S MAYAN CALENDAR In his book, which actually covers many different subjects, Chatelain discusses the bitter war between the French and the Germans considering the seeming ambiguity of the Mayan Calendar's start date. This occurred when the calendar was first discovered, as there were actually two copies found, and they did not, in fact, precisely agree with each other. It took a great deal of work to finally arrive at the proper starting date. Since so much effort was involved in resolving these conflicting areas of data, Chatelain believed that our now-universal adaptation of the “winning” date set was not necessarily grounded. Chatelain created his own start date to perfectly coincide with a massive astrological event that appeared to lend great credibility to his date system -- at the time he was unaware of the larger-scale solar cycles"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"involved. And so, regardless of how it is viewed, the Mayan Calendar is a multifaceted astrological tool, in fact quite ingenuous and very useful once understood. The Calendar is not simply one cycle; it is measured through smaller cycles, which must also be considered. The smallest of these is the katun, which is approximately 20 years in length, at 7,200 days. One Mayan Calendar cycle of approximately 5,200 years consists of 260 of these katuns. This number 260 proves to be the most sacred number in all of Mayan science and mysticism. We will explore the new information that suggests why it was so important as we progress. This number was so crucial and sacred to their understanding of the universe that they actually assigned it a name, calling it the tzolkin. In order to break the Calendar up into more manageable pieces, they also grouped the 20-year katuns together into groups of 20. Each of these groups of 20 katuns is about 400 years long, or 144,000 days, and the name they created for this was the baktun. (And of course, we are seeing the same Cathie harmonic for the Speed of Light emerge again, this time in a cycle that is measuring time.) Since there are a total of 260 katuns in one Calendar Cycle, we need 13 groups of 20 in order to have everything add up. So, for each Calendar Cycle, there are 13 baktuns altogether. As we just stated, the tzolkin number 260 is the ultimate sacred number to the Mayans; it is the root of their entire mathematical system and the number of days in their Sacred Year. Their calendar consisted always of two date cycles -- the conventional solar year of 365 days along with the 260-day Sacred Year at the same time. Every calendar date was a combination of these two variables, and obviously the points where they intersect will be constantly changing. All of this is very well covered in Chatelain and Gilbert's Mayan Prophecies. HARMONICS OF THE NUMBER 13 As we shall see, the deeper synchronicities surrounding the number 260 are quite impressive. As our first example, Cotterell indicates that the swirling gases at the Sun’s equator make one complete rotation every 26 Earth days. This is an important point, and right away we should be viewing this as having a possible harmonic counterpart in vibration. In order to see how this could be, we remind ourselves that the entire harmonic number series is built upon the \"vibrations\" of the smallest digits, as they multiply into larger and larger figures. This is a key point that will become more obvious as we study the planetary orbits. All numbers one through eight have specific meanings in the Octave, and nine, ten, eleven and twelve are also very fundamental for different reasons. 13 appears to be the last number that carries a unique vibration before the vibratory properties again duplicate themselves. We are reminded that many ancient cultures including the Sumerians would use base-12 as a counting system at various times, and in this system the vibrations of the number 13 would represent an octave - the first counting unit on the next \"level,\" just as 10 is the next \"level\" of the number 1 when using a base-10 system. The vibrations of the number 13 as an octave can be seen on a conventional piano if you were to play a \"chromatic\" scale, where you go from C to C playing both white and black keys. Each scale will have 12 notes before resolving to the Octave on the 13th. So again, we can see that 26 is a"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"harmonic number in its own right, only it appears that the Maya were much more aware of it than the Sumerians. According to Ra, they were in touch with different extraterrestrial groups, and this might well explain why -- each group received different pieces of the puzzle. So again, the Sun's equator rotates in 26 Earth days. Cotterell also demonstrates that ten of these rotations, or 260 days, are pivotal to all higher-level Solar cycles. Therefore, the Mayan Sacred Year of 260 days would be a precise way of keeping track of solar activity. The question we must immediately ask is this: Without Ra's suggestion of extraterrestrial intervention and / or Atlantean inheritance, how else would an apparently non-technical society know to count this? There are certainly no recorded bits of evidence to suggest that they had anything even remotely resembling the satellite technology that we needed to rediscover this. When we expand our tzolkin number of 260, (built up from the vibrational number 13,) to its higher harmonics, we have 260 katuns in the Calendar Cycle, at roughly 20 years each. We also have 260 days in the Sacred Year. The amazing discovery that Chatelain made is that the katun itself is not just a dead, lifeless fraction of the Great Cycle; it is a working cycle all in its own right. Chatelain indicates in his book that the scientists knew that the length of the katun had to be about 19.75 years, but no one has ever explained what it was actually measuring. They tried such things as dividing the length of the orbits of various planets in years, but nothing seemed to work. Miraculously, and perhaps absurdly, no one ever bothered to check the conjunctions between the planets. Though no one else had ever considered it, Chatelain realized that by adding a very slight 54 days extra to the standard harmonic katun length of 7,200 days, he suddenly, magically arrived at the precise length of time between each conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. This conjunction was the grease in the gears, the very essence of what made the clock tick. In an Email conversation with this author, Jenkins revealed further information about this harmonic connection with Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions: One Maya scholar, Robert Hall, suggests that [the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction was used] in the early development of the Long Count. 7200 days is 19 years plus 260 days exactly. That fact alone suggests further points of study for the harmonic cycles, but for our discussion is just the beginning. Chatelain showed that the katun not only worked for Jupiter and Saturn, but when taken as a unit, it plugged into the orbits of many other planets as well. This work has also been shown with stock trader extraordinaire Bradley Cowan, who uses these harmonic cycles for very accurate stock market predictions and clearly associates J-S conjunctions with movements such as the quarter-cycle of Uranus' orbit. For now, we will have Chatelain explain in more detail: For the Mayas the katun of 7,254 days was not only a measure of time but also an astronomical unit to express the synodic periods of revolution of planets, or the count of days needed for each planet to be realigned with the Sun and the Earth. For example, 5 katuns were equal to 313 revolutions of Mercury, 13 katuns were equal to 121 revolutions of Mars, or 27 katuns were equal to 7 returns of Halley’s comet."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"So, we can easily see that by simply using the katuns to count, it would be quite possible to plot out all major planetary motions in this manner through relatively simple math. Cowan's work shows us the same thing, and as time goes on we will see that this is a fundamental vibrational property of the planetary orbits. The typically recognized number system given for the structure of the Mayan Calendar is very simplified and round; 20, 260, 360, 7,200 and 144,000. Each of these refer to a number of days, namely the uinal, tzolkin, tun, katun and baktun. We cannot ignore how harmonic these time cycle numbers really are, and it gives us a lot to consider when we realize that the structure of time as we know it is built up from this. For example, 36 and 36 adds to 72, and 72 and 72 add to 144, the frequency of Light. Therefore, we can speculate that all of these differing time cycles are related to the harmonics of Light itself, and as Ra and other sources as well as physicists like Nordberg and Larson believe, time is measured by the speed of light. So, the time cycles that we see in the universe are all harmonics of this fundamental vibration. Again, Chatelain's theories have drawn attention to the almost 100-percent connection between the katun and the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction. We can then begin to understand the possible physical connection to the katuns' use as a counting system. If the orbits were just a slight bit different, they would be perfect- just like the once-perfect Earth orbit of 360 days and the once- perfect Mars orbit of 666 days. Chatelain goes on to show us that the main Calendar Cycle of ~5,200 years can be perfectly broken down into mathematically precise harmonic measurements for many different planetary conjunctions, especially Jupiter and Saturn, as we mentioned. Here is Chatelain to explain. ...Meanwhile, the Mayas had also discovered [the Main Calendar] cycle of 1,886,040 days that represented exactly 260 conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn, 2,310 of Mars and Jupiter, 2,418 of Earth and Mars, and 3,230 of Earth and Venus. This particular cycle was the key to the mystery of the Mayan calendar. It was based on the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn, something nobody had cared to consider... nobody had tested the conjunctions between the planets. [Until now, they still haven’t, other than Cotterell's notice of a cycle that tied in the Mayan Calendar with the length of the Venus year, discussed in his book.] The conjunction period of Jupiter and Saturn is in reality 7,253.445 days, but the rounded-out Mayan value of 7,254 days is valid because they did not use decimal parts and counted in whole days only. So the Great [Calendar] Cycle of the 260 Mayan conjunctions was 1,886,040 days, or 5,163.8 of our years. And thus, we have Chatelain’s explanation of how he arrived at what he considered to be the true length of the Mayan Calendar, 5,163.8 years, and how it was measured. The measurement occurred through planetary conjunctions, the very foundations of astrology and an unchanging product of celestial mechanics. We also can see from his writings here that a great number of differing planetary conjunctions all fit into the Calendar Cycle like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Notice, though, that this system of planetary calculations"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"fits for his number for the Mayan Calendar, at 1,886,040 days of length, and not the regular number of 1,872,000 days. Cotterell's work does give us many crucial parts of the puzzle, but it was Chatelain’s discovery that the Mayan Calendar was directly linked to astrological conjunctions that led to his discovery of the importance of Jupiter and Saturn. In order to fit the Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions that the Maya used as a counting system, Chatelain needed to modify the typically utilized dates. As we go on and look at the numbers, we must ask ourselves if it was possible that the Maya were indeed well aware of both the Chatelain version of the calendar as well as the conventional one. It certainly appears that the two cycles are permanently and inextricably woven into each other. The length of the katun is just far too close to the length of the J-S conjunction to be a coincidence. From the excerpts just cited previously, we now know that Chatelain is indicating to us that the length of his version of the Mayan Calendar Cycle is 1,886,040 days, and therefore a baktun, which is 1/13th of the whole cycle, would be 145,080 days. The standard harmonic figures take the baktun to be 144,000 days -- and we again remember that this is the harmonic of the Speed of Light as well as the number of people said to Ascend in the Bible. If we multiply the traditional baktun of 144,000 by 13, we get 1,872,000, the number of days for the common Mayan Calendar cycle. So between Chatelain’s length of 1,886,040 and the common length of 1,872,000, we can see that there is a discrepancy; the astrology-based Mayan Calendar from Chatelain is slightly longer in duration. Remember now that Cotterell had independently discovered a sunspot cycle that caused the sun’s magnetic fields to shift, before he ever saw any mathematical information tying this in with the Mayas. His numbers had come strictly from the interpretation of satellite data pertaining to the ebb and flow of sunspots. This principal sunspot cycle that Cotterell calculated is given in Mayan Prophecies as 1,366,040 days. The Maya put great work into monitoring these cycles, as they were directly connected with smaller-scale cataclysms and energy shifts on Earth. Remember that this is a smaller, more frequent cycle that affects when the Sun’s own poles shift, not the Great Cycle of ~25,920 years itself. As we previously stated, this solar pole shift cycle has to run itself through exactly seven times in order to add up into the Great Cycle. Again looking back to Cotterell, we see that his own sunspot shift cycle of 1,366,040 days was very closely related to 1,366,560 days, the Mayan \"Super Number\" in the Dresden Codex. They are exactly 520 days apart from each other, or 2 x 260, the tzolkin number and Sacred Year, built up from the harmonic vibrations of the number 13. This should leave absolutely no doubt that the Maya were aware of the solar cycles we are discussing. The additional 520 days act as Cotterell's \"shift differential operator,\" introducing an extra pattern into the equation that allows us to expand these cycles into even larger patterns in the Sun's activity. This tzolkin \"shift number\" obviously has a wide range of uses in the universe, as it is another basic vibratory property of the sea of living, intelligent energy that creates our existence moment by moment. Remember that Cotterell calculated his solar pole shift number without ever"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"having seen the Mayan information. When you really dig into Cotterell's information, you discover that the Mayan \"Super Number\" of 1,366,560 days was based on the usage of the cycles of Venus to calculate solar pole shift. We will not go into detail to explain these points, as it is extremely complicated, relegated to the appendices in the back of Mayan Prophecies. It is an interesting point, though, to see that Venus works so perfectly with the sunspot cycle we are discussing; everything fits together. So, we add 520 days, or two of Cotterell’s solar \"shift differentials,\" and suddenly fact meets fiction: a scientifically derived, totally modern Sunspot cycle harmonizes perfectly with an ancient Mayan number. Science is again baffled by a seemingly insoluble quagmire, where a bunch of \"savages\" clearly had access to some very significant data. But, since \"they\" cannot acknowledge something like this, it is simply brushed aside and ignored. We don't like what we don't understand. The link between Chatelain’s astrology-based number of 1,886,040 days for the Mayan Calendar and Cotterell’s 1,366,040 days for the sunspot shift cycle should be seen right away. The difference is, miraculously, a quite whole number, as both numbers end in 6,040; therefore, when subtracted from each other, the last four digits cancel out to 0,000. This eminent roundness clearly indicates that the matching nature of the numbers is no accident. Their difference is exactly, precisely 520 thousand days. This is undoubtedly one of the most fantastic correlations between the two cycles, as it shows yet another \"layer\" of the harmonic, Octave-shifting properties of the number 13! If we remember from earlier chapters, Bruce Cathie indicates that the Ancients would effortlessly add or subtract zeroes to numbers, knowing that the numbers remained harmonically identical underneath. This has to do with the innate properties of the base-ten system, which can certainly frustrate mathematicians who want all number bases to be equivalent. So therefore, 520,000 harmonically reduces to 520, which is the exact same number that we just saw above when Cotterell got the Solar \"pole shift\" to equal the Mayan \"super number.\" Again, he did this by simply adding two tzolkins or Sacred Years of 260 days. We have to admit that there is a fundamental similarity between Chatelain's modified figures for the Mayan Calendar, based on J-S conjunctions, and Cotterell's number for the solar pole shift. Unless we see the harmonics of 13 at work, it would be very difficult to understand how this could possibly be, as Chatelain’s book was out on the shelves in 1971, long before Cotterell calculated the sunspot shift cycle. In addition, Cotterell made these sunspot calculations with no apparent knowledge of Chatelain’s work whatsoever. Just to recap, the harmonics of 13, expanded into the \"tzolkin number\" of 260, appear to be of pivotal importance in understanding all of our mystically interrelated cycles, including the Great Cycle of ~25,920 years, in many more ways than one. The tzolkin is the anchor of the entire system, from the 26 day rotation of the Sun's equator to the \"Sacred Year\" of the Maya to the number of katuns in the Mayan Calendar. The tzolkin also links the sunspot shift cycle to the \"Super Number,\" allowing it to expand into the Great Solar Cycle. Now, we have just shown how it also demonstrates the harmonic link between the J-S conjunctions and the sunspot shift cycle itself."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"J-S CONJUNCTIONS AND EXTREME RADIO DISTURBANCE It is interesting to note that \"frontier scientist\" Richard Hoagland and his team wrote a recent article on hyperdimensional physics on his www.enterprisemission.com website that also demonstrates the hyperdimensional importance of the J-S conjunction in this integrated harmonic system. In this case, he shows that the power of the J-S conjunction surpasses the power emitted by the standard 11-year sunspot cycle. This was measured by studying the relative level of radio interference caused by the peaks of the sunspot cycle, and then comparing that against the level of interference caused by the J-S conjunctions. The J-S conjunctions caused a significantly higher amount of interference than the 11-year sunspot cycle in this case, and he has reprinted the original articles that prove it. Interestingly, Hoagland also mentions the 25,920-year cycle in the same article, only he has completely missed the real causes behind this cycle, which we are discussing here. In his article on the website, he speculates that the orbit of a large, distant planet might be the cause this cycle. We now know from our excerpts from Edgar Cayce, The Ra Material and other sources that this 25,920-year cycle is not caused by a planet at all; it is a Solar effect. We also know that it does more than simply affect weather, magnetic pole reversals and the ups and down of civilization - it also holographically controls the dimensional frequencies that are streaming in from the Galactic Center and resonating throughout the entire Solar System. We have shown that due to the properties of aether vibration, each planet is a multidimensional body, which assembles into a geometric, crystalline form. These crystalline forms are nothing more than the holographic projections of the One; essentially, conscious energy forms. They are all intertwined into a vast energetic web, and the Sun controls the resonating frequency of this web through the Great Cycle, or the “Breath of the Divine.” JESUS AND THE 40-YEAR TESTING PERIOD As we previously alluded, what we actually see is a “ratchet” form developing, where the available higher-dimensional energy noticeably increases at the peak of each Jupiter-Saturn conjunction. Therefore, even though the conventional Mayan Calendar date system used by Cotterell is clearly at work, we still need to watch Jupiter and Saturn in order to observe the \"ratchets\" of this cycle. It is interesting that Edgar Cayce listed “’58 to ‘98” as a crucial \"evaluation\" period leading up to the planetary changes. Both of these dates are exactly two years prior to when the J-S conjunctions occurred. Based on what we have just unfurled here, we must conclude that this is what the Cayce Readings were referring to. We are hard-pressed to find any other physical observations of the Cycle that could possibly match up any better than this. But why would the Cayce Readings anticipate each of these conjunctions two years in advance when referring to a \"testing period?\" We must conclude that just the approach of the J-S conjunction can cause massive changes, even before it actually hits. This applies in astrology as well, where the effects of a major conjunction get stronger and stronger as the conjunction gets tighter and tighter. It really is the exact same principle, albeit on a larger scale. The length of time between '58 and '98 is forty years, and again we see the Bible symbolism popping out all over the place. The Biblical flood involving Noah's Ark took place for \"forty days and forty nights.\" The Israelite exodus, led by"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Moses, spent forty years in the desert. Jesus' time of temptation by Satan in the desert was forty days and forty nights as well. All three of these cases would certainly be considered \"testing periods.\" Remember the overwhelming evidence that connects the story of Jesus to the modern accounts of extraterrestrial visitation. This includes immaculate conception, the giant light that hovered in the sky over Bethlehem, the appearance of \"angels of the Lord,\" and obviously Jesus' many fantastic abilities. We also have numerous top-secret government officials who have come forward to say that the extraterrestrial visitors informed them that Jesus was one of their own (Good, 1991.) Therefore, to a being that is outside of linear time, the era of Jesus could be the equivalent of one or two of our days in the past. So, when there are writings in the Bible that say, \"Two are walking in the fields, and then there is one...\" we have to remember that this is not ancient or mythological to them; it is a statement of the fact of exactly what is going to happen to us. Jesus obviously would be the highest example of a physical being with fourth- density abilities clearly visible before the actual shift itself. It is clear that he was \"preparing the way,\" showing us a future vision of ourselves. In the big picture, once we realize that we are dealing with cycles that are roughly 26,000 years in length, we can see that his arrival was essentially at the close of the most recent cycle. This would explain his quote in John 14, “As I do these things, so shall ye do them, and even greater things.” MALDEK AND THE 54-DAY DISCREPANCY Getting back to the point of this chapter, we must remember that no other researcher has ever tied in the Mayan Calendar to planetary conjunctions, except for Chatelain. If the J-S conjunctions are so obviously close to the Mayan katun, why the 54-day discrepancy? Wilcock's own readings finally explained it in a way that makes sense, providing that the Ra Material is accurate. We remember that Ra said that there was once a planet where the Asteroid Belt now resides, often called Maldek. Ra told us that this planet was caused to explode by a war that occurred between its inhabitants some 500,000 years ago. We also know that Thomas Van Flandern, a reputable astrophysicist, is now putting increasingly hard science behind the notion that this was indeed a planet in the recent past that exploded. All comets in the Solar System can be traced back to that point of origin, for example. Since comets are largely water ice, they are the vacuum-frozen chunks of what was once a fertile ocean. So, even though it might not be \"mainstream\" yet, at some future point the loss of Maldek to nuclear war will no longer be considered a matter of fiction, but of simple and tragic human history. The only thing that stops us from being able to accept the truth is the limitations of our own imaginations, and our desire to cling desperately to our \"beliefs,\" which can often be a series of prejudices. We simply cast out the information that we don't like, and everything is \"fine.\" Since we have only just begun to accept the idea of extraterrestrial life, the notion of \"planet-hopping\" certainly takes some time to get used to. But facts like the gigantic Face on Mars certainly gives us clues that lead in this direction. [As a very interesting side note, the morning after Wilcock wrote this, 1/23/"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"99, he had a very detailed and interesting dream that was apparently about Maldek. It was extremely rich and detailed, and borrowed off of the idea of the then-upcoming new Star Wars Episode One movie. In the middle of a sentence that Wilcock spoke to a waitress in a very bizarre \"restaurant,\" the perspective suddenly shifted to outer space, where he saw a gigantic flash of light. That was it! Then, he was in a movie theater, and everyone was disappointed with the ending. They all had a copy of Gilbert and Cotterell's book Mayan Prophecies. The \"movie\" just seemed to \"cut off\" with no prior warning. Wilcock told them not to worry, as there would indeed be a sequel to the movie. Ra says that 50 percent of people on Earth came originally from Maldek. Wilcock had been thinking that the exploded planet portrayed in the movie Star Wars was a sort of \"genetic memory\" coming through George Lucas, who might have been one of the 50 percent who went through the actual experience. It is very interesting to Wilcock how much the Maldekian \"restaurant\" resembled the general feeling of the \"cantina\" scene in Star Wars and Jabba the Hutt's hovering cruiser in Return of the Jedi. All the characters were human, but there were definite similarities. Theoretically, anyone should be able to access this information and dream accurately about it. Perhaps Lucas turned it into a film as a result of this ability.] So, since we can now prove that Maldek did indeed explode, we then need to stretch our imaginations just a bit more. Clearly, the force and impact of an entire large planet exploding must be quite something. Indeed, part of Van Flandern's research concerns the amazing blast impacts that are visible on the neighboring planetary and lunar bodies closest to the Asteroid Belt. Many of them appear to have sustained far more damage on one half than the other half, including Mars, which now appears to have been one of the exploded planet's moons. With the force of a planet-killing nuclear explosion and all the debris that would be created, we clearly would have quite an incredible problem on our hands. Indeed, something similar might happen to Earth were it to be sufficiently disturbed by a large-scale nuclear war. Therefore, when Maldek exploded, there were extremely damaging effects created in the entire harmonic structure of the Solar System, disrupting the natural harmonic smoothness of the planetary orbits. In the conventional Newtonian model, the planets are held in place solely by the Sun's gravity. So, if we have a series of free-floating bodies suddenly hit with the impact of this tremendous blast, it would be like playing a game of pool on a billiard table. We can easily see that the other planets would get knocked out of their positions. Since Jupiter and Saturn are both beyond the Asteroid Belt, the explosion would blow them further away from the Sun. All it would take would be for one or both of them to be close to Maldek in their orbit pattern, and the extra 54 days could easily be accounted for. So, what we have to realize here is that at one time, the Solar System functioned in a perfectly Divine and beautiful way, with elegant harmonic mathematics. Among many other things, these mathematics allowed the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn to be exactly 7,200 days in length, thus precisely matching the numbers inherent in the Sunspot Cycle. But, after Maldek's explosion, the planets were knocked out of place, creating a very acceptable 54 days of extra time between each conjunction. But, even though they were knocked slightly out of place, their effects as the driver of the Solar"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Cycle could not be disputed; they were the two biggest planets in the Solar System. It is interesting to think that if this explosion had never disrupted our system, we might well have come to a discovery about these harmonic systems much earlier. However, since it did happen, the extraterrestrial forces referred to by Ra needed to keep track of both systems of measurement. The \"conventional\" Mayan Calendar was used to keep perfect track of the idealized harmonic cycles of the Sun, which would not have been significantly affected by Maldek's explosion, due to the Sun's gigantic mass. These numbers would remain beautifully simple and elegant, representing the true Divine design of creation. Thus, even though Jupiter and Saturn got knocked out of alignment, they still ended up arriving in a position that perfectly harmonized with the cycle in the Sun by the \"shift number\" of 2x260, or 520. This shows us how adaptable the harmonic system really is -- even after such a catastrophic explosion, the new positions that the planets assumed still had harmonic, vibrational qualities. So, Jupiter and Saturn still have a definite effect, even though they no longer figure in precisely to the conventional Mayan Calendar. We can now see exactly how important the \"shift period\" of May of 2000 really is, as it is not only the last sunspot cycle peak before the Cycle itself ends, it is also the very last time that the masses of Jupiter and Saturn will conjoin before the cycle ends. We must conclude that it is for this reason that the forces in the Edgar Cayce readings triangulated on 1998-2001 when they spoke of the Solar Cycle and the corresponding pole shift. In the next chapter, we will investigate the further ramifications of this ancient astrological cycle technology, by uncovering an even vaster cycle that was equally well charted out by the Atlantean / Extraterrestrial contingent, handed down to the Maya and Egyptians. Maurice Chatelain also discovered this cycle as well, and he named it The Nineveh Constant. It is vital for us to explore just how precise and multifaceted the harmonics of the planetary cycles really can be, as we will ultimately conclude that every orbit in the entire Universe is functioning this way. The precision of calculation behind this cycle will show unequivocally that a very high-level influence of some kind was in touch with these ancient cultures, as this 6,000 year old harmonic number enables precise calculations of planets all the way out to Pluto."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 18: THE NINEVEH CONSTANT: CELESTIAL HARMONICS In this chapter we examine perhaps the most enigmatic finding in all of Chatelain's significant and practically unknown work. He learns that all of the orbits of the planets can be expressed by one single number, which is a singularly shared common denominator. This important and heretofore unknown number is nothing more than the product of 70 multiplied seven times by 60! We ask ourselves how it can be that this hyper-complex number was originally found on an ancient Sumerian clay tablet. CHAPTER 18: THE NINEVEH CONSTANT: CELESTIAL HARMONICS Chatelain’s research goes well beyond the Mayan Calendar, and his discovery of an even larger cycle that unifies the entire Solar System in simple harmonic vibrations may well be his finest accomplishment. As we will see in the next chapter, the stock traders working with Bradley Cowan's techniques are very excited about this new number, which has equally profound implications for the Solar Cycle. This quote is directly from the beginning of the first chapter of Ancestors. [Note: The most recent version of Chatelain's work is called Our Cosmic Ancestors, although the original version was named Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space.] FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS astrologers and mathematicians have been greatly impressed by the majestic regularity of the stars moving in the skies. For millenniums they tried hard to discover the secrets of this marvelous clock. These skywatchers realized that a very long period of time, one probably encompassing mil lions of years, had to exist that would represent in even numbers the revolutions of all the celestial objects. At the end of such a constant period, all the bodies of the firmament would again find themselves in their original positions on the band of the zodiac. These astrologers and mathematicians called this time span the “Great Constant” or the “Great Year.” [They] did not know that indeed this number existed and had been calculated tens of thousands of years before their time to be used by early civili zations but then lost and forgotten as cataclysmic natural disas ters and wars destroyed one civilization after another. The astrol ogers tried in vain to find the Great Constant and finally gave up. But now, by a chain of strange coincidences, this magical number has been found on an old clay tablet from Nineveh."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"As Chatelain just indicated, this huge cycle came off of Sumerian clay tablets, which were found in the burned-down remains of the Library of King Assurbanipal in Nineveh. This library was discovered in the ruins of the Assyrian civilization, located in modern-day Iraq in the nineteenth century through the work of Paul Emile Botta and Henry Layard. Botta himself discovered the Assyrian remains, including many marvelous pieces of architecture such as the castle of King Sargon II, which was a virtual treasure trove of statues and artifacts. Layard later excavated the site of Kuyunjik, in search of the capital of Assyria, known as Nineveh. And indeed, his intuition hit pay dirt, as among many other things he uncovered the Library of King Assurbanipal, an Assyrian king who was in power from 669 to 626 BC. Within this library were thousands of clay tablets etched with cuneiform writings. These writings were, as Chatelain says, “a collection of all the science and history known at that time, assembled from all previous civilizations.” Chatelain goes on to show how these discoveries led to the unearthing of the story of the epic saga of Gilgamesh, which has been confirmed by the scholars to be the original source document for the story of Noah and the Flood. Indeed, the modern Biblical account is shown to be a simplified version of the Saga of Gilgamesh, with a change in the names and a great deal of omissions. Zechariah Sitchin, a controversial Sumerologist and proponent of the Ancient Astronaut theory, discusses this as well. The staggering figures on these tablets were originally ignored as the ramblings of weak-minded Sumerians obsessed with numbers. Nevertheless, Chatelain saw that there could be a lot more to it -- his attention was drawn to the number 195,955,200,000, and he explains in his book how this is the expression of 70 multiplied seven times by 60. [For simplicity's sake, we will shorten this number to 19.5 x 1010.] He then goes on to indicate that as the Sumerians counted by 60, the number apparently came directly from their civilization, and modern Sumerologists agree that these tablets originated"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"there. Since the Sumerians invented the use of days, hours and seconds, using their base-60 counting system, Chatelain inferred that this number might have been a measurement of a certain discrete quantity of seconds. From here on out, Chatelain’s discoveries pertaining to this cycle are absolutely revolutionary. With this one number alone, you can calculate the exact time it takes any planet, comet or celestial object in the Solar System to make one full cycle around the Sun, down to the second. And that is not all. This mysterious number also encompasses an exact multiple of the precession. As we now know, it would also encompass the sunspot cycles as well, since they are a direct harmonic of the precession through the Great Solar Cycle. The precision of the Nineveh constant is summarized in one all-important quote from Chatelain. ...Every period of revolution or conjunction of all the solar system bodies calculated by the Constant of Nineveh corresponded exactly down to several decimal points with the values given in the modern tables of United States astronomers... I have not been able to find even a single period of revolution or conjunction of a solar system planet or satellite that would not be an exact fraction down to the fourth decimal point of the Great Constant of the Solar System. Yes, it sounds impossible, but we must remember that astrophysics was Chatelain’s job, and he had worked on calculating the orbits for such things as the Apollo missions; thus, he was not scared by these numbers, and could work with them rather easily. And furthermore we can prove here that this cycle was derived at least 6,000 years ago, and was probably quite archaic by that time. In other words, the Nineveh Constant is a fantastic calculator, as it is designed to fit the rotation of every planet into a certain round number of cycles; not in years as in the Mayan Calendar, but in seconds. So, with this number many significant discoveries emerge. To begin with, we must not fail to see the harmonics that are at work here. The numbers in the Octave have a fundamental geometry and vibration, as we have already seen. Their larger- order functions have definite internal waveforms, structures and movement. And now, what we are seeing is that the master cycle for the entire Solar System is built up from nothing more than 70 multiplied seven times by 60 -- in other words, the harmonic vibrations of the numbers six and seven, at the top of the Octave. What this shows us is that each planetary orbit could also be thought of as a harmonic wavelength of precise length. This had already become visible in the last chapter, when we saw that many harmonic cycles were emerging amongst the planetary and solar time patterns. Now, we can see that the entire Solar System is fundamentally interconnected through the same system. In other words, the same harmonic stresses in space-time that amassed the continents with the Global Grid have similar effects on astronomical and astrological cycles. And so, for an ancient or extraterrestrial culture that possessed knowledge of the true properties of vibration, we can demonstrate that the Nineveh Constant itself would be the only large number one would ever need to keep on hand. Calculating the precise length of any planetary orbit or cycle would"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"then be a simple question of dividing the Constant by one of a set of much smaller numbers that you could easily memorize. So, let’s say that you wanted to calculate the precession, or Great Cycle, in seconds. It just so happens that if you divide the Nineveh Constant by 240, that is exactly what you will get. And that number 240 is a precise harmonic of 24, the number of hours in a day. If you want Halley’s Comet, divide the number by 81,000, which is the harmonic of nine times nine. Chatelain shows us that the Nineveh Cycle existed on both sides of the Atlantic; the Mayans had it as well, only in a different harmonic base that preserved their love for the vibrations of the number 13. The Maya arrived at the Great Constant of the Solar System in two ways. They expressed it as a multiple of 26 Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions, [actually 180,392 of them,] as well as a multiple of their Mayan Calendar cycle of 260 Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions [actually 78,170 of them.] Again, we see the Maya's insistence on the use of 26 and 260 for counting. The other harmonic number that seems to pop out at us as possibly being a part of Divine Order is 25, expressed in the approximate number of Earth years in the precession as 25,000. This is the \"true harmonic\" count number for the Great Breath of the Sun that was given in the Ra / Law of One series. It also has extreme Pyramidological importance, as we will indicate in a second. Chatelain’s discoveries also encompass an even further extenuation of the harmonic importance of 25,000 in the Great Cycle of the Solar System. If we remove a mere seven days from the common value for Pluto’s orbit around the Sun of 90,727 days, which is perfectly possible given the inaccuracy of our measuring capabilities, we get 90,720 days. And again, this is a precise harmonic or \"Gematrian\" number. When we divide this round number into the Nineveh Constant of 19.5 x 1010 or 2,268 million days, we get exactly 25,000. Yes, it is true! The Great Solar Cycle gravitates towards an harmonic ideal of 25,000 Earth years in length, and the Nineveh Cycle is exactly 25,000 of Pluto’s years. The cycles appear identical, counted in the same harmonic number of 25, for two different planets. And of course, 25 is a direct \"vibration\" of the number 5. We will cover the topic of the Great Pyramid in greater detail in the twentieth chapter, but for right now we will discuss 25 based on the numerological code that was discovered inside its measurements. The number 25 in the Pyramid is indicated as the square of five. The numerology for the number 5 is \"initiation into the mysteries of the universe.\" By squaring the number, we then have a tremendous increase on the basic meaning of initiation. Lemesurier, author of Great Pyramid Decoded, refers to this number as an indication of the Messiah, or “The Great Initiate.” Indeed, 25 is the fundamental number of all Ascended people. The Cayce Readings explain that the Second Coming of Christ is the dawning of the Christ Light within all of humanity. Thus, we have a possible numerological clue that tells us that this Grand Solar System Cycle itself produces initiation, or what we are referring to as higher-dimensional advancement. Other interesting possibilities emerge as well when we consider that the harmonic numbers have actual spiritual meanings, etched into the Mind of God itself. The entire Solar System may be a very carefully-encoded message of extraordinary spiritual depth, if we allow ourselves to not restrict the powers of the Mind of God in this harmonic"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"system. The more we assemble these pieces together, the more the entire function of the Solar System, and thereby the entire cosmos, appears to be Divine Harmony. The very first multi-planetary system that we have discovered, orbiting pulsar B1257+12, has been discovered to be a precise duplicate of the inner workings of our own Solar System, both in terms of planetary size and planetary spacing. The following excerpt is from an article by John Gribbin in the London Guardian, at http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~hardy/gconsyn.html that says just this, with our own italics added: LONDON, from THE GUARDIAN -- The discovery of three planets orbiting a pulsar known as PSR B1257+21 has revealed a system with properties that almost exactly match those of the Inner Solar System, made up of Mercury, Venus and Earth. The similarities are so striking that it seems there may be a law of nature which ensures that planets always form in certain orbits and always have certain sizes; and it lends credence to the significance of a mathematical relationship that relates the orbits of the planets in our Solar System, which many astronomers have dismissed as mere numerology. The outer planets may well exist around B1257+12 in addition, but we do not yet have the instrumentation to detect them. It is therefore extremely likely that the B1257+12 system is equally harmonic and precise in its orbital function as our own, operating under the exact same laws of vibration as the Constant of Nineveh. So in short, the sacred numbers involved in this series of multi-dimensional cycles could well be universal. After all, this is the very first planetary system of its nature that we have discovered, among many other potential areas that we could have studied, and it just so happens to have near-identical properties to our own. Even the mainstream article above admitted that a previously unknown \"law of nature\" may be at work. And in the next chapter we will essentially prove this, by showing that this same precise system continues to operate when we expand our focus out to the Galaxy itself. PERFECT YEARS So as we have theoretically stated, before humanity caused such damage by destroying themselves on Maldek, Earth had a \"perfect\" year. This possibly “true” Earth year could explain why we would measure 360 degrees in a circle; it would be a harmonic of the 360 days in the Earth’s circle around the Sun, just as it appears that Mars may have used 666 degrees for their own circles, giving us the harmonic angle relationships in the Platonic Solids. Chatelain explains that there are many ancient cultures that count as though there were still only 360 days, and begrudgingly add five days in at the end to make everything fit. In order to look into this a little further, let us say that 9,450,000 is the approximate number of days for the current Precessional Year that we now have. [This would be a result of taking the Nineveh constant of 2,268 million days and dividing it by 240, just as the Atlanteans / Sumerians had done.] We then plug in the 'original' sacred length of the Earth year as 360 days instead of 365.2422. If our \"perfect Precession cycle\" for Earth would be exactly 25,000 years of exactly 360 days in length, how many days total would be in that “perfect cycle?” In order to get this number, we would simply multiply 360 by 25,000."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"From this calculation, we can quite clearly show that the number of “perfect days” in a “perfect cycle” would be exactly 9,000,000 days, an exact harmonic of the number 9, with no extra embellishment necessary. Nine is considered the penultimate number for the Maya, as it is the cornerstone that underlies all other natural harmonic numbers that emerge in the Mayan Calendar, such as 36, 72 and 144. In the Pyramid system, the harmonic number 9 is considered to be indicative of “perfect perfection,” or the number 3, which means “perfect”, multiplied by itself. Knowing that Pluto is the timekeeper for the Great Cycle of the Solar System, the holographic architecture of the system becomes much clearer. We remember that based on this Great Cycle of Nineveh, after 25,000 Pluto years all the planets would reassemble into an exact straight line. This moment appears to be the true measurement of one harmonic pulsation of our Solar System as a unified entity, much as we would normally consider one year on Earth with its twelve major lunar cycles or months to be a complete orbital unit of time. And so, we all know that matter is actually comprised of atomic energy that is 99.99999 percent empty space. That .00001 percent that is left is not solid, but rather arises from the aetheric \"zero-point energy\" of consciousness. Then when we understand harmonics, we see that the atom is also an expression of a color, sound and geometric vibration. This could explain why the theoretical limit of the Periodic Table of the Elements is 144, which is the light harmonic. So when we see the entire Solar System as a giant CU, we would find that the numbers are very harmonic and very simple. We also must remind ourselves of the existence of Bode's Law, which shows us that the spacing of the planets directly correspond to musical ratios. This has been further enhanced and redefined harmonically by the work of Ray Tomes and JB Stoneking, who draws off of the London Guardian article above in his writings. In addition, Tomes shows us that every system level of size in the universe is partitioned from each other by a precisely equal ratio. The harmonic vibrations of the number 34560 hold true as ratios that precisely separate the average size magnitudes of objects, as seen in Tomes' illustration as follows. This data and other points regarding harmonic structure will be covered much more in Convergence: The Physics of Ascension. Once we start seeing the interdependence of the quantum level of the atom, the macro level of the Solar System and beyond, such as in this chart, the system of harmonics does start to make more sense to us. We certainly do not need the physical structure of a planet to be in place in order for these energetic structures to organize themselves -- the natural resonances in the aether arrange this for us."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" So what we have, in essence, are some very precise cycles that were charted by some very old cultures, which appear to reveal a formerly understood \"master harmonic law\" in the Universe that subsequently faded into obscurity. These \"master cycles\" appear in very precise and harmonic intervals of time, working off of basic numbers such as 9, or the square of 3, and as we saw here, the numbers 5, 6, 7 and 8, the octave. All of this suggests simple, intelligent design with intelligent purpose in the Universe. Although we are not accustomed to thinking of Nature as being this precise, one quick examination of the complexity of the human DNA molecule should put such ideas to rest. In the next chapter we will prove that similar harmonics exist as we continue to expand the scope to include the spiraling of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Ra Material indicates that it is the spiraling action of the Galaxy that ultimately controls the frequency of energetic stresses in any given area. Thus, the Breath of the Sun as well as the Great Cycle of Nineveh are actually the shadows of the slow, continuous spiraling motions that we travel through as we change in position to the Galaxy. Yes, dear friends, welcome to the 21st Century. It’s not just a nine-planet birth chart anymore. What we are dealing with here is Galactic Astrology, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Universe."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 19: GEOMETRIC TIME AND THE WILCOCK CONSTANT: RA'S SCIENCE REVEALED In this chapter, we see the work of Bradley Cowan revealing hidden structures in time that can be harnessed, understood and mapped out to predict the behavior of the stock market. We then look into Wilcock's discoveries of a larger-order cycle in the Galaxy that is built up from the same principles as the Nineveh Constant. This lends dramatic assistance in understanding Ra's teachings, then made complete as we determine a scientific basis for the combination three Solar Cycles into one. CHAPTER 19: GEOMETRIC TIME AND THE WILCOCK CONSTANT: RA'S SCIENCE REVEALED With this chapter we will directly see the harmonic structures that are visible in time, and the direct geometry that goes along with them. Once we have done so, the theoretical foundations for the universal applicability of the Nineveh Constant will be easily seen, as our Galaxy is also operating under these harmonic geometries in time. So obviously, the very first question that comes to mind is this: even if we knew that we were looking for Platonic geometry, how could we chart out the passage of time in such a way as to have a solid measurement of its effects that might allow us to see such a structure? Almost all graphs that we see, regardless of what phenomena in time that they are measuring, are expressed in two dimensions -- an X axis and a Y axis. How would we be able to use such a graph to visualize a Z axis and thereby extend our perception of the effects of time out into three dimensions? The even more fundamental question is this: \"How do we know whether time is simply a static, \"linear\" phenomenon that produces no changes within nature in and of itself as it passes by, or an active, \"topological\" phenomenon that produces predictable, recurring patterns in neatly organized cycles?\" What possibly could we look for in trying to discover if time has a dynamic shape? In order to hope to see a shape of any kind, we would have to find something that changes, something that does not stay the same but has the potential to move in different, measurable directions. We have already shown the proof that Light itself has just such an active, topological structure -- and our one of our original arguments, seen in both the \"Unified Field\" theories of John Nordberg and Dewey Larson, is that all of Space is filled with a sea of Light that we do not normally observe. Our scientific evidence as well as excerpts from Ra and W.B. Smith's UFO lecture suggest that these Light harmonics have different density levels in different areas of the Universe. The Sun had been maintaining the octahedral level nicely for us, even though the Ulysses probe did not detect any polarized magnetic field in 1995. Furthermore, all of the sources we have just mentioned are telling us that Time itself is a function of Light. In the case of John Nordberg's physics, he explains that all of the universe is made up of balls of light, which we have called Consciousness Units. In Nordberg's model, (which will be covered in"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"much more detail in Convergence: The Physics of Ascension,) these balls of light can either remain stationary as \"standing waves\" (as in the case of ball lightning) or move at the speed of Light, becoming \"moving waves\" or photons that create visible light. Even though a \"standing wave\" does not appear to be moving through space, it certainly possesses dynamic internal motion -- and this will be a motion that corresponds to its own frequency of vibration. In the case of the third dimension or density, our light harmonic is 144, and the Hindu geometric cosmology tells us that Light forms the structure of an octahedron in our area. And so, the ultimate assertion that we will make is that motion is what creates \"standing waves\" of Light, which will naturally form spherical harmonics in models such as Nordberg's. The motion of a large body, such as a planet or star, will create harmonics as it drags along the aether in its motion, thus creating a \"standing wave\" in the System that it is contained within. Wherever the center of gravity is, such as the Sun in the Solar System or the Center in the Galaxy, the harmonics will arrange themselves around that point. In other words, any large mass must draw in the Light of Space around itself to sustain its existence, becoming an 'aether sink' to the surrounding area in the same manner as a low-pressure zone in our atmosphere causes high-pressure air to move into it, thus creating thunderstorms. When you have such a sink in motion, such as in the orbit of a planet or galaxy, it naturally disturbs its environment and creates vibration as it travels, just as the froth of water that follows a motorboat continues to ripple outwards after it has passed by a certain area. And in the case of the disruption of aetheric energy, we know from many researchers that these vibrations can be seen as light, sound and geometry. We have discussed previously the fact that Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions are the main 'driver' for the Mayan Calendar. What we have not mentioned is that these conjunctions always happen in the exact same three areas of space, relative to the Sun. These areas are equally spaced and thus form a great equilateral triangle:"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" Furthermore, each 19.86-year J-S conjunction is also very close to one-quarter the total length of Uranus' orbit. Again, in previous times this may have been more exact than it is at present, due to the explosion of Maldek. So if we divide Uranus' 84-year orbit into similarly harmonic quarter-cycles, we end up with a giant square that is formed in its orbit around the Sun, also a harmonic that is seen to overlap with the Mayan katun and / or the J-S conjunction: Other planetary cycles, once further explored, should yield other geometries as well, including pentagons and hexagons. And if we go back to the study of the crop circles, we remember that the work of Gerald Hawkins showed us that two-dimensional diagrams like these can in fact be hyper-extended to three dimensions. And already, we have seen that the three-dimensional octahedron appearing in the Sun is responsible for the positive and negative energy bombardments that we receive twice a month on the Earth. And when we look at the behavior of a system such as the Great Red Spot in Jupiter at 19.5 degrees latitude, we can assume that a similar harmonic outpouring of Light energy is occurring from the tetrahedral level, slowly moving like a giant lawn sprinkler in the Solar System as Jupiter rotates:"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" So, the rotations of the planets and grids themselves, combined with the planet or star's motion through space, create a variety of interconnecting harmonics. Some of these harmonics will move very slowly compared to the speed with which our Earth passes through the Light of Space, as we complete twenty cycles around the Sun to add up to one conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, for example. Therefore, it is certainly possible for us to pass into and out of areas of greater or lesser energetic concentration -- and this appears to be the basis of astrology. If these energies are more than just a simple \"hot- or-cold,\" \"high-or-low\" variable and instead represent discrete archetypes of consciousness, then as certain archetypes are flooding more powerfully into our minds, we can expect that more of those corresponding personality traits in ourselves will be visible. The entire Solar System would become a vast webwork of intertwining three-dimensional harmonics, just as an astrology chart will show you in two dimensions. Our simplified diagram of the spiraling tetrahedron does not reveal the full extent of these harmonic pulsations. We must look at the entire shape itself as being a harmonic stress point, not just the tips. Therefore, the exact structure of the \"standing wave\" in free space will act as an attracting force, causing the very lifeblood of Consciousness to be affected as all other forces pass through it. And if we are looking for these properties in time, our next challenge would be to find a way to actually measure such changes, in order to determine if there is such a force in effect. Since these effects are related to consciousness and thereby psychological in nature, we must find a simple way of charting out the behavior of human psychology on a mass scale. Furthermore, if we want to insure that these changes could not possibly be caused by anything but the passage of time, then all other factors involved with the changes should be as completely random as possible. In other words, whatever we are graphing should appear to be an almost completely unpredictable psychological phenomenon that is very easy to measure, ideally with only two \"hot or cold, high or low\" variables to consider. And then, if this behavior is truly a random event by all conventional understandings, any patterns taking effect should be a byproduct of our observable higher- dimensional geometric structures in time. Such \"patterns in chaos\" have indeed been observed in many different ways already, and they are"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"commonly referred to in modern \"Chaos theory\" as forming \"fractal\" geometries, like the Mandelbrot Set. Until now, with our aetheric models in place, we have never truly had a foundation with which to understand how these fractal formations could be seen in both space and time. Again, if we want to chart out human behavior to see if the passage of time has any observable effect, the first thing we have to do is to find a very, very simple index for measuring that behavior. Ideally we should investigate some form of human behavior that essentially has only two directions - up or down, positive or negative, high or low, joy or fear, prosperity or scarcity. This measurement of human behavior would need to be rigorously graphed day after day in an ongoing fashion in order to accurately analyze the long-term data for any trends or patterns. In order to be truly scientific, it would have to be something that was kept fastidiously, with no interruptions, for as long as possible. No one research group could realistically attempt to do such a broad-based study on their own, as they would be likely to introduce their own biases -- and furthermore, we simply don't have the profit motive to graph such behavior with steadfastness. Or do we? THAT'S RIGHT... THE STOCK MARKET! It just so happens that we do not need to look very far to find such an ongoing measurement index of human behavior. Ever since the late 1700's, at the dawning hour of a new nation known as the United States of America, an accurate record of the human extremes of joy and fear have been rigorously documented and rendered into the form of an ongoing graph. This record is known to us as the stock market of the United States, later referred to as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Yes indeed, the final answer to proving the geometric structure of time will come to us from the study of the stock market. As surprising as this may seem, it is indeed the most obvious and specific means by which we can graph out the extremes of human behavior through time. The measuring index of this behavior would be the price scale, which always occupies the Y axis of a stock market graph. And thus, the relative price value of the stock market is indeed a very direct and very effective measurement device for collective human behavior. When human beings feel joy, prosperity and"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"inspiration, they confidently buy, buy, buy into the stock market, rising the price index. And when human beings suddenly begin to feel fear, scarcity and panic, they quickly sell, sell, sell their stocks, hoping to bail out of the market before it gets any worse. Indeed, any simple study of a stock market graph will show us that it continues to move up and down, up and down as time moves forward. Rarely do we ever see a stock market graph \"flatline\" for any prolonged period of time, and even within the larger trends, smaller oscillations are usually seen as well. The structures of human behavior indeed take on a dynamic shape as the collective mood of humanity rises and lowers from hope to despair, over and over again. And these cycles of human behavior have been intensely studied by many, many different researchers, as there is a very real profit motive in understanding their functions. If it can indeed be proven that these up-and-down movements can be predicted in advance, then all the sport and intrigue of playing the stock market is eliminated. If you know exactly when the market has bottomed out and can go no lower, then you know exactly when to buy your stock. And if you know exactly when the market has topped out and can go no higher, then you know exactly when to sell your stock, and thus make as much of a profit as you were willing to allow yourself to make, based upon how much money you invested in the first place. A MASONIC SCHOLAR USES \"ATLANTEAN KNOWLEDGE\" TO REVEAL THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE OF THE MARKET We have already cited a great deal of evidence that suggests that the true knowledge of this octave-based system of hyperdimensional geometry that we are now discussing has been secretly known all along. The society of Freemasons is one current guise of this \"secret society\" that has preserved this knowledge, which found its way into cathedral windows, the Great Seal of the United States and the United Nations Meditation Room mural, among other things. On the outside, the Masonic Order appears to be nothing more than another boring fraternal \"lodge\" of aging men like the Shriners, Moose Lodge, Lions, Kiwanis or Elks Club, but to those who have spoken from the inside, there is a very complex and interwoven system of Atlantean understandings that has been handed down over time to them. So, with the idea that everything we have discussed and more may already be known by a handful of elites upon this planet, let us investigate the work of ace stock trader W.D. Gann. We know for a fact that Gann was a high-level initiate in the Masonic secret society, and he actively came forward into the public to teach how very similar principles as what we have been studying could be applied to the stock market. Gann's work did indeed allow him and many others to make accurate predictions of market trends in certain cases, though not on a constant basis. And now, a much more recent researcher by the name of Bradley Cowan appears to have discovered all of the unspoken and unrevealed knowledge within Gann's works - knowledge which Gann apparently did not want to release because of his secret Masonic oaths. This knowledge ties directly into our understandings of time as a multi-dimensional, geometric phenomenon, hence the title of the first of Cowan's works, Four-Dimensional Stock Market Structures and Cycles. But before we discuss Cowan, we must start with Gann. The essential core of"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Gann's discoveries is concerned with the idea that the combined price and time movement of the stock market will arrange itself into units of specific length and specific direction. These units of length and direction were referred to as \"radii vectors.\" The length and value of such a vector is calculated by observing the nearest substantial high and low points of a stock market graph, and then drawing a straight line between those two points that represents a combined, numerical value of price and time. (In other words, you want to combine the movement of price and time values into a whole, unified number instead of separating them and only analyzing one at a time. We will explain Gann's method of doing this below.) Based on this rather simple system, once you calculate the value of the radius vector, you automatically know that the next vector will be exactly the same length. Without a knowledge of the harmonic structures in time, it may seem impossible, but Gann gathered mountains of evidence to prove that that's \"just the way it works.\" Furthermore, and significantly, all possible movements of the stock's value will always be contained within a simple, harmonic oval or ellipse that can be drawn around each radius vector. In other words, once you have your radius vectors clearly mapped out on paper, simply representing the connecting lines between the highest and lowest cycles of price-time behavior, you would never see the stock market graph move outside of each ellipse. Gann showed that the length of this harmonic ellipse is identical to the length of the radius vector, and the ellipse's full width, at a perpendicular angle to the midpoint of the radius vector, will always be exactly half of this length. The next picture allows us to see this very clearly. Again, Gann revealed that the stock graph will never move outside of the perimeter of this ellipse, providing that you accurately know the true direction of the radius vector. This information regarding the ellipse is actually very important for our final theories of hyperdimensional physics, and thus we will soon see that we are not simply wasting space here by discussing this. The next basic point of Gann's theory that we must discuss is that each time that you reach the end of a radius vector, you know to watch for the direction that the next vector will begin to take. Once you know the direction of the next radius vector, you will already know exactly how far it will go in terms of length before terminating, since the length is a constant -- in other words, it is a fusion of price and time values that will always have approximately the same numerical value when combined together. You may have a great movement in time and very little movement in price, and the fusion of these values could be the same as an equal movement in time and in price or a great movement in price in a very short time. Obviously, the large price"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"movement in a short time would be the one to watch for. [Note: In order to protect Cowan, we are actually not going to reveal enough information for this idea to be reliably used with success for stock trading. As one of Cowan's clients reported, \"If you only pay attention to one cycle and do not consider all the others, then something else will come along and blow you out of the water.\" So, if you want to invest money using these ideas, we strongly suggest that you purchase Bradley Cowan's books. The ordering information is available from his website, www.cycle-trader.com.] We must also remember that the length of each radius vector is a function of both price and time moving together, and thus unless price and time are equally balanced out against each other, (which is rather easily done,) the lengths of the radii vectors may appear to be different when measured with a ruler. Therefore, Gann asked us to \"square our charts,\" or to produce a chart where there was a perfect one-to-one relationship between price and time. This is how we would create balance in the chart. We would first take the overall average of a stock's movement in price for whatever length of time the graph is working with, whether hourly, daily, weekly or yearly. Once you get the average movement of that particular stock's price for each hour, day or the like, you then re-draw the price scale of your graph to count out intervals of time in that average. And thus, if you have a daily market graph and you discover that a stock price moves an average of three points per day, you would then draw a new graph where each of these three-point days on the X-axis would be coupled with a three-point unit of movement in price on the Y-axis. Days one, two and three would square up with prices three, six and nine, for example. Once your charts are \"squared\" and redrawn, Gann revealed that it becomes very easy to see that the graph will move in \"radii vectors\" of specific lengths and specific directions. In a squared chart, the radii vectors will all be the same visible length, contained within the perimeter of the simple ellipse that is drawn around them. Each time that a radii vector reaches its end, a new vector is formed that will have a different direction. (In Cowan's books there are techniques that eliminate the need to redraw or square your charts, instead using the existing chart for reference- but in these cases the price and time ratios are usually not squared, thus making the similar lengths of the vectors harder to see.) For most readers, the idea that an apparently random phenomenon such as the movement of a stock's price value in time could occur in specific, ordered intervals and vectors seems far, far too simple to be true. However, Gann proved his case with extensive documentation beyond any shadow of a doubt. And thus, even though you can find Gann's books in the library, many traders are still selling copies of Gann's Master Course for Stocks, a huge compilation of Gann's writings and lectures over many years, for absurdly expensive prices. And people will buy them, just because of the promises of profit that are hidden within them, if they can keep and study the books long enough to understand how to do it. And here, we are really only describing the absolute basics of this enormously complicated body of information. COWAN'S STOCK MARKET GEOMETRY And now, enter Bradley Cowan, who may eventually be known on a very"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"widespread public level as the man who silently turned the entire field of stock market analysis on its end at a very young age, and also made a significant breakthrough in hyperdimensional harmonic physics. Little is known about Cowan, as he refuses to give interviews, lectures or public appearances, seeking rather to allow his books to speak for themselves. There are two basic sets of books that Cowan has produced, namely Four-Dimensional Stock Market Structures and Cycles and Market Science. This author has not purchased either of these sets of rather expensive books yet, as our knowledge of the specifics of Cowan's information comes from interviewing an increasing number of his clients on a professional basis. Each of these clients were shocked to see this material given a rational, causative explanation on our website, and thus immediately became interested in obtaining their own dream readings. For them, there is no doubt that this system works, as each of them continue to actively use these principles to play the stock market and determine where it will go next. Cowan does require that a non-disclosure agreement be signed in order to purchase the second series of books, Market Science, which deal with issues such as the soybean market, the musical fifth and the square of twelve, (yes, that's 144,) as defined on Cowan's website, www.cycle-trader.com. This author did not want to try to press any of his clients to tell him any information from the second set, as this would be both illegal and damaging to Cowan. The material within the first book does not require a non-disclosure agreement, however, and our publication of the validity of these concepts has already triggered waves of new interest in Cowan's books -- so the PR pays for itself. And indeed, more than half of our \"Cowanite\" clients have already made significant profits from these techniques when we spoke with them. Now how does this relate to three-dimensional Platonic structures, you ask? The bottom line is that Cowan simply observed the hidden geometric structures that were formed when Gann's radii vectors were compared against each other. Over time, Cowan realized that these radii vectors on \"squared\" stock market charts would assemble into the \"unwrapped\" faces of three- dimensional Platonic solids, one face at a time. We remind ourselves at this point that each side of a Platonic Solid is the same length, just like each radius vector is the same length. Three out of five of the Platonic solids are formed by equilateral triangles - the octahedron, tetrahedron and icosahedron. (The cube has square faces, and the faces of the dodecahedron are pentagonal, or five-sided.) All equilateral triangles have 60-degree angles at each corner. And thus, when Cowan started to see the endless redundancy of 60-degree angle relationships between radii vectors, he knew that he had stumbled over something quite grandiose - Stock Market Geometry. And indeed, once it was seen for what it was, it became very obvious that Gann had to have known about it, but simply kept it a secret. [When we look at the below diagram, we must remember that the ellipses that we are seeing are actually flattened out into two dimensions -- and thus this is not really an honest three-dimensional graphing of what this would look like. It will, however, show us how one tetrahedral face would appear on a perfectly \"squared\" two-dimensional graph.]"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"And so, once we throw Cowan's work into the mix, we indeed expose how our passage of time here in the third dimension is a truly multi-dimensional, geometric phenomenon. This should be fully expected, since we can see these same effects in space with the Global Grid, and space and time are unified in the sea of Conscious Aether. In his books, Cowan shows us how geometric forms such as the tetrahedron, octahedron and cube reveal themselves in an \"unwrapped\" form upon a two-dimensional stock market graph. In case this is hard to visualize, we must remind ourselves of what Cowan is fundamentally asking us to do. He is essentially telling us that the movement of a stock, in terms of its radii vectors, forms a hidden three-dimensional geometry. However, we do not have three-dimensional graphs to illustrate this. Therefore, a two-dimensional stock market graph will be a \"flattened out\" version of three-dimensional action. This could be visualized by actually taking a piece of paper with your squared-out stock market graph on it and then wrapping that paper around the model of a tetrahedron, let's say, whose sides are of equal length to each radius vector on the stock graph. To your amazement, after wrapping that graph around the tetrahedron, (and necessarily crumpling and folding the paper in certain places to correct for the two-dimensional distortions that the paper introduces,) you would indeed see how the graph itself would remarkably hug the outline of the tetrahedron. All twelve clients agree that Cowan has proven this in his first set of books over and over again, beyond any shadow of a doubt, using real examples from the stock market. Perhaps what is even more amazing than this is what the ellipses reveal to us. The ellipses actually trace"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"out the path of a spiral that forms the geometric shape as it moves along. Yes, that's right, a spiral -- the same exact formation that is observed in our images of Cymatics from Hans Jenny, where the Platonic Solids emerged within the vibrations of a fluid, connected by large interconnecting spirals. Now, we see the same harmonic, spiraling, geometric passage of energy occurring in the aetheric \"fluid\" of time, directly through the work of Bradley Cowan. The ellipses that surround each of Gann's 'radii vectors,' or each side of the Platonic Solid, would actually define those places where the spiral is \"buckling out\" of the geometric shape as it continues its rotating motion. We should already recognize the below picture, derived from the very well- known \"Triple Julia Set\" crop formation that appeared literally overnight at Windmill Hill in England in 1997, as we have already printed it before with a circle around it to illustrate its outer spherical field. Again, this diagram helps us visualize how such a spiral, based on the Julia Set fractal, would formulate a tetrahedron. All straight lines and triangles were not in the formation but rather drawn in afterwards, aligning with the shape that the collection of spiraling circles suggested. Furthermore, if we also inserted an inverted mirror-image of the crop formation over this same diagram, we would observe the formation of ellipses that are literally identical to those envisioned by Cowan and visually modeled in the Cymatics experiments of Dr. Jenny."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" And if we briefly look back to the spatial distortions of the Global Grid again, as seen in our study of \"Grid Circles,\" we can see circular, unfolding \"fractal\" spirals in the formation of island chains and continent borders. Furthermore, an overlay from the Stonehenge Julia Set formation in 1996 reveals almost the exact same fractal shape: Since the ETs delineated the simple spirals as actually fractal formations, we believe that this is showing us how there can be very large and very small levels of Platonic solids that smoothly interconnect with each other. This fits in perfectly from a quote of Ra: The term density is a, what you call, mathematical one. The closest analogy is that of music, whereby after seven notes on your western type of scale, if you will, the eighth note begins a new octave. Within your great octave of existence which we share with you, there are seven octaves or densities. Within each sub-density are seven sub-sub-densities. Within each sub-sub- density, seven sub-sub-sub-densities and so on infinitely. To see this effect occurring with fractals, the Mandelbrot Set certainly could be expanded into three dimensions just like Cowan has done with the stock market graphs, thus revealing the spherical structure of the different aether densities within itself. And one of the most fundamental qualities of any fractal is that it is composed of spiraling lines that will show the same formations over and over again as you zoom in on them. These spirals would naturally form the Platonic geometries within themselves as they unfold, as the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"previous crop circle diagram suggests. What we have learned from Cowan's clients is that lower-order cycles will show up in tetrahedra and octahedra, which in our system are the geometries of the fourth and third densities or dimensions, respectively. However, far longer-term cycles emerge as cubical formations in the market, which would be those of the fifth density. Once again, Cowan shows that the longer-term radii vectors of the graphs can be shown to trace a path over a rotating cube over the course of many years. It would make sense that the cube would take longer to show up than the lower-order shapes, as the cubical geometry of the fifth dimension is of a far higher vibration than the tetrahedron of the fourth. Furthermore, Cowan teaches us that the four-way or \"square\" division of the 84-year orbital period of the planet Uranus precisely defines the time units that form each side of this basic \"market cube\" as it unfolds! This is the first big clue that we have to indicate that the orbits of the planets themselves are tracing out these geometric forms in free space, forms which have very active effects on the structure of spacetime as we perceive it. And according to Cowan's clients, a stock trader does not want to tangle with this cube. Based on Cowan's advanced calculations that combine price and time as a whole, both the Crash of 1929 and 1987 could be predicted in advance, practically down to the day, by this cubical structure. And as of May 1999, the potential for the next major downward trend had begun, in terms of geometry, though it has not been as steep as the others thus far -- but even as this book is going to print in April of 2000, the market is experiencing jitters unprecedented since the Crash of 1987. The last bit of information regarding Bradley Cowan's works that we need to mention at this time is why he calls these stock market cycles \"four- dimensional.\" The reason for this is that in three dimensions, you cannot predict the future, merely study the past and observe the present. However, by accurately deducing the structure and movement of these higher-order geometries in advance, it is indeed possible to move outside of linear time and predict the future with great accuracy. Therefore, since the geometries indeed forecast events that have yet to occur, they can be considered as fourth or even fifth-dimensional in their structure. GALACTIC GEOMETRIES IN TIME: THE WILCOCK CONSTANT One of Wilcock's most significant original discoveries in \"harmonic aether physics\" occurred when he happened to come across an astrophysics professor's webpage. He originally discovered this page in his search for information on the interesting phenomenon of dark matter. The first significant point that David noticed was that the entire galaxy is spinning as a single unit, meaning that the outside portions travel at the same relative speed as the"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"inside portions, just like a single, connected disc. Obviously this is not the case in our own Solar System, as in order for Pluto to move at the same relative speed as Mercury, it would have to travel at a tremendous velocity. Therefore, our current astrophysicists have postulated that the only way that our Galaxy could spin in unison like this would be if a sphere-shaped field of matter named the \"Galactic Halo\" exists around it. However, since we cannot see this halo, they have called it \"dark matter\" and insist that it must be there. And now, based on our understandings of the harmonic aether, we can clearly see that this is unnecessary - it is a simple property of the spherical harmonics of aether vibration that is at work. As David inspected this page, he came across a number that he had never before been made aware of. In previous manuscript versions of this book, he had alluded to the fact that there must be a comparable Galactic cycle to what was seen in the Nineveh cycle. However, at the time he was unaware that there were any numbers for the length of the Galactic rotation that were precise enough to make any calculations. On the professor's website the number was clearly given: the galaxy rotates once approximately every 225,000,000 years. David was immediately excited when he saw the number. The first thing that he did was to see if this number could be turned into seconds and thus derived in a similar way to the Nineveh Constant, from the \"vibrations\" of seven and six. He calculated that there were a total of 31,556,926.08 seconds in a year by multiplying 86,400 per day times 365.2422 days. By multiplying this number into the 225 million-year orbit of the Galaxy, he could get a"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"ballpark for exactly how many seconds this would be. Then, he eventually realized that if he took 0.7, not 70, and multiplied it by 60 nine times in a row, he came up with a number that was very, very close - a \"harmonic\" Galaxy orbit of exactly 7,054,387,200,000,000 (or roughly 7 quintillion) seconds in length. Once he had this number, he then simply had to multiply it by 365.2422 to get the exact number of years that it would be -- and thus a true \"harmonic year\" of the Galaxy became 223,544,814.9201 million years in length. The fact that .7 multiplied by 60 nine times in a row could be 223.5 million, when the professor's figure was set at 225 million, was already quite stunning. David knew that when small numbers are multiplied into large numbers, each successive expansion in size would make it more and more difficult to naturally arrive at such a close correspondence by sheer chance. In other words, he was \"on to something big.\" David took a deep breath as he realized the next step. In order to see if everything worked out properly, he would have to take the exact length of the Nineveh Constant in years and divide it into the \"master harmonic number\" for the Galaxy. This was the moment of truth. If the resulting value turned out to be non-harmonic, then there would be nothing left of the theory -- the entire effort would have crumbled apart. David had clearly seen what the true \"harmonic\" value of the Galaxy's orbit was, and that it was based again solely on the vibrations of seven and six -- so there was reason to believe that it should amount to something. However, this didn't change the fact that David was nervous - if the calculator showed a meaningless number, then he knew that the theory was either seriously flawed or completely wrong. It was a moment that might never happen again in his life the same way. In order to get to the \"moment of truth,\" he had to calculate the Nineveh Constant in years, by taking its total value of 2,268 million days and dividing it by 365.2422. From this, the exact number of years in one Nineveh Constant turned out to be precisely 6,209,578.192224, or roughly six million years. Then, all that was left was to take this number and divide it by the \"harmonic\" length of the Galaxy's orbit, at 223,544,814.9201 years. By the time David got to this point and had set up the final calculation, he had already accepted that it probably wasn't going to be anything significant. He was ready for the letdown, ready to go back to the drawing board, ready to start all over again from scratch. He was almost disappointed in himself as he prepared to hit the ENTER key, waiting for the messy number to appear on the screen. After all, anything but a messy number would be a complete miracle. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and pressed ENTER. Click. He opened his eyes. In the window of the calculator shone two digits, and to David's eyes they were as bright as the Sun: 36."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"David's entire body went completely numb. Suddenly he burst out of the chair and found himself screaming at the top of his lungs with joy, jumping, shaking his arms and racing around the room- there could be no mistake. \"Oh my GOD, oh my GOD, oh my GOD, I can't believe it! Thank you GOD!\" The Master Harmonic Number, 36, had appeared right before his eyes as if by magic! It was the Crown Jewel, the Holy Grail, the ultimate proof that the Harmonic Universe Theory was real. David now knew that our planets come into a perfect straight line exactly 36 times in a row for every rotation of the galaxy. The majesty and harmony of the wheelwork of the Creation was exposed. The answer was more beautiful, more elegant than David could have ever possibly imagined. He almost couldn't believe that he was the first one on the planet to have discovered this. When he finally came to his senses, he had to check the soon-to-be-named Wilcock Constant against the value for the precession in the Nineveh Constant, which in this case turns out to be 25,873.2424676 years long, fairly close to the 25,920-year \"harmonic ideal\" value. To his amazement, the number was exactly 8640. In other words, everything worked exactly like a clock. There are 3600 seconds in an hour and 86,400 seconds in a day. Similarly, there are 36 Nineveh cycles and 8640 precessional cycles in a \"Galactic Year\". Everything worked out -- just like a clock. Now, when he went back to the Ra Material, he knew what they were talking about. First, the quote from Session 9: Thus, each of your planetary entities is on a different cyclical schedule as you might call it. The timing of these cycles is a measurement equal to a portion of intelligent energy. This intelligent energy offers a type of clock. The cycles move as precisely as a clock strikes your hour. Thus, the gateway from intelligent energy to intelligent infinity opens regardless of circumstance on the striking of the hour. Then, the quote from Session 13: The spiraling energy, which is the characteristic of what you call \"light,\" moves in a straight-line spiral thus giving spirals an inevitable vector upwards to a more comprehensive beingness with regards to intelligent infinity... The fourth density is, as we have said, as regularized in its approach as the striking of a clock upon the hour. The space/time of your solar system has enabled this planetary sphere to spiral into space/time of a different vibrational configuration... Then, the quote from Session 14: Imagine, if you will, the many force fields of the Earth in their geometrically precise web. Energies stream into the Earth planes, as you would call them, from magnetically determined points... the various geometrical centers of electromagnetic energy which surround and shape the planetary sphere. Then, the quote from Session 15:"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Love creating light, becoming love / light, streams into the planetary sphere according to the electromagnetic web of points or nexi of entrance. These streamings are then available to the individual who, like the planet, is a web of electromagnetic energy fields with points or nexi of entrance. Here, David knew that they were speaking of the chakras. Earlier in this same session, Ra had said the following: The thought-form distortions of your peoples have caused the energy streamings to enter the planetary magnetic atmosphere, if you would so term this web of energy patterns, in such a way that the proper streamings are not correctly imbued with balanced vibratory light / love from the, shall we say, cosmic level of this octave of existence. And then, the quote from Session 17: The fourth density is a vibrational spectrum. Your time / space continuum has spiraled your planetary sphere and your, what we would call galaxy, what you call star, into this vibration. This will cause the planetary sphere itself to electromagnetically realign its vortices of reception of the in-streaming of cosmic forces expressing themselves as vibrational webs so that the Earth thus be fourth-density magnetized, as you may call it... And then, the case was sealed with the quote from Session 63, started by a question from Dr. Elkins that seemed to pop \"out of the blue:\" QUESTIONER: Is there a clock-like face, shall I say, associated with the entire major galaxy so that as it revolves it carries all of these stars and planetary systems from density to density? Is this how it works? RA: I am Ra. You are perceptive. You may see a three-dimensional clock face or spiral of endlessness which is planned by the Logos for this purpose. At this point, the only remaining step was to find a reason for why Ra insisted that the key figure for our planetary evolution was three cycles of precession, not one. David returned to the figures from Cotterell, and saw that one full rotational cycle of the fortune cookie-shaped \"neutral sheet\" surrounding the Sun had been calculated at 18,139 years. This was obviously too big of a number to fit in together with 25,920 years, which would be one precessional wobble of the Earth. David knew that three precessional cycles added up to 77,760 years. Then, he realized that if Cotterell's number was increased from 18,139 years to 18,140, which is a perfectly possible and excusable adjustment, then four of these cycles would add up to 72,560 years. And 77,760 minus 72,560 was 5200 -- again, the same \"shift cycle\" seen on so many smaller levels with impressive redundancy, based on the harmonics of the number 13. We remember that this even included the difference between the number of J-S conjunctions in one Mayan Calendar as opposed to their harmonic katun counterparts. David then decided to see how many three-precessional cycles would occur in one full harmonic rotation of the Galaxy. He was hardly surprised to see that the number came out to 2880-- the exact harmonic of \"double light\" and the first ratio in the common Diatonic scale. In short, everything that Ra had said"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"about the essential structure, function and architecture of the Universe was true -- and therefore, the actual harvest itself was also a legitimate reality. And then, David thought back to the remarkable internal timeline structure of the Great Pyramid, which Ra had given to humanity as their greatest blessing -- a structure believed to be the perfect form for initiation and healing. And as he again studied the Timeline, he realized that the remarkable metaphysical qualities of harmonic time and the Shift of the Ages had been built-in all along"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 20: GREAT PYRAMID: PROPHECY IN STONE This chapter starts out with an examination of the harmonic periodicity of historical events, lending greater validity to the concept of time as a geometric, predictable structure. From this basis, we then explore the Great Pyramid Timeline. We learn how the Pyramid contains a timeline of future events, encoded through geometry and a symbolic code that assigns a different meaning to each number one through thirteen, and a few others as well. From here, we suggest that Cayce's interpretation of the King's Chamber is indeed correct, and that therefore we are now at the end of the Timeline. We then conclude with some spiritual reflections on the nature of this book. CHAPTER 20: GREAT PYRAMID: PROPHECY IN STONE On the night of March 7, 1999, just one day prior to the final completion and publishing of the original manuscript that would become this work, David suddenly received startling new information that changed the whole picture. It was his first big clue that the geometric / harmonic cycles were affecting time directly - but by that time it was too late to do anything except mention it in the conclusion. (He would only hear about Cowan in the months following the publication of the manuscript.) The timing of this information disclosure lent an even greater hand in showing the processes of Divinely guided synchronicity at work -- it had to get in before the manuscript was finished. The author was attending a birthday party in his honor, and David Steinberg, the host of the party, presented him with his unpublished English translation of a work by a French author named Francois Masson. The translation was still in typed manuscript form on yellowing paper, as no American book company had ever actually printed it. Masson had adopted a method of making prophecy forecasts that worked off of a few basic signposts. He only used those prophets that demonstrated repeated accuracy, such as Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce, and he never advanced a prediction unless he found a minimum of a three-way cross- validation for whatever event was forecasted. The book was written in circa 1974, and we can already see examples of his predictions that have accurately come to pass. Masson's true specialty is in cyclology, or the study of cycles. And indeed, the master number that all of his prophetic calculations are derived from is our precessional / solar cycle number of 25,920 years! Masson draws off of the work of another French author named Michel Helmer, who wrote Cahiers Astrologiques in 1960. Masson says the following about this work, which we have italicized in certain places: So events do repeat cyclically, but it is never the repeating of the same events but more like an ascending spiral; the similar events manifest in an entirely new context, but their deep roots are identical. In France, Michel Helmer was the first to reinstate and successfully apply this ancient theory, aided by his discovery of the number Phi=1.616 whose use enables him to locate the peak times within each cycle. (!)"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Surely, this adds great weight to our theories of harmonic time. As Masson's book makes abundantly clear, there are rigidly documentable connections between the precessional number, our own \"harmonic numbers\" that underlie all things, the phi ratio and all major events in human society. It appears as though these same harmonic numbers in years act as a sort of macro- astrology, having an unseen and yet very potent effect. History continues to repeat itself in these harmonic terms for no apparent reason. Masson then tells us about math professor M. E. Bindel at the Waldorfschule in Stuttgart, who published The Spiritual Elements of Numbers in 1958, and wrote the following monograph in 1969: In the Cahiers Astrologiques of 1960, M. Helmer presented his theory on the cyclic repetition of events, a cycle based mainly on using the Ideal Pre- eminent Number 25920 and its factors. Applying his theory enabled him to make many exact predictions both economic and political. In his account, he gave a special place to the Ideal Number, 25920 years. Here is an excerpt of his thesis: he begins by saying: \"Each of the three astrological phenomena that we know are signs in the sky of coordinates of three Space-Times: a) The Earth's rotation on its axis equals the Space-Time of the houses (in Worldly Astrology, themes of nations, regimes, political leaders), these themes being like the second hands of the cosmic clock. b) The Earth's revolution around the sun equals the Space-Time of the heavy planetary cycles. It is like the minute hand of the cosmic clock. c) Finally, the Precession of the Equinoxes, which has 25920 as its symbolic number. The numerological rhythms of this number give us the hour hand of the clock.\" We now know that the Precessional number is not by far the extent of the picture -- it expands out into three cycles, into the Constant of Nineveh and finally the Wilcock Constant, the entire harmonic movement of the Galaxy itself. In the following chart, we indicate the numbers for some of the cycles that Masson has already given us, and their corresponding effects on planetary societies. We will also briefly fill in what we know from our own work in the first four entries and the entry for 288: 1 25920-year cycle: Grand Solar / Precessional Cycle, marking out great ages of human civilization. 2 12960-year cycle: Major division of ages within each cycle. 3 5200-year cycle: Mayan Calendar. 4 3440-year cycle: Sunspot shift cycle. 5 2160-year cycle: Cycle of a civilization or a religion- one Zodiacal age or precessional passage from one constellation of the Zodiac to the next. 6 1080-year cycle: The cycle of empires and civilizations, opposing what was created in the 2160-year cycle. 7 720-year cycle: Cycle of spiritual changes. 8 539 (from Biblical cycle 7x77) or 540-year cycle: Mass movements of peoples. 9 360-year cycle: Cycle of changes of regime and internal ideology. 10"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"288-year cycle: Cycle of new creation in society, discovered by physicist Tony Smith. 11 180-year cycle: Cycle of political change of regimes. 12 22 and 11-year cycle: Cycle of sunspots, determines placement of events before and after their peaks in other cycles. And now, let's excerpt one section from the book that begins to explain Masson's accurate prediction regarding the collapse of the Soviet Union. Remember that this was written circa 1974: Now, there is no a priori relation between this 1:7 ratio and the cycle of 25920 years with its subcycle of 2160 years, presented at the beginning of this chapter -- except for the facts that the French Revolution of 1789 ended in December 1799, and applying the ratio tells us that the Soviet regime will end in late 1990 or early 1991 - and these three dates show up on the chart of the precessional cycle marking the start and finish of mass movements. This date of 1990/91 also comes out of Nostradamus' figure of 73 years 7 months for the Russian revolution - a duration very close to the 73 years 1 month 7 days that our ratio yields. (*Adoption of the year VIII Constitution 25 Dec. 1799, 10 years 5 months 11 days (after 14 July 1789) x 7 = 73 years 1 month 7 days. Since the precessional Golden Number 25920 contains in its permutations all the outstanding dates of human history, there must be a closer cyclic relationship, but the author has not yet found any. One point worth noting: the parallel is much more accurate for political facts than for military actions. Exactly why the amount of time for events to unfold increases by a factor of seven is not yet understood at this time; but there are interesting harmonic qualities to the number 7, including the fact that the Nineveh Constant is 70 multiplied seven times by 60. Another arcane point that may have possible meaning is seen with the icosahedron. First, assign a length of one to each side of the icosahedron. Then, if you draw a line from each of the twelve tips of the icosahedron back to the center point, that inside line will be .695 in length, compared to the length of each outside line – and that figure is very close to being seven tenths. Regardless of how this is being done, others with historical knowledge should easily be able to duplicate this research for the present. It appears that a comparison of modern times to Rome is particularly useful – and elsewhere Masson made a direct connection between Emperor Cato of Rome and the politics occurring at that time, and President Carter of the USA and the events occurring at that time. (Once we gain access to the book again we will post a precise reference on this point.) Since even the names of the two are very similar, it shows us how far this science could potentially go! We do remember reading from Maurice Cotterell that the sunspot cycles, including the larger permutations that he himself discovered and correlated with the Maya, show us many remarkable and concrete connections between the intensity of these energies and the rise and fall of civilizations. Obviously, with the work of Cowan we have now seen the true geometric effects of time"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"that we would be looking for. And with Masson's work, the theory is truly made complete. We can now see that these harmonic principles, embodied in the spiraling, octave format, truly guide the mass consciousness of humanity through its paces. The rise and fall of nations, ideologies and spiritual faiths all occur according to this mysterious, harmonic principle, which underlies all things. So our next question is this. The study of cyclology reveals that there is more to be known about the nature of events in time then simply whether people are going to buy or sell in the stock market. In a large-scale form of astrology, similar events emerge repeatedly in time, in an ever-expanding spiral. Many of the ancient cultures possessed a piece of the Atlantean secret inheritance and had written of these harmonic cycles in time, but unfortunately this information is so obscure that very little data has been found by this author, despite intensive research devoted to searching for it. As we learn more about these cycles, it probably will not be necessary to find it, as we will be able to re-derive it based on simply studying history and following the harmonic guidelines. So, what we are suggesting is that the Atlanteans were very well aware of how to use this system of harmonics to predict events in time with great precision. It is this basis that then explains the enigma of the Pyramid Timeline -- how a massive stone structure could have precise historical events built into it with such certainty. Clearly, no one could have come in at the \"last minute\" and changed these measurements, as they were integral to the construction of the edifice itself. In order to better understand this, we will take a closer look: THE PYRAMID TIMELINE We are reminded that the Mayan Calendar was carved in stone, and stands as one of humanity’s oldest sources of prophecy. What many people are not aware of is that there is yet another prophecy in stone, far more specific in details than the Mayan calendar. This would be the Great Pyramid of Gizeh in Egypt. It may come as a great surprise to many readers that a complete timeline for the evolution of humanity spanning the last 4000 years and extending 1000 more into the future, is written, in stone, directly into the internal passages of the Great Pyramid. This is not written in words, but rather through the use of a comprehensive numerological system. Understanding this system may at first seem difficult, as it is not a \"typical\" way of doing things, but the method is quite internally consistent and extremely mathematical and logical. The most important aspect of generating a mathematical code would be to make a symbolic ‘alphabet’ to work off of, which all other measurements could then use. In order to do this you would assign each number 1-12 a specific meaning. Certain other numbers related to various mathematical functions could also be used. In order that your code may not be lost, you would carefully preserve its memory within the culture, in this case the Egyptian priestly caste, and thereby introduce your number system into many myths worldwide. We can see that similar numerical encoding was done through the work of Santillana and Von Deschend in Hamlet’s Mill, which we already covered."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Then, through skillful combination of numerology, geometry and symbolism, it would be possible to turn these symbolic numbers into a language. You would actually read the passages in the Pyramid themselves as time, counting the years as you traveled forward. The keys to unlocking the meanings in the timeline would then become the height and width of the passages, the degree measurements of the various angles inside, the general direction the passageways travel in, and the basic quality of the stone that the passages are made with -- either granite or limestone. All of these measurements, except the direction and the material used, can be expressed in numerical fashion. A passage going up and / or to the right would represent progress, while a passage going down and / or to the left would represent decline. Hard granite would represent the spirit, soft limestone the physical body, and physical world. Years could be counted off in Primitive Egyptian Inches, carefully measured as we travel through the narrow passageways. The height of the passage suddenly rises, say at 3 AD, and you would make the new height just the right measurement in inches to convey the massive symbolic explosion of progress that had just occurred. There are additional ways to refine your mathematical code. Each horizontal layer of blocks that make up the entire structure of the pyramid could be counted from the ground up in courses, and their numbers worked in to the meaning. By using the courses in such a manner, the new height discussed in the previous paragraph could tie in to a symbolic angle measurement, and then the course number could be added to provide even greater detail. We must be reminded that mathematics is the only true universal language. If you use 360 degrees to measure a circle, a 33-degree angle will always read the same no matter what historical time period you are in. You could write all the predictions you wanted in obscure hieroglyphics, but without something to decipher them, they are useless. We could then say that the Pyramid code itself could be in danger of obsolescence, but mathematics is different than an alphabet of letters; the laws remain constant. The author of Great Pyramid Decoded, Peter Lemesurier, takes the time to carefully explain how this code naturally arises as you count forward, emerging from the basic symbolic meanings of each number. A more metaphysical explanation would say that the number meanings themselves are etched into the collective consciousness of humanity, and existed as universal truth long before we built our structure. Then, even if all records were lost, the answers would still come to the initiate in dreams and visions. Interestingly, Edgar Cayce spoke of this timeline while in a trance state, despite the fact that he was uneducated and obviously had no interest in the symbolic significance of the Pyramid, coming from a strict Fundamentalist Christian background. Here is his reading from June 30, 1932 that explains the point, with special emphasis added by the author. Then... there began the building of that now called Gizeh... the Hall of the Initiates... This, then, receives all the records from the beginnings of that given by the priest... to that period when there is to be the change in the earth’s position and the return of the Great Initiate to that and other lands for the folding up of those prophecies that are depicted there. All changes that came in the religious thought in the world are shown there, in the variations in"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"which the passage through same is reached, from the base to the top- or to the open tomb and the top. These are signified by both the layer and the color [and] in what direction the turn is made. This, then is the purpose, for the record and the meaning to be interpreted by those that have come and do come as the teachers of the various periods, in the experience of this present position, of the activity of the spheres of the earth... Even if we are loath to acknowledge that something like this could really be a fact, the timeline still exists, and many authors have shown that it has already targeted many events with amazing precision. Furthermore, Cayce’s reading again hints at the ‘present position of the Earth’ in terms of the ‘activity’ of its ‘spheres.’ The word ‘spheres’ is plural, not singular, meaning that there is more than one sphere. We can infer from this, when combining it with the other readings in question, that these spheres represent different energetic or dimensional levels surrounding the Earth’s physical sphere. Cayce also states that the Pyramid was built to triangulate upon ‘the time when the Earth shifts its position,’ which as we have already seen appears to be coming up very soon, as a product of the Sun’s activity. Again, Cayce has this date at 2001. Cayce also speaks of the Solar Cycles, correlating it with the rise and fall of various civilizations, including Atlantis. For starters, in case anyone tries to attack the starting date of the Pyramid Timeline as being open to interpretation, we can show that it is quite definite."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The start date was precisely fixed through a very rare conjunction where the Scored Lines, a set of vertical lines in the Descending Passage near the entrance, aligned with the Pleaides star cluster directly overhead. This was also timed to coincide with the star Alpha Draconis shining directly down into the bottom of the Descending Passage. This alignment has many similarities to the popular alignment discovered by Robert Bauval, where he demonstrates that the three pyramids of Gizeh are the same in relative size and orientation to the stars in the belt of the constellation Orion. Bauval goes on to show that the entire Egyptian plain was built as a physical map of the heavens. The proximity of the Nile River to the three pyramids is precisely the same as the proximity of the Milky Way to the stars in Orion’s belt. This is becoming almost \"common knowledge\" now in many metaphysical circles, being frequently covered in such areas as documentary programs seen on The Discovery Channel. Bauval derived his time code is by finding out when the physical pyramid layout of Gizeh was directly lined up with the heavens. Through the drifting action of the precession, which we have already mentioned, there is only one time per cycle that the celestial Orion could line up with the terrestrial Orion, and that was around 11,450 BC. Amazingly, Edgar Cayce’s readings said that the pyramid was built from 11,490 to 11,390 BC, so it is clear that Bauval's information triangulated perfectly with Cayce's. The dating for the Pyramid Timeline is equally intriguing, as it also uses a precise astronomical alignment modulated by the precession in order to encode its time. Bauval showed in his own work that all the ‘air shafts’ in the Pyramid line up precisely with certain stars in the sky, but only within a time period usually considered to be the mainstream Pyramid Age. This time period is also in sync with the Pleaides / Alpha Draconis lineup. Thus, once we have the start date, all we have to do is start counting in the basic measurement unit for years, which is the Primitive Inch. The point is, one can attack the prophecies of Edgar Cayce or Nostradamus all they want, but we will see that they can’t attack the Pyramid’s timeline once it is properly explained. The principal Pyramid book we will draw off of for this timeline is the impeccable Great Pyramid Decoded by Peter Lemesurier. In a sense, with unbelievable numbers of diagrams and exceedingly minute scientific detail for those who choose to read all the footnotes, his book has essentially become the Bible of the Pyramid Timeline. In order to get an idea of the effect that it has had on established critics, Lemesurier cites a quote on the back of the book from Anthony Smith, from the BBC Kaleidoscope. ...I find it a very, very remarkable book. At the end of reading it I felt that either I should throw it out of the window, or that I should throw every other book in my room out of the window and keep just it. This is an erudite statement of the massive effect that this book has on the reader’s mind. The author remembers well the tremendously epic feelings that he experienced as he walked down the street on a bright sunny day, knowing that the Timeline was real. It was pure ecstasy, as it proved that such visionary feats were possible."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Lemesurier’s book essentially proves that somehow, the builders could see a crystal-clear picture of the future, and with even the most conservative dates for the Pyramid’s age at 2,500 BC, this becomes an incredible proof that such future predictions can occur. A variety of predictions in the past have been made with the Great Pyramid Timeline, and these include the following. First we have the date, then the encoded prediction, followed by the events in society: BC 2623 (summer solstice): Entrance of passage system -- Construction (?) of Pyramid begins during reign of Pharaoh Khufu. 2141 (spring equinox): (Scored Lines aligned with Pleiades) -- (Datum-year for Pyramid's chronograph) 1453 (30th March): Inception of new upward path -- Jewish exodus from Egypt. 797-765: Formative period of favorable development -- 13th Israelite Jubilee? 592-559: Formative period of adversity -- Early Babylonian captivity of Jews and destruction of Solomon's Temple. Decline of Egypt. Era of darkness immediately preceding the sudden dawning of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and, in Europe, the Pythagoreans. 384-352: Favorable formative period -- Era of Plato and Aristotle. 2 (27th Sept.): Birth of central Messianic figure -- Birth of Jesus of Nazareth. AD 29 (14th Oct.): Preparation of Messianic figure completed (?) -- Baptism of Jesus of Nazareth (?) 33 (1st April): Achievement of full enlightenment by Messianic figure: inception of path of the enlightened -- Crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. 46 (March) - 58 (April): Mission of lesser Messianic figure -- Missionary journeys of Paul to the non-Jewish world. Birth era of Buddhist notion of salvation by faith in a boddhisatva (savior.) 58-82: Period of physical death and destruction -- Era of Nero, Vespasian, Titus. Jewish revolt and war. 70: Central event of period -- Sacking of Jerusalem by Titus. 152: Separation of discarnate path of the enlightened from the static path of physical rebirth -- Final break between Nazarenes, official Judaism, and Christians. 1223-28: Man begins to \"come of age\": return to the basics of the Messianic teachings: first steps towards establishment of hell on earth -- Death of Francis of Assisi: Franciscan and Dominican reform. Thomas Aquinas. Tentative establishment of modern scientific principles: Bishop Grosseteste, Friar Bacon."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"1440-1521: Crucial events leading directly to the age of hell on earth -- Invention of printing-press in Europe; fall of Constantinople; the Renaissance; the Reformation; re-discovery of America; circumnavigation of the globe. 1767-1848: Idealistic time of physical turbulence -- American War of Independence; French Revolution; Napoleonic Wars, further revolutions in France, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Italy. Marxism founded. 1845: Initial steps in the foundation of the Final Age -- Spread of effects of Industrial Revolution; railways; invention of telegraph; rapid development in all branches of science; in the arts, the Romantic era; dawn of Orientalism in Europe. After 1845, a peculiar thing happens before we reach the King's Chamber. There is an element known as the \"Great Step,\" and no one seems to know what to do with it. Lemesurier assigned a mathematical transformation to the length of the timeline at this point, and at first glance it appeared quite valid. In previous editions of this book we commented on some of the interesting synchronicities that this modified timeline seemed to predict. However, the key period of February 1999 came and went with no fanfare, certainly nothing of the sort that would need to be etched in stone for all future generations to see. We believe that the original reason for why Lemesurier did not want to accept the typically-used dating system is that it ended too quickly. He simply thought this was \"illogical\" and thus applied his Great Step transformation to buy us more time, thus reducing the length of the counting unit. However, in the process a bias was introduced into the data. On the other hand, if we actually go back to the Edgar Cayce readings, he gave '58 to '98 as a general testing period. This length of time is 40 years, or two J-S conjunctions. We remember the Biblical connections to the 40-year period of time. And when Cayce was asked directly about the time period signified by the King's Chamber, which is essentially the end of the entire Timeline, he said, \"'58 to '98.\" In other words, it appears that we are now in the final stage of this entire timeline, which has already predicted so many other events accurately in the past - most noticeably the Ascension of Jesus, when the Grand Gallery suddenly comes into play, dramatically raising the height of the roof in the aptly-named Ascending Passage. In the King's Chamber there is an empty tomb, and this is the symbol of no more death. We then also have two shafts that have been shown by Bauval and others to directly triangulate on stars in the Heavens. And thus, the ultimate message that the Pyramid Timeline seems to give us is of the Harvest. The starting date was set, the ending date is now and the only place that we have left to go is through the star-shafts. Death is transcended, life is renewed and the capstone is returned to the top of the Pyramid. The formerly incomplete spiritual nature of humanity, symbolized by the six-sided pyramid without a capstone, is replaced by the five-sided pyramid in its new perfected form, representing the final renewal of humanity in a \"New Order of Ages.\" (Novus Ordo Seclorum.) However, something that most researchers never consider is that the star- shafts also could symbolize those who would travel from the stars to the"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Earth, to assist us through this time where normal death is transcended -- just as Jesus underwent in his own Pyramidal initiation and subsequent self- transformation. Clear evidence has shown that the image on the Shroud of Turin appears to have been burned in by an incredible source of Light. With a dimensional shift of this magnitude coming our way, it is foolish for us to assume that something like this might not happen. However, David's readings have informed us that for most people, there will be a \"pick-up\" at the moment that the critical threshold is released, and only after this Exodus within a super-high-tech form of Noah's Ark is complete will the Pole Shift happen. In short, we have nothing to worry about, and should not underestimate the power of the higher forces when they are around us so consistently at this time in history. And even if you don't believe that it is going to happen this way, if \"they\" do show up at your door, don't hesitate! Don't ask to bring anything with you, don't worry about anything. This is your moment. This is your day. Enjoy your graduation, and walk down the aisle of the wedding of flesh to Spirit without fear or reservation. You will be returning to an Earth that is the home we have all wished for. THE EGO AND THE QUEST FOR ACCEPTANCE And so, we have arrived at our point of conclusion. Ra claims to have given this Pyramid to humanity, and we can see that the harvest was built-in to the design. Rather than struggling with the incredibly complex specifics about the timeline, (since it takes an entire book to properly explain,) shutting down because the weight of evidence is too intense or just denying the entire batch of evidence in this book with a satisfying, arrogant laugh, let’s look at the big picture. If we really expect to get anywhere, we need to act like we’re watching a movie, and stop the small I, or the Ego, from raging inside of us. The Ego demands that everything must stay the same – we work five days a week, hang out on weekends, and stare at a fast-moving, brightly colored glass box for recreation. Perhaps something like God is out there, but it remains forever hidden and veiled, as we just become a cold lifeless corpse at the fearsome time of death, our consciousness forever expired. Our neat little world is perfectly explained because “they say” it is, and therefore nothing this fantastic could ever really happen. That is precisely why very, very few are prepared for the Harvest, according to Ra. These forces would dearly love to teach us the very simple steps that we need to take in order to make the cut. They dearly want to teach all of us how to prepare for this, the most fantastic moment we will ever experience as third-density beings – GRADUATION. This event represents the end of the suffering that the third density provides; it is a final, beautiful entrance into Utopia. It is the “Heaven” so often written about by prophets and mystics, and it is very real. The abilities we will have far outstrip our wildest stretches of imagination. The reason why so many Earth Changes have already occurred before the event itself is that we were not capable of learning any other way. We needed to be practically destroyed as a civilization to be slammed out of our perpetual slumber. Our lives are giant dreams, where the only things that matter are the transient issues that surface day to day; money, relationships, work, paying the bills, et cetera. None of this matters one iota, except for its effect on how we treat others. We cannot deny the fact, though, that for now we"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"must continue to go through the motions to preserve our physical bodies. What will matter the most in the near future of our physical world is how prepared we are for the continuing Earth Changes when all of these systems have dropped out from under us. These events will help us to respect that something much bigger than we had imagined is at work. Many of us will suddenly know the forces of change that we have brought about ourselves; almost all will cower in fear at the apparent “wrath of God.” In actuality, this is natural karma, compassionately applied with never the slightest bit more than we need for balance, and designed as a learning tool. Indeed, it becomes quite clear that the Shift of the Ages is the name of the game, the whole point behind all of the physically hopeless situations. Much of this book has been designed to show us how the millennial event horizon is the opening of a vortex through space and time – a vortex that we can pass into. When the time is right, we will embark on a personal adventure more fantastic than anything we could have ever dreamed of. Indeed, no movie sequence or artist’s vision could possibly match the joy, beauty and peace of what will be. That, dear friends, is the joy of the Harvest. As we can see, the information in this book is not a story of, “Oh well, I guess this is it, we’re all going to die.” What you, the reader, actually have here is the opportunity to take part in the most historic single moment of evolution in this planet’s history. But if you don’t want to know about it, you can choose not to. Again and again, these sources have emphasized that it is your own free will, your universal right to be protected from truth if you do not want to know the truth, that stops you from being clearly forewarned. So let’s say you do want to know the truth. What we are talking about here is evolution of your true Self on the energetic, harmonic and light levels, or Spiritual Growth, as is so commonly talked about. Spiritual growth must, by nature of its design, involve your own choices every step of the way. It is not the will of the One to force you into preparing yourself for Harvest. If you continue to resist, and in fact miss the whole thing, you must be allowed to make that choice. It is possible that you might be unaware that it ever even happened afterwards. Without your freewill choices in place, there is no growth; you would be an automaton who would never really learn anything, just going through the motions. This evolutionary leap is as much personal as it is planetary, and that is the essential focus that most people are failing to see when examining the issues surrounding the now-obvious Earth Changes that are occurring, as predicted. This is a step that we must make within ourselves, and in fact the conditions of the larger world are not to be looked at as outside events, but rather as motivators for us to become ever more highly engaged in our own personal growth process. The crux of the growth process that we are referring to here is the acceptance of other people, and of a desire to help them; a desire to act on behalf of others around us before taking actions that would be for our own individual gains. When we begin understanding the way the universe truly works, that it is a universe of Oneness, we may then realize that helping others is in fact attending to our own One Being, meaning ourselves, the others, the entire planet and in essence, the entire Creation. It is only in our illusory feelings of"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"being separate from the One that we would act, in fear, for our own interests first."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 21: CONCLUSION: TYING IT ALL TOGETHER In this final chapter, we push all the \"buttons\" simultaneously, weaving all the arguments presented in the book together into one package. We see that the entire argument assembles together perfectly. We also provide a few more compelling bits of new information, including the emergence of the \"11:11\" ratio in the Great Pyramid and the idea that the August 99 - May 2000 period is a major vibrational gateway to usher in higher vibrations. CHAPTER 21: CONCLUSION: TYING IT ALL TOGETHER We can look at all of the information within this book as a scientific study, a means of correlating psychic and historical data with observable, empirical facts. We have explored both avenues and seen the multitudinous points where they intersect. As we move closer and closer to the truth, we start to feel a very interesting sensation. \"What about me? What about right now? Is this really going to happen to me? Could something like this actually be possible?\" The actual idea of Ascension is quite incredible to grasp. So many important public figures speak on UFOlogy, spirituality and metaphysics currently, but the topic of Ascension is very curiously absent in the vast majority of cases. We simply don't want to accept something that becomes such a towering, impending edifice of truth. Perhaps we are afraid that it \"couldn't possibly happen,\" and thus we are not willing to go out on a limb and talk about it - risking our reputations for something that we think might never actually happen. Our rational, Ego minds fear their own transformation, and in their lack of knowledge or trust in what might lie beyond, we are land-bound. The idea of our bodies being transformed into a higher dimensional frequency seems to defy every bit of rational thought and analysis that we can summon up. Undoubtedly, the physics are in place. This book shows that to be true in a format more comprehensive than anything else previously compiled into one work. We can also see how many others have gone before us, including the Master Jesus. We can look back on the knowledge of the metaphysics of the One, and realize that it is our own personal destiny for each one of us to individually return to this Oneness, one frequency at a time. But, no matter how much we struggle and fight with the third dimensional world, we cannot conceive of leaving it behind. The whole idea of such a thing seems to invalidate every living fiber and tissue of our bodies. When we pass into death, we know that there will be profound changes. Some of us think that we will simply cease to exist. Others expect that they will simply reincarnate and go through the treadmill yet again. Still others expect to enter into a static \"heaven\" where everyone flies around with angel wings, plays harps, drinks the nectar of the gods and eats the sacred ambrosia. And others might expect that they will rejoin our lost Space Brothers, passing into a higher level of Utopian existence where \"anything goes.\""},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"The truth is that we feel we just can't answer these questions. We don't think that there is any way to \"know\" the answer to these mysteries. The harder we try to think about them, the more we feel our own impotence in explaining these great mysteries of Creation. Nowhere is this more directly felt than within our minds, as we grapple with the knowledge of death. Many of us are very frightened by death, since we just don't know what to expect and may fear the worst. We all need to make a choice within ourselves. A choice to accept that such a fantastic thing as Ascension could really occur. We all need to allow ourselves to fantasize about the incredible possibilities. Are we really meant to stay on Earth forever as we are now, forever reincarnating to play the game over and over again? Or is there a pattern involved? Are we just crashing our way through our lives, or is there a purpose for our being here? Do the experiences and events that happen in our lives have meaning and purpose, or are they all simply random circumstances? Although we don't think about these things in rational terms, all of us are aware that there is a purpose to our lives. We are not simply put here to be born, make widgets, buy products on TV and die. We are spiritual beings, living inheritors of a Divine legacy that has expanded itself throughout the entire cosmos. We have souls, and we are all trying to \"grow\" spiritually. We might wonder at various times what this \"spiritual growth\" entails, but overall we can see that it has to do with being more accepting of both ourselves as well as other people. We all innately know that \"spiritual growth\" is a movement towards being more loving, all across the board. But what is the purpose of spiritual growth, if it does indeed exist? Are we supposed to keep repeating the same script over and over again? If reincarnation exists, do we simply drop down to Earth time after time, just to keep trying? Are we never going to reach a point of completion in this, our \"spiritual growth?\" Is there more to life than being a human in a three- dimensional body? Do the higher dimensions that our physicists have discovered simply exist as \"place holders\" in the Universe, or are they realms of Creation that are equally alive, and higher than our own? Are we about to Graduate? If so, what does this mean? Could this graduation represent our own transcension of the third dimension, and its difficulties? All of us know how hard it is to be here, and how many challenges need to be overcome. All of us can see how many people exist on the face of this Earth in disharmony, causing damage to themselves, to others and to the environment. All of us can see that we have practically destroyed ourselves in order to learn our lessons. And now, it seems that with environmental deterioration, earthquakes, weather disturbances, economic failures and other Earth Changes, the present world that we have created for ourselves is dissolving very rapidly. Since all things must move in cycles, can we not see the reality of our own Solar Cycle? Do we not see the incredible timing between a cycle that has been talked about for thousands of years, and the actual conditions that we see in the present? How could the Maya have possibly known what the conditions would be like at this point in our history, as we head towards December 22, 2012? How could we have ever expected that things would get to be this way? Even just a few years ago, people scoffed at the idea of"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"changes surrounding the New Millennium, either good or bad. And yet now, everyone is becoming very seriously aware of the potential for major social changes at a very rapid speed. Perhaps we will read this book only a few months before these changes move into the next major level. If we look back to the work of Colonel Phillip Corso, who came forward about the reverse-engineering projects that he himself helped to develop from extraterrestrial technology, the pieces all start to fit together. For some inexplicable reason, we have had a number of extraterrestrial spacecraft crash-land on Earth, and apparently more than one of them have had no damage whatsoever. If what Corso says is true, and we have every reason to believe that it is, we simply would not have our current technology without this intervention. But what exactly does that mean for us as global citizens? Why can we look at the Pyramid Timeline and see an exact schedule for a multitude of events in the past, present and future? If Bauval and Cayce are correct in dating the age of the Great Pyramid and the rest of the Gizeh complex to 12,500 years ago, then how could it be possible that these historical events could be plotted out with such incredible accuracy? Do we ever stop to think about this, or do we just shove it under the rug in order to protect our fragile \"belief structures\" that we have built up throughout all of our lives? Is it possible that these extraterrestrials purposefully gave us their technology, in order that we would produce computer chips, lasers, fiber optics, infrared vision, Teflon, superconducting ceramics, anti-gravity propulsion, time travel and other things? When we look at the \"big picture,\" where would we be if the computer chip was never discovered? There would be no Internet, no remote controls, no cordless telephones, no calculators, no digital watches, no credit cards, no ATMs, no VCRs, no video movie cameras, no answering machines, no voice mail... hardly anything that we now have come to rely on would exist. The system of physics presented in this book, when properly utilized in any dimensional level, has the potential to eliminate all of the crises and hardships that we now face on Earth. We now know that we have the ability to harness limitless sources of free energy from this Grid system. We are moving closer and closer to what Christian mystic Teilhard de Chardin called the \"Omega Point,\" or \"a moment of quantum awakening.\" When we look back to the enigma of the Pyramid Timeline, we wonder how such accuracy could be rendered. Was this all a simple case of remarkably accurate future prophecy? Or was there more to it than that? Is it possible that the reason why the Pyramid Timeline exists is that its creators were simply observing the natural products of the Great Solar Cycle? Is it also possible that the \"gift\" of modern crashed-disk technology was purposefully introduced into our society by extraterrestrial beings in order that we advance quickly enough to be \"on schedule\" with the Cycle? Is it possible that the entire reason for crop circles, sightings, abductions, contact experiences and other related events is to prepare us for this awesome event? Can we really even fathom the possibility that the Earth is being transformed, being reborn? Do we have the ability to look within ourselves and see the darkness, to transform ourselves into Light as well?"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Are we Ascending even now as we read this book? Or, do we simply choose to repeat our habit patterns, going down the same old roads of the psyche time after time, never learning our lessons? Are we simply supposed to be allowed to destroy the Earth through our own inability to stop the systems that we ourselves created? If we were left to our own devices, with no universal cycles or outside intervention, would we actually complete our Graduation curriculum, or would we simply let ourselves and our Earth perish? How long will we continue to look away from the warning signs that are all around us? When we hold positions of power, where changes can be made, do we retreat back into what is familiar and comfortable so that we might never have to face the truth? Do we simply erect a barrier within the psyche, shutting out the importance of anything else but our own self-indulgence and gratification? Or, do we activate our sense of compassion for others and for the Earth, and begin trying to make positive changes? We need to stop measuring reality on what we think we know is true, to stop indulging ourselves in assuming that we have all the answers. We need to be willing to crack the door open just a bit. This book is a backstage pass into some of the behind-the-scenes activity that is going on here on Earth. Can we ever know the full extent of this activity? Probably not. Can we approach a great deal of it and begin to understand it? Absolutely. A great portion of this material was inspired through direct contacts with those who already exist in higher realms. We have quoted Edgar Cayce, the Ra Material, the Seth Material, Walter Russell and the Wilcock Readings. We have seen repeated examples of historical cases of extraterrestrial intervention, including the stunning picture of the Solomon Islands religious idols that were reprinted in this book. These idols looked almost exactly the same as what we would now think of as modern-day Greys. If we look back to the Jane Roberts books, we can see yet another confirmation of the morphology of the \"Grey,\" back in 1968 when no one was talking about these guys yet. Millions and millions of us have come to accept that we are not the only game in town. We can hardly even fathom the awesomeness of a complete civilization existing in ruins on our closest neighboring planet, Mars. And yet, when we go there, we see a physical layout for all the same hyperdimensional systems of physics that we have been discussing in this book. Do we open our minds and dare to dream the impossible dream? Do we face up to the truth, look everything squarely in the eye and accept the possibility that we will Ascend? Are we ready for the most awesome, majestic, unbelievable, incredible, mind-expanding, paradigm shifting event in the history of human civilization? Do we allow ourselves to entertain the notion that this could really be true, or do our hardened minds simply revert back to \"reality mode?\" Does the reality of the 8 to 5, workaday life have us in its clutches? Do monthly bills and yearly taxes fix us into an immovable structure of beliefs? Do we simply indulge in believing that \"this world sucks and that's the way it is?\" Is it not more invigorating, more exciting, more adventurous to expand the limitations of our minds? To accept that Ascension is a reality? All the clues have been set before us in this book. So now, let's briefly review what those clues are."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"In the Introduction, we started out by discussing the imminent changes all around us at this time. None of us can deny that our world is moving into a totally new phase of its development. We looked at some of the multitudes of creative works being produced in modern times, and examined how these apparently subconscious metaphors for Ascension have surfaced again and again. In Convergence Book Three: Psychic Revelations, we will examine more completely how it is that all of us are being prepared for Ascension through our dreaming lives. Wilcock's associate Joe Mason has done a great deal of research on this topic as well. In Chapter Two, we proposed the idea of a hidden \"zero-point energy\" or aether in the universe that obeys fluid-like harmonic properties of vibration, in order that we might then find the mechanism of this system of physics that we have been discussing. We started by looking at the phenomenon of consciousness units, the unseen energetic structures \"beneath\" physical matter. We took quotes from The Ra Material, The Seth Material and Walter Russell to give us a conceptual basis for understanding these enigmatic \"units.\" What we have showed is that they provide a \"structure\" within the background energy of the Creation, corresponding to the relative density of energy in any one area. And it is this same structure that is directly responsible for the relative speed and quality of the passage of time as we now know it. After laying out the conceptual foundations for consciousness units, we described how the octave structure of the dimensions best exemplifies this organization. Modern physics is already well on the way to discovering that there is indeed an octave of dimensions - certainly a very metaphysical concept, a \"deep numerology that no one understands.\" So far the physicists have felt that the superstrings lack \"symmetry,\" and thus they have added two more dimensions to the universe to balance this. This does not show up in Srinivasa Ramanujan's modular functions, which are related to the dimensions and abound with the numbers 8 and 24. Physicist Tony King then revealed exactly what we were looking for -- an eight-dimensional spacetime that is built upon a series of Platonic \"hyperframes,\" as we continue to remind ourselves that the Platonic geometries are the simple result of vibration in a fluid-like medium. Taking this eight-fold structure of dimensions, we looked at how there is a direct correlation between light and sound - both of which fall into an octave. We explained how the octave also shows up within the electron orbits of the atom. Each \"shell\" can hold a maximum of eight electrons, before it must rise into the next \"shell\" or frequency. We also saw how human DNA conforms to an octave structure as well, incorporating the square of 8, or 64 proteins in each strand. This was correlated with modern discoveries of the identical mathematical structure of the I Ching. We have suggested that it is conceivable that the ancient Chinese authors of the I Ching were able to \"download\" the DNA structure from Universal Consciousness, which fundamentally entrains Light and harnesses it into its natural, spiraling form. Then, in later chapters we also saw that cell mitosis goes through an octave as well -- eight phases in seven intervals. Robert Lawlor also expressed to us that there are seven main subsystems to the human nervous system. We also learned that the Renaissance scientists were obsessed with finding symmetry and mathematical proportions such as phi within the measurements of the"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"human body, and that there are an incredible number of these correlations. These ratios govern the growth of all living structures on this planet, as well as the growth of entire civilizations and Time itself as well! So from the biological perspective, we can start to see that we ourselves are also a function of this octave structure on a very intimate level - from DNA to our cells to our nervous system, skeletal system and many other areas as well. (As one skeletal example, we have seven cervical vertebrae, twelve dorsal vertebrae and four lumbar vertebrae - again, all the octave-based, building block \"frequency numbers.\") We then have seen that geometry is the third component to this puzzle. In the words of Hipparchus, \"Geometry is frozen music.\" We have gone to great lengths to show how the Platonic solids illustrate various frequencies, all of which are \"encoded\" within a spherical energy field. The work of Buckminster Fuller showed us that a spherical balloon, submerged in dye, would visually demonstrate the Platonic solids when vibrated at different frequencies, or tones. Dr. Hans Jenny followed this up with the vibrations of pure sound in hydro-dynamic dispersions. However, the problem with these Platonic frequencies, as we had stated it, was that there did not appear to be a full octave of Platonic solids to satisfy an octave of vibrations. The ancient Hindu writings in the Vedas provided the solution for us, by demonstrating how the icosahedron, or what they named the god Purusha, was repeated twice in the \"octave,\" at positions two and seven. We then saw that this knowledge regarding the three-dimensional structure of \"consciousness units\" has been repeated to us by the arguably non-terrestrial phenomenon of crop circles. Anyone can go to www.cropcircleconnector.com, pay a small fee to become a member and peruse the yearly archives of crop circles, from every year since 1977 and especially 96, 97 and 98, and easily see diagrams of \"consciousness units\" as well as the spirals that make them up. Upon careful study of the archives of these formations as a whole, it can be seen that well over 90 percent of all crop circles in existence appear to be geometric expressions of consciousness units in many different forms! Some show the geometries themselves, and other more recent formations actually show us the spirals, complete with their fractal counterparts! We again bring in the B&W image of Stonehenge 1996, which is another amazing phi-shaped Julia Set fractal crop circle, with our image from the chapter on the Becker-Hagens grid, and then an inverted, magnified and reversed clipping of the Stonehenge formation with the appropriate circles stressed in white: From this diagram, we can indeed see that these \"Earth Grid Circles\" that"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Richard Lefors Clark called \"Diamagnetic Energy Vortices\" could be showing us how this spiraling energy works within the Global Grid, in a very physical form. These crop circles might not simply be showing us fractals to pique our interest, but to give us valuable information for decoding the pulsating structure of the Creation. Furthermore, if you look closely at the three circles in image number 2, they are remarkably similar in size and position to the three stars in the belt of Orion, which are also remarkably similar in size and position to the three Pyramids of Giza. And thus, this same harmonic law certainly may be organizing these three stars in a harmonic spiral as well. So, it is obvious that \"someone\" is trying to get us to put all of this together. Thankfully, there are many ways to approach this problem, and thus the proof can come in a variety of forms. The focus in the last few chapters of Part II has specifically dealt with how these geometric energies show themselves within planetary structures. We have looked at the work of Bruce Cathie, who showed a cube / octahedron structure within the Earth's energetic fields, and demonstrated how it was apparently being used for navigation by UFOs. We also looked at the work of Richard Hoagland and the Enterprise Mission, who showed us how the tetrahedron emerges as a system of energetic upwellings that occur on planets all throughout the Solar System, as well as Earth. The next step was to see how Carl Munck fit into all of this. He showed us a discrete \"coordinate system\" that was in use by previous Earth civilizations to map these energies. As amazing as it must seem to the skeptical, Munck conclusively demonstrates that the structure of pyramids, temples, stone circles and earthworks all are based on a planet-wide system of classification. No matter where they are situated, they provide self-referential coordinates that describe their precise location on the Earth, in latitude and longitude. The center point for all of these coordinates passes directly through the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. In order for the builders of this coordinate system to have made these precise calculations, they would have needed a level of technology or focused spiritual consciousness comparable to modern computers or geniuses like Srinivasa Ramanujan. We also know from examining the geometric structure of these consciousness units that the pyramid structure is a perfect replication of our own native density, the octahedral level. Therefore, it would make sense that the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, with its mirror-perfect polished white limestone casing stones, cemented together at 1/100th of an inch, would be situated on the best energy vortex the Earth has to offer. We are literally viewing a lost technology that is still far more advanced than our own. If we know how to use it, as these pyramid builders did, then tremendous things would be possible. Not only are they valid for healing and initiation, but they balance the energies of the planet and can lend tremendous energy for excursions in consciousness. With these energies properly harnessed, a human entity could basically log on to the Cosmic Internet and get any information needed, from any period of time in any location. The next interesting series of points that we raised have to do with the actual frequency of light speed, and its harmonic connections to the basic \"frequency numbers\" that we have continually mentioned. Through Cathie's research, we can see that the value for light speed, expressed in harmonic Global Grid terms of minutes of arc per grid second, is precisely 144,000. This is exactly the same as the number of days in one Mayan Calendar \"baktun\" time period,"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"as well as being a direct harmonic of the sound frequencies, expressed as a number of cycles per second of vibration in air. Then, when we factor in the work of Carl Munck, the results become even more significant. Munck's work showed us the validity of inches, feet and miles as a measurement, which we can also see in the harmonic 2,160-mile diameter of the Moon. We also know that the second is very important as well, because of the existence of the Constant of Nineveh, and the fact that the second is the only value of time that will precisely yield the series of round \"frequency numbers\" that we now use to express sound vibrations. So, the old-fashioned value for the Speed of Light, expressed in miles per second, should have something interesting to offer us. With the work of Carl Munck, we are left with no doubts about the harmonic importance of our present figure for light speed in miles per second. We remember that Munck took the tangents of all of the Gematrian \"frequency numbers,\" including all those that measure sound vibrations, and determined that they all reduced down to only two simple values! That means that for every single frequency number we have discussed, as well as other harmonic and Gematrian numbers, the \"spiral\" or waveform that they describe appears to be the same. We know this because the tangent function is used to measure and calculate curvatures. What was even more incredible was that by multiplying these two tangents together, or showing how they both are One, part of a unified, spiraling system, we get the square root of five! And Robert Lawlor makes a solid mathematical / geometrical case in Sacred Geometry for the fact that the square root of five directly generates the phi ratio. We know from studying the side lengths of the Platonic Solids that they are all a function of phi and the square root of two. Now we can see that the \"spiral\" formed by multiplying the two common tangents of all our \"frequency numbers\", namely the square root of five, also directly produces this same phi ratio! Furthermore, Munck tells us that the square root of five, which is the key to the whole puzzle of phi and the \"consciousness units,\" is also the tangent of the Speed of Light in free space! In other words, the \"upward spiraling line of light\" indicated by Ra travels in the exact same mathematical fashion as our Platonic solids and frequency numbers - utilizing a spiral that is tangentially measured by the square root of five! What we can see from this \"final capstone\" to the puzzle is that the Gematrian frequency numbers for sound vibrations are indeed the key to understanding the entire composite picture that we have here. These numbers mark out the actual intervals of the spiral of Light that forms the consciousness units. By seeing that the Speed of Light also functions with mathematical precision through the same spiral physics, we can no longer doubt the fundamental, cohesive unity of the \"consciousness unit\" as we have outlined it here. Nor can we possibly deny its effects on the Earth when studying the Global Grid, specifically the Becker / Hagens UVG 120 Polyhedron, which unifies all the Platonic Solids into one basic form. So, when we understand that these frequency numbers indicate a spiraling system of Light, and we also know that they indicate dimensional frequencies as well, our ears perk up when we see these same numbers in the Great Solar Cycle. We remember that the figure of 25,920 years is a precise"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"harmonic value that can yield all other \"frequency numbers\" through division. The Mayan Calendar itself, charting out one fifth of this cycle, also shows us these numbers in its organization. So, when we see that the Sun and planets are also a unified, spiraling system or consciousness unit, tracing their orbits through free-standing space in a spiral fashion, we can see why so many prophetic sources have indicated a dimensional shift from this event. What we now understand is that the Great Solar Cycle embodies this complete, unified system of physics that we have described. It is yet another functioning aspect of the consciousness unit in action, since the CU can be infinitesimally small or infinitely large. Since there is no real space in the Universe, all levels of the CU are actually the same relative \"size.\" We are told in the Ra Material that we can precisely measure the cycles of the Sun with exactness, since it is a Universal Law that all systems must operate in such cycles. Now that we have the physics behind it, we can see why. Each solar system is a consciousness unit that must pulsate through different dimensional frequencies at a precise rate of speed, which the harmonics of the spiral itself determines. The planets exhibit these harmonic, musical ratios in their relative positions one to the other, thus exemplifying the nature of any Solar System as \"crystallized music\" or light. The author remembers seeing a study from Zecharia Sitchin that illustrated a similar harmonic structure to the Uranian moon system as well. In Chapter Fifteen, we zoned in on Edgar Cayce reading 1602-003, and on the following enigmatic lines: In 1998 we may find a great deal of the activities as have been wrought by the gradual changes that are coming about. These are at the periods when the cycle of the solar activity, or the years as related to the sun's passage through the various spheres of activity become paramount... to the change between the Piscean and Aquarian age... We then looked at Cayce's timeline of events, and saw that this \"cycle of the solar activity\" appears to break down into roughly 25,000-year intervals. We connected this cycle of time to the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes, the Earth's slow wobble which shifts our view of the stars in the night sky by one degree every seventy-two years. Then, we examined the Ra Material, and we saw that this roughly 25,000-year solar cycle is indeed in effect, and will shift the dimensional frequencies here on Earth: ...One major cycle is approximately 25,000 of your years. There are three cycles of this nature during which those who have progressed may be harvested at the end of three major cycles... This sphere... has not made an easy transition to the vibrations which beckon. This inconvenience... shall continue unabated for a period of approximately thirty of your years. Q: After this period of thirty years (1981+30=2011) I am assuming that this will be a fourth density planet. Is this correct? RA: I am Ra. This is so. Once we had gotten our information from Ra, we looked in on the groundbreaking work of Maurice Cotterell, who discovered an identical cycle in the Solar body through strictly scientific means. Cotterell also discovered that"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"the Maya had the same information encoded in stone, through the Mayan Calendar. We looked at all of the clues suggested from Cotterell's work, John Major Jenkins and others that indicate that we are due up for a major change, a possible pole shift or \"the end of the present world.\" We then checked in with ex-NASA scientist Maurice Chatelain for his insights on the Mayan Calendar. From this work, we were led to discover the incredible, mathematical precision of the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction, and its effects on the Great Solar Cycle. We learned that there is only a 54-day difference between the actual timing of a J-S conjunction and a Mayan katun of 7,200 days. When we figured the number of days in one of Chatelain's Mayan Calendar cycles, based on J-S conjunctions at 1,886,040 days, and then subtracted this from the length of one of Cotterell's \"sunspot shift cycles\" at 1,366,040, we came up with exactly 520,000 days left over. Cotterell demonstrates how the number 520, or 2x260, is a universal system for \"shifting\" cycles, and we showed how it is a harmonic of the number 13. From this one point, we can see how the J-S conjunction obviously fits in to the grand scheme of things in a mysterious, synchronistic and mathematically precise fashion. Then, as we continued looking at the J-S conjunction, we discovered that Richard Hoagland had written an entire study on his website that showed that this event had even more radio jamming, hyperdimensional power than the common 11-year sunspot cycle. When we looked at the actual timing of the J- S conjunction, we realized that it very strongly suggested the period before and after May 28, 2000 as a date of great significance. On this date, Jupiter and Saturn, the drivers of the Great Solar Cycle, will make their last conjunction prior to the completion of the cycle itself. And as this book is going to print, we certainly are seeing bizarre behavior in the Stock Market - a 2-trillion dollar loss of value in one day on Friday, April 14, 2000. Then, when we turned the clock back a few months from this date, we again find that the August 11, 1999 conjunction appeared to be an important gateway, even if we did not see anything physically. In our other writings we have seen how it appeared that the Gnostic authors of the Bible were aware of this hallmark conjunction, and wrote it into the New Testament. The four beasts of the Apocalypse, the lion, ox, man and eagle, corresponded to the four zodiacal signs Leo, Taurus, Aquarius and Scorpio, in which this Grand Cross conjunction took place. Even if they didn't know what exactly would happen at this time, they appear to have used this event as a point for triangulating many prophetic statements. We can see the symbolism of the Grand Cross here on Earth having to do with crucifixion, or the Earth's own fulfillment of the pattern set by Christ. What we had, from a strictly hyperdimensional perspective, is a tremendous cross- shaped arrangement of planetary bodies, which produces tremendous energetic stress as well as a clear geometric structure. This is then almost precisely the same as that stress caused by the two largest bodies, Jupiter and Saturn, when they go into conjunction. So therefore, when we saw such a powerful configuration appearing so close to the final J-S conjunction at the end of an entire 77,760-year cycle of ages, we could not help but wonder if it had some sort of effect in opening up a higher level of energy that will become completely settled after May 28, 2000. We can certainly expect many new changes by this point."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Drawing off our Global Grid work in the later chapters, Becker and Hagens have shown us that Grid Point 11 falls directly over the northern portion of England. We have looked at information from other sources on the Grid that suggest that certain times of year, and certain astronomical configurations, might affect the energetics of the Global Grid. So, what we can see is that on Aug. 11, on grid point 11 at 11:11 a.m., the Solar Eclipse went into complete corona, where the hyperdimensional energies of the Sun and Moon were as precisely aligned as they could ever possibly get. And, as we had said in the previous edition of this book, finished March 8, 1999: With all the attending stresses of the Grand Cross configuration, this Eclipse will become as a laser beam of focused, fourth-dimensional consciousness/ energy, or metaphorically significant as the lance that pierced the body of Christ on the Cross. As this hyperdimensional \"laser beam\" reaches its strongest point of corona, it also ignites one of the most highly significant Grid vortices on Earth - the location of Stonehenge and a host of other megalithic stoneworks. This single burst of energy will blast the Global Grid so strongly that the entire Grid itself will sound like a gigantic gong, rising to an incredible height of frequency for a few moments...We can also expect that this blast of energy would continue to cause the Global Grid to expand, thereby causing land shifts as Wilcock's readings are predicting. And indeed, on Aug. 17, 1999, the exact day when the Grand Square planetary conjunction itself went into its tightest alignment, there was a tremendous 6.9 earthquake in Turkey -- directly over the area where the eclipse path had traversed just six days earlier. This was all the convincing that was necessary to see that these effects really can be measured and predicted. Taiwan then followed soon afterwards with equal severity. We remember seeing the ring of energy created in the Pacific Ocean basin, and how much it resembled cell mitosis, as though the Earth itself was showing us a physical metaphor of regeneration. We also remember Joseph Jochmans' information from Athelsan Spilhaus and others that suggests that such a geometric expansion has already occurred in the past. The Hopi prophecies about the Earth's grid expanding like the white spots on a growing doe are also very interesting bits of corroboration. So, this continuing increase of Light or aether density into the global energy grid, by such a precise hyperdimensional arrangement of forces in the galaxy, cannot go without its effects. The Ra Material tells us that the Earth will have to \"electromagnetically realign its vortices of reception,\" and that they have \"every reason to believe\" that the sum total of this realignment will be approximately 20 degrees due east of North. Furthermore, there is even more intriguing research to show that the \"gateway\" of 11:11, which opened on Aug. 11, 1999, had great significance. In Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval's book, Message of the Sphinx, [or Keeper of Genesis in Europe,] the 11:11 ratio is specifically mentioned as being of quintessential importance to the functioning of the entire pyramid itself! This 11:11 ratio is also shown to have a harmonic connection to the angle measurement of 111.111 degrees, elsewhere in the Gizeh complex. In Hancock and Bauval's work, there are frequent citations from the landmark Pyramid Texts of Unas, and their reference to the First Time, or \"Zep Tepi.\" Hancock and Bauval tell us that this First Time of Egypt was 12,500 years ago, the exact date of the close of the most recent Solar Breath / precessional"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"cycle. At this moment, the point where the Sun would rise, called the vernal point, was directly in front of the Sphinx within the constellation Leo, the Lion. Hence the very first thing we see is how the terrestrial Sphinx was built to face its celestial counterpart. This obviously is another piece of evidence linking the Sphinx to a time of 12,500 years in the past. This Sphinx alignment dovetails nicely with Bauval's discovery that the three pyramids of Gizeh are a precise terrestrial map of the constellation Orion, designed to be in exact alignment with the celestial Orion 12,500 years ago. Then, we are told that the second major time-encoded date for the Pyramid complex is the point at which the internal \"airshafts\" in the Pyramid align with their celestial counterparts in the heavens. The time where everything fits together is in 2500 BC, almost exactly 8000 years after the First Time of 10,500 BC. The vernal point, where the Sun rose, has then moved exactly 111.111 degrees away from where it started in 10,500 BC! There again, we have an apparently built-in, deliberate numerical synchronicity showing itself! Hancock and Bauval speculate that the pyramids might somehow be able to facilitate time travel within the focus of consciousness, so that those of the Egyptian Pyramid Age might be able to scan backwards to this \"First Time\" of 12,500 years ago. If this is true, then they suggest that these precision alignments in the Pyramid have their purpose for calibrating that specific time. The reader will remember that we discussed similar methods of time calibration in the chapter on the Constant of Nineveh. Thus, on page 235 of \"Message of the Sphinx,\" they write that since the precession causes a one- degree shift every 72 years, ...If the Horus - King could have been provided with the 'special number' 111.111, and had used it in the way described above, it would have led him back to (72x111.111 years =) 7,999.99 years before the specified 'ground zero,' i.e. to almost exactly 8000 years before 2500 BC - in short, to 10,500 BC. We know that this seems like wishful numerology of the worst sort - i.e. 'factoring in' an arbitrary value to a set of calculations so as to procure spurious 'corroboration' for a specific desired date (in this case the date of 10,500 BC, twelve and a half thousand years before the present...) The problem, however, is that the number 111.111 may well not be an arbitrary value. At any rate, it has long been recognized that the main numerical factor in the design of the Great Pyramid, and indeed of the Giza necropolis as a whole, is the prime number 11 - a prime number being one that is only divisible by itself to produce the whole number 1. Thus 11 divided by 11, i.e. the ratio 11:11, produces the whole number 1 (while 11 divided by anything else, i.e. any other ratio, would, of necessity, generate a fraction.) What is intriguing is the way that the architecture of the Great Pyramid responds to the number 11 when it is divided, or multiplied, by other whole numbers. The reader will recall, for example, that its side length of just over 755 feet is equivalent to 440 Egyptian royal cubits - i.e. 11 times 40 cubits. In addition, its height to base ratio is 7:11. The slope ratio of its sides is 14:11 (tan 51 degrees 50'). And the slope ratio of the southern shaft of the King's Chamber - the shaft that was targeted on Orion's belt in 2500 BC - is 11:11 (tan 45 degrees)."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Arguably, therefore, the ratio 11:11, which integrates with our \"special number\" 111.111, could be considered as a sort of mathematical key, or 'stargate' to Orion's belt. Moreover, as we shall see, a movement of 111.111 degrees backwards along the ecliptic from 'ground - zero' at the Hyades - Taurus, the head of the celestial bull, would place the vernal point 'underneath' the cosmic lion.\" So now we can see that Hancock and Bauval directly mention the 11:11 ratio as the \"stargate\" of the Great Pyramid! [Note: Just as this book is in its final edit and going to print, a huge bolt of lightning exploded overhead in a giant flash, right as we read the word \"Stargate\" again.] Synchronistically enough, the colon between the two numbers, which indicates a ratio, reads exactly the same as the colon in clock time, AND exactly the same as the colon in Bible quotations! This lends even greater credence to the validity of the 11:11 conjunction being so important - it appears that the entire Pyramid was built to encapsulate this number! Then, when we see the focus on the internal timelines, the metaphor of the returning capstone and the Masonic connections of this symbol to \"A great order of ages\" being \"born anew,\" we must start to seriously consider that the period between the Aug. 11, 1999 conjunction and May 28, 2000 conjunction will end up being seen as a symbolic event of incredible significance to us as a planetary species. The ancients clearly were able to focus in on this time as being of significance, and in order for us to see it we may need to study more of the \"subtle\" effects in society, such as the changes in paradigms that are now occurring with events such as a major motion picture about the Martian Anomalies. We rounded out the book with a discussion of the Nineveh Constant, which helped to show us how these cycles of time might be used by extradimensional travelers to navigate through the timestream, or the fabric of space and time. We also were given another glaring clue as to the elegant beauty and simplicity of the harmonic numbers underlying all of the Creation. Simply multiplying 70 by 60 seven times in a row can render the entire Cycle, measured in seconds. The pulsar B1257+10 shows an almost exact similarity to our own in its configuration, and as this is the first major extra-planetary system that we have found, we can assume that they all function to some degree of harmonic consistency. And with Wilcock's original research, this same harmonic system has been expanded out to the Galactic level, and we can see that all truly does work in perfect mathematical harmony. With the work of Cowan and Masson, we see that time itself takes on a dynamic, shifting, energetic structure that can be accurately predicted in advance, and whose behaviors have certain definite effects upon civilization. So now, we have an even greater grasp of how our own Great Solar Cycle affects us as a planetary society. (4:44 p.m., 3/8/98.) As we learn and understand the physics behind the Shift of the Ages, we are made pure with our own realization that all things are in balance. Whether we look at sound, color, geometry, atoms, cells, biology, the human body, pyramids, the Global Grid, planetary orbits, the Sunspot Cycle or even greater cycles such as that of the Constant of Nineveh, and now the rise and decline of massive, seemingly random social trends as well, we can see that all things, indeed everything, obeys these magnificent, cyclical harmonic principles. We now know that a massive effort was made by the survivors of the Atlantean cataclysm to preserve the basis of this knowledge for our own"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"generation. Mythologies the world over have encoded the precessional numbers in their roots, and various other societies have retained immense pieces of the puzzle, such as the Maya, the Aztecs and the Sumerians. These teachings found their way into the Western secret societies over time, and now they continue to thrive in the United States Government and its backbone of Masonic belief, as well as the United Nations as a whole in their remarkable Meditation Room. We have also seen how the extraterrestrial forces surrounding us at this time have made numerous efforts to communicate these simple truths to us, through Nostradamus, Cayce, Jane Roberts, Walter Russell, David Wilcock and others. We have indeed arrived at this Omega Point of planetary Ascension now, and we are surrounded by a throng of spectators. These brothers and sisters on the outside made sure that we would have the necessary technology in place at the end of this cycle so that we may process our collective karma from the Age of Atlantis. It is time for us to Ascend, to regain our true heritage and to reclaim the Earth, or the New Jerusalem, in its cleansed and perfected fourth-density form. We have all the proof that we need to convince ourselves that this epic, fantastic event is very soon to occur."}]
