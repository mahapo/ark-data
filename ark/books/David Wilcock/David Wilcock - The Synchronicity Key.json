It is an effect of the connectivityof the universe. It is proof that everything is a part of a unified, connectedwhole. It is an affirmation of life.I first heard about David Wilcock in 2008 when my aunt, Kate Foster, a spiritualseeker who had introduced me to great thinkers such as Seth, Eckhart Tolle,Abraham-Hicks, and many others, called me saying I had to check outDivineCosmos.com. Kate described the website as coming from an extraordinarymind, and since she had steered me to brilliant spiritual teachers in the past,I paid attention. What I saw on DivineCosmos.com opened my eyes to a hiddenworld only recently being uncovered. And that is the world of consciousness.What makes David’s work unique, though, is the core insight that there is aconsciousness throughout the universe. David believes the universe is alive andwe are all a part of the living fabric that binds it together. What a beautifulidea.There is so much information in the world available to people who seek it. As abook publisher, I look for people who can take the seemingly infiniteavailability of data and make sense of it. Then we invite readers to considernew insights into old ideas. When my aunt died in early 2013, she left a legacyof cultivating the new consciousness and helping me bring these ideas intobooks. My first book with David, The Source Field Investigations, became a NewYork Times bestseller and sold all over the world. It is a stunning work ofnear-encyclopedic knowledge about human beings’ place in our universe. It becamean instant classic in its field, and I felt this was the start of a newmovement.The Synchronicity Key is the next evolution of that movement. Using the sameintense research and bold insightfulness that characterized The Source FieldInvestigations, but with an emphasis on how all this hidden science affects youpersonally, this book you have in your hands has the ability to change your lifeto a profound level.David is a divine madman—part shaman, part storyteller, part code breaker—butgimlet-eyed in his quest for answers to life’s unnerving questions. He seeks andfinds and has a knack for explaining the seemingly inexplicable. He is alsorelentlessly positive and optimistic. His words and research deliver a messageof hope and love. It is no accident that Kate directed me to David’s website. Itis no accident that we started working together on his books. It is no accidentthat you are now reading this book. Everything is connected. Everywhere.Brian TartPresident and Publisher, Dutton, and editor ofThe Source Field Investigations and The Synchronicity Key"},{"pageContent":"PART ONETHE SOUL’S JOURNEY IN A LIVING UNIVERSE[../images/00007.gif]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONETHE QUESTYou may have picked up this book, and possibly many others like it over theyears, to try to find a new understanding of the complex world we live in.Before long, if the words are true enough, you soar off to a paradise of themind and heart—freeing yourself from the troubles of the everyday world.Beautiful words of inspiration rain down like a waterfall of love, and for thosemoments—however fleeting they may be—all seems to be well. You undoubtedly havesome wonderful memories—opening beautifully wrapped gifts as a child, achievinga seemingly impossible victory, beholding a magnificent view of nature, feelingthe breathtaking rush of new love or the incredible magic of a newborn baby. Inthose fine moments, life is wonderful, the universe is a marvelous place to be,and you are inspired and optimistic about the future. You may even be brought totears. You feel loved, and you believe that your life has value and purpose. Youknow you are a good person, and that you deserve every kindness that is bestowedupon you. You may even feel that this experience has changed your life—given youa new perspective, taught you to think differently, or allowed you to avoid thepitfalls that once seemed so impossible to evade. Genuine happiness seems to beyours.Then what happens? Sooner or later, tragedy strikes. You are utterly humiliated.You lose your job. You crash your car. You can’t pay the bills. You worry aboutlosing your home. You suffer a terrible health crisis. Your baby is screamingand may be very sick. Your teenage daughter hates you with an astonishingpassion. You may even be threatened with violence. Everything is very dark. Youare shamed, ridiculed, and laughed at. The people you loved and trusted the mostturn on you, and you feel savagely betrayed and utterly alone. Where once youhad love, gratitude, respect, honor, and peace, you now have pain, misery,sorrow, depression, and fear. You do your best to breathe through theseexperiences and understand what happened, but you feel as if you have beensingled out for horrible punishment. No one else has ever suffered thisprofoundly. Your pain is so vast, so unimaginable, that if anyone else wereexpected to go through this, it would crush them.This is your moment of choice. Do you still believe in a positive future? Do youstill believe in love and in the value of helping others? Do you let misery anddespair overwhelm you, or do you look for ways you can heal the problem and makethe world a better place? Do you believe that if you treat everyone with love,forgiveness, and acceptance—while still maintaining responsible boundaries andnot allowing yourself to be manipulated—then these personal and global woundswill eventually heal? Do you feel that if you have love in your heart, then lovewill appear in your life? Are you strong enough to forgive and to forget—totruly release the pain inside—and know, in your core, that life is wonderful,you are worthy, and you don’t need to be angry, sad, or depressed when crisisstrikes or when others disrespect you? Let’s say that love and forgiveness wouldbe your first choice in how you respond to life’s ups and downs. In thespiritual literature we will discuss in the next chapter, this would be called“the positive path” or “the service-to-others path.” On this path, we learn howto generate love from within ourselves, by our attitude, and this process has ahealing, renewing, and revitalizing effect on all aspects of our lives.Your second choice would be to see each tragic event as just the latest in along, unbroken string of terrible things that have happened in the “real world.”In these painful moments, do you overlook all the positives in your life andconclude, with cynical sarcasm, that life sucks, you can never really trustanyone, love is a myth that people use to get what they want, the only thing youknow for sure is that you’re going to die, and ultimately we humans are afailure—a cancer on the earth? Do you see yourself as strong and wise becauseyou have learned how the world really works, while others are weak, ignorant,even pathetic for believing in the foolish lies of love and forgiveness? Do yougain pleasure and laughter from seeing them suffer? Do you enjoy ridiculinganyone who believes in love—and in a spiritual reality? Do you divide the worldinto “us” and “them” categories, where everyone in your group is good andeveryone outside your group is bad, almost subhuman? Do you carefully study howto manipulate and control others—including telling lies when it seems safe anduseful—so that you won’t have to keep suffering from their blindness andcruelty? Do you believe that toughening them up to be more like you and yourgroup is ultimately a good thing, as their weakness is now being transformedinto strength? This could be called “service to self,” the “negative path,” or“the path of control,” as we will see. Ultimately this is another means ofseeking energy and vitality in our daily lives. On this path, our primary focusis absorbing energy from others.Or do you take the third option: denial and avoidance of either of these paths?During your darkest moments, do you long for that childlike trust that all iswell, and when you remember the positive things that have happened, do they nowall seem like a pathetic fairy tale? Do you feel like you cannot accept a lifewith so much unhappiness—that feeling of faceless terror, intolerable shame, andthe seemingly inevitable reality that bad things will keep on happening, againand again? Does your mind shut down? Do you force yourself not to look? Do youbecome desperate? Do you lack courage? Will you do anything to avoid seeing thetruth? Do you come up with silly, even ludicrous ways of convincing yourselfthat this latest traumatic event is not real, and seek others who will supportyour story, because they can’t handle it either? Do you desperately seek anescape, a lifeline, a rope, thrown down into your pit of misery, so you can feelhappy once more? Do you ignore the reality that is staring you in the face? Doyou climb your way out of hell by learning to live with a very strongconflict—the life you wish you had versus the life there really is? Are youunable to accept that a loving Creator would allow such seemingly terriblethings to happen? Do you pick yourself up, dismiss the pain, and do somethingthat will make you feel good in the short term—even if it ends up hurting you?Temporarily, do you feel like all is well—only to have the truth you are hidingfrom come roaring back into your life once more? Those who repeat theseexperiences with no new insight, without choosing either the path of love or thepath of control, are considered to be in “the sinkhole of indifference”1[part0034.html#chapter001fn1] or in a state of “true helplessness,”2[part0034.html#chapter001fn2] as described in the spiritual literature known asthe Law of One series, which we will be discussing in the next chapter.These choices appear each time we move through a cycle—of pleasure and pain, joyand despair, love and fear, boom and bust, happiness and agony, forgiveness andjudgment, trust and betrayal, strength and weakness, “good” and “bad.” As wewill see, this cycle is written into every movie, every television show, everygreat story told throughout the ages in mythology—and even into the ebb and flowof historical events. It is the Book of Life. It is the great story we all gothrough. We instinctively recognize this story—and the choices we can makewithin it. Atheists and agnostics are as compelled by this story as the devoutlyreligious are. As the lights dim in the theater, our defense mechanisms arepulled down and we surrender ourselves into the childlike wonder of the story,if it is told properly. In this sense, every movie, play, television show, andmyth is a spiritual ceremony, evoking deep memories from a part of us that knowsthe truth without having to think about it. However, the modern retellings ofthis great story almost never reveal the vastly deeper truths that are hiddenwithin it. Until this great jewel of ageless wisdom is truly discovered andappreciated for what it is, we will continue to suffer through endless cycles ofjoy and disaster.The best part of our story is that you do not need to keep suffering. Once youunderstand the hidden design of the universe, you can begin mastering yourexperiences and immediately improve your quality of life. You may even end upfeeling that this information—this ageless wisdom—is alive. Like a fertile seed,it can lie dormant for many hundreds, if not thousands, of years. You can nowunderstand this cycle—the so-called Wheel of Karma—and see what it really is andwhy it is happening. Once you put these ageless wisdom teachings into practice,you can reach the top of the cycle—the highest, best, happiest, and mosttriumphant point in the story—and never again be dragged down into the pit ofdespair. You can move from a place of weakness, pain, sorrow, humiliation,betrayal, anger, and fear to a world of happiness, abundance, joy, prosperity,peace, and fulfillment—and stay there.Some people believe that feelings can heal all the pain and create lastingpeace. The quest to feel good, to feel happy, and to feel inspired might seem tobring acceptable solutions to any problem. However, feelings can always behurt—and if you only ever want to have good feelings, you will be continuallydisappointed. Addictions can creep up when we relentlessly pursue pleasure—evenwhen we do so at increasingly crippling costs. The desire to only ever feel goodcan keep us perpetually locked in denial and avoidance of reality—a state inwhich we are unable or unwilling to choose between the path of love andacceptance and the path of manipulation and control.Others believe that thoughts can solve the mystery. Life is a grand puzzle, andif you think about your problems long enough and deeply enough, you can alwaysfind a solution. However, you have lived your entire life in a world that thinksand believes a certain way. This conditioning runs very deep and is extremelyeasy to fall back into, even for those who are quite advanced on their spiritualpaths. In the animal kingdom, sticking with the group can literally mean thedifference between life and death. If you become an outsider and refuse to goalong with the pack, you probably won’t live very long. Behaviorists have longknown that we have many things in common with the animal kingdom, and thisconstant desire to agree with the group is one of our most deeply ingrainedbehaviors. We pride ourselves on our knowledge, and both school and work teachus that if we have incorrect thoughts, we are a failure and our lives will bethreatened. Our whole identity can be built around the thoughts we think and theknowledge we carry with us and believe to be true. If that knowledge isjeopardized or proven to be incorrect, the shame we feel can seem to be utterlyintolerable. This in turn can quickly lead to incredible rage.Once we dig deeply enough, we may discover that we are profoundly affected bythe hurts we felt in the past, often when we were not yet full adults. The painwe carry inside may be so intense that it affects every thought we think, everyfeeling we feel, and every action we take. We know what we really want—to beloved and accepted. However, the more we go into denial—and try to force thetruth not to be the truth—the uglier our problems get. The more we try to demandthat the people in our lives treat us kindly, or hide from them so we can avoidbeing hurt, the more we suffer. In this book we will explore wisdom teachingsthat can provide effective ways to help make the pain stop.CYCLES OF HISTORYThe Source Field Investigations debuted in August 2011, enjoyed great reviews,and stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for three weeks—peaking atnumber sixteen. The hardcover was more than five hundred pages in length, eventhough I had decided to cut more than a hundred pages from the originalmanuscript so the book would not be overwhelmingly long. The deleted chapterscontained a fascinating body of material, in which I rigorously demonstratedthat the most significant events in world history are not random—they areactually repeating, again and again, in very precise cycles of time. The eventsthat occur within these cycles are telling a story—our own worldwide Book ofLife. The story displays the classic ups and downs of the Wheel of Karma and theHero’s Journey—a mystery we will explore in much more detail later in this book.One of these cycles is the classic 2,160-year Age of the Zodiac. As we will see,the most significant events in Roman history during the Age of Aries reappear inquite a similar fashion during the Age of Pisces—2,160 years later—in America.French scholars Michèl Helmer and François Masson revealed this great hiddentruth beginning in 1958—and I discovered their work only through puresynchronicity.3 [part0034.html#chapter001fn3] Russian scientist Nikolai A.Morozov independently discovered other repeating patterns in history—such asprecise correspondences between Hebrew kings in the Old Testament and Romankings more than a thousand years later—and began publishing his research as farback as Revelation amid Storm and Tempest in 1907.4[part0034.html#chapter001fn4] Morozov eventually published an enormousseven-volume series on his unique discoveries from 1926 to 1932, subtitled TheHistory of Human Culture from the Standpoint of the Natural Sciences. Dr.Anatoly Fomenko used Morozov’s model and dramatically extended his quest to aworldwide level beginning in the 1970s, while pursuing an advanced mathematicsdegree. Fomenko discovered that these patterns were reappearing throughout allof written history—going all the way back to ancient Sumerian times in 4000 B.C.Faced with such staggering and mysterious evidence, both Morozov and Fomenkobelieved that much of our written history was actually a fraud created byhistorians who applied the same set of events to different eras. According toMorozov and Fomenko, historians reused all the most important details of thestory, although they changed the names of leaders, cities, and countries. Thesecycles were such a great mystery that I realized I would need to write a new andseparate book to explain them.I wasn’t entirely sure what was causing these cycles to happen, though I hadsome ideas. In this book I will lay out a complete presentation of the evidence,and I will also present a working model of how these cycles might be happeningand why. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest mysteries of life onearth—particularly once you’ve studied the evidence—and yet it also seemsincomprehensible. Most of us are so accustomed to “conventional reality” thatthe idea of cyclical time, or similar events repeating in regular cycles,wouldn’t be considered a remote possibility. Anyone who suggests such an ideawould probably be quickly dismissed with a sarcastic joke and a big laugh.However, by the time you’re done reading this book, you may see thingsdifferently. We shouldn’t shy away from a mystery just because it seems so hardto believe. The evidence is already quite compelling, but to understand it, wehave to completely rebuild our scientific view of the universe with newinstructions. A variety of discoveries have either been overlooked orunderemphasized, and once we are presented with this new information, our entireworldview may radically change.Although this is not considered a popular notion by any means, there isextensive scientific proof that the universe itself is alive. It is a vast,singular, living being—and we are far more interconnected with it than we mayhave ever believed. A unified, conscious energy field generates the entirecosmos, and this hidden energy can appropriately be called the Source Field. Inthis new science, galaxies, stars, and planets are life-forms on a scale we canbarely even imagine. The basic laws of quantum physics arrange DNA andbiological life out of atoms and molecules we would normally consider to beinanimate.DNA BEGINS AS A QUANTUM WAVEThe DNA molecule is obviously essential to any scientific understanding of lifeand how it forms. One strand of DNA from a single cell contains enoughinformation to clone an entire organism. The new science tells us that DNAbegins as a wave, not a molecule. This wave exists as a pattern within space andtime and is written throughout the entire universe. In this new model, we areconstantly surrounded by pulsating waves of invisible genetic information—muchlike satellite TV, radio waves, and cell phone and broadband Internet signals.Each of these tiny DNA-forming waves creates gravitational forces, on amicroscopic scale, that pull in atoms and molecules from their surroundings toconstruct DNA. If we could develop instruments to see them, each of these waveswould be an exact energetic replica of the DNA molecules they will eventuallyform. The atoms naturally “fall” into the right places as they are pulled intothe wave—much like rocks naturally roll into the bottom of a mountain streamonce they are swept into the current. After single DNA molecules have beenbuilt, these same microgravitational forces cause them to cluster together sothey can begin integrating and creating larger forms of life.One scientist who caught these microgravitational forces in action is Dr. SergeyLeikin. In 2008, Leikin put various types of DNA in ordinary salt water andtagged each type with a different fluorescent color. The color-coded DNAmolecules were scattered like confetti throughout the water. Much to Leikin’ssurprise, matching DNA molecules traveled the equivalent of thousands of miles,within their own tiny universe, to find each other. Before long, he saw thatentire clusters of DNA molecules had gathered together. Each cluster was made ofDNA molecules with the same fluorescent color.5 [part0034.html#chapter001fn5]What could possibly be attracting them together over such vast distances? Leikinthinks this phenomenon may be caused by electrical charges. However, otherexperiments clearly show that this effect cannot be electromagnetic. Gravitybecomes the most likely answer within the existing energy fields known to modernscience.In 2011, Nobel Prize winner Dr. Luc Montagnier demonstrated that DNA can bespontaneously formed out of hydrogen and oxygen molecules—nothing more.Montagnier started out with a hermetically sealed tube of pure sterilized water.He then placed another sealed test tube next it—but this tube had small amountsof DNA floating in the water. Montagnier then electrified both tubes with aweak, seven-hertz electromagnetic field and waited. Eighteen hours later, littlepieces of DNA had grown in the original tube—out of nothing but pure sterilizedwater.6 [part0034.html#chapter001fn6] Let’s not forget that water is H2O,hydrogen and oxygen. How could DNA—which is made of much more complexmolecules—form out of such simple elements? This is one of the most significantdiscoveries in the history of science—by a Nobel laureate biologist, no less—andalthough it did get a small amount of publicity in the media, it was almostcompletely ignored.This new science tells us that the universe is constantly conspiring to makebiological life, wherever and however it can—even in the most utterlyinhospitable places. In any given area of the universe, these hiddenmicrogravitational waves will begin gathering atoms and molecules together thatmake DNA. The waves build whatever life-forms will naturally thrive in thatarea, beginning with single-cell organisms. Amazingly, British astronomers SirFred Hoyle and Dr. Nalin Chandra Wickramasinghe found that 99.9 percent of allthe dust floating around in our galaxy is freeze-dried bacteria.7[part0034.html#chapter001fn7] Sir Fred Hoyle revealed the full implications ofthese new discoveries in a lecture on April 15, 1980—fully thirty-three yearsago at the time of this writing—and yet his surprising breakthroughs have stillnot reached the level of mainstream thought.Microbiology may be said to have had its beginnings in the 1940s. A new world ofthe most astonishing complexity began to be revealed. I find it remarkable thatmicrobiologists did not at once recognize that the world they had penetrated hadof necessity to be of a cosmic order. I suspect that the cosmic quality ofmicrobiology will seem as obvious to future generations as the sun being thecenter of our solar system seems obvious to the present generation.8[part0034.html#chapter001fn8]We already know that the dust in our galaxy is emerging from the surface ofstars like our sun in what we call the “solar wind.” If 99.9 percent of allgalactic dust particles are the freeze-dried bodies of microorganisms, as Hoyleand Wickramasinghe discovered, then every star is a life factory. Each star’sfiery surface is boiling with living bacteria that thrive in extremely hightemperatures. As the superhot material in the star is thrown out into thecoolness of space, the bacteria are instantly freeze-dried and preserved.Eventually they drift to the planets, where they are hydrated and reheated,forming viable organisms once more. Scientists have even observed bacteriagrowing inside hermetically sealed nuclear reactors, and these bacteria feed onradiation.9 [part0034.html#chapter001fn9] How did they get there? We now havemore than enough scientific proof to conclude that these bacteria formedspontaneously, within the reactor, and were custom-designed to eat radiation andbreak it down into material that is less harmful to other forms of life.Everywhere we have ever looked on earth, even 1.7 (2.8 kilometers) miles belowthe surface, we have found living bacteria.10 [part0034.html#chapter001fn10] Inour current view of science, based on the evolutionary theories of CharlesDarwin, all this bacteria evolved “randomly” on earth—and it all had to comefrom a single, original cell. In this new view of science, the universe itselfis a living organism—and the basic laws of physics are custom-designed to createlife, including microorganisms, plants, insects, fish, reptiles, birds, andmammals, wherever it can.Several scientists have also caught DNA in the act of pulling in photons, thetiny packets of energy that make visible light throughout the universe. The newscience reveals that photons are essential to the basic health and function ofDNA and are apparently used to send and receive information throughout the body.As Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp discovered, each DNA molecule stores up to one thousandphotons within itself, much like a tiny fiber-optic cable.11[part0034.html#chapter001fn11] The photons zing back and forth at the speed oflight inside the molecule and are stored until they need to be used. The entireprocess has been observed in a variety of groundbreaking laboratory experiments,and we will review some of the data in this book.In 1984, Russian scientist Dr. Peter Gariaev discovered that when a DNA moleculewas placed inside a tiny quartz container, it naturally absorbed every photon inthe room.12 [part0034.html#chapter001fn12] This would be the equivalent of aperson standing in a large stadium and having every photon in the arena somehowbending directly into him or her, leaving the person’s body glowing with light,while the rest of the arena becomes completely dark. The only force that canbend light, in conventional science, is gravity, such as we see around a blackhole. Therefore, DNA appears to be generating a microgravitational effect thatattracts and captures light. Leikin, in whose experiment color-coded DNAmolecules were attracted to one another, thought electrical charges might becausing them to come together across such vast distances, but electrical chargeshave never been able to bend light as it moves through space. The only placewe’ve ever seen energetic light-bending effects is around a black hole.The really big mystery didn’t happen until Gariaev pulled his DNA out of thelittle quartz container. He thought the experiment was over and it was time topack up and go home. However, when he looked through the microscope one lasttime, he was astonished to see that the photons were still spiraling in theexact same place where the DNA had been. How could this even be possible? Ifthere was no DNA to hold the photons in place, then they should have immediatelydisappeared—but they didn’t. They stayed right where they were. Some kind offorce field—apparently a gravitational influence—was holding those photons rightwhere the DNA had just been. Gariaev and his colleagues soon called this the“DNA Phantom Effect.” I feel that this is one of the most important discoveriesin the history of science. The implications are stunning and force us tocompletely rewrite many scientific “laws.” DNA is creating an energetic forcethat absorbs photons and pulls them right into the molecule, but the DNA itselfis not needed. There is some invisible force—some wave—that seems to beattracting and holding light by itself. Once we pull the DNA away, the wave isstill there, and it still holds on to the photons it gathered.Gariaev found out that he could blast the “phantom” with supercold liquidnitrogen gas and the photons would all escape from the force field. However,within five to eight minutes, new photons would be captured and the entirephantom would reappear. No matter how many times Gariaev blasted the phantom andset the photons free, the phantom kept reappearing—for an astonishing thirtydays.13 [part0034.html#chapter001fn13] This effect cannot be explained by anyform of electromagnetic field. It’s not static electricity, it’s not a radiowave, and it’s not plasma. Gravity is the only field we know of that may be ableto do something like this. Furthermore, this would also mean that our currentunderstanding of gravity is very primitive. We know how fast objects accelerateas they fall—ten meters (32 feet) per second squared. We know that in an airlessvacuum, a feather and a brick will fall at the same speed. Now we have toconsider that gravity can have structure—on a quantum level—and this structurecan persist for at least thirty days in the same location, even with no physicalmatter in that area. This implies that gravity does not require the presence ofphysical matter to exist. Gravity is a force that permeates our entire universe.If gravity has hidden waves in it that make DNA, and DNA makes intelligent life,then gravity itself must be alive and intelligent. This is why I refer togravity as the Source Field. We do have certain ways of capturing the SourceField at work, on the quantum level—and I’ve just shared a few of them with you.Even though the DNA phantom discovery is nearly thirty years old at the time ofthis writing and has stunning implications, it has never been widely publicized.This knowledge will utterly transform our society once it becomes widelyaccepted. It also paves the way for an entirely new range of powerful healingtechnology known as energy medicine. I integrated more than a thousand academicreferences on this subject in The Source Field Investigations, which wasreleased on August 23, 2011. We got an exclusive slideshow on the HuffingtonPost that same day, which was linked on the front pages of both the “Books” andthe “Weird News” sections.14 [part0034.html#chapter001fn14] I had a budget ofonly thirteen slides, with 150 words each, to try to summarize this monster534-page encyclopedia of “sacred science” I had just constructed—which thedistinguished scholar Graham Hancock said was “magnificent.” Here is a reprintof the introduction and first five sections of the article, with a few minoredits for clarity. You will soon see that we can beam new instructions into anexisting DNA molecule and completely change its structure. Themicrogravitational forces of the wave will grab atoms inside the DNA and movethem around until they assemble into the new configuration. This is an entirelynew way of explaining the evolution of species, and the mechanism has alreadybeen proven to work in the laboratory.THE SOURCE FIELD INVESTIGATIONSAll the science needed to explain and understand the UFO phenomenon and thegreatest mysteries of ancient civilizations is revealed in The Source FieldInvestigations. Ancient prophecies foretold a coming Golden Age in our very nearfuture—and the US government may well have encoded these predictions into avariety of mysterious symbols. Antigravity, teleportation, time travel,energetic DNA evolution, and consciousness transformation could now create aworld few of us ever even dreamed of.Space, time, matter, energy, and biological life may be the results of a SourceField that is conscious and alive in its own unique way, on a scale far too vastfor the finite mind to fathom. More than a thousand different references,predominantly from mainstream scientists, make the case.WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS?Dr. William Braud is one of a variety of scientists who have performed rigorous,laboratory-controlled studies proving that mind-to-mind communication is veryreal and is repeatable in a scientific laboratory.15[part0034.html#chapter001fn15] Participants in one room were able to make theskin of another person in a completely separate room change—at a distance.Sudden surges would appear in the amount of electricity conducted through theaffected person’s skin. This change in electrical activity usually happens whenwe get excited, but in this case, the person who had the reaction did not knowthat anything was going on.16 [part0034.html#chapter001fn16] Many of theseexperiments were done in rooms shielded from all electromagnetic signals,proving this phenomenon cannot be explained by any known energy waves in theconventional spectrum.By 1929, more than 148 different cases of “multiples” had been documented inscience—where multiple scientists independently make the same breakthroughs atthe same time. The subjects in which these breakthroughs occurred includedcalculus, the theory of evolution, color photography, thermometers, telescopes,typewriters, and steamboats.17 [part0034.html#chapter001fn17] It appears thatour thoughts are not as private as we think. When we work to solve a problem, wemay be accessing a universal data bank of knowledge. The information thenappears in our minds as if it was our own unique idea. Let’s not forget thatthese 148 cases are only examples where inventors tried to patent the samethings at the same time.There is wonderful, abundant proof that extrasensory perception is a naturalgift we all possess, but these groundbreaking studies have received very littlepublicity. Could the basic energy of the cosmos be conscious in some way?IS DNA AN ENERGY WAVE THAT ASSEMBLES LIFE?In 2011, Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier demonstrated “DNA teleportation,” aphenomenon in which ordinary water molecules in a sealed test tube assembledinto DNA. A tube containing sterilized water was placed next to another tubethat contained water with trace amounts of DNA. Both tubes were electrified witha weak, seven-hertz current. Some of the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in thetube with pure sterile water transformed into DNA—by a process still unknown toWestern science.18 [part0034.html#chapter001fn18]Sir Fred Hoyle and Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe noticed that 99.9 percent of allthe dust in the galaxy had peculiar optical properties. The only material thatcould create these effects in the laboratory was freeze-dried bacteria.19[part0034.html#chapter001fn19] In 1980, Sir Hoyle said, “I suspect that thecosmic quality of microbiology will seem as obvious to future generations as theSun being the centre of our solar system seems obvious to the presentgeneration.” 20 [part0034.html#chapter001fn20]CAN DNA BE ENERGETICALLY TRANSFORMED FROM ONE SPECIES INTO ANOTHER?The agricultural division of the Ciba-Geigy corporation (now Syngenta)discovered that existing plant seeds could be transformed into extinctvarieties, simply by zapping them with a weak electrostatic current.21[part0034.html#chapter001fn21] This process generated stronger andfaster-growing wheat, extinct fern species, and tulips with thorns.22[part0034.html#chapter001fn22] Italian scientist Pier Luigi Ighina energeticallytransformed a living apricot tree into an apple tree, actually causing thefruits on the branches to metamorphose from apricots into apples in only sixteendays. Ighina also zapped a rat with DNA-wave information from a cat, and thiscaused the rat to grow a catlike tail in four days.23[part0034.html#chapter001fn23] Korean scientist Dr. Dzang Kangeng received apatent (N1828665) for a device that used microwaves to transfer the DNA-waveinformation of a duck into a pregnant mother hen.24[part0034.html#chapter001fn24] Roughly 80 percent of the hen’s eggs hatched ashalf-duck, half-chicken hybrids. Dr. Peter Gariaev zapped salamander eggs with alow-level laser and redirected the beam into frog eggs. The frog eggsexperienced a complete metamorphosis and the embryos grew into healthy adultsalamanders. They never reverted back to being frogs—nor did their offspring.25[part0034.html#chapter001fn25]IS THERE INTELLIGENT HUMAN LIFE THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY?Thanks to these and other scientific discoveries, we can now suggest that humanlife could be a galactic or even universal template, potentially appearing onevery habitable, watery planet in the galaxy, due to the quantum properties ofDNA. The majority of ancient cultures worldwide reported interactions withhuman-looking “gods” or “angels” that gave them powerful assistance—inagriculture, animal husbandry, spoken and written language, constructiontechniques, mathematics, and science, as well as spiritual teachings ofmorality, ethics, and becoming a more loving person. The majority of ancientcultures also consistently taught us that history moves in great cycles of time,whether in the Mayan calendar, the Hindu Yugas, or the Ages of the Zodiac.Highly unusual human skulls, including a series discovered in Boskop, SouthAfrica, whose brain capacity is twice that of normal humans, with large headsand small, childlike faces, have been found around the world. The skulls foundin South Africa were given highly honorable burials, as Discover magazinerevealed in 2009.26 [part0034.html#chapter001fn26] Bizarre, elongated skullshave also been discovered in Peru, Bolivia, Russia, and elsewhere—closelymatching the appearance of early Egyptian pharaohs—and some of them are still ondisplay in museums.[../images/00008.jpeg]Fig. 1 [part0006.html#l1]: Granite bust of Akhenaten and Nefertiti’s daughterMeritatenIS EVOLUTION BEING DRIVEN BY WAVES OF ENERGY IN THE GALAXY?Drs. David Raup and James Sepkoski discovered a 26-million-year cycle in theevolution of life on earth after creating the most exhaustive fossil catalogever assembled.27 [part0034.html#chapter001fn27] The data show that every 26million years, astonishing numbers of new species suddenly appear in massivebursts after millions of years with very little change. Fearing embarrassment,the researchers worked harder to eliminate the pattern, but it only becamestronger and clearer as they did more research. Recently, Drs. Robert Müller andRobert Rohde discovered an even larger 62-million-year cycle within the samedata, going back to the dawn of all complex fossil life on earth.28[part0034.html#chapter001fn28] These cyclical events may be triggered bygalactic energy waves that reprogram DNA.29 [part0034.html#chapter001fn29][../images/00009.jpeg]Fig. 2 [part0006.html#l2]: Combined graph of 26- and 62-million-year evolutioncyclesDr. William Tifft discovered concentric bands of microwave energies withingalaxies that slowly expand away from their centers.30[part0034.html#chapter001fn30] Dr. Harold Aspden’s unique physics equationssuggest that each of these microwave regions possesses different properties on aquantum level.31 [part0034.html#chapter001fn31] This gives us a measurableenergetic model that could account for the long-term cycles of evolution we seeon earth. Each zone may carry information that rewrites DNA according to agrand, intelligent pattern within the galaxy itself. Life appears to be anatural law—an “emergent phenomenon” within quantum mechanics. The universeitself is a living being. Life appears wherever and however it can throughoutthe universe. All life is periodically reprogrammed by energetic forces that canbe reproduced in a laboratory, creating continual advancements in speciesevolution throughout the universe.A CONSCIOUS UNIVERSEI do believe not only that the universe is alive, but also that it is consciousand self-aware. There is a plan and a purpose to our lives on earth that is fargreater than most of us have ever realized—and we are definitely not alone. Nordo we only have one life to live. There is undeniable scientific proof that wereincarnate again and again. We also keep moving through the same lessons in ourhistory as they repeat in incredibly precise patterns. These wars and atrocitiesneed not continue, however—they will persist only if we keep creating them, inour ignorance of the greater reality that surrounds us. The truth does notrequire any religion to appreciate; however, we may discover that the ancientspiritual traditions hold far more wisdom than most modern scientists have everbelieved. Synchronicity gives us an invitation to explore this greater reality.Synchronicity is the key that unlocks the doors to the mysteries of theuniverse. Synchronicity appears in an industrial-scale, measurable form in thecycles of history—events that keep repeating, very precisely, in units of timethat can be thousands of years in length. I became much more aware of thisphenomenon once I began studying a unique body of data known as the Law of Oneseries in 1996."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOCYCLES OF HISTORY AND THE LAW OF ONEWhat if the universe is alive? What if we are surrounded by invisible waves thatassemble DNA out of nonliving material? Could these hidden forces bereprogramming our DNA and propelling us into a new level of human evolution? Arethere certain spiritual lessons we need to learn in order to harmonize with thisevolutionary change as a planet? Are the events in world history “programmed” bya hidden intelligence to keep running us through the same set ofexperiences—until we awaken, on a collective level, and choose to stop hurtingone another? Were these cycles built to be discovered? Were they intended tohelp us realize that this collective nightmare is happening for a reason—andthat we can do something about it? Is there a lesson, a pattern, a story, inthese cycles that we are now meant to understand, collectively? Does the storyitself contain the wisdom teachings we need to pull ourselves out of this globalnightmare—on a worldwide level—and finally live in peace?As revealed in The Source Field Investigations, the evidence that we live in anorganic universe is conclusive. Now, instead of seeing life as a brief anomalythat may have occurred only on earth, in the midst of an otherwise “dead”universe, we will come to realize that the cosmos is literally teeming withlife—from single-cell microorganisms all the way up through intelligent,sentient beings like ourselves. Life also will be seen as fundamentallyenergetic in nature, first and foremost, and it does not require biologicalmaterial to exist. Once this is widely accepted, the discovery that the universeitself is alive—and intelligent—will arguably be the biggest breakthrough in thehistory of science, eclipsing even that of our realizations that the earth isround, or that the sun is the center of the solar system.Within human DNA is all the information needed to make the brain, which iscurrently believed to be the center of our conscious, thinking minds. If DNA canform in a tube of pure sterilized water, then the information that makes thatorganism conscious must exist all around us as well—much like radio waves,satellite TV signals, or broadband Internet. Consciousness and DNA arefundamentally intertwined. As groundbreaking as all of these ideas may be, thisis only the beginning of our story. In one sense, these breakthroughs are like atrail of bread crumbs that lead us into much greater mysteries.THE LAW OF ONE SERIESThis model of a living cosmos was originally found in a very unusual sourcecalled the Law of One series—five books that were allegedly obtained byintuitive means from 1981 to 1983.32 [part0034.html#chapter002fn32] The Law ofOne series consists of 106 dialogues between a credentialed physics professor,Dr. Don Elkins, and an allegedly higher source of intelligence speaking throughhis companion Carla Rueckert while she was in an unconscious trance state. JimMcCarty was also present for each session and transcribed all the tapes. ThroughCarla, Don was apparently speaking to a large group of people who were once likehumans on earth but who had since merged into a single consciousness. From abiblical perspective, they would likely be classified as seraphim orcherubim—among the most evolved of the types of angelic presences that everappeared on earth. The word angel comes from the Greek word aggelos, whichsimply means “messenger.” These people no longer had physical, flesh-and-bloodbodies as we now think of them but had long since evolved into a form of lifethat is energetic in nature.According to the Law of One series, this and other angelic groups assisted inthe creation of the major world religions, including Christianity. They neverintended to have us fight over the differences in these teachings, but now thereare 38,830 denominations of Christianity and ten thousand other religions in theworld.33 [part0034.html#chapter002fn33] The group in the Law of One series alsosaid they were members of a larger organization that was working “in service tothe One Infinite Creator.” This organization is apparently responsible forguiding, protecting, steering, and managing our collective evolution on earth.Its goal is to help us all become more aware of our true identity. The realnature of identity was given when they defined the Law of One in the very firstsession.1.6 You are every thing, every being, every emotion, every event, everysituation. You are unity. You are infinity. You are love/light, light/love. Youare. This is the Law of One.34 [part0034.html#chapter002fn34]For now, the spiritual laws these beings follow require them to remain hidden.They cannot create a grandiose, worldwide display of their presence, as freewill is a universal law they must abide by. Until we acknowledge their existenceand welcome them on a planetary level, they are not permitted to appear, astheir presence would interrupt our natural course of evolution. However,synchronicity is one of the most prevalent ways in which they are helping usgradually acclimate to their presence and to the greater reality we are livingin.As you are probably already seeing by now, any discussion of the Law of Oneseries causes the “rabbit hole” to get very deep, very quickly. By the time Ibegan studying these five books in 1996, I had three years of intensivescientific research under my belt and I immediately started making onemind-blowing connection after another. I quickly realized that the Law of Oneseries was like a real-world, literary equivalent of the Roswell crash—anartifact that appeared in our world by a mysterious process and that could thenbe taken apart, piece by piece, and studied. Massive enhancements to our scienceand technology could be made in the process. There are many people who claim tohave telepathic access to sources like this, particularly since the rise of theInternet. The vast majority of these sources contradict one another and can beeasily picked apart for obvious flaws, failed prophecies, and the like. However,in my opinion, there is no other source that goes nearly as deep or revealsnearly as much groundbreaking, provable scientific information as the Law of Onematerial. In linear terms, the Law of One was far ahead of its time.I first began studying the Law of One material in January 1996, after more thanthree years of writing down and analyzing my dreams every morning and fifteenyears of dedicated research into ancient civilizations, alternative science, andmetaphysics. The Law of One almost immediately crystallized my focus, tiedtogether everything I had read in a way I couldn’t have imagined was possible,and shaped the entire future course of my life’s work. Within less than a year,I, too, began having profound personal experiences of contact with the source ofthe words—both in dreams and in direct telepathic messages. By that point I waswell aware that there was a higher power in the universe. By inviting it tocontact me and being willing to closely follow the spiritual practices in theLaw of One series, I got results.Until then, this had been strictly an academic study, but soon I began producingpage after page of words, from a very deep level of meditation, that providedincredibly valuable spiritual guidance and could predict the future withastonishing precision. The words spoke with seemingly omniscient awareness of mydeepest physical, mental, and emotional issues and clearly showed me how to healthem. These “readings” often knew exactly what was going to happen in my futureand how I could best navigate through these events. This obviously made myresearch much more personal. I was no longer a detached third party, studyingthe fruits of contacts that had happened to other people and looking for thescientific proof to back them up. I was now experiencing similarly bizarre andwonderful events in my own life.When I first started reading the Law of One series, I would often have to spendabout forty-five minutes in intense concentration before I felt comfortableenough to turn to the next page, but I was never the least bit disappointed orbored with what I was reading. It simply took me that long to understand thewords.The Law of One series tells us that everyone on earth is ultimately sharing thesame mind—much more than we would ever dare to believe. Years later, I wouldfind impressive scientific discoveries that supported this concept. For example,a group of seven thousand people meditating on thoughts of love, peace, andhappiness were somehow able to reduce acts of terrorism, worldwide, by 72percent. The level of wars, crimes, fatalities, and economic suffering alldropped remarkably just from this very small group of people meditating,privately, in one location. This was documented in a professional, peer-reviewedscientific study, which was accepted by and published in the Journal of OffenderRehabilitation. All other factors, including cycles, trends, weather, weekends,and holidays, were ruled out.35 [part0034.html#chapter002fn35] By 1993, fiftydifferent scientific studies had demonstrated this same effect over thepreceding thirty years. The meditators improved the overall health and qualityof life for people on earth, boosted the economy, and decreased accidents,crime, war, and terrorism.36 [part0034.html#chapter002fn36] Nearly three out offour people who would normally have committed an act of violent terrorismdecided not to while these seven thousand people were at work meditating. Thesewould-be terrorists obviously had no idea that their decision to be violentcould be so profoundly influenced by others. All they knew is that they simplyfelt better and they made more positive choices. Their thoughts and feelingswere nowhere near as private as conventional science had led them to believe.In the Law of One series, we are told that the universe is one mind—that “thereis only identity”—and each of us is a perfect holographic reflection of the OneInfinite Creator. Mainstream science would have us believe that in the“beginning,” there was nothing. Simply put, nothing existed. That whole conceptalways confused me greatly. Scientists then expect us to believe that eventhough “nothing existed,” nothing exploded—and from this one explosion, all thematter and energy in the universe was created, in a single instant. The universehas apparently been spinning down to a “thermal death” ever since that first,triumphant moment. By comparison, the Law of One series teaches us that newmatter is continually being formed and both space and time are ultimatelyillusions, created solely for the evolution of consciousness.Apart from these philosophical concepts, there was a wealth of specific datapoints that had to be either right or wrong and could therefore be confirmed orrejected with further investigation. By the time I first read the series,hundreds of scientific breakthroughs had already emerged that validated the Lawof One model after its publication, and the volume of supporting evidence hassignificantly increased every year since then. The vast majority of this newdata was not yet discovered when the series was first produced. Furthermore, inthe process of writing The Source Field Investigations and integrating thirtyyears’ worth of this research into alternative science, I made many newdiscoveries that were not featured in the Law of One material but were logicalextensions of it.I also lived with the surviving founders of this five-volume series from January2003 to October 2004—Carla Rueckert, a devout Christian who verbalized the wordswhile in an unconscious trance state, and Jim McCarty, who transcribed all thedialogues between Don and the source. Their material had never gotten verypopular, at least partly due to its extreme complexity, and Jim had to mow lawnsto pay the bills. By living with Carla for nearly two years, I was able toprove, well beyond any margin of doubt, that she could not possibly have fakedthe Law of One material. Carla applauded me for deciphering many of thetechnical details that she herself had been unable to grasp. However, afterstudying this material intensely for seven years, I admittedly had gone in therewith unrealistic expectations. I believed that the person who spoke the wordswould also be an embodiment of the words, at least to some degree. I wasdefinitely looking for a hero—someone who would have glorious, superhumanqualities that I felt were lacking in myself. However, Carla had plenty of“distortions” of her own, in Law of One terms. If anyone put her on a pedestal,she would immediately kick it away—often causing embarrassment and laughter inthe process. I watched it happen several times.One of the most interesting, peculiar, and enjoyable fringe benefits of thisliving universe is that once you begin exploring its great mysteries, it maysoon reach out to you, if it hasn’t already done so. This will often occur inundeniable and fascinating ways. Many of these experiences could be classifiedas synchronicity, which we will explore in the next chapter. Every effort willbe made to avoid causing you any fear in this process, so there is no trauma.The goal is to increase your feelings of love, joy, peace, and happiness, in theultimate hope of helping you free yourself from the ongoing cycle ofreincarnation. Synchronicity also leaves room for plausible deniability, so youhave the freedom to accept or reject the message as you see fit. In Law of Oneterms, free will is the most important universal law that must be upheld withinthis loving universe. As we will explore in chapters 6 [part0015.html], 7[part0016.html], and 8 [part0017.html], the law of karma is not some mysterious,impersonal universal law; it is very actively maintained with the help of a hugevariety of nonphysical beings who work in and around the earth.SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF A CONSCIOUS COSMOSAlthough as much as 80 percent of the information in the Law of One series isphilosophical and cannot be proven, there is also an extensive body ofscientific data that supports many of its basic principles. Armed with this newscientific data, we can validate the idea that when life reaches the level of agalaxy, star, or planet, it will have all the attributes of consciousness andidentity that we have within ourselves, and much, much more. In this model,rather than detached and disconnected from the universe, we are fundamentallyintegrated with it—and our thoughts are much less private than we currentlybelieve. Dr. James Spottiswoode conducted a meta-analysis of twenty years’ worthof laboratory experiments into “anomalous cognition,” or extrasensoryperception, and found that our psychic abilities increased by over 400 percentwhen our position on earth reached a particular alignment with the center of thegalaxy—which culminated at 13:30 local sidereal time.37[part0034.html#chapter002fn37] We already saw how 7,000 people meditating couldpositively affect the majority of everyone on earth, reducing worldwide acts ofterrorism by 72 percent. Spottiswoode’s discovery suggests that our thinkingminds are directly interconnected with the galaxy itself—and may also supportthe concept that our DNA is ultimately created by a galactic intelligence. TheLaw of One series also indicates that history moves in a cyclical, not a linearfashion. Multiple references are made to a “25,000-year cycle” that is drivinghuman evolution. I was fascinated by this idea and spent many years trying tounravel what this twenty-five-thousand-year cycle is, how it appears on earth,and what we can learn from it. I still hadn’t fully solved the mystery when Iwrote The Source Field Investigations—but I was really close.We’ve already seen that the surfaces of stars may well be boiling with livingmicroorganisms that are getting thrown off into space, where they are thenfreeze-dried into galactic dust particles. If stars are forming microbes,complete with DNA, then stars might also have some form of consciousness, sincelife itself is conscious. The microbes might be only a very small part of anextremely complex life-form—much like the bacteria we find on our skin do notrepresent who we are as intelligent, self-aware organisms.Could it be possible that galaxies and stars have “personalities”? Could theyhave their own thoughts? Could they also have different thoughts in differentregions? Could these thoughts in different regions affect every life-form thatmoves through them, to varying degrees? This is exactly what the Law of Oneseries teaches—and there is very good scientific evidence to support these newideas. We’ve already discussed the 26- and 62-million-year evolution cycles inthe first chapter. We also presented evidence for a new DNA model that allowsspontaneous, energetic changes to be made to living organisms—to rewrite theirgenetic code. This is precisely how the Law of One series describes themechanism of evolution as we evolved from Neanderthal-type hominids to ourcurrent form.19.9 There was loss of the body hair, as you call it, the clothing of the bodyto protect it, the changing of the structure of the neck, jaw, and forehead inorder to allow the easier vocalization, and the larger cranial developmentcharacteristic of third-density [human] needs. This was a normaltransfiguration.38 [part0034.html#chapter002fn38]19.10 [This occurred] within a generation and one-half, as you know thesethings.39 [part0034.html#chapter002fn39]This explains why anthropologists have never been able to find a “missing link”to account for a sudden doubling in the size of the human brain. However,genetic evolution is only one very large-scale, long-term aspect of how thisliving system of celestial energy actually influences us.Is it possible, therefore, that as we drift through space, we also drift throughdifferent influences—which then directly affect how we think and feel? What ifthis were already true? What if science just hasn’t caught up to this knowledgeyet—at least not in modern times? Astrology is a robust system of scholarshipthat tells us our minds are directly affected by celestial influences; it isjust not widely accepted in our current era. The history of astrology goes backat least five thousand years, to Babylonian times. Astrology was taken seriouslyas a science by Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and PierreGassendi—all of whom were pioneers in developing modern physics and astronomy.40[part0034.html#chapter002fn40]THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIACNow, let’s visualize the earth’s 365-day orbit around the sun as a cycle. Let’ssay that the sun is generating an energy field that influences how we think andfeel. Let’s say our position in this energy field has a direct effect on ourminds and bodies. Let’s say that different areas of the sun’s energy field willmake us think and feel in different ways. Let’s say there are twelve equallyspaced regions in the sun’s energy field that we drift through in each earthcycle, or year. Let’s say that each of these regions has a unique “personality”that causes us to feel a certain way. This would then explain the twelve signsof the zodiac.[../images/00010.gif]Fig. 3 [part0006.html#l3]: Division of Sun’s energy field into twelve Ages ofthe ZodiacSkeptics are quick to point out that being born under a certain sign does notguarantee a certain type of personality in any scientifically provable way.41[part0034.html#chapter002fn41] However, matching up a particular sign to aparticular personality type is only “newspaper astrology,” which was invented byR. H. Naylor in 1930.42 [part0034.html#chapter002fn42] Naylor was a Britishastrologer who made a stunningly accurate prediction in his second newspapercolumn. He warned that British aircraft might be in danger, and on that sameday, the British airship R101 crashed in northern France. This catapulted Naylorinto the public eye virtually overnight. The resulting hunger for a regularnewspaper column led him to pioneer a highly simplified method, where he wrotepersonalized descriptions for each sign of the zodiac. To this day, manymagazines and almost all newspapers feature Naylor-style astrological forecastsfor their readers.The real science is far more complex than that. In fact, modern astrologersbelieve that Naylor’s “newspaper astrology” has done incredible damage to theirfield, since the twelve zones around the sun we call “signs” are only one of aseries of competing influences.43 [part0034.html#chapter002fn43] If there wereno planets involved, the power of these twelve zones would probably be muchstronger.ENERGETIC INFLUENCES OF PLANETS AND MOONSInterestingly, Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, the father of “synchronicity” and anassociate of Dr. Sigmund Freud, revealed that the meanings of the twelve signsof the zodiac are not arbitrary—they represent an encyclopedic knowledge ofhuman psychology. “Astrology represents the summation of all the psychologicalknowledge of antiquity.”44 [part0034.html#chapter002fn44] Each sign representsan archetype—a specific type of personality—which we will learn about later inthis book. These patterns are written into the mind of the galaxy itself,according to the Law of One series.If the signs of astrology have an effect, then what about planets and moons?Let’s begin with our closest neighbor. The idea that the moon’s position has aneffect on us is ancient and is the source of the word lunatic. University ofMiami psychologist Arnold Lieber studied the homicide data in Miami-Dade Countyover a fifteen-year period—1,887 murders—looking for a lunar effect. Dr. Lieber,whose results were published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, found thatthe murder rate did rise and fall with the phases of the moon, very steadily,throughout the entire period he studied.45 [part0034.html#chapter002fn45] Staffmembers at the Toledo Blade newspaper did a computer analysis of all CuyahogaCounty police reports from the beginning of 1999 through the end of 2001—120,000in total—and found that there were 5.5 percent more violent crimes and 4.6percent more property crimes on nights when there was a full moon.46[part0034.html#chapter002fn46] Additionally, burglaries of unoccupied homes roseby 16 percent, resisting arrest rose by 34 percent, and aggravated assault wentup by 35 percent.47 [part0034.html#chapter002fn47] In 2007, British policeannounced that they had found similar results in their own studies of crime anddecided to deploy more officers to counter the effect.48[part0034.html#chapter002fn48] Inspector Andy Parr said, “I would be interestedin approaching universities and seeing if any of their postgraduates would beinterested in looking into it further. This could be helpful to us.” 49[part0034.html#chapter002fn49][../images/00011.jpeg]Fig. 4 [part0006.html#l4]: Dr. Carl JungIf the moon has a statistically significant effect on violent crime, thenperhaps the positions of the planets affect how we think and feel as well.Beginning in 1949, Michel Gauquelin analyzed the astrology of thousands ofnotable historical figures and found that certain types of people were more aptto be born with planets in key positions.50 [part0034.html#chapter002fn50]Gauquelin started out as a total skeptic and was quite surprised to discoverthat the real-world data thoroughly contradicted his original assumptions.Gauquelin’s most well-known finding is the Mars effect, in which sportschampions and military personnel are much more likely to have Mars appear justabove the eastern horizon at their time of birth, which is known as the “rising”point, or directly overhead, which is known as the “culminating” or “midheaven”point. Michel and his wife, Françoise, analyzed more than sixty thousand peoplein eleven different professions and found strong correlations with fivedifferent planets.51 [part0034.html#chapter002fn51] Mercury influencespoliticians and writers; Venus influences painters and musicians; Marsinfluences doctors, athletes, military personnel, executives, and scientists;Jupiter influences actors, military personnel, executives, politicians,journalists, and playwrights; and Saturn influences doctors and scientists.Certain planets were negatively correlated with certain professions aswell—meaning that these planets were farther away from the rising or culminatingpoints than usual in these people. Mercury is farther away from athletes; Marsis farther away from writers, painters, and musicians; Jupiter is farther awayfrom doctors and scientists; and Saturn is farther away from actors,journalists, writers, and painters.52 [part0034.html#chapter002fn52] Theseresults were originally found in French data, and the Gauquelins later provedthat the data was valid for American and other European professionals as well.53[part0034.html#chapter002fn53]After Michel Gauquelin’s death in 1991, his findings were further replicated bySuitbert Ertel and Arto Müller using a data set of members of the FrenchAcadémie Nationale de Médecine, Italian writers, and German physicians.54[part0034.html#chapter002fn54] Furthermore, three different skeptic groupsgathered their own data on athletes and validated the Mars effect—in some casesbegrudgingly.55 [part0034.html#chapter002fn55] After fifty years, no skepticshave been able to definitively debunk Gauquelin’s findings.56[part0034.html#chapter002fn56] In fact, in their 1996 book, The Tenacious MarsEffect, Suitbert Ertel and Kenneth Irving revealed that the scientific evidencehas proven to be even stronger than Gauquelin originally found.57[part0034.html#chapter002fn57]Science doesn’t matter when people refuse to believe certain facts. If they wantto deny that something is happening, for whatever reason, it can be utterlyimpossible to convince them otherwise. Skeptics often used hostile and dubiousmethods to attempt to debunk Gauquelin’s findings about the effects of theplanets on human personality and behavior.58 [part0034.html#chapter002fn58] It’shuman nature to fiercely attack anything that makes us feel threatened. Theshame of having passionately believed something that turns out to be incorrectcan be almost impossible to face—particularly if you’ve paid tens of thousandsof dollars and worked for many years to acquire that knowledge. However,attacking new discoveries is the exact opposite of true scientific inquiry,which teaches us to follow the data—no matter how unfamiliar or bizarre thetrail may be.CELESTIAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESSIn The Source Field Investigations, I presented comprehensive scientificevidence that our collective experiences may be influenced by certainastrophysical factors. For example, the Russian scientist Aleksandr Tchijevskyconclusively demonstrated that sunspot cycles have a powerful effect on the ebband flow of civilization. Tchijevsky studied the level of conflict and activityin seventy-two different countries over almost twenty-five hundred years—from500 B.C. to A.D. 1922. The study included wars, revolutions, riots, economicupsets, expeditions, and migrations. The severity of these events was alsoranked by how many people were involved, giving us a measurable scale ofmagnitude. To his amazement, “Tchijevsky found that fully 80 percent of the mostsignificant events occurred during the 5 years of maximum sunspot activity.”59[part0034.html#chapter002fn59] The sunspot cycle typically takes about elevenyears, but its length is not always consistent. Nonetheless, Tchijevsky foundthat whenever solar activity was at its maximum, fully 80 percent of all themost significant events on earth took place. The increased solar energy outputduring the peak of this cycle seems to make us feel restless on a mass,worldwide level.I removed the pages on the cycles of history in The Source Field Investigationsin part because I hadn’t fully solved the mystery of what was causing them.There were some clues in the Law of One series, but Don Elkins certainly did notask every question that was raised by the discussions he was having. A workableexplanation for these cycles did not appear until August 2012, when I realizedthat all of these longer-term cycles of history could be modeled by our sunorbiting another star in a 25,920-year cycle—forming what scientists call abinary solar system. I was already familiar with the work of Walter Cruttenden,who made a strong scientific case that we were indeed living in a binary solarsystem. In fact, Cruttenden had already sent me a copy of his book for review—Ijust hadn’t taken the time to study it before then. Now I opened the book andfound concrete evidence that our entire solar system could be orbiting aroundanother star adjacent to the sun. As it turned out, this phenomenon perfectlyexplained several passages in the Law of One series that had remained mysteriousuntil then.Our neighboring star may be a brown dwarf, which means it might not be easilyvisible to our telescopes even at such a relatively close range. Ancient mysteryschools often spoke of a nearby “Black Sun,” which has a very strong influenceon us, which we will discuss in Part 4 [part0027.html]. This nearly invisiblestar does have measurable effects—including gravitational pull. Certainscientists have already speculated that there must be a large gravitating bodyoutside our solar system. Cruttenden’s book masterfully spelled out how thegravitational attraction of this neighboring star could be pulling our earth’saxis through the slow, 25,920-year wobble that astronomers now call the“precession of the equinoxes.” This gradual, counter-rotating movement in theearth could now be explained by our solar system orbiting this companion starover 25,920 years. Interestingly, this same cycle was historically called the“Great Year.”Historians Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend demonstrated that morethan thirty ancient cultures, worldwide, had complex, technical informationabout this cycle “encoded” into their mythologies.60[part0034.html#chapter002fn60] This appeared to be the result of a focused,worldwide effort and was certainly not a coincidence. I found out about thismystery in 1995, when reading Fingerprints of the Gods, by Graham Hancock,61[part0034.html#chapter002fn61] and spent many years trying to understand why theancients were so interested in this long-term cycle. When we divide this25,920-year cycle into twelve sections, we get the twelve Ages of the Zodiac—at2,160 years each. As of approximately December 21, 2012—the end of the Mayancalendar—we have now apparently moved out of the Age of Pisces and into the Ageof Aquarius. This 25,920-year cycle of “precession” is almost certainly what theLaw of One series referred to as the “25,000-year cycle,” which the source saidwas directing human evolution. It appears that ancient cultures were contacted,worldwide, and this key piece of information was then encoded into their mythsby the unified group of angelic or extraterrestrial humans known as the“Confederation” in the Law of One series. This ancient mystery was apparentlyplanted to help us rediscover the truth in today’s world with the help of moderntechnology. Since just about any information could have been encoded intoancient myths, the “Great Year” was obviously seen to be of monumentalimportance for us to understand.Now, after many years of thinking about this problem, I had finally found asystem that could physically model the forces that may be causing history torepeat itself. This system fits in perfectly with the scientific argument thatwe live in an intelligent universe—and that stars and planets are exertinginfluences on our minds and bodies. In this case, our sun’s companion star isgenerating energy fields that affect our thoughts and behaviors as we movethrough them—in surprisingly specific ways. These energy fields seem to carrythe necessary codes to rewrite our DNA as well—making us more intelligent andmore evolved, in even cycles of time.SOLID SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR A TWENTY-FIVE-THOUSAND-YEAR EVOLUTION CYCLEThere is solid scientific evidence to support the Law of One concept that humanevolution is moving in roughly twenty-five-thousand-year cycles. First, theNeanderthals died out—or were transformed—somewhere between twenty-eightthousand and twenty-four thousand years ago.62 [part0034.html#chapter002fn62] Ifwe then go back to fifty thousand years ago, we see an equally massive change.Before then, no one on earth used any tools that were more sophisticated than acrude stone blade.63 [part0034.html#chapter002fn63] However, according toanthropologist John Fleagle, beginning fifty thousand years ago, people all overthe world suddenly began making musical instruments, artwork, religiouscarvings, harpoons, arrowheads, needles, and beaded jewelry.64[part0034.html#chapter002fn64] Furthermore, giant mammals that were dangerous tohumans experienced a mass extinction fifty thousand years ago—on every continentexcept Africa.65 [part0034.html#chapter002fn65] The various human groups thatsuddenly became a lot more creative were obviously not in contact with oneanother, but everyone in the world seemed to experience a massive IQ boost atthe same time.THE FOURTH-DENSITY SHIFTThis same IQ-boosting phenomenon is happening again and is visible in a varietyof provable ways, as we will discuss. Nonetheless, we may still be in for quitea surprise. The Law of One series indicates that we will soon make a transitioninto an entirely new level of human evolution that is called “fourth density,”as opposed to our current “third-density” level. Once we survey the statementsmade in the Law of One about what fourth-density humans are like, it will beobvious that they are describing an ascended being—much like Jesus allegedlyappeared after the resurrection. There are thousands of documented cases ofadvanced meditators who have made this evolutionary leap into what the Tibetanscall the “Rainbow Body.” Since the twenty-five-thousand-year cycle apparentlypropels us into this change, on a worldwide level, and it also drives us throughrepeating cycles of history, it definitely appears that identifying andunderstanding this phenomenon is of critical importance.It is very interesting to discover that every cycle of history divides perfectlyinto this “Great Year,” as Michèl Helmer and François Masson revealed. Thebinary solar system model finally provided a working explanation for how and whythese cycles are happening, through simple geometry caused by the energy fieldsof our companion star. One basic historical cycle is the twelve Ages of theZodiac, each of which is 2,160 years long. There are also twelve signs of thezodiac within a single earth year. Now, with the binary solar system model, Irealized that these twelve Ages of the Zodiac could be caused by another star,with the same type of energy fields that our sun is generating to create thetwelve signs of the zodiac in traditional astrology. The only real differencebetween these two zodiac cycles might be the length of time it takes our planetto complete one orbit around each of these stars. On the interstellar scale,there are no other planets or large bodies out there to compete with ourcompanion star’s energy fields, so the effects of these twelve 2,160-year zonescould be much stronger than the traditional signs of the zodiac.CONVENTIONAL EXAMPLES OF CYCLES IN HISTORYIf you were to ask the average American whether any events have mysteriouslyrepeated in exact cycles throughout history, most of them, if they even had anyidea that such a phenomenon might occur, would probably think of only two commonand controversial examples, which revolve around the deaths of Americanpresidents Lincoln and Kennedy and Tecumseh’s Curse. Neither of these cases isnecessarily “real,” but both are certainly interesting. Skeptics automaticallydiscount these phenomena, but by the time you are finished reading this book,you may have a different opinion. Time may not be as linear as we think; it mayactually be cyclical. The events that happen in one cycle may continue toinfluence our thoughts and behaviors in later cycles, in seemingly mysteriousways.THE LINCOLN-KENNEDY CONNECTIONFirst of all, there are strange connections between the lives and deaths ofAmerican presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. Certain specific eventshappened in both of their lives, and the lives of those around them, in ahundred-year cycle. Let’s not forget that Nikolai Morozov, the original Russianpioneer scientist who first discovered historical cycles in the modern era,noticed that there were astonishing similarities between the historical accountsof Hebrew kings in the Old Testament and those of Roman kings more than athousand years later. In the case of Lincoln and Kennedy, the events thatconnect them are not always exactly one hundred years apart, but there areseveral key similarities. For example, Lincoln was elected in 1860 and Kennedyin 1960. Both were elected to the House of Representatives (1846 and 1946). Bothwere runners-up for the vice presidential nomination (in 1856 and 1956). Bothleaders had vice presidents—and successors—named Johnson (born in 1808 and1908). Both presidents were concerned about the rights of black Americans. OnJanuary 1, 1863, Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation became law, ending slavery:“All persons held as slaves…shall be…forever free;…the Executive government ofthe United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, willrecognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.”66[part0034.html#chapter002fn66]One hundred years and six months later, on June 11, 1963, Kennedy addressed thenation in a pivotal speech about civil rights. The John F. Kennedy PresidentialLibrary and Museum website explains that in this speech, “The President asksCongress to enact legislation protecting all Americans’ voting rights, legalstanding, educational opportunities, and access to public facilities, butrecognizes that legislation alone cannot solve the country’s problems concerningrace relations.”67 [part0034.html#chapter002fn67] This directly paved the wayfor Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech on August 28,1963—addressing the largest crowd to ever have marched on the US Capitol inWashington, DC. In the first eight sentences of his speech, King made fully fivedifferent references to the one hundred years that had elapsed since Lincoln’sEmancipation Proclamation. Four of the first eight sentences began with thewords “one hundred years later.”68 [part0034.html#chapter002fn68]From this point forward, in order to better understand the connections betweenLincoln and Kennedy, we must explore the history of the Federal Reserve, whichis responsible for printing and circulating American currency at the time ofthis writing in April 2013. The term Federal Reserve is confusing, as the Fed isnot actually a part of the federal government of the United States. As more andmore people are becoming aware, the Fed is a private consortium of internationalbankers. Due to perpetual insolvency and financial crises, the United Stateshanded over the control and management of its financial system to thisinternational group of bankers in 1913. The US Treasury has allowed the FederalReserve bankers to circulate their Federal Reserve notes—that is, the USdollar—as legal tender ever since.69 [part0034.html#chapter002fn69] According toSenator Ron Paul, who has pursued this investigation for more than thirty years,the Federal Reserve is the ultimate adversary in our story. Senator Paul is oneof many influential figures who believe that the Federal Reserve has beenresponsible for many of America’s greatest problems in the last one hundredyears.The Federal Reserve is the chief culprit behind the economic crisis. Itsunchecked power to create endless amounts of money out of thin air brought usthe boom and bust cycle, and causes one financial bubble after another. Sincethe Fed’s creation in 1913, the dollar has lost more than 96% of its value—andby recklessly inflating the money supply, the Fed continues to distort interestrates, and intentionally erodes the value of the dollar.70[part0034.html#chapter002fn70]Both Lincoln and Kennedy tried to wrestle the American currency away from theprivate banking groups who founded the Federal Reserve and back into the handsof the US Treasury.71 [part0034.html#chapter002fn71] Although these bankers hadnot formed the Federal Reserve during the time of Lincoln, the sameintergenerational dynasties were at work in the 1800s. Lincoln authorized theprinting of “greenbacks” from the US Treasury, not backed by gold or silver, onFebruary 25, 1862, in the First Legal Tender Act.72[part0034.html#chapter002fn72] This allowed for unprecedented economic growth inthe United States that could not be controlled and taxed by foreign banks, whichhad wanted to collect tax rates of 24 to 36 percent due to their financing ofAmerican infrastructure and war debts. Lincoln’s move to centralize Americancurrency within the US Treasury greatly angered them.73[part0034.html#chapter002fn73] Nearly one hundred years later, Kennedy haltedall sales of silver from the US Treasury, on November 28, 1961.74[part0034.html#chapter002fn74] Until then, the storehouse of US Treasury silverwas being very rapidly sold off at seriously cheap prices. Kennedy then draftedHouse Resolution 5389 to authorize the printing of “silver certificates” fromthe US Treasury; these certificates would be an American currency totallyoutside the control of the Federal Reserve. Kennedy’s groundbreaking bill passedthe House on April 10, 1963,75 [part0034.html#chapter002fn75] and the Senate onMay 23, 1963.76 [part0034.html#chapter002fn76] Kennedy signed this bill into lawon June 4, 1963, and issued Executive Order 11,110 that same day.77[part0034.html#chapter002fn77] Executive Order 11,110 authorized the secretaryof the treasury to issue silver certificates on his own—without any input oroversight from the Federal Reserve. Although the halting of all sales of silverfrom the Treasury in 1961 originally seemed to favor the Federal Reserve, theTreasury silver provided Kennedy with the collateral he needed to print money,which was completely outside the Fed’s control.78 [part0034.html#chapter002fn78]Within a hundred-year cycle, Lincoln’s printing of greenbacks on February 25,1862, and Kennedy’s halting of silver sales on November 28, 1961, overlap byless than three months.Lincoln was shot to death by an assassin on April 14, 1865, and Kennedy wasassassinated on November 22, 1963—within less than a year and a half of eachother in a hundred-year cycle. Both of these heroic presidents were shot in thehead, in the presence of their wives, on a Friday—which may or may not besignificant but is often cited in articles comparing the two. Many independentresearchers have speculated that Lincoln and Kennedy were both assassinatedbecause they opposed the foreign bankers who pooled their resources to becomethe Federal Reserve in 1913.79 [part0034.html#chapter002fn79] Lincoln was shotin Ford’s Theatre, and Kennedy was shot in a Lincoln automobile, which was madeby Ford Motor Company. Both presidents have seven-letter last names, and bothassassins have three-part names with fifteen letters—John Wilkes Booth and LeeHarvey Oswald. Other connections have been presented that turned out to befalse, or at least weak, causing skeptics to discount the entire story as an“urban legend.”80 [part0034.html#chapter002fn80]TECUMSEH’S CURSEThen we have Tecumseh’s Curse. In 1809, William Henry Harrison was the governorof the Indiana Territory as the United States continued expanding westward. Inthe Treaty of Fort Wayne, Harrison persuaded several Native American tribes tohand over their greatest wealth to the US government—namely, huge tracts ofland. Harrison convinced certain warring tribes to turn against one another andaccept very low payouts for their lands. In some cases, more powerful tribessuch as the Wea were bribed to coerce less powerful tribes, such as theKickapoo, into accepting the treaty, and this coercion could easily haveincluded threats, violence, terrorism, and murder. The Shawnee leader Tecumsehsoon felt they had all been tricked, that the wealth of their lands had beenseized through a variety of unethical tactics. Tecumseh ultimately worked withhis brother Tenskwatawa to create an alliance of Native American tribes thatresisted the westward expansion of the United States. Tenskwatawa was aspiritual leader more than a military man and was known as “the Prophet.”81[part0034.html#chapter002fn81] Tenskwatawa led his brother’s army into battleagainst Harrison’s forces in Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811, while Tecumseh wasoff recruiting new allies.82 [part0034.html#chapter002fn82] Ultimately theNative Americans lost the war because of a lack of ammunition.Harrison became president in 1840. By that point, many Native Americans feltthat they had gotten a very bad deal. They had given away their greatesttreasure, and whatever payments they had received in exchange had long sincebeen forgotten. The Prophet made a public curse against Harrison and all futureAmerican presidents as an act of revenge for the seizure of their land.83[part0034.html#chapter002fn83] Tenskwatawa said that every president electedduring a year that ended in a zero, just as Harrison had been, would die inoffice.84 [part0034.html#chapter002fn84] This would create a twenty-year cycleif it actually worked—and many thousands of people believed in it. Harrison diedof pneumonia in 1841, while in office, seemingly verifying that the curse wasworking. Lincoln was next. The pattern continued, like clockwork, straightthrough until Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush—both of whom survivedassassination attempts. The presidents who were elected during the years in thiscurse and died in office were William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840; AbrahamLincoln, elected in 1860; James A. Garfield, elected in 1880; William McKinley,elected in 1900; Warren G. Harding, elected in 1920; Franklin D. Roosevelt,elected in 1940; and John F. Kennedy, elected in 1960. In fact, the onlypresident who died in office and was not elected during one of the “cursed”years was Zachary Taylor, who won the election in 1848 and died in 1850.In 1998, I was given a yellowing, typed, unpublished manuscript from 1980 thatgave many astonishing examples of history repeating itself—far beyond theLincoln-Kennedy connection or Tecumseh’s Curse. All of these cycles were exactsubdivisions of 25,920 years, which the author could not explain. Nonetheless,the author, François Masson, boldly predicted the collapse of the Soviet Unionusing the science of cycles. He even got the year right—1991—but his manuscriptwas completed in 1980. It wasn’t until I was developing The Source FieldInvestigations in 2010 that I went back to this original body of data to studyit in more detail and to see if these cycles were still working. I was veryimpressed by what I found. There were incredibly specific connections betweenhistorical events separated by hundreds or even thousands of years. I quicklyrealized that 9/11 occurred within only days of a similar sequence of events in1462, thirty years before Columbus ever sailed to America.In late November 2011, shortly after The Source Field Investigations came out, Ihad a rash of overconfidence and signed a new book deal—promising that I wouldgenerate an entirely new manuscript out of the deleted chapters from The SourceField Investigations in three months’ time. I assured the publisher that thisnew book would be ready to go by the end of February 2012. My original workingtitle was The Hidden Architecture of Time. Brian Tart, the president of DuttonBooks, suggested that I call it The Synchronicity Key instead. This titleallowed the book to discuss other subjects besides the cycles of history. Iliked that idea—and I accepted the new title.Little did I know that I was about to come face-to-face with what may be themost powerful and negative force on earth today. Nor did I realize that I wouldbe given an opportunity to directly take part in its defeat. Before we fill inthe details on this intriguing story and the people behind it, we will explorethe history and science of synchronicity and how it had become such a part of mylife that I had gained the confidence to stand up to this Global Adversary."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEWHAT IS SYNCHRONICITY?So what, exactly, is synchronicity? The term synchronicity, as it applies topsychology, was coined by Dr. Carl Gustav Jung in the 1920s.85[part0034.html#chapter003fn85] Jung was a Swiss psychologist who studied underthe legendary pioneer Dr. Sigmund Freud and ultimately broke away from him overa basic difference of opinion. Dr. Freud’s perspective was much moreconventional, in the sense that he did not believe in Jung’s concept of a“collective unconscious”—a fundamental connectedness that we all share withinthe mind, such as in dreams. The dictionary definition of synchronicity, as itapplies to psychology, is “the simultaneous occurrence of causally unrelatedevents—and the belief that the simultaneity has meaning beyond merecoincidence.”86 [part0034.html#chapter003fn86] In plain language, synchronicityis a mysterious event in which two or more things happen at the same time thatseem directly related to each other, even though this would normally appear tobe impossible. Jung had discussed this concept since the early 1920s, but he didnot formalize his thoughts into a lecture until 1951.87[part0034.html#chapter003fn87] Then, in 1952, Jung published his defining work,Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle, found in Volume 8 of hisCollected Works.88 [part0034.html#chapter003fn88] Jung believed thatsynchronicity was a key element of spiritual awakening. He felt thatsynchronicity shifted us out of egocentric thinking into a viewpoint where wesee ourselves as far more interconnected with one another.Let’s not forget that Jung was rubbing elbows with the finest scientists of hisday, including Albert Einstein and Wolfgang Pauli, a Nobel laureate who was oneof the founding fathers of quantum physics. Pauli had lengthy correspondencewith other luminaries in the field, including Nobel prizewinners Niels Bohr andWerner Heisenberg. Pauli was directly or indirectly responsible for many quantumphysics breakthroughs, including the Pauli exclusion principle, in which heproved that two electrons cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Jungfelt that synchronicity could be explained scientifically, through applyingEinstein’s relativity theory and the quantum mechanics theory Pauli and otherswere developing. Pauli was fascinated by the concept of synchronicity,absolutely believed it was true, and published his own paper about it in thesame book with Jung in 1952.89 [part0034.html#chapter003fn89] By this point,Pauli had already won the Nobel Prize in 1945; he went on to win two otherhighly prestigious physics awards after this—the Matteucci Medal in 1956 and theMax Planck Medal in 1958.Jung’s most classic personal example of synchronicity can be found in paragraph843 of his epic work from 1952. I first read this when I was in college, as partof a homework assignment for a class called Psychology of Perception, and I wasvery impressed.A young woman I was treating had, at a critical moment, a dream in which she wasgiven a golden scarab. While she was telling me this dream, I sat with my backto the closed window. Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, like a gentle tapping.I turned round and saw a flying insect knocking against the window-pane from theoutside. I opened the window and caught the creature in the air as it flew in.It was the nearest analogy to a golden scarab one finds in our latitudes, ascarabaeid beetle, the common rose-chafer (Cetonia aurata), which, contrary toits usual habits, had evidently felt the urge to get into a dark room at thisparticular moment. I must admit that nothing like it ever happened to me beforeor since.90 [part0034.html#chapter003fn90]Although Pauli was considered “the conscience of physics”—the ultimate skepticwho picked apart everyone else’s work for flaws—powerful synchronicity washappening around him as well. There were many documented occasions in whichPauli’s colleagues would be working on an experiment, and when Pauli visitedthem to fact-check it himself, their equipment would self-destruct as soon as hewalked in the room. This was a very common occurrence that came to be known asthe “Pauli effect.”91 [part0034.html#chapter003fn91] Noted physicist Otto Stern,who won the Nobel Prize in 1943, politely but firmly banned Pauli from visitinghis laboratory in Hamburg—even though they were friends—due to the stronglikelihood that Pauli would create expensive and time-consuming equipmentfailures simply by showing up.92 [part0034.html#chapter003fn92] Pauli wasfascinated by this effect and wrote about it in Jung’s classic 1952 volume onsynchronicity.93 [part0034.html#chapter003fn93]Jung had a heart attack in 1944, which resulted in a near-death experience, orNDE. (We will review the science behind NDEs in chapter 8 [part0017.html].) InJung’s case, he found himself in the presence of beautiful light, and he hadmany insights that shaped his ideas of the collective unconscious,synchronicity, and archetypes. Jung now felt that certain personality types werebasic elements within the mind of the universe, and he believed that astrologywas a valid form of synchronicity. After having this powerful experience, Jungcommitted to finding the scientific proof that astrology could be a genuinescience. He studied the birth charts of 483 married couples and looked for thethree conjunctions that were associated with a happy partnership in traditionalastrology. He also mixed up the charts into 31,737 other random combinations.Jung found that the “happy relationship” conjunctions appeared three times moreoften in the combined charts of married couples than in those of random pairedindividuals.94 [part0034.html#chapter003fn94] Furthermore, the pattern that wasconsidered the most conducive to marriage occurred the most frequently in thecouples’ charts, and the pattern that was least conducive to marriage occurredthe least frequently. Jung calculated the odds of this occurring by randomchance as 1 in 62.5 million.95 [part0034.html#chapter003fn95]Jung defined synchronicity as a “meaningful coincidence”—a mysterioussynchronizing of seemingly unrelated events. These experiences politely shatteryour most cherished and rigorously held belief systems about the “real world.”In my own personal experience, there is no chemical and no other event that cangive you such a staggering high—in body, mind, and spirit—as an experience withsynchronicity. Once it happens, it’s real. It’s Now. It’s awesome. In the mostdramatic cases, you can barely breathe. Your head threatens to explode in pureecstatic bliss. Everything seems to sparkle. Reality crystallizes into a hiddenorder that should not—cannot—exist. And yet it does. The world you so flagrantlytook for granted is now nothing more than a shadow—a shadow of a hidden,majestic Truth you may never dare to grasp.DRAMATIC PERSONAL EXAMPLES OF SYNCHRONICITYIt was December 21, 1992—twenty years to the day before the Mayan calendar enddate—when I came home and told my old high school friends I had been completelysober for the last three months. I voluntarily chose to put myself throughrecovery shortly after starting my sophomore year of college and was now writingmy dreams down every morning. In addition to giving me guidance that helped mestay clean, all sorts of amazing things were happening in these dreams,including cosmic messages of hope and specific prophecies of the future thatwere then coming true. My friends glared at me through the stench of old beerand cigarette smoke as I told them that I now believed I was here for aspiritual purpose and that I would help many people. Stony silence erupted intoa full-scale verbal assault as soon as I finished. Apparently I was going tofight my way into a dead-end job, marry a vicious and unattractive woman, slavemy life away for kids who would only hate me more and more as they got older,and ultimately die alone in a nursing home surrounded by staff who could barelywait for their next cigarette break as I groaned for their attention.Was this it? Was this life? Was I crazy? Were they right? How could they be socruel—after all the years we’d shared together? I could barely even hear whatthey were saying as I observed this withering assault of sarcasm andhumiliation. I warned them several times that I could not tolerate this, but onand on they went. Finally, I stood up in the middle of a sentence and walked outthe front door—without verbalizing any anger or hostility—never to return. Oneof them reconnected with me as I was finishing this book—for the first time intwenty years—and we had a good conversation that helped us arrive at a point ofmutual forgiveness.After a ten-minute walk, I stood at the crossroads between my friend’s streetand mine. I was utterly devastated, fighting back tears. I felt inspired to holdmy arms out to the sky and speak.You…whoever or whatever you are. I know you’re out there. I know you can hearme. I know I’m here for a reason. My life has a purpose. You’ve shown me that. Ibelieve you—and I trust you. I know I’m not crazy. I have made my choice. I willdedicate my life to helping others who are suffering. I thank you for helpingme—and now I want to help you.I was staring at a small patch of stars in the night sky as these words coursedthrough my mind. Right as I said “I want to help you,” a huge, yellow-whitemeteor streaked directly across the area I was looking at. It was real. It wasabsolute. It was undeniable. It was astonishing. It was the biggest, brightestmeteor I had ever seen, even after many sleepless nights of sitting out in alawn chair as a boy, watching the occasional flickerings of the Perseids orLeonids. A tremendous surge of ecstatic energy roared up through my body, and Ifelt a magnificent spiritual presence. Tears of joy streamed down my face. Ispoke to the universe—and got an answer. It was, and still is, one of the mostprofound events in my life.A STAGGERING WEALTH OF NUMERICAL SYNCHRONICITYAfter this defining event, the genie burst out of the bottle and synchronicitystarted happening like crazy. I was now seeing repeating patterns of numberseverywhere—such as on digital clocks—at seemingly random moments. Thisphenomenon had happened only once before, while I was a junior in high school,but now it was happening almost every day, and frequently several times a day. Iwould often be sitting and reading about paranormal subjects—a favorite topic ofmine—and suddenly be inspired to look at the clock, after an hour or more ofunbroken focus on the book. I would then see repeating patterns such as 11:11,12:12, 3:33, 5:55, or other combinations—1:11, 2:22, and 4:44. In other cases Iwould wake right up out of a very intense dream, look at the clock, and see oneof these patterns.I started counting the seconds after this happened and found that I usually wasseeing these patterns immediately after the clock had changed. I also sawrepeating digits appearing on wristwatches, television screens, scoreboards, andlicense plates. Generally I did not worry about the meanings of the numbersthemselves. Instead, these events seemed to give instant feedback on whatever Ihad just been thinking about—telling me I was on the right track, letting meknow that these thoughts were beneficial and progressive for my soul. Thisphenomenon always seemed to happen right as I was having a positive, lovingthought. If I started moving into a negative place, the synchronicities wouldstop—or I would see the same patterns, but at exactly one minute before thesynchronous mark. I also noticed that my diet seemed to determine how often thiswould happen. The cleaner and healthier I ate, the more synchronicity Ireceived. The more I ate processed food, dairy, white flour, and refined sugar,the harder it was to remember my dreams—and the less synchronicity I wouldexperience throughout the day.Believe me, I wasn’t constantly checking clocks and looking for this to happen.If I did try to do that, it never seemed to work. Instead, whenever I was leastexpecting it, bam!—there it was: 3:33, 12:12, 5:55, 11:11. It happened over andover again, and I would often laugh out loud in amazement. I am well aware thatsome people will immediately discount all of this as coincidence. They will sayit is unreasonable, ridiculous, and foolish. Most people do not realize that ourmodern theories of synchronicity were developed by the same scientists whomskeptics often use to discredit them. However, simply becoming aware ofsynchronicity can make it start happening a lot more often. In that sense, thisbook is the Synchronicity Key, because instead of just reading this book, youare now directly participating in its main subject. The conscious universe maywell decide that you are now ready to know who and what you really are. Manyhundreds of readers of The Source Field Investigations reported stunningsynchronicities while they were reading the book—and now we are focusing evenmore strongly on that subject.TWO BULLETS!After my parents divorced in the summer after my fifth-grade year, I startedself-medicating with food. I quickly became the fat kid in school during a timewhen most students were at their normal weight. This alone made me veryunpopular. I was also one of the smartest kids in school and a complete pacifistwho would do just about anything to avoid hurting someone else’s feelings. Theoverall combination of body fat, intelligence, sensitivity, and pacifism made methe ideal target for bullying and humiliation. I still have a dent in myforehead from the kid who threw a ball of solid ice into my face fromthirty-five feet away with the speed and accuracy of a baseball pitcher. Thepain was incredible—and the kid laughed sardonically as I cried and tried tostand up. I also have a circular scar along the edge of my left ear from a tentpole that sliced right through the cartilage, like a cookie cutter. The pole cuta perfect, one-centimeter-wide ring after my friend threw it at me as a joke. Helaughed at me and had his dog chase me around the yard while I ran, screaming inagony and holding my ear. He didn’t realize what had happened until he noticedhis dog licking the blood off of my hand after I had collapsed in tears. Thisaccident required emergency plastic surgery, and I had to wear a large whitegauze bandage on my ear for months. Several kids in school called me“Vinnie”—referring to how Vincent Van Gogh supposedly cut his own ear off andmailed it to a woman. I quickly grew my hair out to hide the scar.By the year 1989, I was sixteen years old, seriously overweight—225 pounds atfive feet nine inches tall—and completely tired of being bullied and teased. Iplunged myself into a grindingly strict and very dangerous diet, drinking a canof cold V8 vegetable juice for breakfast and nothing but water between classes.By the end of the year, without really doing any more exercise, I had becomeeighty-five pounds lighter, but the psychological scars of the bullying stayedwith me.Five years later, in July 1994, I was a college student and was working on amusic album with my best friend, Jude, in his apartment. I was thin andmoderately athletic, and I had a year and a half of clean time, but I’d neverhad a girlfriend. I still didn’t have the courage to ask a girl out on a dateafter so many years of threats, humiliation, and physical injuries from otherkids. I was struggling to fall asleep as I lay there on the floor on a cold,dirty air mattress, staring at the ceiling. Jude was sleeping off to my right,two feet above the ground, in his normal bed. Jude’s apartment was far too smallfor me to have a separate room to sleep in, as his cousin Reuben was crashed outon the couch in the other room.As I lay there, I was having a weird, waking dream. This monstrous, exaggeratedfat man—an obvious caricature of how I used to look—was chasing me, trying tokill me. I had a gun in my belt as I ran. I knew I could shoot this man and putan end to my misery, once and for all, but for some reason I wouldn’t do it. Ididn’t want to hurt him, even though he was definitely trying to hurt me. Thishorrible battle raged on, and I ran for all I was worth as I faded in and out ofconsciousness. Suddenly, Jude’s sleeping body turned in the bed next to me, andin an agitated, distant voice, he said, “Shoot him…Just shoot him. Two bullets!”I was galvanized. Instantaneously I was wide-awake. I couldn’t breathe. I staredat the ceiling. Everything seemed to shimmer with life. I felt like my body waslevitating. My mind was crowded with millions of thoughts—and yet I wasecstatic. I seriously wanted to wake Jude up and tell him what had justhappened, but I felt like if I did, we would never get back to sleep, and Idesperately needed rest. Somehow I managed to wait until the next morning totell him, and we were both dazzled by the implications.The dream seemed to be saying that I was still being ruled by my “shadow self.”Even after losing all that weight and being completely sober for more than ayear and a half, I was still too insecure to ask a girl out. I was so afraid ofbeing rejected that it was much easier to avoid the whole problem entirely. Atleast that way I would never get my feelings hurt, and I wouldn’t have to feellike that bullied kid again. Now, on some level, Jude had been seeing my dreamright as it was happening. I was running, this huge man was chasing me, I waschoosing not to shoot him even though I had a gun, and Jude was watching thewhole thing. This strongly suggested that these events had not happened in justmy own mind—the dream had occurred in a shared space. Later I would discoverthat in 1973, Dr. Montague Ullman and Dr. Stanley Krippner published acomprehensive paper revealing that ordinary people could concentrate on specificimages while awake, and send them to people who were dreaming. The dreamers thenexperienced symbols and events in their dreams that were directly related to thesenders’ message. This fascinating effect was repeated with over one hundredparticipants.96 [part0034.html#chapter003fn96] The dream seemed to be telling meto let go of that pain, hurt, fear, and buried shame—to symbolically kill offthat old, tortured part of myself once and for all. That would mean choosing tolove myself for who I was, just the way I was, regardless of what other peoplethought about me. Two months later, I opened my heart to Yumi, a beautifulJapanese girl, in my senior year of college, and we fell in love. She was sofascinated by my blue eyes that I finally let her touch my eyeball one day toconfirm it was real.HUMAN NATUREBarely a week after the “two bullets” incident—on July 17, 1994—I was still onthe summer break between my junior and senior years of college, and one and ahalf years sober. My parents had insisted I take a job during every summer breaksince my second year of high school. The pain of disagreeing with them was worsethan riding my bicycle in the rain or taking the public bus to work. I was quiteaccustomed to the sharp odors and prying looks of homeless people and to the menin the ties looking right through me as they glided by the bus stop. Now myfather had loaned me $2,000 to buy my own car, and here it was. I painstakinglyinstalled a new Radio Shack stereo system in the beat-up old red station wagon,which was big enough to hold all of my and Jude’s musical equipment, includingmy entire drum kit. Fake wood panels lined the sides, and I had already cleanedand detailed the interior of the car so thoroughly that it looked brand-newinside. Michael Jackson sang away in my mind as I worked on the stereo system insilence:“Why? Why? Tell ’em that it’s human nature. Why? Why…did she do me that way?”Finally, the moment of truth. I connected the last speaker wire to the stereo,sealed it off with a sticky black strip of electrician’s tape, shoved it backinto the dashboard, and hit the ON button. The radio roared to life.Staggeringly, the exact same song I had been hearing came blasting out.Michael’s vocals were perfectly synchronized with the very same moment they hadreached in my mind; the song wasn’t off by even a fraction of a second. I didnot have any dental fillings, so I could not have pulled in radio stationsthrough my teeth. Nor was anyone else playing music in the area. I had beenhearing the song for at least twenty minutes before the radio came on. I spentmonths trying to figure out how this one event could have happened—particularlyin a universe that is supposed to be limited by the constraints of linear timeand by minds that are supposed to be separate from the greater environmentaround them.Synchronicity is fickle. It doesn’t always work. It’s not there to pleasure yourego on demand. Once you become aware of the possibilities that exist and havehad your first taste, you can beg, cry, long for it, and beseech the greatforces of the universe to give you another chance—but synchronicity makes itsown rules. Time is irrelevant. The next event could be ten years or ten minutesaway. I had very few experiences of synchronicity until after I completelystopped using any and all mind-altering chemicals—including caffeine, nicotine,and alcohol—and started cleaning up my diet. I also came to learn that thegreater meaning of a synchronicity may not always be apparent when it firsthappens.I drove the car to my new job for the first time, and it was wonderful. Atwo-hour trek, requiring three different buses, was now shaved down to athirty-five-minute drive. However, at the end of the day, an enormous cloud ofsmoke belched out of the car when I started it—quickly engulfing a familywalking behind me—and the smoke just kept on coming. I was devastated. A newfriend I met at work came to the rescue, and she gave me a ride home. The carwas towed all the way back to a garage in my hometown, which was not cheap, andit was declared dead on arrival. Head gasket. The whole engine block wascracked. No way out. I was terrified that the elderly couple who had sold it tome would keep the money. I felt so lost, so alone, so confused. My fathercouldn’t afford to give me another loan, and it would take me anotheryear—because I was a full-time student—to earn enough money to pay back theoriginal loan and try again. Yet I couldn’t deny the miracle that had happened.Were they really going to take the money and run? Was this the “human nature”Michael Jackson had sung about? Had those lyrics given me a sinister warningabout how they were going to “do me that way”? Or could I trust in the goodvibes they’d shared with me when I bought it and get my money back? After twodays of grinding suspense, I nearly cried with relief when I found out theywould take the car back and return the money. They honestly did not know the carwas about to die. The synchronicity was a message that all was well, before Ieven knew there was going to be a problem. I was indeed being guided andprotected by mysterious, unseen forces that could influence human nature—andmake miracles happen. Linear time did not seem to pose any barrier to whoever orwhatever had done this.It is impossible to predict where or when synchronicity will occur. Then one dayit does—and in that brief, tantalizing moment, you have touched infinity. Youhave tasted that which cannot be tasted. You catch a fleeting glimpse of thatwhich cannot be seen—and yet it is just as real as the eyes that gaze upon it,the ears that hear it, and the mind that revels in it. Now there is no place tohide. That lonely, tortured soul that believes in suffering, pain, andseparation is isolated and cornered. It fights valiantly to maintain itsrigorous enchantment with despair and misery and its addiction to drama andvictimhood—but after enough synchronicity, it simply cannot dare to claim anyfurther relevance. Now the lies are stripped away. The truth is revealed. Theworld we’ve been taught to believe in is a sham. The universe is vastly moremysterious and wonderful than we assume—and we are loved more than we could everpossibly imagine.A LITTLE BIRD TOLD MESynchronicity often emerges from the depths of despair as a hidden connectionbetween seemingly unrelated events. We all have to go through what people intwelve-step support groups would call “the bottom” at various times.Psychoanalysts who follow the work of Dr. Carl Jung call it the “dark night ofthe soul.” When we go through this experience, it seems like it’s the end of theworld, but we can learn to see it as only one part of a much greater series ofevents in our own evolution. This experience also happens on a collective,planetary level as we go through the great, repeating cycles of wars, disasters,and epic changes. Seemingly random thoughts, decisions, and actions, throughouthistory, are actually following a hidden script. Ultimately we all know thescript, and we constantly seek out creative works that keep telling us the samestory, as we will see. Dr. Jung found that there were a series of symbols andexperiences that we all encounter, often in dreams. These symbols andexperiences remain consistent, regardless of where we are from—historically andgeographically. They are called archetypes, and they range from the mostdifficult and horrible experiences we will ever endure to the mostbreathtakingly transcendent moments of clarity and triumph. Together, theycreate the grand story of enlightenment, which Joseph Campbell called the Hero’sJourney.I have had hundreds, if not thousands, of ego-crushing experiences as I traveledalong my own Hero’s Journey to greater wisdom and understanding. I used to bethat guy who wanted other people to take care of him and was terrified of adultresponsibility. By the time I graduated from college with a bachelor of artsdegree in psychology, I had experienced many mind-blowing synchronicities—but Ihad also lived on campus all four years, straight out of high school. I hadnever paid rent or bought my own food from a store on any consistent basis, as Ialways had a meal plan and I made sure I never ran over budget on my meal card.I was absolutely terrified of graduation, as I knew it was almost impossible toget a well-paying job in New York State with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.There were far too many unknown variables. I knew many students who lived offcampus and were buying food and paying rent with very little money. Many of themwere living on instant ramen noodles, spaghetti, and peanut butter and jellysandwiches—and they lived in a constant state of anxiety.I remember the moment in August 1995, right after graduation, when I absolutelyknew, without question, that my mother was indeed kicking me out of the houseI’d grown up in all my life. She’d gotten tough. She wouldn’t take no for ananswer. There was nothing I could do. There was no turning back. Now I had tothrow myself to the wolves of the corporate world and try to survive onDepression-level wages. I already knew there were powerful and sinister forcesthat were systematically destroying the wealth of the middle and lower classes.My mind had been blown wide open in 1992 by a sociology class calledContemporary Social Issues, in which our professor openly spoke about howAmerican corporations had systematically financed and supported Hitler’s rise topower. The elite had declared full-scale war on the public—and the media was nottelling us the truth. The romance of a good job, a home mortgage, and asingle-wage family was almost impossible to achieve with a four-year degree inpsychology in New York State, but now my mother was forcing me out of the nest.Years of anxiety welled up into a horrible, vomitous, all-consuming fear. Ifound myself sprawled out on the grass in the backyard, sobbing uncontrollably.I was so terrified I didn’t even know if I could stand up.A small red-breasted robin soon flew down and landed next to me, barely two feetaway from my face. It turned its little head to look at me—and it beganspeaking, in its own chirping voice. I felt so alone, so terrified and confused,and yet here was this little bird, which stayed there for well over ten minutes,seemingly doing its best to cheer me up and console me. This only made me cryeven louder and sob even more—at first—but it was real. It was happening. Birdscan certainly love people as domesticated pets, but this robin was completelywild. Here I was, lying in the grass and the dirt, feeling utterly devastated,and this little being that I normally wouldn’t even expect to think or havefeelings was right there. The bird seemed to be distinctly aware that I wascrying and was doing its best to help me feel like I was not alone.Did that little bird know cold? Absolutely. Did that little bird know hunger?Certainly. Did that little bird know what it was like to be alone? To be scared?Undoubtedly. Its own mother had once thrown it out of the nest and demanded thatit survive alone. It had since done its best to hunt insects and worms, toshelter itself from the cold and the rain, to find a mate, to build its ownnest, and to start a family. It was certainly capable of feeling love—for otherbirds, for example—and pain, if, for instance, one of those birds died, or whenit had to throw its own babies out of the nest once it was time for them to growup. And now, as much as I tried to stay in my own little world of misery anddisaster, I simply could not deny what was happening. This little bird wasstanding right there in front of me—and it cared about me. It wanted me to feelbetter. I could easily have assumed I was going crazy, but this was reallyhappening.For more than ten minutes it spoke to me in chirps and whistles, bowing its headin different ways, moving its little legs and wings, and doing its best to letme know it cared. However, the whole experience was so profound, so bizarre, andso inexplicable that I soon started crying again. I knew this bird would go backto being a bird, disappearing into the faceless and unthinking world of nature.I would have to go on alone in a harsh and uncompromising world. I feltextremely vulnerable. Once the bird realized it had done all it could do for me,it flew off—seemingly in frustration—and again I was alone. However, my tearsquickly turned to amazement and disbelief at what had just happened. I pickedmyself up off the ground, went inside, and started making calls to see if Icould move back to my old college town and line up a job. Within less than aweek, I had found a place to live—and I landed a job within twenty-four hours ofmy arrival.Synchronicity can take on many forms, and as I explain in my Access Your HigherSelf video series, you can also “encode” synchronicity.97[part0034.html#chapter003fn97] This means that once you decide to see a certainevent or symbol as meaningful, messages can then be communicated to you thisway. Many people have a favorite number that starts appearing in a variety ofdifferent places, seemingly at random. Others may choose to see a coin on theground as their message. You may decide to grab a book, particularly aninspirational title, relax your mind as much as possible, ask a question, andthen open to a particular page and read the answer. Living creatures withsymbolic importance can appear—such as Jung’s example of the scarab beetle, orshamanic totems such as the hawk, owl, deer, or coyote. You may feel a suddenrush of energy in a particular part of your body such as the lower abdomen, theheart, or the interior of the head. You may get a ringing in your left or rightear. You may also feel a sudden, stabbing pain in some part of your body—likeyou are being pricked by a needle—but there is no apparent reason for it. Ofcourse, telepathic events can be classified as synchronicity as well. You findyourself thinking about someone—and then the phone rings and it’s them, or youbump into them at the store.Skeptical people will almost always start picking apart a synchronicitystory—coming up with anything they can think of to explain it away ascoincidence. It can be extremely frustrating to try to share these stories withsomeone who insists that you are lying to them or that there must be somemundane “scientific” explanation for it. Of course, not all of these experienceswill be genuine synchronicities, but the more you open your mind and heart, themore likely they are to happen. Remind your skeptics that synchronicity wasactively being discussed by some of the finest scientific minds of the twentiethcentury, including Albert Einstein, key founders of quantum mechanics, and CarlJung. I’ve personally witnessed hundreds of cases in which skeptical peopleimmediately dismiss their own synchronicities and never look back. In somecases, their level of denial is so blatant that all you can do is laugh. Theyare actually insulted if you try to suggest that they just experienced aparanormal event and can even become quite angry with you. However, if you dodecide to ask, “What if?,” you may well be surprised at how quicklysynchronicity will start happening. This is when, as Jung said, you begin tohave a spiritual awakening and are introduced to a greater vision of theuniverse.Synchronicity and intuition were very helpful tools in the investigations of mytwo published books. Dreams often fed me specific information that later couldbe verified with a quick Internet search. There were hundreds of instances inwhich I was searching for one subject online, and then another subject I wasmuch more interested in popped up—after it seemed like I could not find anyinformation on it, no matter how hard I looked. There are so many stories likethis that I could fill twenty books’ worth of pages explaining them and stillcover only the basics. So let’s start asking more of the questions thatsynchronicity and my study of the Law of One series were leading me to find theproof for.What if the cosmos is a living, conscious being? What if space, time, matter,energy, and biological life are the body of this vast organism? What if theultimate purpose of life is to realize that we are all one—perfect reflectionsof this single, vast identity? What if everything in the universe is consciousand alive, to varying degrees—even the lowliest gas, dust, and rocks ofinterstellar space? What if the basic laws of quantum mechanics create DNA andbiological life—and the human form is quite common throughout the universe?[../images/00012.jpeg]Fig. 5 [part0006.html#l5]: Micro-gravitational fields may construct DNA frominanimate matter.What if we are all experiencing a deliberately designed amnesia about ourdeepest, truest identity—but it fades away more and more as we continueevolving? Could gentleness, kindness, patience, love, acceptance, andforgiveness be the keys that bring us into the greatest harmony with our trueidentity? Is this conscious universe sending us messages, throughsynchronicity—bizarre events most dismiss as coincidence—as it seeks to help usachieve our highest evolutionary potential? Could it be possible to use the keysof science to unlock these great mysteries—and prove, beyond any reasonabledoubt, that they are true?ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE FULL EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENTIn The Source Field Investigations, I combined thirty years’ worth of extensiveresearch to answer many of the greatest mysteries of the universe and presentedmore than a thousand academic references to establish the case. However, I havesince realized that presenting facts alone is not sufficient. In order to trulyknow and understand how the universe operates, we have to elevate our studiesbeyond the level of thoughts and feelings and into the arena of direct, personalexperiences. This is where synchronicity becomes the key that unlocks thegreatest mysteries of the universe.Feelings and thoughts are not our enemies. There is nothing wrong with wantingto feel good, and there is nothing wrong with using our thoughts to contemplatethe great mysteries and attempt to solve them. However, the ancient spiritualteachings have always told us that the truth can be reached only when we quietthe mind, open the heart, and let our intuition flow through the deep relaxationof the meditative state. Once we create this loving space within our minds andhearts, we open the door for synchronicity to appear. People who seek only tofeel good might never experience synchronicity. Others who believe the mind isin control and that it can solve any and all problems may be far too stubborn toallow synchronicity into their lives. Nonetheless, by surrendering our burdensand relaxing into the now—this very moment—we can gain answers that areotherwise impossible to think and impossible to feel. Here’s a Law of One quoteon this same subject that jumped out at me when I first read it in 1996:17.2 Enlightenment is of the moment. It is an opening to intelligent infinity.It can only be accomplished by the self, for the self. Another self cannotteach/learn enlightenment, but only teach/learn information, inspiration, or asharing of love, of mystery, of the unknown. [This] makes the other-self reachout, and begin the seeking process that ends in a moment—but who can know whenan entity will open the gate to the present?98 [part0034.html#chapter003fn98]Millions and millions of people are now having experiences that cannot fit intothe “box” of what we collectively think and believe. Dr. Jung described thevisit of the scarab beetle to his office as a once-in-a-lifetime event, but nowit seems like more and more events of this quality are happening to ordinarypeople on a regular basis. Hundreds of letters pour into my website each andevery day, many of them describing staggering events that defy everything weused to take for granted.Synchronicity forces you to ask painful questions. It opens you up to thepossibility that the worldview articulated by most scientists is largely, if notcompletely, incorrect and that we live in a greater spiritual reality that isonly barely understood at this time. By the time I was a college student,synchronicity had already started happening so frequently—and in suchastonishing ways—that I was absolutely compelled to find out what was going onand what it really meant for me—and the world. Our single biggest blind spot, asa civilization, may well be our inability to accept this greater reality, inwhich human life could be multidimensional.The concept of “me” is very personal and very precious. Once synchronicitystarts happening to you, then you have to ask, “Who is doing it?” Is it you, onsome level that you are not consciously aware of? Do you have a “Higher Self”that is coordinating the seemingly random events that happen in your life,behind the scenes? Death may seem like an impossible boundary, seemingly acomplete loss of all consciousness, all existence, all awareness that there everwas, is, or will be a universe. The idea that life is eternal and that therecould be another “me” out there—if not many of them—is almost beyondimagination. What if you do have more than one identity, more than one consciousawareness, guiding the events that happen in your life—for a hidden spiritualpurpose? What if this concept is only a stepping-stone to an even greatermystery? The Law of One series tells us that there is only identity. Everyliving being is ultimately using the same consciousness to think, feel, and act.We are all one. Individuality is an illusion—and was designed so that thecreator of the universe could experience itself. Without free will and apparentindividuality, there would be no opportunity for us to forget who we really are.If we automatically had full access to universal consciousness, life wouldquickly become dull and boring. Our “forgetfulness” gives us a story—a quest. Itgives us something to grow for, something to strive for, across many lifetimes.Furthermore, the law of free will is a universal standard—and it paves the wayfor some people to become highly negative, manipulative, controlling, andviolent. Although these people can and do create terrible difficulties, theirbehavior also gives us a strong incentive to want to grow and evolve, relievesuffering, and search for deeper meaning. Obviously, this concept of “oneness”can never be proven—it is only a philosophical argument, not a scientific one.However, a variety of scientific data points do suggest the universe is alive,and where science stops, synchronicity begins.Some people refuse to believe in synchronicity but are extremely knowledgeableabout the negative forces that seem to be manipulating and controlling politics,finance, and media for their own ends. Is this all just a conspiracy theory, oris there something more to it? My own investigations demonstrated that there isindeed a Global Adversary. I believe that the only way we can heal our planet isto release the fear and directly confront the shadowy groups of people who areterrorizing and manipulating us. Without the power of synchronicity occurring sooften in my life, I would probably never have been brave enough to take on thisquest and provide investigative and media support for an alliance of more than160 nations that are seeking to promote real, lasting peace in this world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURUNDERSTANDING THE SOCIOPATHMost of us naturally want to believe that everyone is kindhearted andconsiderate of others, and has at least predominantly positive intentions. Wewant to believe that our governments and financial systems are fair andequitable, and aside from a certain amount of greed and corruption, they arebasically trustworthy and responsible. On a global level, we are increasinglyawakening to the fact that some people can be very negative in their consciousfocus—and they may also have formed shadowy, elite groups that have manipulatedpolitics, finance, and media for generations. On April 2, 2013, a survey byPublic Policy Polling, a top American organization analyzing political trends,revealed that “28 percent of [American] voters believe a secretive power elitewith a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through anauthoritarian world government, or New World Order.” This included thirty-eightpercent of all Republican/Romney voters.99 [part0034.html#chapter004fn99] Ifalmost one-third of the American public is willing to tell an anonymous strangeron the phone that they believe a dangerous, elite group like this really doesexist, we are no longer dealing with a “fringe” subject. Thousands of hours ofacademic research on this subject since 1992 have convinced me that a shadowygroup like this does exist—and must be stopped.On November 23, 2011—just days before I legally agreed to write TheSynchronicity Key—an incredible lawsuit emerged that was a bold and direct actof war against many top global players, including some of the internationalbankers who formed the Federal Reserve. A fifty-seven-nation alliance,headquartered in Southeast Asia, was seeking the return of a massive amount ofwealth, mostly in gold, that they felt had been stolen from them and put on“deposit” with the Federal Reserve.100 [part0034.html#chapter004fn100] Thisalliance has now expanded to more than 160 countries as of April 2013. As aresult of being an increasingly visible public figure since I launched my ownwebsite in 1999, I have gained the trust and confidence of a group of patriotic,high-level insiders who have access to classified information, and want torestore freedom and peace on earth. According to these insiders, this 160-nationalliance is supported by a significant majority of the US military, who swore anoath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against allenemies, foreign and domestic. I was told that certain branches of the USmilitary were 100 percent in support of exposing how the Federal Reserve bankershad infiltrated government and politics in our modern world.On April 25, 2013, the ugly truth became even more apparent as another massivefinancial scandal leaked into public view—revealed through the braveinvestigative journalism of Matt Taibbi with Rolling Stone magazine.Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of theRothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology.You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise iscorrect: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when aseries of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector,suggesting the world’s largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, justabout everything.You may have heard of the Libor scandal, in which at least three—and perhaps asmany as 16—of the name-brand too-big-to-fail banks have been manipulating globalinterest rates, in the process messing around with the prices of upward of $500trillion (that’s trillion, with a “t”) worth of financial instruments. When thatsprawling con burst into public view last year, it was easily the biggestfinancial scandal in history—MIT professor Andrew Lo even said it “dwarfs byorders of magnitude any financial scam in the history of markets.”That was bad enough, but now Libor may have a twin brother…. It should surpriseno one that among the players implicated in this scheme…are the samemegabanks—including Barclays, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and the RoyalBank of Scotland—that serve on the Libor panel that sets global interest rates.In fact, in recent years many of these banks have already paidmultimillion-dollar settlements for anti-competitive manipulation of one form oranother…. The only reason this problem has not received the attention itdeserves is because the scale of it is so enormous that ordinary people simplycannot see it.101 [part0034.html#chapter004fn101]A war like this could not be fought by conventional means, as these powerfulbanks have almost limitless financial resources to fight back with. The lawsuitwas one key part of a much larger operation the alliance was conducting tolegally and financially block the adversary from being able to do harm, whilesystematically exposing its greatest secrets at the same time. This lawsuit wasfiled two hundred years and sixteen days after the Prophet’s alliance of NativeAmerican tribes attacked Harrison’s forces in Tippecanoe, on November 7,1811—which I did not realize until I was writing this chapter of the book. Inthe Battle of Tippecanoe, back in 1811, the Native Americans were demanding thereturn of massive amounts of land they felt had been stolen from them. In 2011,the alliance was seeking the return of massive amounts of gold they felt hadbeen stolen from them. Again, these two events were only sixteen days apartwithin two turns of a hundred-year cycle—or ten turns of a twenty-year cycle.Whether the initiative will succeed in this cycle or fall prey to the sameweaknesses and failures that occurred in the previous cycle remains to be seenat the time of this writing.Again—this battle had to be fought through multiple, nonlethal means, includinghacking and deleting bank accounts, filing key lawsuits, exposing corruption,blocking the inflow of money, and threatening key members with public exposure,thus forcing them to peacefully step down and resign. An internationalbusinessman named Neil Keenan filed this groundbreaking lawsuit on November 23,2011—on behalf of the Asian members of the alliance. This was a direct attackagainst financial tyranny, in the interest of peace and freedom for everyone—andwas deliberately timed to coincide with the forty-eight-year anniversary ofKennedy’s assassination. I wrote a detailed criticism of this lawsuit three daysafter it appeared and was very surprised when the alliance contacted me directlyto provide further evidence. One thing the alliance told me was that Kennedy’smove to print silver certificates, outside of Federal Reserve control, wasplanned out with Indonesian president Sukarno to help restore the USConstitution, and was apparently the main reason Kennedy was assassinated in1963.Beginning on December 1, 2011, I was given fascinating inside information by thealliance, much of which could be proven. This included a treasure trove ofhundreds of original documents and photographs.102[part0034.html#chapter004fn102] The problem was this: Whether or not this storywas true, it was considered so dangerous to investigate, so highly classified,and so complicated that no one else in the public eye was willing or able towrite it up. The government leaders and officials within the alliance had beentold that their entire family tree would be tortured and killed if they stood upto this Global Adversary. As those shocking emails first came rolling in, I hadno idea that I was about to get drawn into writing an entire book’s worth ofmaterial on the subject of the Global Adversary. I never took a single penny ofmoney from any person or group involved in the operation, in order to remaintruly independent, so no one could ask me for a favor later on. I had no idea,at the time, that the difficulty and deadly seriousness of this investigationwould distract me from finishing The Synchronicity Key for more than a year—butthis did seem like a small price to pay for freedom.Although the whole idea of a Global Adversary might have been written off ascrazy by most people, I had been tracking it ever since my college class in 1992had revealed the truth—and now the lawsuit and the documents were very real. Irealized that if the alliance’s plans to expose corruption and change the worldwere successful, this could become the mother of all historical events. Ratherthan just observing the cycles of history, I had the opportunity to jump rightinto the global Wheel of Karma myself. I could now directly assist aninternational alliance—featuring a majority of the largest countries in theworld—in fighting the globalist bankers who had seized control of several topWestern financial systems. I knew that the ageless wisdom behind the Wheel ofKarma tells us that if we learn the lessons these cycles of boom and bust areteaching us, we can have the wheel reach the top without having to repeat thesame sequence of misery and pain. Three of my all-time favorite Law of Onequotes explain this very well.17.20 In forgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of action—or what you callkarma.103 [part0034.html#chapter004fn103]18.12 Forgiveness of other-self is forgiveness of self. An understanding of thisinsists upon full forgiveness upon the conscious level of self and other-self,for they are one. A full forgiveness is thus impossible without the inclusion ofself.104 [part0034.html#chapter004fn104]1.9 The distinction between yourself and others is not visible to us. We do notconsider that a separation exists between…the distortion which you project as apersonality and the distortion which you project as an other personality.105[part0034.html#chapter004fn105]In The Source Field Investigations, I presented many instances of “suppressed”scientific information—including free-energy technology, gravity shielding,teleportation, and energy medicine. Whether by collective ignorance ordeliberate design, these world-changing discoveries never received any publicityin the media—which meant that very few people knew about them. I had felt allalong that the ancient vision of a Golden Age could not be fully realized in ourpresent world. There was far too much institutional corruption and pressure tomaintain the status quo, from the oil companies, for example, which definitelydid not want free energy.In 1997, the Institute for New Energy revealed that “the US Patent Office hasclassified over 3,000 patent devices or applications under the secrecy order,Title 35, US Code (1952) Sections 181–188.”106 [part0034.html#chapter004fn106]By the end of fiscal year 2010, the number of suppressed patents had expanded to5,135 inventions—according to the Federation of American Scientists. Any solarcell with greater than 20 percent efficiency, or any power system that is morethan 70 to 80 percent efficient at converting energy, is automatically targetedfor “review and possible restriction.”107 [part0034.html#chapter004fn107] AfterNeil Keenan’s lawsuit was filed in the Southern District Court of New York onNovember 23, 2011, and the alliance began sending me documents on December 1,2011, I wrote my first large investigation on the subject, entitled “Confirmed:The Trillion-Dollar Lawsuit that Could End Financial Tyranny.”108[part0034.html#chapter004fn108]As I documented in a variety of long and complex articles on my website, DivineCosmos, I spent many years researching these subjects—and as I became morepublic I had ultimately developed contacts with a variety of people who hadaccess to highly classified information. Anytime I caught someone knowinglylying to me or trying to manipulate me, I cut off the contact and worked onlywith people who seemed to genuinely have humanity’s best interests at heart.Once I knew the right questions to ask, various insiders repeatedly confirmedthat what the alliance was telling me was true. There was indeed one greatsecret—more highly classified and jealously guarded than all others in modernhistory…including the UFO subject.THE PATH OF SEPARATIONOrdinary people could not hold a secret like this. Telling such incredibly vastlies would utterly ruin their lives, leaving them so plagued with anxiety thatthey would eventually break down and either tell the truth or commit suicide.However, about 1 percent of the people in our world are sociopaths.109[part0034.html#chapter004fn109] Humanity as a whole is only just beginning tounderstand that there really are people out there who think, feel, and behavethis way. Breaking through the denial is a very important step for our healingon a collective level. Sociopaths honestly do not think they are doing anythingwrong—and in Law of One terms, they are practicing the path of “service toself,” also known as the path of separation.36.14 We remind you that the negative path is one of separation. What is thefirst separation? The self from the self.110 [part0034.html#chapter004fn110]In the very beginning of chapter 1 [part0009.html], I gave a summary of howpeople who are “negatively polarized” tend to think, feel, and act—and now wewill examine it more thoroughly. The Law of One series made clear analogiesbetween the positive and negative paths.19.17 Some love the light. Some love the darkness. It is a matter of the uniqueand infinitely various Creator choosing and playing among its experiences, as achild upon a picnic. Some enjoy the picnic and find the sun beautiful, the fooddelicious, the games refreshing, and glow with the joy of creation. Some findthe night delicious—their picnic being pain, difficulty, sufferings of others,and the examination of the perversities of nature.111[part0034.html#chapter004fn111]80.15 The service-to-self adept will satisfy itself with the shadows and,grasping the light of day, will toss back the head in grim laughter—preferringthe darkness.112 [part0034.html#chapter004fn112]EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE TO GO POSITIVE TO STAY ALIVEAnother very important data point in the Law of One series is that an entity cango only so far on the negative path before it has to go positive and fullyintegrate a love, forgiveness, and appreciation of all others. Otherwise, itwill completely disintegrate into pure energy and cease to exist, through aprocess called “spiritual entropy.” In the Law of One cosmology, the livinguniverse divided itself into seven major levels, or “densities,” in order tocreate a comprehensive system of soul evolution. It can take many millions ofyears in our linear-time terms to complete this course. The visible-lightspectrum of seven colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—isapparently intended to serve as a mirror of this greater structure. Each ofthese levels represents a plane of existence populated with its own forms oflife. We are connected to each of these energy levels through what the Hinduscall chakras—energy centers that move up from the base of the spine to the topof the head. We are currently at third density—the yellow, solar-plexuslevel—and are moving into fourth density, which is the green ray, or heartchakra, level. Importantly, no negative beings have ever been able to make itpast the beginning of sixth density, located at the pineal-gland center in themiddle of the brain. Nonetheless, all souls must still reach and master seventhdensity before they can fully reunify with the Creator.36.15 The sixth-density negative entity is extremely wise. It observes thespiritual entropy occurring [i.e., the disintegration of its own soul] due tothe lack of ability to express the unity of sixth density. Thus, loving theCreator and realizing at some point that the Creator is not only self butother-self as self, this entity consciously chooses an instantaneous energyreorientation—so that it may continue its evolution.113[part0034.html#chapter004fn113]36.12 Negatively oriented [entities] have a difficulty which to our knowledgehas never been overcome, for after [reaching a level of evolution known as]fifth-density graduation, wisdom is available but must be matched with an equalamount of love. This love/light is very, very difficult to achieve in unity whenfollowing the negative path—and during the earlier part of the sixth density,society complexes of the negative orientation will choose to release thepotential, and leap into the sixth-density positive.114[part0034.html#chapter004fn114]47.5 The positive/negative polarity is a thing which will, at the sixth level,simply become history.115 [part0034.html#chapter004fn115]In the greater sense, there is no polarity; the universe itself is much morepositive than negative in its overall orientation. By the time a fourth, fifthor sixth-density negative entity is ready to go positive, it has paid so heavilyfor the negative karma it has created that it has been restored to a perfectbalance—and no further negative karma is necessary. This is an important point.Negative entities are not at all exempt from the law of karma. Everything theydo to others will be returned to them in some equally powerful form. Thisprocess will be deeply analyzed in chapters 6 [part0015.html], 7[part0016.html], and 8 [part0017.html].EXPOSING THE SOCIOPATHPsychologists refer to this strongly negative personality type as a “psychopath”or “sociopath.” The people in this category have almost completely turned offtheir empathy and care for others, or at least those outside their chosen group.They usually have pain and trauma that runs so deep that they no longer careabout other people’s feelings and in fact gain great pleasure from manipulatingand controlling them. They are capable of committing strongly criminal acts withno remorse. They are often highly self-involved, have elaborate, impenetrabledefense mechanisms, believe themselves to be superior to others, and feelentitled to many benefits and privileges that others do not enjoy. They may alsobe highly charismatic, extroverted, and attractive to others. Many people do notnotice the negative side of their personalities at first, since these traits areoften very well hidden. Sociopaths are also in a constant fight against boredomand seek thrills whenever and however possible. In many cases, power over othersbecomes their ultimate drug of choice—and the more of it they get, the more theywant, because nothing ever satisfies the hunger inside. Serial killers, forexample, get such a high from taking the life of another human being that theybecome compelled to do it again and again, even if they are well aware that theycould get caught. Of course, most sociopaths are not actually murderers. Theydrain the lives of others more slowly. At their core, they are deeply depressedand miserable and are willing to risk their own lives, or even end their lives,for the next thrill.Interestingly, some professional astrologers are able to identify serial killersby known configurations that appear in their birth charts. Carolyn Reynolds, awell-known astrologer, was handed twenty astrological charts by the producers ofthe television program Unsolved Mysteries. The producers included the charts offour serial killers within this set of twenty—Jeffrey Dahmer, David “Son of Sam”Berkowitz, David “the Night Stalker” Ramirez, and Ed Kemper. Without knowing theidentities of the people in these charts or having ever studied their astrologybefore, Carolyn Reynolds was able to identify all four of them as potentialserial killers.116 [part0034.html#chapter004fn116] Edna Rowland, anotherprofessional astrologer, was involved in a similar experiment and successfullyidentified six other serial killers within a larger group of random birthcharts, none of which she had ever seen before. The results were published inDestined for Murder: Profiles of Six Serial Killers with AstrologicalCommentary.117 [part0034.html#chapter004fn117]Sociopaths are the most extreme examples of people who tend toward the negativepath. As Dale Carnegie documented in his 1937 classic How to Win Friends andInfluence People, convicted criminals on death row, including serial killers,often continue to insist that they are good people and have done nothingwrong.118 [part0034.html#chapter004fn118] When asked how they can justify takingthe lives of their victims, they come up with a variety of excuses, or they maynot even be willing to admit that they committed these crimes at all. Peoplewith sociopathic behaviors see morals, ethics, and conscience as weaknesses thatcan be exploited. They have a passionate need to be in charge, to lead the way,and to dominate others. These excerpts from an article by Maxwell C. Bridgesshed more light on the mind-set of sociopaths.119[part0034.html#chapter004fn119]Out of all humanity, approximately three percent of men and one percent of womenare sociopaths…. Such people can tell right from wrong in their behavior, butderive no unpleasant feelings when they commit the latter. They…look down onthose bound by conscience. The truth is a matter of convenience for them, to bebiased to their advantage….Many of them are charming and debonair when so inclined, [and] manipulative andvicious when they can get away with it. They can “read” like a book the bodylanguage and facial expressions of the conscience-driven. They can fakeemotions, seek pity and affection they never feel for others, and seduce theirvictims before they exploit or injure them on purpose. They use people anddiscard them the way you would use a Kleenex and throw it away….Since their brains are not preoccupied by the infinite subconscious calculationsof moral conscience and love, they are burdened with a semi-permanent drudgeryof boredom they can only relieve by serial, risky behaviors—and elaboratemanipulations (torture, humiliation, and betrayal) of their conscientiousinferiors. They usually wind up in old age alone, broke and shunned byeveryone—their family included. Many are killed or socially crushed by apowerful protector of one of their victims, or by numerous avengers. Very fewdie in their bed surrounded by people who love them.120[part0034.html#chapter004fn120]REDIRECTING SOCIOPATHIC BEHAVIORSI feel it is also important to point out that everyone by nature has tendenciesthat are sociopathic, to a certain degree. All of us are capable of being cruelto others and dismissing their feelings, and yet still thinking of ourselves as100 percent good. Behavioral geneticist Dr. David Lykken concluded that childrenwith sociopathic tendencies, such as fearlessness, aggressiveness, and sensationseeking, can have those personality characteristics directed toward morepositive behaviors by loving parents with good boundaries.121[part0034.html#chapter004fn121] In an undergraduate Psychology of Adjustmentclass, we learned that good parenting requires a consistent “punishmentparadigm”—in which the child knows exactly where the boundaries are. The childshould be well aware that every time those boundaries are tested, the samepunishment will result. Permissive parenting—in which parents are overwhelmed bytheir children’s misbehavior and are not always consistent in punishing them forit—is actually one of the most damaging forms of child abuse.Even in adulthood, sociopathic behavioral traits can be transformed intopositive qualities in certain circumstances. A group of scientists led by ScottO. Lilienfeld identified key behavioral characteristics of sociopaths, including“fearless dominance,” but also found that these same traits, if focusedpositively, can create very effective leaders.122[part0034.html#chapter004fn122] This includes the ability to think clearly andlead skillfully in a time of crisis.123 [part0034.html#chapter004fn123] John F.Kennedy is one of many beloved American leaders who had “fearless dominance.”Steve Jobs had many of these characteristics as well, and though he is widelyregarded as having been overly abusive, he nonetheless made many valuableinnovations. Here is a quote from Lilienfeld’s study that sums it up nicely:“Fearless Dominance, which reflects the boldness associated with psychopathy,was associated with better rated presidential performance, leadership,persuasiveness, crisis management, Congressional relations, and alliedvariables…. Fearless dominance…may contribute to reckless criminality andviolence, or to skillful leadership in the face of a crisis.”124[part0034.html#chapter004fn124]Everyone is on a spectrum between positive and negative, and learning to admitthat can be a very powerful tool in your spiritual awakening. People withsociopathic qualities are not “evil” or beyond hope. However, in the mostextreme cases they may require extensive rehabilitation—including a completeprevention of any way for them to harm others—before any real personality changeis possible. Most people are not sociopathic but are still quite capable ofbeing self-involved, manipulative, and controlling—particularly when they feelshamed or emotionally injured in some way.WEALTH AND POWER CAN LEAD TO SOCIOPATHIC BEHAVIORI am absolutely convinced that sociopathic attitudes and behaviors can developin a person who did not have any particular astrological configuration orgenetic indications of these traits from birth. People who acquire significantwealth and power can easily develop sociopathic qualities, particularly if theydo not have a strong and loving foundation to begin with. The problem withhaving worldly power is that other people want it from you. If you know someonewith fame and fortune, you may find that people approach you just to try to getto your friend. The more money and power you have, the more it seems thateveryone you meet has an angle. Everyone wants your money. Everyone wants to useyou to get ahead. These are, of course, exaggerations, as not everyone actuallydoes this, but it can certainly seem like it.Many folks love to hate people with wealth and power, as it makes them feelbetter about their own lives. We read stories about the rich and powerful andwish that we could get our own chance to find out how horrible that life wouldbe. However, even if you have a huge house, a luxury car, and enough money toeat out at fine restaurants every night and take lavish vacations, happiness isstill a choice—not a guarantee. If the people you interact with are constantlytrying to manipulate you and take advantage of you, it can be very difficult tochoose happiness. All the treasures of the material world mean nothing if youdon’t have love. As the Beatles were on their meteoric rise to fame in theaftermath of the success of “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” Paul McCartney sat at anupright piano in the five-star George V hotel in Paris, under severe pressure towrite another hit song, and wrote “Can’t Buy Me Love.”125[part0034.html#chapter004fn125] This is arguably the most popular song in modernhistory to plainly state that material wealth and success cannot buy you thelove you are seeking. In fact, it often has just the opposite effect.This is also why lottery winners often end up quite unhappy and feel thatwinning the money was the worst thing that could have ever happened to them.126[part0034.html#chapter004fn126] Sandra Hayes, a former child services worker,split a $224 million Powerball jackpot with a dozen of her coworkers in 2006 andcollected a lump sum in excess of $6 million after taxes: “I had to endure thegreed and the need that people have, trying to get you to release your money tothem. That caused a lot of emotional pain. These are people who you’ve loveddeep down, and they’re turning into vampires trying to suck the life out ofme.”127 [part0034.html#chapter004fn127]LABORATORY STUDIES OF SOCIOPATHIC BEHAVIOR IN ORDINARY PEOPLEIn 1971, Stanford psychology professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo created what is nowcalled the Stanford Prison Experiment, which shed light on another way in whichsociopathic behaviors can develop. Zimbardo and his colleagues set up amakeshift prison in the basement of Jordan Hall and sought volunteers to becomeeither prisoners or prison guards at random. The participating students would bepaid $15 a day for two weeks. Seventy volunteers were given interviews and abattery of psychological tests. From this number, the twenty-four men who werejudged to be the most normal, average, and healthy were chosen. On Sunday,August 17, 1971, real Palo Alto police officers showed up at the homes of thenine young men assigned to be prisoners and “arrested” them. Some of theparticipants were recorded leaving their homes in handcuffs by TV cameras forthe nightly news, as their neighbors and friends looked on with astonishment.They were then taken and booked at a real jail, blindfolded, and driven to theprison created for them at Stanford. The students who were assigned to be guardswere given uniforms and told that their job was to maintain control of theprison without using violence.The guards became increasingly cruel to the prisoners—particularly after theprisoners staged a revolt on the second day. After the guards crushed therebellion, “they steadily increased their coercive aggression tactics,humiliation, and dehumanization of the prisoners,” Zimbardo said. This includedforcing prisoners to clean out toilet bowls with their hands or act outdegrading scenarios. The worst abuses occurred in the middle of the night, whenthe guards thought the researchers weren’t watching. Some guards told theprisoners that this was not an experiment—they actually had been imprisoned,this was their life now, and it would be years before they could ever escape.This abuse caused such severe stress on the nine prisoners that five of them hadto be released prematurely, one per day.Five days into the experiment, Dr. Philip Zimbardo’s girlfriend, ChristinaMaslach, who had just received her doctorate from Stanford and was starting anassistant professorship at Berkeley, showed up to see what was going on.Although she found it “dull and boring” at first, she was quickly horrified bywhat she saw.128 [part0034.html#chapter004fn128] This began shortly after shestarted up a conversation with a “charming, funny and smart” young man who wasworking as one of the prison guards. She had heard from other researchers thatone guard was particularly sadistic and had been nicknamed John Wayne by boththe prisoners and the other guards. After the charming young man started hisshift, she asked the researchers to point out John Wayne—and was shocked torealize that this was the same person she had just spoken to: “This man had beentransformed. He was talking in a different accent—a Southern accent, which Ihadn’t recalled at all. He moved differently, and the way he talked wasdifferent, not just in the accent, but in the way he was interacting with theprisoners. It was like [seeing] Jekyll and Hyde…. It really took my breathaway.”129 [part0034.html#chapter004fn129]One prisoner then confronted John Wayne for tripping him on the way to thebathroom when no researchers were around to see the act. The prisoner accusedhim of enjoying his job, but John Wayne refused to budge, saying if he went easyon them, his role wouldn’t remain powerful. Maslach also saw the guards take theprisoners to the bathroom with paper bags over their heads before their bedtime.Her fellow researchers teased her when this made her feel sick to her stomach.That night, she had a wildly intense fight with Zimbardo and demanded he end theexperiment. He ultimately realized that he and his colleagues had also lostcompassion for the prisoners, just as the guards had, and the experiment neededto be stopped. The very next day it was all brought to a close. Maslach andZimbardo married in 1972, and she became a full professor at Berkeley,conducting research into dehumanization. Her conclusions, as expressed here in aStanford University press release, are still very relevant in today’s world.“I started interviewing prison guards, real ones, and also people in emergencymedical care. Out of that grew a lot of the research I have done over the yearson job burn-out,” she said. Her work has looked at “how people who areresponsible for the care and treatment of others can come to view those theycare for in object-like ways, leading them, in some cases, to behave in waysthat are really insensitive, uncaring, brutal and dehumanizing.”130[part0034.html#chapter004fn130]Interestingly, Zimbardo’s high school classmate Stanley Milgram also conducted agroundbreaking experiment with similar implications in 1965. A white-coatedresearcher told the participants in the experiment to administer electric shocksto a stranger whenever that person got an answer incorrect on a questionnaire.The stranger was in an adjacent room, behind a one-way mirror, but theparticipant could see and hear everything. Although no real shocks wereoccurring, the stranger would scream in agony when the shocks were apparentlybeing delivered. Every time the participant felt queasy and questioned theresearcher, he or she was simply told that the experiment must continue. Despitethe cries of the stranger reaching the level of true death agony as the scalewent up, fully two-thirds of all the participants administered the maximum doseof electricity—a staggering 750 volts—which was clearly labeled “DANGER—SEVERESHOCK.”131 [part0034.html#chapter004fn131] Many of these participants were laterhorrified by their own dark potential after the true nature of the experimentwas revealed to them. In the aftermath of the Milgram and Zimbardo experiments,new laws were passed to prevent psychological experiments from violating ethics,and as a result, most of these tests are now simply in the form ofpaper-and-pencil questionnaires.Both the Zimbardo and Milgram experiments reveal that ordinary people can easilydehumanize others when placed in unusual circumstances. Certain roles, such asthe prison guard or the authority figure giving orders that we then feelcompelled to follow, are expected to carry specific behaviors along with them.Once you acquire wealth and power and begin interacting with a greater communityof wealthy and powerful people on a regular basis, it becomes much easier toadopt their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as your own. Even if you initiallyfeel badly about certain attitudes and practices they may have, the desire toobey the will of your peers can be very strong—as Milgram’s electric shockexperiment revealed. The difficulties of having lifelong friends turn on you andwant you to give them your money can be very dramatic, as Sandra Hayesdiscovered, along with many other lottery winners like her. Christina Maslach’sresearch after her experience with the Stanford Prison Experiment extended intoa study of caregivers who develop job burnout after being responsible for thewelfare of others. Government, military, finance, and corporate management jobsall involve power over others. The constantly conflicting wants and needs ofthose they serve can definitely create “compassion fatigue.”THE BYSTANDER EFFECTThe bystander effect also shows how sociopathic behaviors can occur in otherwiseordinary people when they are in a group. Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death bya serial rapist and murderer on March 13, 1964, and initial estimates were thateven though she screamed and pleaded for help for at least half an hour,thirty-eight witnesses were aware of the stabbings and failed to intervene orcall the police until the attacker fled the scene and Genovese was dead. Asubsequent American Psychologist investigation suggested that some of thedetails were exaggerated by the media; at least one bystander did call thepolice, and some people could hear her screaming but could not see where it washappening.132 [part0034.html#chapter004fn132] Nonetheless, the underlying pointwas well established: Many deaths occur that are entirely preventable if peoplein groups would intervene sooner. John Darley and Bibb Latané created theirfirst laboratory experiment to study this phenomenon in 1968 and stronglyconfirmed it.133 [part0034.html#chapter004fn133] In one of Darley and Latané’sexperiments from 1969, only 40 percent of people in a crowd offered help to awoman who had apparently fallen and was crying out in distress, whereas if theywere alone, 70 percent of the people called out or went to help her.134[part0034.html#chapter004fn134]ELVIS-MARILYN SYNDROMESevere burnout can also happen when someone becomes a recognized public figure.This is why there are so many cases of celebrities and others in the public eyeending up with clinical depression and anxiety disorders. I coined the termElvis-Marilyn syndrome to describe this condition. We are taught to desire thefruits of the material world, but the most famous man and woman in the twentiethcentury both ended up miserably depressed, severely chemically dependent, anddead of apparent drug overdose. Despite this obvious fact, many people stillbelieve that reaching this level of fame and fortune will bring them thegreatest happiness this world could ever provide. We also tend to believe in themyth of the overnight success, rather than seeing that the harder you work, themore you will benefit.THE SCIENCE OF ABSORBING LIFE ENERGYAs Powerball lottery winner Sandra Hayes indicated, her sudden acquisition of $6million caused her friends to become “vampires trying to suck the life out” ofher. Their behaviors toward her displayed sociopathic tendencies—and she feltthat they were draining her of her life-force. This concept may have far greatervalidity than most of us would ever believe, although several new pieces ofscientific data must be examined in order to understand it.In chapter 1 [part0009.html] we saw that DNA apparently uses light as a primarysource of vitality. Dr. Peter Gariaev found that the DNA molecule naturallyabsorbed every photon inside a tiny quartz container.135[part0034.html#chapter004fn135] Gravity is the only force that can bend light inconventional physics, and the DNA Phantom Effect appears to be gravitational innature. The story gets even stranger when we remember that an invisible wavecontinued holding the photons in place for an incredible thirty days after theDNA itself was removed. This is proof positive that DNA is being heavilyinfluenced, if not created, by invisible waves of gravitational energy. The morewe understand this, the more scientific tests can be devised to prove it.DNA seems to both absorb and transmit light as a part of its basic function.Once this knowledge becomes widespread, it will have huge effects on a varietyof areas—including medicine, healing, psychology, and even conflict resolution.Sociopathic people appear to be making use of this basic system to absorb energyfrom others, though additional scientific data is needed to make the case.Additionally, since this system works by simple, conscious intent, no scientificknowledge is required to make use of it in our everyday lives. We don’t have tobe aware of how it works in order to get results—much as gravity worked justfine before Isaac Newton “discovered” it when an apple fell on his head.Gariaev was not aware that Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp, as a direct result of hisresearch into the underlying causes of cancer, had already discovered in the1970s that DNA stores photons. Popp found that all different forms of life wereabsorbing photons into their DNA—including bacteria, plants, insects, and fish.In certain cases, Popp even observed light being exchanged between organisms.Daphnia, a common water flea, would emit light that was then absorbed by itsneighbors. The same effect was seen to occur with small fish.136[part0034.html#chapter004fn136] The photons seemed to be intelligentlydirected—as if they knew where they were going and were being guided from oneorganism to the other.Furthermore, when Popp broke open a DNA molecule with a chemical known asethidium bromide, a flood of about a thousand photons surged out.137[part0034.html#chapter004fn137] This suggests that each DNA molecule is like aminiature fiber-optic cable. Photons zing back and forth inside the DNA at lightspeed until they need to be used by the body. Popp also found that these photonswere intimately related to our level of physical health. In areas of the bodythat were weakened or diseased, the amount of light stored in our DNA wassignificantly lower—or could almost be entirely absent. Another fascinatingobservation was that as we go through stress, our DNA sheds more and more of itslight and quickly grows darker. Stress causes damage to the tissues of the bodyand can be as toxic as cigarette smoking. When healing needs to occur, our DNAapparently releases photons so the light can go make the repairs that areneeded.Another great pioneer in this category is Dr. Glen Rein, a biochemist whograduated from the University of London. Rein found that we can directly controlhow much light is being stored in someone else’s DNA.138[part0034.html#chapter004fn138] Loving, nurturing thoughts create a healingresponse, increasing the number of photons in the DNA, whereas sudden anger andaggression pulled the light right out of the molecule. In this case, the DNA wasfrom an entirely different person’s body, in a tissue sample from a humanplacenta. Additionally, Dr. Rein’s participants could consciously controlwhether or not they were healing the DNA. When they intended to heal the DNA inthe placenta, it worked, but if they just focused on being loving and did notdirect their minds toward the DNA, the number of photons inside it remainedunchanged.LIGHT IS ALIVEIf we reimagine the universe as a single, vast, living being, then all aspectsof the universe are alive. The universe is now built to make biological life—onthe quantum level. Light, therefore, would be alive in its own right. This isyet another scientific concept I found in the Law of One series back in 1996.41.9 The simplest manifest being is light—or what you have called the photon.139[part0034.html#chapter004fn139]In this new model, a single photon can store far more information than we everdared to believe—including the complete genetic code to build a given type oforganism. This genetic information will also stay encoded within a photon evenas it traverses vast distances. Apparently, the movement through space does notdisrupt the interior structure of a photon. Light also provides a very valuablesource of vital energy to keep biological organisms alive and healthy.LOVE: THE FORCE THAT TRANSPORTS LIGHTIn this model of a living cosmos, light also needs an intelligent means of beingtransported from one point to another. Dr. Rein’s scientific experiments suggestthat as soon as we have a thought about someone—or even start thinking about asample of living biological material—we automatically create a tunnel betweenour own body and the life that we focus our attention on. Light immediatelybegins passing through the tunnel. These energetic passageways are not visibleto us and have not yet been measured scientifically, but on a theoretical level,they have to be there in order to explain the observations of many differentrepeatable laboratory experiments.It appears, therefore, that there are two different forces at work in this newmodel of “energetic biology.” We have light, providing the raw power ofvitality, and we have another force that shapes, molds, and directs the lightthrough invisible tunnels. Although it may seem like a strange concept rightnow, the Law of One refers to the force that shapes, molds, and directs thelight, creating tunnels between life-forms, as “love.”In this case, love becomes a very active force that generates invisible,tunnel-like structures, allowing light to be transferred across variousdistances. Our thoughts create these tunnels. Anytime we have a thought aboutsomeone, a tunnel is automatically created in the Source Field between us andthat person, and photons begin passing through it. These photons can then beencoded with the information from our own thoughts, thus creating a practicalmechanism for telepathic communication to occur. Love is also the force thatmakes the DNA phantom itself. This same energy can either hold photons in theshape of the DNA molecule or create a tunnel to send them outside the DNAmolecule—even across vast distances.MASCULINE AND FEMININE ARCHETYPES—AND UNIVERSAL ENERGYIn philosophical terms, these two forces can also be assigned genders—lightbeing the masculine force that projects outward and provides raw power in thephoton, and love being the feminine force that shapes, molds, and directs thelight. Psychologically, we need to balance these personality characteristics, or“archetypes,” in our own lives in order to be healthy. In the Law of Onephilosophy, the genders we see in biological life are holographic reflections ofthe basic structure of energy in the universe. This was explained in session 92of the Law of One series. Notice that the source was not willing to reveal thefull answer; we needed the opportunity to solve this puzzle ourselves.92.20 That which reaches may be seen as a male principle. That which awaits thereaching may be seen as a female principle. The richness of the male and femalesystem of polarity is interesting—and we would not comment further, but suggestconsideration by the student.140 [part0034.html#chapter004fn140]In session 67, Don Elkins summarized his best understanding of what he was beingtold about the nature of the masculine and feminine archetypes. Don did notunderstand that male and female, light and love, had other energetic qualitiesbesides the flow of electrical charge from negative to positive. Nonetheless,this statement did reflect some of what Don was being told.67.28 The Father archetype corresponds to the male or positive aspect ofelectromagnetic energy, and is active, creative, and radiant—as is our localsun. The Mother archetype corresponds to the female or negative aspect ofelectromagnetic energy, and is receptive or magnetic—as is our Earth, as itreceives the sun’s rays and brings forth life via third-density fertility.141[part0034.html#chapter004fn141]The masculine and feminine archetypes are extremely important to understand ifyou want to analyze the symbolism of your dreams—and the deeper meaning of thestruggles you may be going through. Most men need to develop their feminine sidemore fully and end up learning to do this through being involved inrelationships with women. Most women are attracted to men for the oppositereason, to develop their masculine side. However, it is also possible for a manto be more feminine than masculine—which usually attracts him to women withexaggerated masculine qualities. Sexual attraction often has a subconsciousfunction of drawing us to the people from whom we will learn the most. Meek,passive, self-defeating, and anxiety-prone people will often have irresistiblesexual attraction to strong, fearless, dominant, and narcissistic personalitytypes. These relationships can be extremely torturous and miserable if thenarcissist refuses to change.HEALING AND ABSORBINGIdeally, once we’ve created a tunnel between ourselves and someone else with ourthoughts, the exchange of photons flows in both directions. In cases when we arehealing others, we send more photons into the body of the person who needshealing, but when we absorb energy, we are actively pulling photons out ofsomeone’s body. As soon as we direct angry thoughts at someone, a tunnel isautomatically formed and we immediately begin trying to pull photons through it.To do this successfully, we have to break the other person down by causing themto feel negative emotions such as guilt, fear, shame, sadness, anger, disgust,terror, or shock. However, if the person stays in a loving but firm state andrefuses to allow him- or herself to be bullied while also not indulging innegative emotions, his or her own vital energy will be protected, and nothing islost. This is one of the most important Law of One teachings to master if youwant to preserve and protect your vital energy.If we are successful in absorbing energy from someone—if the other personwithers in the presence of our anger—then we draw light out of the storehouse ofDNA throughout that person’s entire body. This provides us with an immediatesource of energy. We become more alert and energized—though this is also a cold,thin, and hollow way to restore ourselves and lacks the richness and complexitythat naturally fills us when we feel genuine love. In Law of One terms,absorbing energy from someone else is the negative path—and it guarantees thatwhatever you take from others will soon be taken from you in a similar fashion.This mechanism is precisely what Dr. Glen Rein observed in his DNA experiments.Angry people pulled photons out of the DNA from a human placenta, whereas peoplefeeling love were able to beam additional photons into that same DNA. We havenot yet measured these invisible energetic tunnels or seen how our thoughtsautomatically create them, but the effects of the mechanism have been welldocumented.BURLAKOV’S FISH EGG EXPERIMENTFurther support for this concept was given by Dr. A. B. Burlakov, anotherRussian scientist. In this case, Burlakov placed growing fish eggs near eachother, so photons could pass freely between them. When he put older, more matureeggs in front of younger, newer eggs, the older eggs literally pulled the healthright out of the younger eggs. The younger eggs soon developed obvious healthproblems, including withering, deformities, and even death.142[part0034.html#chapter004fn142] Thus, it seemed that the older, stronger eggswere directly absorbing life-force out of the younger, weaker eggs—feeding onthem for their own survival. This same mechanism can also allow us to transferhealth to others as well. When slightly younger eggs were placed near slightlyolder eggs in Burlakov’s experiment, the younger eggs actually sped up in theirdevelopment—and experienced accelerated growth until they reached the sameapparent age level as the older eggs.143 [part0034.html#chapter004fn143]Interestingly, these healing or weakening effects could be totally blocked byputting a pane of glass between the two sealed rooms holding the eggs. This isalmost certainly due to the fact that glass blocks ultraviolet light. The glassdoes not block the microgravitational field in the stronger eggs from pullingphotons out of the weaker eggs. The weaker eggs still shed their photons.However, once those photons are released, they bump against the glass, reflectback into the room, and are reabsorbed by other eggs. Therefore, there is no netloss of energy—even as the gravitational force from the stronger eggs continuespulling on the photons of the weaker ones.HEALING: A META-ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIESDr. Daniel Benor analyzed 191 different controlled scientific studies ofspiritual healing, where human beings consciously intended to heal livingtissue. Healing was attempted on a wide variety of life-forms, includingbacteria, algae, plants, insects, and animals, as well as other humans. Quitesurprisingly, 64 percent of these 191 studies showed significant effects—even incases where other human beings were being healed across substantial distances,such as from New York to Los Angeles.144 [part0034.html#chapter004fn144]Once again, this implies that as soon as we direct our thoughts andemotions—particularly loving thoughts and emotions—toward a life-form, we open atunnel that allows photons to pass through. This effect is very consistent andhas clearly been observed in the majority of all scientific studies of healing.Best of all, in Law of One terms, when you heal someone else, you don’t have togive up any of your own biophotons. You can act like a lens of light foruniversal energy to flow through you. This point was clearly established insession 66 of the Law of One series.66.10 The healer does not heal. The crystallized healer is a channel forintelligent energy, which offers an opportunity to an entity that it might healitself…. This is also true of the more conventional healers of your culture. Ifthese healers could but fully realize that they are responsible only foroffering the opportunity of healing, and not for the healing, many of theseentities would feel an enormous load of misconceived responsibility fall fromthem.145 [part0034.html#chapter004fn145]4.14 It is a further item of interest that those whose life does not equal theirwork may find some difficulty in absorbing the energy of intelligent infinity.[They can] thus become quite distorted—in such a way as to cause disharmony inthemselves and others—and perhaps even find it necessary to cease the healingactivity.146 [part0034.html#chapter004fn146]LAW OF ONE QUOTES ON LIGHT AND LOVEThe Law of One series tells us that light is alive. Photons are the most basicform of life in the universe, and we now have the science to prove it. The DNAphantom—the feminine force of love—is the vortex energy that surrounds andshapes the light. In the Law of One series, we are told that the universe ismade of light and love—masculine and feminine—and that love is the force thatshapes light. Our entire universe is built by light and love—the two primarymanifestations of “intelligent infinity” after it becomes intelligent energy.The offspring of light and love are matter and biology, all of which isultimately alive. Here are some key quotes where these connections are revealed.13.9 Light…is the building block of that which is known as matter, the lightbeing intelligent and full of energy.147 [part0034.html#chapter004fn147]2.4 The stones are alive. It has not been so understood by the [people] of yourculture.148 [part0034.html#chapter004fn148]64.6 Our understanding is that there is no other material except light.149[part0034.html#chapter004fn149]28.5 Question: What causes…light [to] condense into our physical or chemicalelements?Answer:…It is necessary to consider the enabling function of the focus known asLove. This energy is of an ordering nature.150 [part0034.html#chapter004fn150]27.13 Love uses light, and has the power to direct light.151[part0034.html#chapter004fn151]6.4 The illusion [i.e., your physical universe] is created of light—or moreproperly but less understandably, light/love.152 [part0034.html#chapter004fn152]1.6 You are every thing, every being, every emotion, every event, everysituation. You are unity. You are infinity. You are love/light, light/love. Youare. This is the Law of One.153 [part0034.html#chapter004fn153]REMOTE VIEWING RESEARCH—AND FURTHER INSIGHTS INTO THE NEGATIVE PATHThe vortex created by love extends out of us when we direct our attentionelsewhere. Light then transmits across this channel. This effect can happen overlong distances. In remote viewing research conducted in both China and theUnited States, a person is trained to intuitively perceive a distant area andmake accurate observations. During the time the person is accurately viewing thetarget, which is inside a room that is otherwise completely dark, photons appeararound the target. The photons can surge up to a thousand times above the normalbackground level.154 [part0034.html#chapter004fn154] This seems to be caused bya tunnel that is formed when the person focuses his or her attention on thedistant target. Anyone can be trained to become an accurate remote viewer, soall of us have the ability to form these tunnels. These same tunnels canactually become visible to us when we have an out-of-body experience. Manypeople have reported seeing a silver cord that connects their astral body totheir physical body.Whenever we focus our thoughts on another person, we open up a conduit with themthrough which photons can be exchanged. We can send energy into a person or drawit out of that person through this tunnel. We can also kindle vital energy andfill our DNA with photons by having loving thoughts. In a meditative, inspired,blissful state, we naturally open up many microtunnels that pull new photonsinto our DNA. This is the scientific explanation behind the placebo effect,where simply believing we will be healed actually creates a healing response.The sociopath, however, has walled out feelings of love, seeing them asweakness. As a result, their physical health and attention span suffer, and theonly way they can feel alive again is to feed on the energy of others. Theyattack, shame, humiliate, and take offense—demanding greater and greatersacrifices, apologies, and concessions. They deliberately provoke kindheartedpeople into having negative reactions, knowing that one of the greatest sourcesof energy and vitality they receive is when someone begs them for forgiveness.As we plead for kindness and mercy, we also flood the person we’ve hurt with ahuge surge of our vital energy, in the hope of helping them feel better.However, in the strongest cases, no matter how much energy they take, they stillthirst for more. They will never truly be happy until they allow themselves tolove. For them, this involves lowering their boundaries and dismantling theincredible defense mechanisms they’ve built around their sensitive core. Theyare well aware that if they let themselves feel their emotions—including thepowerful pain they’ve gone through—then others could absorb their vitality, justas they have been doing all along. For them, this is a terrifying thought, asthey trust no one. However, in time they can learn that most people are kind andgood-natured and genuinely do not want to hurt or torture them, and then theycan begin receiving the benefits of a loving attitude.Our Global Adversary, or “negative elite,” as they are called in the Law of Oneseries, is simply a group of people who are consciously or subconsciouslyseeking worldly power and prestige in order to feel the energizing influence ofmillions of people focusing their attention on them. Those on the “negativepath,” such as sociopaths, have so much resistance to loving, accepting, andforgiving others that they usually do not see any other way to acquire theenergy they need to stay healthy. They seek public acclaim, adoration, andreverence—and laugh sarcastically at how they are fooling everyone. Thankfully,as we break through the denial and expose the greatest secrets of the “negativeelite,” we also inoculate ourselves against their control and manipulation.Ignorance is required for their plans to succeed. Once a “critical mass” ofpeople awaken to who they are and what they are doing, their defeat becomes amathematical certainty."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVETHE GLOBAL ADVERSARYMany plays, novels, movies, and television shows have explored how ordinary,kindhearted people can become highly negative after acquiring money and power.What is still not understood on a widespread level, at this time, is the extentto which wealthy and powerful people have formed a global elite. In 2011 Dr.Clive Boddy of Nottingham Trent University wrote a peer-reviewed theoreticalpaper entitled “The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global FinancialCrisis.”155 [part0034.html#chapter005fn155] Mitchell Anderson offered someinteresting thoughts on this study in the Toronto Star newspaper.Only a small subset of psychopaths become the violent criminals so oftenfictionalized in film. Most simply seek to blend in, and conceal theirdifference, in order to more effectively manipulate others. This frighteningcondition has existed throughout human history…. Scientists believe about 1 percent of the general population is psychopathic, meaning there are more than 3million moral monsters among normal United States citizens. There is emergingevidence that this frequency increases within the upper management of moderncorporations. This is not surprising, since personal ruthlessness and fixationon personal power have become seen as strong assets to large publicly tradedcorporations (which some authors believe have also become psychopathic).However, appearance and performance are two different things. While psychopathsare often outwardly charming and excellent self-promoters, they are alsotypically terrible managers—bullying co-workers and creating chaos to concealtheir behaviour. When employed in senior levels, their pathology also means theyare biochemically incapable of something they are legally required to do: act ingood faith on behalf of other people….Boddy suggests that corporations have changed from relatively stableinstitutions where psychopaths would have a difficult time concealingthemselves, to highly fluid organizations where it is much easier for them todisappear within the chaos in their wake….Boddy is not hopeful that the current round of expensive public bailouts willsolve the problem. If psychopaths have, in fact, installed themselves in theupper reaches of the world’s financial institutions, their genetic deficiencydictates that their greed knows no bounds. They will continue to act inanti-social, remorseless ways, amplified by their enormous corporate influence,until the institutions they represent—and perhaps the entire globaleconomy—collapses.156 [part0034.html#chapter005fn156]UNRAVELING THE GREAT SECRETOur great secret starts to unravel even further when we confirm that theAmerican financial system was privatized in 1913. America’s right to issue moneywas handed over to a group of private bankers, including the Rothschild andRockefeller families, calling themselves the Federal Reserve.157[part0034.html#chapter005fn157] The Federal Reserve banking families also formedthe Bank for International Settlements, or BIS, creating the first “worldwidecentral bank.”On September 19, 2011, a Swiss scientific study led by Dr. James Glattfelderproved that a staggering 80 percent of all the money that was being made in theworld was filtering back into the pockets of the Federal Reserve through verycarefully disguised “interlocking directorates” of corporations.158[part0034.html#chapter005fn158] This includes the big media conglomerates.Supercomputers were used to analyze a database of the top 37 millioncorporations and individual investors worldwide. Shockingly, only 737corporations controlled a network that was earning 80 percent of all the world’sprofits. This information was deeply hidden within the data and requiredsupercomputer power to discover. These 737 entities enjoyed power in the systemthat was ten times greater than they should have had from their wealth alone.With even greater number crunching, this web of ownership could be furthernarrowed down to a superentity of only 147 companies. An astonishing 75 percentof the corporations within this superentity are financial institutions. The top25 financial institutions within this highly covert group include Barclays,JPMorgan Chase & Co., Merrill Lynch, UBS, Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank,Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America—all of which are allegedlymembers of the Federal Reserve.159 [part0034.html#chapter005fn159] The actualbanks running the Federal Reserve have never been openly and officiallyrevealed—ostensibly for their own safety and privacy—but most researchers andinsiders I’ve spoken with agree on who the main players are. The degree ofcontrol enjoyed by these top banks is a scientific fact—not a conspiracytheory—and that’s not all.Representative Alan Grayson, former representative Ron Paul, and now deceasedsenator Robert Byrd forced through a congressional audit of the Federal Reservein 2011 and found that the Fed secretly gave away $26 trillion worth of Americantaxpayers’ money. Twenty-six trillion dollars—not to the people, not to thegovernment, but to the top Federal Reserve banks themselves—to bail them out.160[part0034.html#chapter005fn160] Several of the bailed-out banks were not evenbased in the United States. Had this money been redirected to the people, itcould have done wonders, considering this staggering figure is well over a thirdof the value of the entire world’s gross domestic product in a given year.However, the greed of the financial institutions is so high, and the gamblesthey have taken are so huge, that this was only barely enough money to keep themalive. I did find out from the 160-nation alliance that the 2008 financialcollapse was directly engineered by members within the alliance to financiallywipe out the Federal Reserve cabal. No one in the alliance suspected the FederalReserve would be able to create such a massive bailout to keep their corruptfinancial institutions afloat—and get away with it—but they did.It seems impossible to believe that these facts are true—but the superentity of147 corporations controlling 80 percent of the world’s wealth, and the $26trillion of bailouts they created to keep themselves alive are both provenrealities. Normally we think of sociopaths as working in isolation, but power isvery hierarchical by nature. I have spoken to people who have broken free ofthis group or are actively working to bring it down from the inside. One of themost common things I’ve heard is that wealthy and powerful people believe youare automatically smarter, stronger, and better than others if you achieveworldly riches. By teaming up with the wealthy and powerful and accepting yourposition in the hierarchy, you can become even more wealthy and powerful.Elaborate secrecy is used, so that those who do not have the stomach for trulysociopathic behaviors never find out what the group is doing at the higherlevels. Ruthlessness and a willingness to do anything to accomplish the goals ofthe organization are rewarded with further progress. The farther up you go, themore the group resembles the worst aspects of Nazi Germany. In fact, there isundeniable proof that the Nazi Party was financed and supported by these samepeople, an idea we will explore in chapter 13 [part0023.html].161[part0034.html#chapter005fn161] The Bolshevik Revolution, which created theSoviet Union beginning in 1917, was also financed by Federal Reserve bankers, aswe find in G. Edward Griffin’s The Creature from Jekyll Island162[part0034.html#chapter005fn162] and Dr. Antony C. Sutton’s Wall Street and theBolshevik Revolution.163 [part0034.html#chapter005fn163] I do honestly believethis entire system is crumbling apart now, and that’s why I’m taking the time totalk about it.THE SCIENCE OF ABSORBING ENERGYDr. Cleve Backster is a former CIA employee who pioneered and standardized theprotocols for administering a lie detector, or polygraph, test.164[part0034.html#chapter005fn164] Backster’s findings are directly relevant tounderstanding what is happening with the Global Adversary. The polygraphmeasures changes in the electrical conductivity of human skin, but it canmeasure the electrical activity of other life-forms as well. In 1966, after manyyears of work in the field, Backster got the idea to wire up his houseplant tothe polygraph machine—to see if he could get humanlike reactions from it. Muchto his surprise, the plant had ongoing, complex electrical activity—surging upand down, seemingly at random, with fluctuations curiously similar to what ahuman’s own patterns would look like.Backster knew that the key to administering a lie detector test is threateningthe subject with a confrontation—“Did you fire the shot that killed your wife?”If the subject says no but his body’s electrical activity starts having a hugeresponse—like we would see if he was screaming, shocked, angered, or suddenlyterrified—then this is considered proof he is lying. Backster wanted to see ifhe could threaten the plant’s well-being in some way to get a humanlikereaction. Finally, when Backster got a clear mental picture of lighting a matchand burning one of the leaves, the plant started “screaming” very strongly. Thishappened before he actually burned the plant. Backster did end up going andgetting a matchbook, lighting a match, and burning a leaf. The plant didn’t stopscreaming until after he took the matches out of the room and left the areacompletely.This “alert system” is constantly at work in nature and forms a collectiveconsciousness among all living things. Backster tested plants, yogurt bacteria,chicken eggs, animal cells, and human cells and found that when one organismfeels stress, pain, fear, and danger, an energetic beacon is sent out to everyother life-form around it. When Backster startled his cat out of a deep sleep,his African violet “screamed.”165 [part0034.html#chapter005fn165] When Backsterboiled or poisoned bacteria, other bacteria screamed.166[part0034.html#chapter005fn166] When a captured spider suddenly was set free andwas about to run for its life in front of a team of Yale University graduatestudents in 1969, a nearby ivy plant screamed.167[part0034.html#chapter005fn167] When Backster boiled living brine shrimp using acompletely randomized process, at night, while no one else was in the building,nearby plants screamed.168 [part0034.html#chapter005fn168] When Backster boiledchicken eggs, one by one, other chicken eggs screamed.169[part0034.html#chapter005fn169] When a World War II pilot who was nearly shotdown watched film of another pilot being shot down, his own tissue samplescreamed—and this was only one of many human examples.170[part0034.html#chapter005fn170] Dr. Brian O’Leary, a NASA astronaut, traveled ona three-hundred-mile airplane flight and wrote down every time he went throughstress. His cells in the lab screamed at the exact same time each stressfulevent happened.171 [part0034.html#chapter005fn171][../images/00013.gif]Fig. 6 [part0006.html#l6]: Dr. Cleve Backster’s diagram of humanlike electricalactivity in a plantWE MAY BE CONNECTED TO AN ENTIRE NETWORKLet’s not forget what Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp discovered about stress. As soon aswe feel stress, there is a sudden decrease in the amount of photons in our DNA,causing a visible dimming of the light. This suggests a very intriguingpossibility. In the previous chapter, we discussed energetic tunnels that canform between two people, in which photons exchange information as well as vitalenergy. Now we are confronted with a new possibility. What if all biologicallife is interconnected by these same tunnels? What if we already have a huge webof energetic tunnels connecting us to every life-form around us as part of thebasic laws of physics that we don’t yet understand? What if, in times of suddenstress, we release biophotons that transmit a warning signal of our fear andpain throughout this entire network of tunnels?Each cell contains forty-six chromosomes, and each chromosome is made of twochromatids, or DNA molecules. This gives us ninety-two DNA molecules percell—not including mitochondrial DNA, which varies depending upon the type ofcell. Our bodies have an estimated 10 trillion human cells, as well as another90 trillion nonhuman microbial cells. That means we have at least 920 trillionDNA molecules within our own human cells—just within the chromosomes. Each DNAmolecule holds up to a thousand photons. At these numbers, we can now start tosee what a huge energy resource we possess. With at least 920 quadrillionphotons zinging around inside our bodies at any one time, a single moment ofstress could send out a shower of millions or even billions of photons atonce—without even making a dent in our overall supply.Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp saw the photons suddenly decrease in DNA during stress.Dr. Cleve Backster saw how stress sends out a warning beacon to all otherlife-forms in the area. Backster was not able to identify how this warningbeacon of stress traveled, but we have strong reasons now to believe thatphotons are being used. These photons travel through energetic tunnels in theSource Field that connect us with all living things.Apparently, these energetic tunnels are not limited by physical distance. Dr.Brian O’Leary’s cells picked up every shock he went through on his flight backto Phoenix from San Diego, even though he ended up being hundreds of miles away.Successful healing studies have been conducted in which a person in New Yorkremotely healed a person in Los Angeles, as Dr. Daniel Benor revealed in hismeta-analysis of healing studies.Therefore, we can safely conclude that whenever we begin focusing our attentionon a particular person, we begin transferring photons to them through a tunnelthat may exist as a basic, as yet undiscovered law of nature that interconnectsall living things—perhaps akin to a wormhole. Although certain signals, such aspain, fear, stress, and death, appear to be transmitted to all living things ina given area, these tunnels appear to be strengthened once we focus ourattention on any one person. Dr. Glen Rein’s participants were able to heal DNAwhen they focused loving emotions on it, but the DNA did not gain any newphotons if the participants’ attention was directed elsewhere.DR. WILLIAM BRAUD AND THE STUDY OF BEING STARED ATDr. William Braud proved that simply staring at someone is enough to triggertheir bodies to have an excited response—even at a distance, where there is nophysical line of sight between the two individuals. This is very likely causedby the same energetic mechanism we have been describing. In Braud’s experiment,one person was placed in a small room with a hidden video camera and told torelax and read a magazine while his skin was being monitored for its electricalactivity. In another room, a closed-circuit television screen revealed images ofthe man sitting there in his chair, even though he didn’t know he was beingfilmed. At computer-generated random moments, a participant in the room wasasked to suddenly stare intently at this man’s face on the television screen.Surprisingly, 59 percent of the time the man was being stared at, his skin had asudden shock reaction. It worked with women just as well as men—again and again.A 59 percent reaction is fully 9 percent above random chance. This may not soundlike much, but it is very significant, considering that Braud repeated thisexperiment again and again, with many different participants, and the effect wasvery consistent.172 [part0034.html#chapter005fn172]Dr. Braud may have stumbled upon the real hidden secret of those who seekworldly power, whether they consciously know what is happening to them or not.When I did my first full-length show on Coast to Coast with Art Bell, in April2001, an estimated 20 million people were listening. During the show, andparticularly after it was finished, I felt an incredible amount of energysurging through me. I could not seem to control my elevated heartbeat, breathingrate, and head rush—and it did remind me of a drug-like effect. Since I nolonger did drugs, or wanted to do drugs, I found it distracting and unpleasant.The effect was so intense that I went down to the beach and paced up and downthe shore to try to walk it off, but I simply could not relax. It quieted downafter a few hours, and I was finally able to go to sleep, but it had beenextremely noticeable—much like a runner’s high—and I knew it wasn’t just me. Iwas immediately aware that this power could be greatly misused. In fact, Ideliberately avoided doing conferences or seeking large-scale publicity forseveral years until I knew I could be mature enough to handle it. For a positiveperson, the ideal response is to transform that raw energy into a usable formthrough a stage performance that elevates and inspires everyone. However, I alsorealized that politicians, military leaders, heads of corporations, and otherfamous people—actors, musicians, and the like—were at risk. Power was veryreal—and could be very addictive. Every person who focuses his or her attentionon you is sending you energy.PAYING TRIBUTE TO LEADERSThis system has apparently been in place throughout all of human evolution.Leaders who put their faces on currency may well have been getting energytransfers from their people every time the people looked at the currency intheir pocket. Of course, public gatherings would make this transfer system muchmore potent as a leader makes a rousing speech, for example. After Gutenberg’sinvention of the printing press, beginning in or around 1439, portraits ofleaders could be distributed in printed illustrations, and that may well havebeen enough to create viable energy transfers. Photography would represent thenext quantum leap in this system, potentially making the transfers even moreeffective as the images of the leaders’ faces became even clearer. Once liveradio and television became available, potentially millions of people couldfocus on one person simultaneously—in real time. Furthermore, if a particularfilm actor is being seen in movies by tens or even hundreds of thousands ofpeople at any given time—even if the actor is only playing a character—he or shemay still be receiving tremendous amounts of energy from the people watchingthem. These Law of One quotes from sessions 93, 97, and 55 summarize thedifference in polarities, between negative and positive, very succinctly.93.3 Another method of viewing polarities might involve the concept ofradiation/absorption. That which is positive is radiant; that which is negativeis absorbent.173 [part0034.html#chapter005fn173]97.17 The left hand [negative polarity] attempts to absorb the power of thespirit, and point it for its use alone.174 [part0034.html#chapter005fn174]55.3 The negative polarization is greatly aided by the subjugation orenslavement of other-selves.175 [part0034.html#chapter005fn175]Controlling others may seem to make our lives a lot easier, but as this quotefrom session 52 reveals, it automatically requires us to reincarnate andexperience what we’ve created from the other side. Reincarnation will beexplained much more in chapters 7 [part0016.html] and 8 [part0017.html].52.7 Control may seem to be a short-cut to discipline, peace, and illumination.However, this very control potentiates and necessitates the further incarnativeexperience—in order to balance this control or repression of that self which isperfect.176 [part0034.html#chapter005fn176]A HOLDOVER FROM THE ANIMAL KINGDOM FOR SURVIVALI do believe that nature established this energy-exchange system for a positivepurpose—at least originally. If your tribe lives in a cave, huddled together forwarmth, and a saber-toothed tiger appears at the entrance looking for a meal,someone’s got to go fight the tiger and protect the others. This will usually bethe alpha male of the tribe—who may also lead his bravest warriors into battle.Everyone else is cowering in fear of the tiger—absolutely terrified. As theymove through this terrible, life-or-death feeling of stress, their DNA gives offa massive release of photons, arguably in the billions for each of them. Thesephotons—the essence of life, health, and vitality—are directly beamed into thewarriors who are out there protecting the rest of the tribe. Let’s not forgetthat Dr. Rein was able to physically measure the light increasing in the DNAeven though it was taken from another person’s body. The warriors at the frontof the cave are able to think faster and have greater physical strength andgreater endurance as this energy transfer takes place.This same system seems to work very well at public gatherings, which have goneon since the dawn of civilization. I was invited to attend a Detroit Tigersbaseball game in 2011, while they were in the midst of playoffs that woulddetermine if they would go to the World Series. I was not a sports fan and hadno attachment to the outcome when I went to the game. This put me in a uniqueposition, as I soon felt an incredible rush of energy from being in this packedstadium. This appeared as a euphoric state of mind as well as a strong sense ofphysical excitation. In particular, when the home team’s batter got a good,strong hit, and the ball was looking like it might go the distance and become ahome run, my mind and body raced into pure ecstasy. Almost every pair of eyes inthe stadium was focused directly on that ball as it flew, creating a powerfulfocal point for the attention of the group. When the ball did make it past theoutfield, the crowd leaped to their feet and all the energizing feelings reachedan orgasmic peak. Within ten or fifteen minutes, I discovered that I absolutelyloved baseball.I was really quite surprised by this—and with my background in this new science,I realized that what people were calling “team spirit” had a direct energeticcomponent. The overall energy of the crowd gave each person more vitality thanhe or she brought in on his or her own, and people were willing to pay hundredsof dollars a ticket to participate in it. This same system seems to explain whyteams seem to do better at home games. When the crowd is right there, hoping fortheir team to succeed, they are beaming a much stronger rush of biophotons intothe players than the players receive at an opponent’s venue. The minds of theplayers then become sharper and more alert, and their bodies become stronger,more energized, and capable of much greater endurance.POWER: THE SOCIOPATH’S ULTIMATE DRUG OF CHOICEMost people can rebuild their vital energy by being loving and supporting toothers, which usually leads to that same love and support being returned tothem. The collective inspiration in the sports arena was clearly creating morevitality than each individual brought in on his or her own. Let’s not forgetthat seven thousand people in deep meditation were able to inspire everyone onearth to such a degree that terrorism decreased by 72 percent worldwide.However, the 1 percent of people who are genuine sociopaths have completelywalled themselves off from love—at least for anyone other than themselves. Theyfeel a constant sense of boredom and depression and often become daredevils andadrenaline junkies, looking for more speed, more power, more excitement, andmore danger—regardless of whom they hurt or threaten to get it. Power overothers, and the energy they absorb from others, can literally become like anarcotic. The risk of taking someone on, not knowing if the struggle for controlwill succeed, can give these people a huge adrenaline rush. When they do succeedin battle, they are replenished by the vital energy of the person they havehumiliated and defeated.Let’s say that a group of sociopathic individuals have relentlessly sought poweron earth and formed a hierarchical system as they fought for superiority withinthe group. In this case, their ultimate goal would be to dominate and controlthe planet, since they feel they are the strongest, the wisest, and the mostspiritually advanced, and therefore worthy of their power. Instinctively, theymay understand that when people are traumatized, they release vital energy andwill transfer that energy to the alpha male who steps in to protect them. Thoughmost people could not conceive of a strategy like this, sociopaths would befully capable of creating mass atrocities—such as wars—simply to traumatize thepeople. Mass trauma causes the people to release vital energy in hugequantities. Once the elite step in as the brave and noble protectors of thepeople, they get to absorb this energy for themselves. The power elite’sstrongest goal might then be to enjoy an ongoing, secure role on earth—wherethey control the money, the politics, the military and the media, and no one caneffectively oppose them. If they are successful, they will enjoy a continuingsupply of vitality from their traumatized subjects. However, this also providesus with a major spiritual growth opportunity as we become inspired to endinjustice and help others. This is clearly spelled out in session 97 of the Lawof One.97.16 The fruit of those experiences apparently negative is frequently found tobe helpful in the development of the service-to-others bias.177[part0034.html#chapter005fn177]FUNDING BOTH SIDES OF A WARIn order to understand the deepest secret of this Global Adversary, we mustexplore the sickening idea that World War I and World War II might have bothbeen elaborate, deadly deceptions. You may find this hard to read. You maysuddenly feel tired and want to do something else. This is a very normalself-protective response. Your body does not want to go into fear and trauma,because it knows it will lose vitality in the process. This sudden sense ofpowerful exhaustion is very effective at getting us to avoid looking at painfulthings. I do feel it is important that we understand what was done, however—aswell as what is still happening at the time of this writing—in order for us tohelp to change it. Knowing the truth is much safer than staying in denial.What if this same group of international bankers covertly financed both sides ofthese wars? What if many of the leaders of the smaller countries, as well as thesoldiers who were fighting the wars and the people who were supporting them,believed there were genuine reasons for fighting—but, in fact, they had all beenlied to?178 [part0034.html#chapter005fn178] This would be the ultimate exampleof sociopathy on a worldwide scale—behaviors truly worthy of the term GlobalAdversary. When the public is thrown into a state of massive fear and terror,the people begin sending far more energy to their leaders, who they desperatelyhope will protect them.How could any group of human beings do such a thing? And perhaps even moreimportant, why would they do such a thing? The whole idea is so outrageous, sotreasonous, so horrible to consider that many, if not most, people who hear itwill simply shut down. They don’t feel safe enough to explore the idea that sucha massive, interconnected, hidden negative force could exist in the world today.Their prevailing belief in a loving God cannot allow for the world they live into be manipulated by such an oppressive force. Sacrificing the lives of millionsof people for some hidden political and financial purpose isn’t just crazy; inthe eyes of most people, it would be the ultimate form of evil. How could anyonepossibly keep a secret this big? How could we not know about it? Even in theface of extensive, verifiable evidence, I’ve seen many people do their best tomake it go away, to laugh at it, and even to stridently attack anyone whosuggests it might be true. These are all efforts to stop the loss of vitalenergy that would occur if they allowed themselves to feel fear. However,synchronicity gives us the personal proof that life is not all about fear anddoom. The universe is a happy and magical place to be. There is love—and we havea responsibility to see the truth and work to transform our planet.LAW OF ONE ON CONSCIOUSNESS AS AN ENERGY SYSTEMThe Law of One series goes into great detail about the negative elite on earth,and how they have either consciously or subconsciously sought energy transfersfrom the people while pursuing the path of manipulation and control.Consciousness is described as an energetic system, much like electricity, as wesee in this brief exchange of questions and answers in session 19. Here we arereminded that the positions of the planets and satellites also have a strongeffect on the consciousness and vitality of any given person on earth at anygiven time.19.19 Question: I believe we have a very, very important point here…. To make ananalogy, using electricity: We have a positive and negative pole. The more youbuild the charge on either of these, the greater the potential difference andthe greater the ability to do work, as we call it, in the physical. This wouldseem to me to be the exact analogy that we have in consciousness here. Is thiscorrect?Answer:…This is precisely correct…. The physical [body] complex alone is createdof many, many electromagnetic fields interacting due to intelligent energy….[You are] affected by thoughts of all kinds generated by the mind complex, bydistortions of the body complex, and by the numerous relationships between themicrocosm, which is the entity, and the macrocosm in many forms—which you mayrepresent by viewing the stars, as you call them, each with a contributingenergy ray which enters the electromagnetic web of the entity due to itsindividual distortions…. The part astrology plays is likened unto that of oneroot among many.179 [part0034.html#chapter005fn179]THE SHEEP EFFECTWhen we observe the animal kingdom, we can obtain critical insights into ourcurrent problems as a planet, since our bodies have much in common with those ofanimals. Within their own circles, the negative elite often refer to themselvesas wolves and to the general public as sheep. After meditating on this conceptfrom time to time for a few years, I had an insight into the deeper meaningbehind this statement. I was on the phone, professionally counseling a woman whowas struggling with fear to the point where she couldn’t even look at theproblem. To me, the solution seemed very simple, but I encountered incredibleresistance when I tried to get her to talk about it. Finally I asked her to tellme what she thought would happen if she actually faced her fear. “I am afraid itwould completely destroy me,” she answered. “I feel like if I take even onelook, it will charge at me—and I could actually die from it.” Once I reassuredher that she was in a safe place and I would help her work through whatever itwas, she was able to talk about it—and she felt much, much better. She soonrealized that the solution was very simple and there was nothing to be afraidof. I realized that she was experiencing an animalistic, primal instinct—and Iwanted to know more about it.Sheep move in flocks and herd together as part of their group behavior, partlyfor their own safety. At first, we might think that as soon as a herd of sheepsees a wolf circling the group, they will start to run—but this may not be true.Animals often become paralyzed with fear—as is seen in the phenomenon of thedeer in the headlights, where a deer has enough time to run out of the way of aspeeding car but does not.The sheep may be very well aware that a wolf is circling their herd. They areterrified, but they keep their heads down and act like nothing is wrong. They goon munching grass and try to ignore the problem. Sometimes the wolf will just goaway and leave them alone, whereas if they run, he will definitely charge. Theycannot stop him from killing them—he is too powerful. However, there’s alwaysthat one sheep who ruins it for everyone else. He can’t take the pressure. Heknows the wolf is there, and he’s just got to look. He lifts up his head andmakes direct eye contact with the terrifying face of the wolf. Now, suddenly,the wolf knows he’s out of time. He’s been spotted and he has to charge. Hissearing gaze burns into the eyes of the sheep that spotted him as he charges theherd. All time seems to slow down to a standstill. The sheep that looked isparalyzed with fear, maintaining full eye contact with the wolf as if he is in ahypnotic trance. This paralysis may last only a few seconds, but now he hasbecome the last one to run. The wolf soon catches up to him. Teeth. Pain.Terror. Blood. Agony. Death.All the other sheep know exactly what happened. This guy just proved it again.To look at the wolf circling the herd is death. As soon as you stare fear in theeye, it will overtake you. This is generally a subconscious instinct we have,but a huge variety of Hollywood movies have reinforced this mental conditioning,which I call the Sheep Effect. We love to identify with characters in films.Many suspenseful movies with murderous villains have a scene where someone hasfound a perfectly good hiding place, such as under the bed. The movie sears withtension as the killer walks into the room. All the victim has to do is keep hereyes closed and she will be fine, but she just can’t help it. She has to know.She has to look. She takes a peek—and the killer is right there. The shock is soextreme that she suddenly startles—making a noise, bumping her head against thebottom of the bed. The music surges into terrible dissonance as the killer ripsaway the bed. She dies the most grisly and horrific death imaginable. Thekiller’s blade is our modern version of the wolf’s teeth. Once again, you arebeing conditioned as you see this film. The message is “Don’t look. If you do,you will die. Let us do what we want—and if you are lucky, we will leave youalone.”This primal instinct is reinforced by hundreds of different Hollywood movies.This is what happens when we do not choose the positive path, when we do notfeel that the universe is a loving place where we are protected. In this case wealso have not chosen the negative path, where we develop fearless dominance andattempt to manipulate and control our environment for our own benefit. We havebeen trained to mentally shut down when faced with fear. We try to force theworld to be the way we want by simply refusing to look at the truth. As aplanet, letting go of the fear is of critical importance because there isstrength in numbers. Millions of people are now learning about these problemsand exposing the truth on the Internet and elsewhere. There is no knock on thedoor that follows, no government agents following you in unmarked vehicles, andno midnight abductions. The truth has become so widespread now that the myth ofBig Brother cannot be maintained. Once we realize the strength we have innumbers, there is no possible way for the activities of the negative elite toremain hidden, even if the mainstream media is too afraid to discuss them. I dofeel we are very close to a tipping point at the time of this writing in April2013. Once we fearlessly educate ourselves about the truth, we can directlybecome a part of the solution—rather than perpetuating the problem.SEEKING WORLD DOMINATION—THROUGH THE MAGIC PRINTING PRESSIf World War I and World War II were, in fact, some sort of global magic trick,in which both sides were financed by the same international bankers, what werethey really doing? As I wrote in my full-length online book, Financial Tyranny,the goal was nothing other than world domination.180[part0034.html#chapter005fn180] Power is a drug, an elixir, the thirst for whichcannot be quenched in the sociopathic mind. The most important key tocontrolling the world would be to control its finances. By creating a “globalreserve currency” such as the US dollar, which was backed by nothing more thanhot air, it would be possible to artificially inflate and deflate the value ofmoney—just as Senator Ron Paul has argued that the Federal Reserve has beendoing for a century.If any country held a significant amount of gold, in either the hands of privateowners or its central bank, that country could completely defeat the plan for aone-world currency—simply by printing gold-backed money. The people wouldnaturally prefer a currency they could redeem for solid gold over a currencythat wasn’t backed by anything but the “faith and credit” of the government thatissued it. So in order for any plan of global control to work, it would benecessary to systematically steal the gold from any and every country, group, orprivate individual who could stand in the way of the “magic printing press.”Once you can create money out of thin air, you have achieved the ultimate magictrick on earth. You can write numbers on a piece of paper, hand that paper tosomeone, and get real wealth in return.HELD FOR “SAFEKEEPING”—BY THE FEDERAL RESERVEMost of the countries that were invaded in World War I and World War II hadtheir central banks broken into, and their gold reserves were plundered. Veryfew of them were aware, or could even imagine, that the biggest enemies fightingagainst each other in these wars were actually being financed by the samepeople—at the highest levels. Many countries, fearing their own invasions, puttheir gold on deposit with the Federal Reserve in the United States, for“safekeeping.”181 [part0034.html#chapter005fn181] This next excerpt from RussiaToday spells it out very nicely.The total value of the New York Federal Reserve’s gold bullion trove of 6700tonnes is a staggering $368.5 billion. But according to the New York FederalReserve: “We do not own the gold. We are mere custodians.” The gold is in“safekeeping” on behalf of more than 60 sovereign countries and a feworganizations. Close to 98 per cent of the gold bullion stored in the NY Fed’slower Manhattan vaults, according to the Fed, belongs to central banks offoreign countries.182 [part0034.html#chapter005fn182]A plan like this seems to be completely ridiculous, audacious, and impossible toachieve. In order to explain it properly, an entire book is required—and that iswhy I wrote Financial Tyranny and several other supporting investigations beforeI came back to finish The Synchronicity Key. Seizing the world’s gold was onemajor goal of this shadowy group, which we could call the Cabal—and which manyothers call the Illuminati. A second and equally important goal of this groupwas to create international alliances, which could eventually unify into a newworld order run by a single, world government that the Cabal would then control.These two Law of One quotes, from sessions 11 and 50, reveal the negativeIlluminati mind-set.11.18 Those [of the negative path try]…to disseminate the attitudes andphilosophy of their particular understanding of the Law of One, which is serviceto self. These become the elite. Through these, the attempt begins to create acondition whereby the remainder of the planetary entities are enslaved—by theirown free will.183 [part0034.html#chapter005fn183]50.6 The negatively oriented being will be one who feels that it has found powerthat gives meaning to its existence—precisely as the positive polarization doesfeel. This negative entity will strive to offer these understandings toother-selves, most usually by the process of forming the elite, the disciples,and teaching the need and rightness of the enslavement of other-selves for theirown good. These other-selves are conceived to be dependent upon the self—and inneed of the guidance and the wisdom of the self.184[part0034.html#chapter005fn184]THE BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTSIf World War I and World War II were both “magic tricks” on an unimaginablescale, using the violence and bloodshed of massive staged conflicts as a coverto break into and plunder the world’s central banks, where did all the gold andtreasure end up going? Apparently, many of the leaders of the invaded andplundered countries actually did know where their gold went. It was secretly puton “deposit” with a shadowy international conglomerate called the Bank forInternational Settlements (BIS). The BIS was formed by the Federal Reservebanks—which sought to expand their control of financial systems to a globalscale. The leaders were told that whatever they “deposited” in the bank wouldstill be theirs and would secretly be used to underwrite the value of theircurrency. Although it would appear that their central banks were printing “fiat”currency, backed by nothing but hot air, in reality every currency was backed byits own precious metals, which were on “deposit” with the BIS. In addition,these countries were given Federal Reserve bonds—often in astronomicaldenominations—as collateral for their “deposits.” Single pieces of paper couldbe worth as much as $100 million or even $1 billion—and were apparentlyredeemable at the Federal Reserve. Beginning on December 1, 2011, I was senthundreds of pictures of these Federal Reserve bonds—as well as the boxes andchests they were stored in—and published them as a world exclusive soonafterward.[../images/00014.jpeg]Fig. 7 [part0006.html#l7]: Alleged Federal Reserve bond with face value of onebillion dollarsTHE WEALTH OF NATIONSWhy would these world leaders ever agree to such a ridiculous-sounding plan? Whywould they allow their treasuries to be emptied and put on “deposit” with asecret world bank run by the Federal Reserve? Apparently, each leader wassecretly asked to read The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, written in 1776.185[part0034.html#chapter005fn185] The alliance told me that the Cabal specificallyordered the writing of this document—and paid Smith very well. Smith’s epictreatise argued that the world would never enjoy true peace and prosperity ifany country or private group held large amounts of gold or treasure. Several keyreasons were given.For example, any country with gold in its central bank would be a target forinvasion by other countries. Let’s say the country measured the value of itsmoney by how much gold it had in storage. If that gold was stolen and moved toanother country, the first country’s entire economy would collapse. The mostviolent and powerful countries would quickly become the wealthiest countries aswell—which would only further increase their power. Another argument was thatmore and more people will be born, or immigrate, within any given country. Oncethese people go to work, they will create new wealth. This requires thegovernment to print more money to prevent inflation. If the value of thatcountry’s money is based on gold, its economy will increasingly be at risk ofcollapse as more workers appear. If a country cannot increase its overall goldsupply at the same speed at which its economy is growing, it will take greaterand greater amounts of money to buy the same amount of gold. Eventually thiswill create a catastrophic deflation of the value of currency, much like what wesaw in the Weimar Republic of Germany, where people needed an entire wheelbarrowfull of cash to buy a loaf of bread.A MASSIVE, WORLDWIDE BANK ROBBERYIn his epic book, Gold Warriors,186 [part0034.html#chapter005fn186] SterlingSeagrave reveals that the world’s gold began to be confiscated on a mass levelin 1895, when the Japanese invaded Korea and plundered their central banks. (Thealliance has now revealed that Japan was armed and financed as a British Empireproxy state ever since the Meiji Restoration in 1868.) The Wall Street–fundedBolsheviks confiscated all Russian gold in the development of the Soviet Unionbetween 1917 and 1922,187 [part0034.html#chapter005fn187] and they covertlyturned it over to the Federal Reserve. Those who did not surrender their goldwillingly had it taken from them by force. In Operation Golden Lily, in the1920s and 1930s, the Japanese systematically cleared out all the Chinese andAsian gold on a truly industrial scale,188 [part0034.html#chapter005fn188] andsecretly turned it over to the Federal Reserve. Private ownership of gold wasmade illegal in America on April 5, 1933, with the passage of Executive Order6102.189 [part0034.html#chapter005fn189] Violation of the order was punishableby a fine of up to $10,000, a prison sentence of up to ten years, or both. Likethe Japanese and the Bolsheviks, the Nazis and the Americans also emptied thegold from the central banks of countries they occupied in World War II. All thisgold ended up being pooled into the Federal Reserve / BIS and hidden away—muchof it buried in bunkers throughout Southeast Asia. According to the insiders Ispoke with, 85 percent of the gold that ended up in the BIS was taken from Asia.And here was the key: Without gold, no country could ever compete against the“magic printing press” of paper money, backed by nothing but “faith and credit.”Any group that could print money out of thin air had practically limitlesspower.If this sounds like a wild story that most people would dismiss as conspiracytheory—or the makings of a great political thriller film—you’d be absolutelyright. That didn’t change the fact that it was all based on rigorously provableinformation. I synthesized more than nineteen years’ worth of research andinsider testimony on this subject in Financial Tyranny, a full-length book thatI released on my website, for free, beginning on January 13, 2012, and that hashad nearly a million views as of April 2013.190 [part0034.html#chapter005fn190]This was a very stressful process, as I was told that the things I was writingabout were considered far more classified than the UFO subject—and could easilyget me killed.LIFE AND DEATHOn Wednesday, December 14, 2011, I received a death threat from a veryhigh-level source, but I continued the investigation. Two weeks later, onDecember 31, 2011, David Hutzler sent me critical information from the alliance,directing me to a treasure trove of hidden data on the Unwanted PublicityIntelligence website. This included many pictures of Federal Reserve bonds, aswell as the boxes and chests they were buried in for safekeeping. A week later,on January 6, 2012, David Hutzler and his son Mackie each suffered multiplegunshot wounds in their home—which then burned down.191[part0034.html#chapter005fn191]By this point I had been recording my dreams every morning for twenty years andhad gained incredible benefit from this practice. Many of my dreams had urged meto conduct this investigation and had clearly indicated that I would beprotected if I did. This was further supported by an ongoing number ofphenomenal synchronicities. I already had quite an extensive legacy of accurateprophecies from my dreams—some of which I had documented on my website. However,this was no dream—this was reality. I was directly standing up to what manypeople considered the most dangerous and destructive force on earth. Most peoplecouldn’t even handle the idea of a single unified group that had controlled theFederal Reserve: running the United States, the United Kingdom, the USSR, Japan,Italy, the Nazi Party, and several top European countries. I had to take anenormous leap of faith—and put my life on the line. If I had trusted myfeelings, they would have told me that doing something like this didn’t feelgood. If I had trusted my thoughts, they would have told me the whole idea wascrazy. However, when I listened to the deep, inner voice—at my core—by trustingmy dreams, and looking at all the synchronicities that were happening, I knewthis had to be right. Even if David and Mackie Hutzler had been killed becauseof the information that had been passed to me, I would still complete theinvestigation. I released the finished product, Financial Tyranny, a week aftertheir deaths, on January 13, 2012.192 [part0034.html#chapter005fn192]In the process of writing Financial Tyranny, I had completely missed thedeadline for The Synchronicity Key—and barely even had enough time to start it.I had a core of great material, but no matter how hard I tried, for almost anentire year after publishing Financial Tyranny, I simply could not break throughthe writer’s block. I had originally wanted to share some elements of my ownpersonal journey and had felt very strongly about that. However, once I startedpursuing the Financial Tyranny investigation, the number of viciouslythreatening emails and website comments I was receiving went way, way up.Then, on Easter Sunday in April 2012, a friend of mine died a tragic, violentdeath, right around the corner from my house.193 [part0034.html#chapter005fn193]There was no way to prove that any individual or group may have caused it tohappen, but it was still extremely sad. The police could not immediatelyidentify the body even though my friend had a driver’s license in his wallet.Even after suffering this tragedy, I continued reading all of my mail, and not aday went by when I didn’t see at least two or three very hateful, sarcastic, anddemeaning letters, directed at me personally. This was less than 1 percent ofall of the mail, but I still read every one of them, trying to gain whatevervalue I might find in their arguments. Then, on Friday, June 22, 2012, one of mytop insiders, an old-timer with access to highly classified information, wasnearly poisoned to death by a strange bioweapon.194[part0034.html#chapter005fn194] I still continued reading every nasty letterthat came in, without allowing anyone to screen them for me, until I finallycouldn’t take anymore in August 2012. Even if some people refused to believeanything I was saying, I knew that lives had been lost and the risks were veryreal. I no longer chose to subject myself to a constant barrage of hatred andanger from the skeptics in my audience.After my friend’s tragic death in April 2012, I wanted all the hate to stop. Ifelt like I needed to do whatever I could to avoid being shamed, criticized, andhumiliated—even as I was doing my very best to help the planet. I soon becamedreadfully opposed to saying a single word about myself in the new book. Ideleted every page I had written about my own experiences, about synchronicity,about the law of karma, and anything else along those lines. Instead, I startedcreating another scientific tour de force—right from page one. I didn’t want toleave a single hole in the entire argument that wasn’t rigorously backed up withsolid facts. That way, even if people wanted to hate me and attack the book,there would be no real ground for them to stand on. However, I continued tosuffer through massive stress—and a total writer’s block.I took an extended sabbatical in the Canadian Rocky Mountains beginning onSeptember 2, 2012, hoping—and promising—that I could finish the book. The stressof having such a massive project hanging over my head, unfinished, was tearingme apart. Instead of writing, I now found myself going through an elaborategrieving process.195 [part0034.html#chapter005fn195] I finally had the time andspace necessary to let go of all the stress and pain I’d felt from the FinancialTyranny investigation—the tragic deaths, failed assassination attempts, anddeath threats—and return to a place of balance and peace within myself. I spenta lot of time reading and reacquainting myself with the Law of One series forthe first time in many years. Now that I had done my homework, many newconnections jumped out at me, and my passion for the work was reinvigorated.Those new connections would end up directly helping me write this book.THINKING AND FEELING CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMAfter I came home, I had a long conversation with Dr. Victor Vernon Woolf, thefounder of holodynamics theory and the author of ten books.196[part0034.html#chapter005fn196] Vern Woolf specializes in healing post-traumaticstress disorder, or PTSD, using an innovative method that is completelydifferent from conventional psychoanalysis. His techniques were originallydeveloped with the Academy of Natural Sciences in Russia. Vern’s groupeventually created support chapters in more than one hundred different Russiancities. More than six hundred trained and certified holodynamics teachers helpedheal people from unfathomable traumas, end the Cold War, and transform theSoviet Union, as his techniques were directly reaching people in the highestlevels of the Russian government.I have Vern to thank for pointing out that thinking and feeling can never solveour problems—individually or globally. It is only through being—awakening to thefull and direct experience of this moment—that we can release old pains, see theanswer to all problems, and heal traumas that otherwise seemed to be permanentscars. For me, the “meaningful coincidence” of synchronicity has been one of themost consistent forces that have focused me into the present moment, in all ofits glory and wonder.By the end of my conversation with Vern, I realized I did not need to writeanother book that was strictly scientific in nature. When I stepped back andwent into a place of being, I realized that my whole life had been showing methe answer. Not everything can be proven. Some of it has to be experienced.Synchronicity transcends thought and brings us directly into the world of thespirit.HERE COMES THE CAVALRYLess than two weeks after I finally saw what I had to do and broke through mywriter’s block, I was contacted by REN-TV—one of the largest TV networks inRussia that is not owned and run by the government. Their estimated viewingaudience is as high as 138 million people in Russia and the former Sovietrepublics. Much to my amazement, not only had they read Financial Tyranny, butthey also considered it a masterpiece and were building an entire three-hourdocumentary film around it for prime-time television. In mid-December, right aswe headed toward the Mayan calendar end date of December 21, 2012, REN-TV filmedme answering eleven different questions on this controversial subject. Then inlate December, I was filmed again for another three-hour exclusive, and thistime they had thirty more questions that showed they had thoroughly studied thebook. The first three-hour documentary aired on January 16, 2013—just three daysafter the date I’d published Financial Tyranny the year before.On the very same day this show aired—January 16, 2013—Germany shocked the worldby demanding that the Federal Reserve return 300 metric tons of its gold. Thecountry’s leaders also insisted that France return all 374 metric tons of itsgold that was being held at the Banque de France.197[part0034.html#chapter005fn197] This was a direct act of war, in the financialsense. It was also a surprising confirmation of what UK politician and EuropeanParliament member Nigel Farage had said in an interview on December 14, 2012:“Everything from George Orwell’s 1984 is coming into being…. There are certainlyseveral American commentators pointing out that there may well be, in terms ofgold reserves and their reality, a huge fraud going on.”198[part0034.html#chapter005fn198]According to my contacts within the alliance, this statement from a majorBritish politician had utterly infuriated and terrified the Cabal, sending theminto a true panic. The second REN-TV documentary, Shadow Gold, aired on January30, 2013, and covered the material in Financial Tyranny even more closely thanthe first episode did.199 [part0034.html#chapter005fn199]Then on February 4, 2013, the mysterious hacker group Anonymous posted privatedata from four thousand different Federal Reserve executives’ accounts—includingprivate contact information, mobile phone numbers, account log-ins, IPaddresses, and credentials.200 [part0034.html#chapter005fn200] A Reddit userstarted calling the numbers, confirmed they were Federal Reserve executives, andsaid, “The ramifications of that kind of loss of control are severe.”201[part0034.html#chapter005fn201] A few weeks later, a key insider revealed thatAnonymous was collaborating with patriotic computer experts within the USmilitary, and this was all part of their coordinated effort to defend theConstitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Just twenty-four daysafter the Federal Reserve was hacked, Pope Benedict XVI resigned—which was thefirst time such an event had happened in more than six hundred years. The verytop of the Vatican dome was struck by lightning that same evening, and the eventwas filmed and photographed. I saw this as an astonishingly powerful example ofsynchronicity, appearing on a truly global scale, and wrote an entire articleabout it on my website.202 [part0034.html#chapter005fn202] The lightning-strucktower is one of twenty-two archetypes described in the Law of One series asblueprints written into the mind of the galaxy that we all must go through. Itis also known as the “dark night of the soul.” The image associated with thisarchetype is lightning striking a tower and a king and queen falling to theirdeaths. The lightning bolt represents pure universal energy interfering in ourdaily lives, destroying all corruption—even at the highest levels of government,religion, military, finance, and media. This moment represents the very bottomof the Wheel of Karma—when all the negative things we’ve done are returned to usin our own lives.What you are about to read goes far beyond political conspiracies. I do believethat what we are seeing is part of a much bigger and ultimately far moreimportant story of our own spiritual evolution as a planet into a Golden Age ofpeace, prosperity, and higher consciousness. The “negative elite,” as they arecalled in the Law of One series, help awaken us to the fact that the realitywe’ve been led to believe in is an illusion, and the truth is much stranger thanfiction."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOENTERING THEMAGICAL WORLD[../images/00015.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXKARMA IS REALAs the Wheel of Karma keeps turning, we experience the highest highs and thelowest lows that life has to offer us. Our lives continue cycling through joyand disaster, pleasure and pain, triumph and upset, light and darkness. Theevents we go through can be so upsetting, so traumatizing, that we oftenwillingly blind ourselves to the greatest truth of all: The world we think weare living in is an illusion. Life is not random. Actions have consequences. Wedo not live in a vacuum. There are no private thoughts. We are here to learn tolove each other. Whatever we measure out to others will be measured out in turnto us—as consistently and inevitably as the law of gravity keeps us tethered tothe earth. For those who have already seen the truth, it is obvious. It may evenseem like a kindergarten-level spiritual teaching. For those who have beenunwilling to see the truth, nothing could seem more ludicrous.The ancient Sanskrit word karman means “action,” “effect,” and “fate.” Themeaning encompasses both action and reaction—causes and consequences. The wordkarma also appears in the Hindu language, where it translates closer to the word“work” and involves the effort we make on a soul level to reunify with ourhighest and truest essence.203 [part0034.html#chapter006fn203] Karma is onesimple word that expresses the concept of “what goes around, comesaround”—whatever we create is what we will then experience. Many of the eventsthat happen to us—including the most wonderful and the most seeminglydisastrous—are not random at all. Invisible forces are constantly at work,shaping and arranging whatever will then unfold in our lives. Karma does appearto be enforcing an absolute law, which is upheld throughout the universe—the lawof free will. If we honor and support the free will of others, we are choosinglove, and if we manipulate the free will of others, we are choosing the path ofcontrol. Everything we think, say, and do is being evaluated on an unseenlevel—by ourselves and by others—to see whether we are choosing love or control.The events that happen in our lives are not random; they are the direct resultsof the choices we are making. If you choose to shame, humiliate, disrespect, anddemean others—to manipulate and control them for your own gain—then a verysimilar set of experiences will happen to you. The people in the Cabal are notfree from this eternal system by any means. If you cause pain, you will feelpain. If you choose to deny others’ feelings, then others will deny yourfeelings. If you create love—even in a situation where it seems ignorant orimpossible to do so—then love will indeed be returned to you. Best of all, theentire Wheel of Karma can be stopped through forgiveness. These upsetting eventskeep repeating only until we learn the greatest teaching of the universe—that weare all one, and there is only identity. Once you delve into this new realityand observe it happening in your life firsthand, you may soon realize that noneof us are exempt from this system of accounting, regardless of whatever we mayor may not believe. After you become aware of karma and watch it play out manyhundreds, if not thousands, of times in your own life, it can become quiteastounding to see how stubborn and unwilling some people are to see it, even inthose cases where it should be blatantly obvious.INSTANT KARMAA few years ago I heard about an example of karma that was so profound it wasalmost a joke, had the circumstances not been so tragic. If I were to put thesescenes in a screenplay, any professional script consultant would say they had tobe cut, as the whole story seems just too outrageous to believe. A friend ofmine was raising two toddlers on her own, working a full-time job just to getby, leaving the kids in day care while working, and struggling to make enoughmoney to survive. I could not afford to help her at the time, nor did she ask mefor any financial assistance. The father had run out on his family and had beenordered by the court to pay child support. He refused to get a job becauseworking didn’t feel good. For months, he paid nothing, causing my friend towonder whether she should take legal action. Finally he agreed to pay a ratherlarge lump-sum amount, which, secretly, he borrowed from his father. He acquiredthe money, in cash, and said he was coming right over to drop it off.Then she didn’t hear from him for two days. Finally, he told her the cash hadbeen stolen out of his car. It was a tragedy. He now felt that he didn’t have topay her back, as this was a horrible crime, and he obviously shouldn’t be forcedto earn the same money twice. The next day, he was driving a brand-new car, ablack SUV. He refused to talk about how he had acquired the SUV—he justcompletely shut her down. That very same night, the vehicle skidded off theroad, rolled sideways down the hill like a barrel, and was destroyed beyondrepair. Somehow he was unharmed, but this accident triggered communication thatwould have seemed impossible before then. His father reconnected with my friend,told her he had given his son the cash, and was absolutely certain that his sonhad used it to make a down payment for a new SUV at the dealership. I neverfound out what happened between the father and the son after this, but Istrongly suspect it wasn’t pretty.In another case, I was living in Virginia Beach, right under the flight path ofF-18 Hornet jets coming in to land at Naval Air Station Oceana. The noise was soloud that you literally felt like the sky was tearing open, and it happenedthroughout the day, from eight A.M. to ten P.M. I didn’t realize until after Isigned the lease that this was why it was so inexpensive to live there. Thecouple who lived next door to me were severe alcoholics. Night after night, theywould sit out on their porch drinking, with their chairs facing the road, andscream profanities at each other. I did my best to try to bring joy into theirlives when I spoke to them. However, I couldn’t help but feel like the law ofkarma was going to strike, and there was no way this horrible situation could goon. The stress of hearing them fight every night was tearing me to pieces.One day, a huge boa constrictor appeared in their bathroom, wrapped around thetoilet. “Do you think this means something?” the woman asked me. “Yeah, you maywant to look at that,” I answered. I saw this snake as a manifestation ofsynchronicity, giving them a direct warning of karmic danger if they didn’tchange their behavior. Then, on December 29, 1999, I had a terrifying nightmarein which a ghost-like woman would periodically show up: “When she would show up,everything would seem to slow down and pause, and it was extremely dramatic,just like a tunnel-vision scene in a horror movie with the scary music in thebackground.”204 [part0034.html#chapter006fn204] No one wanted to look at her oreven acknowledge she was there, despite the horror and the intensity of herappearance, and the self-harming things she would then do: “She just looked verysad as she mutilated herself in front of me, blood and debris flying. And Iwondered what she was so upset about, but I wasn’t making any connections. Noone else seemed to even be able to see her besides me.” As time went on, she didfinally get the people to see her, but she was still completely ignored. “Evenas she was horrifyingly mutilating her own body and staring you dead in the eyethe whole time that she was doing it, they tried to act like she totally didn’texist.” Eventually I figured out that she was doing these damaging things toherself in order to try to awaken others to their own negative behaviors. Herfinal appearance in the dream was the most dramatic: “the woman had a fryingpan, and there was fire coming up. She looked like she was going to stick herhead in the frying pan several times to try to prove her point.” I then realizedthat she represented karma: “She was capable of projecting an image of herselfgoing in, looking at people and then doing these horrible things to herself. Andobviously, it was designed to make them realize that they were really inflictingthis exact same harm upon themselves.”205 [part0034.html#chapter006fn205]The screaming continued, almost every night, until January 24, 2000. That night,the man living above them fell asleep with a lit cigarette. This soon ignited afire, and when the awakened man threw water on it, the flames only grew worse,since electrical lines had become exposed in the blaze. I awoke to the sounds ofscreaming outside my front door—and when I opened it, all I could see was asolid wall of smoke, from top to bottom. The couple and I stood helplesslyoutside and watched their house burn as the fire department tried to fight theblaze. In the end, they had to completely saturate it from the highest point,ruining everything inside that wasn’t already destroyed by fire and smoke. TheRed Cross stepped in to help them, as they had lost everything they owned. Inever saw them again. I immediately realized that my dream had predicted thewhole event, in precise detail, less than a month earlier—and I wrote it all upon my website.206 [part0034.html#chapter006fn206] My dream suggested that theirhouse fire was a visible manifestation of the anger and violence they weredisplaying toward each other, night after night. The universe was trying to gettheir attention—in a very dramatic fashion.SECRETS OF SHAMANISMIn my own experience, bad karma has become so easy to identify that I almostalways see a cause-and-effect relationship between the thoughts I am having andthe experiences that result. The final tipping point that got me to identifythis system and see how often bad karma was affecting me came when I readSecrets of Shamanism: Tapping the Spirit Power Within You by Jose and Lena S.Stevens.207 [part0034.html#chapter006fn207] Having this system explained to meby a doctor of psychology and his wife, with such clarity, precision, andconfidence, allowed me to open my mind to the possibility that it was real. Iwas only sixteen years old at the time—and this knowledge soon generatedprofound insights and personal experiences.In the following twenty-four years, I have had literally thousands of cases whenI’ve had an unloving thought about someone and allowed myself to focus on thatfeeling of anger and judgment, only to have a sudden accident or injury. I cutmyself with a knife. I stub my toe. I burn myself. I bite on my fork the wrongway and hurt my teeth. I bite my tongue and taste blood. An animal dashes outinto the road and I have to swerve to avoid it. My favorite drinking glassshatters in the sink after I lose my grip. I nick myself shaving. I get apainful splinter. Dust flies into my eye. I get bitten by an insect. I bump intoa heavy book on the edge of the table, and it crashes down and hits my foot. Islip in the shower and painfully bang my elbow against the glass, and almost gethurt much worse. I write a check, feeling disgusted about paying what I owe, andget a paper cut right as I tear it out of the checkbook. A whole plate of oilyfood slips off the table and falls in my lap, ruining my favorite shirt and adecent pair of pants. I have managed to avoid the more serious types ofaccidents and injuries by being extremely careful about the thoughts I think—andparticularly how I treat others—but many people get much stronger blasts ofkarma than I have described here.The key, as Dr. and Mrs. Stevens’s book explains, is to remember what you werethinking about right before the accident happened. Until you train yourself todo this reliably, you will be easily distracted by the incident itself. Yourattention suddenly dashes over to this new problem that has just crashed in onyou. Now your heart is pounding, your breathing accelerates, blood rushes toyour brain, and you become hypervigilant, hyperaware, and usually very annoyed.This sudden surge of anger and frustration can immediately erase whateverthoughts you were having right before the accident. The key, whenever somethinglike this happens, is to not let this painful and annoying event distract you ifat all possible. Keep your mind as calm as you can, and do your best to rememberwhatever you were just thinking about. With very little practice, thecause-and-effect relationship between your thoughts and your experiences willbecome obvious. Not all karma is instantaneous like this, but a surprisinglylarge amount of it is.It’s also important to point out that many of these cases of bad karma werecaused by the movement of my own body. I might not be aware of it on anyconscious level, but my subconscious mind seems to have been directly involvedin making the painful event happen. My body was influenced to move a certainway—with a little nudge I was completely unaware of—and I then cut my finger,stubbed my toe, burned myself, bit my fork, bit my tongue, dropped my favoriteglass, nicked myself shaving, got a splinter, had dust fly in my eye, bumpedinto the heavy book, slipped in the shower, got a paper cut, or dropped oilyfood all over my shirt and pants. Other events like the animal running into theroad, the insect biting me or dust flying into my eye could ultimately be theresult of our existence within a living universe. We may discover that a widevariety of non-physical entities are conspiring to help us awaken, and canmanipulate our environment to help convey these messages. Similarly, my friend’sex-husband with the SUV may have subconsciously jerked the wheel or driven rightinto an area of loose gravel, causing his new car to roll off the road.Once you begin studying your own daily experiences, you can easily prove thatthese types of experiences are happening to you. Although bad karma can be veryannoying and can cause you to feel humiliated, judged, and criticized by someinvisible force, it can also be quite fascinating. The world you thought youknew is not the world you are actually living in. Once you realize this, youcan’t help but start paying attention to it. Some part of you, on a subconsciouslevel, has an absolute code of ethics and morality, regardless of whatever youmay believe on the conscious level. You can fight, cry, screech, yell, blameothers, and cast yourself as the tortured, helpless victim, but it’s no use. Youcan reason, bargain, and rationalize that you are a good person, you do plentyof good things for others, and therefore you don’t deserve this, but it stillhappens. Sooner or later your ego will drop down a few notches, and you learn tostop complaining and start trying to understand both the bad karma and thecompassion that is behind it. Karma may not seem like it could possibly be agood thing, but ageless wisdom has the answer.JEHOSHUA AND THE TEACHINGS OF HELL, SALVATION, ETERNITY, AND SINMost Bible scholars agree that the most accurate name for Jesus, from theoriginal Aramaic, is Yeshua.208 [part0034.html#chapter006fn208] This becameIesous (ee-yay-sous) in Greek—and this word was further changed into Jesus. TheLaw of One series said that the closest and most accurate pronunciation isJehoshua.209 [part0034.html#chapter006fn209] Many Christians believe Jehoshuataught that there is a place called Hell—perhaps below the surface of theearth—in which anyone who has not converted to Christianity will burn in a lakeof fire for all eternity. In a living universe of loving consciousness, it seemsvery unlikely that any soul would be singled out for eternal abuse, since thereis only identity, and its core essence is love. Now, a rising movement of Biblescholars is going back to the original scriptures to look for direct evidence,rather than simply believing the prevailing opinions of the day.W. L. Graham’s Bible Reality Check website has an amazingly comprehensive bodyof scholarship that all Christians should be aware of. Graham is a Christian andendorses the core religious principles. Graham has also revealed many keydifferences between the beliefs of most Christians and what modern linguisticand scholarly research has actually found in the scriptures. The article “A CaseAgainst Hell” reveals that the entire concept of Hell is built from very flimsyevidence and is absent from the Old Testament altogether.210[part0034.html#chapter006fn210] The Hebrew word that is translated as “Hell” inmost Bibles today is sheol, which means “grave.” The word sheol appears onlythirty-one times in the entire Old Testament. Sheol, the grave, is whereeveryone must go—regardless of how they lived their lives. God does not warnAdam and Eve about there being a Hell if they eat from the Tree of Knowledge ofGood and Evil—only that this action would cause death. Cain is not warned aboutHell. Nor are the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Moses does not warn of therebeing a Hell in the Ten Commandments—or in more than six hundred warnings, laws,and ordinances in the Mosaic Law. Some of the most noted Bible scholars,including William Barclay, John A. T. Robinson, F. W. Farrar, and MarvinVincent, agree that the modern concept of Hell does not appear in any Hebrew orGreek text from these same time periods.211 [part0034.html#chapter006fn211]In the New Testament, Jehoshua occasionally used the Greek word Gehenna todescribe what will happen to us if we engage in negative, self-servingbehaviors. The first time Gehenna is mentioned is in the Sermon on the Mount—inMatthew 5:22, 5:29–30. Jehoshua clearly warns us that we are in danger ofGehenna for something as simple as calling someone else a fool. ModernChristians would never believe that such a mundane insult to another human beingwould sentence you to burn in Hell for all eternity, but it’s right there in thebook of Matthew, since Gehenna is now being translated as “Hell.” Oftentimes,people read the Bible only to confirm what they already believe rather thanconsidering the material on its own merits and analyzing the original meaningsof what Jehoshua and others actually said. Importantly, the same word root forGehenna is not translated as “Hell” when it appears in the Old Testament Hebrewas ga ben Hinnom—the valley of the son of Hinnom.This valley was admittedly a horrible place; it started out as a location wherechildren were sacrificed to the owl-god Moloch. Over time, the ritual murdersstopped and Gehenna became the main garbage dump for the entire city. Deadbodies and all types of filth were routinely burned there. Gehenna was thereforea necessary place for cleansing and purifying the land through fire. Thisappears to be the deeper meaning of the metaphor Jehoshua was using. The thirddefinition of the word Gehenna in the World English Dictionary is “a place orstate of pain and torment.”212 [part0034.html#chapter006fn212] Therefore, whenJehoshua said that calling someone a fool will bring you through Gehenna, hemeant that causing pain and torment to others would cause similar pain andtorment in your own life as a form of purification. Many people still refer tokarma as something you have to “burn off,” and this appears to be a directcontinuation of the symbolism used by Jehoshua. The concept of karma was alsoexpressed with the classic phrase, “As you sow, so shall you reap” (Galatians6:7). Therefore, Gehenna is one instance in which Jehoshua’s frequent use ofsymbolism and metaphor seems to have been wildly misconstrued.This is only the beginning of the argument Graham and other Bible scholars madeto suggest that the concept of Hell was entirely fabricated and is not supportedby the texts. In another key example from the New Testament, the apostle Pauldeclares in Acts 20:27 that he had revealed the entire counsel of God. However,Paul never once mentioned Hell in any of his letters. The only possibleexception in some Bible translations is where Paul is quoted as saying thatJehoshua triumphed over Hell in 1 Corinthians 15:55, but here, the Greek wordtranslates as “the grave.” This is the same word that is mistranslated in theOld Testament as “Hell” and was originally written as sheol.Similarly, the term saved has been misunderstood, though it is still a veryimportant spiritual concept. The New Testament Greek words for saved are sozoand soteria. These words have a variety of definitions and include the conceptsof being rescued, delivered, healed, and saved from danger. These words appearthroughout the New Testament in a variety of different contexts. Spiritualteachings such as Jehoshua gave, therefore, can rescue and deliver us from thedanger of Gehenna—from the fires of karma that burn out our impurities—byrevealing what life on earth is here to teach us.Another frequently mistranslated word is eternity. The Old Testament word isolam—and there are many places in the Bible where it clearly refers to lengthsof time that are much shorter than forever. This includes the length of a king’slife, the amount of time Jonah spent in the belly of the whale, the duration ofman’s earthly existence, the amount of time a child was supposed to spend in thetemple, the amount of time a servant was expected to spend working for hismaster, and the amount of time David was intended to be king of Israel. Each ofthese examples indicate a particular cycle of time. The Greek equivalent of olamis aion, which means “age,” or a cycle of time. This is where we get the modernEnglish word eon from. This “age” could potentially include one of the Ages ofthe Zodiac but clearly refers to much shorter time cycles as well. The Biblealso uses the words aionian and aionios, which refer to the same time cyclerepeating itself. In any other Greek document from the time of the NewTestament, the word aion did not mean “eternity” or “forever.” Plato, Aristotle,Homer, Hippocrates, and many other scholars used the word aion to indicate muchshorter periods of time.The word sin translates as a transgression of divine law—particularly a willfulor deliberate violation of a moral or religious principle.213[part0034.html#chapter006fn213] Although this word is considerably outdated foranyone who is not a Christian, a sin would be anything that violates the freewill of others. Jehoshua’s original message, therefore, was that if you violateothers’ free will, you will have to go through a cycle of purification—orGehenna—for a given cycle, or aion, of time. This is much different than themodern, mistranslated idea that you will “burn in hell for all eternity.” Onceyou understand what is happening to you—and the love that is ultimately fuelingthese karmic events—you can be saved (sozo) from having to repeat these cycles(aionios) of misery, suffering, and pain (Gehenna). The key to stopping theWheel of Karma is forgiveness.RELIGION AS A TOOL FOR STRENGTHENING GOVERNMENTAL POWERHow did these mistranslations come into being? Let’s not forget thatChristianity was a government-sponsored religion by an empire that was indecline and scrambling for power. The life and teachings of Jehoshua could notbe stopped, so the empire’s best move would be to seize all the wealth ofexisting documents, integrate them into one source, and declare that source tobe the definitive word of God. This is precisely what Emperor Constantine I ofRome did in A.D. 325, with the Council of Nicaea. Anything that was deemedcontrary to Constantine I’s will was thrown out of the New Testament, includinga series of gospels written by people who walked with Jehoshua and witnessed histeachings as they were happening. Insiders who worked for the Cabal at highlevels of secrecy told me Constantine I therefore considered himself to be the“God the Father” who is referred to in the Old and New Testament and believed hewas superior to Jehoshua. The Cabal has a very negative view of Christianity,and therefore shares this ancient secret with pride among its own membership.Graduate-level theological textbooks still debate whether Constantine I wasguided by the will of God when he outvoted the group and threw out the twodissenting bishops, even though the original idea was that the unanimousconsensus view of the council would be considered the will of God. The People ofthe Secret by Ernest Scott features an ironic quote about this event.Unanimity was essential if the inspiration of the Holy Spirit was to be claimedfor the Council’s conclusions. Both unanimity and the approval of deity werematters of personal concern to Constantine, and he proceeded to ensure both bythe simple expedient of having the two dissenting Bishops removed from themeeting. Thus the datum point of Christianity for the next 1,500 years seems tohave been decided by nothing more than an overt act of politicalgamesmanship.214 [part0034.html#chapter006fn214]The concept of an eternal hellfire is very useful for a government seeking toestablish a religion it could use to crush any and all resistance. Mergingchurch and state is also the best way to ensure that people pay high taxes—inthe form of “indulgences” that are tithed to the church, since the church isalso the government. (In the case of Christianity, this merger of church andstate did not successfully occur until A.D. 720.) The more harm people feel theyhave done to others, the more money they will likely decide to pay to ensurethey spend the rest of eternity in a heavenly paradise. The fear of thealternative—an eternal torture of unimaginable suffering—would be a veryeffective way to keep the people under control. It also could be used to justifythe concept of holy war, because anyone outside the group, anyone who doesn’tbelieve what the group does, is already condemned to a hideous madness of fear,torture, and pain for all eternity. If you already know your enemies are goingto a place of perpetual horror, you can justify unspeakable atrocities becauseyou’ve already categorized them as nonpersons.A MESSENGER OF THE ONE CREATORThe Law of One series endorsed the teachings of Jehoshua and said that hismission was fully approved and endorsed by the angelic forces that watch overour planet. It was always known that the teachings would be distorted, but thecore of the message was so pure that the good would still outweigh the bad.Jehoshua’s mission was framed as one critical aspect of a much larger groupeffort to assist us in our evolution, and Jehoshua did not have to work alone incarrying out his mission. The Law of One series also tells us that Jehoshua“penetrated intelligent infinity” by realizing that he was not a separate beingbut was in fact an embodiment of the One Creator. This allowed Jehoshua to reachthe next level of human evolution, into a “light-body” form. In Law of Oneterms, this process is called harvest. The meaning of this term, and itsappearance in the Bible, will be explained in Part 4 [part0027.html].17.11 [Jehoshua] was desirous of entering this planetary sphere in order toshare the love vibration in as pure a manner as possible. Thus, this entityreceived permission to perform this mission…. [Jehoshua] was extremelypositively polarized…. This entity became aware that it was not an entity ofitself, but operated as a messenger of the One Creator—whom this entity saw aslove.215 [part0034.html#chapter006fn215]11.8 Penetration into the eighth or intelligent infinity level allows amind/body/spirit complex [i.e., a person] to be harvested [i.e., to reach thenext level of human evolution] if it wishes, at any time/space during thecycle.216 [part0034.html#chapter006fn216]KARMA IN RELATIONSHIPSSome karma appears in our lives in seemingly magical ways, much likesynchronicity. Painful and difficult things happen to us almost immediatelyafter we cause pain to someone else. The living universe and its messengers dotheir very best to make these events both understandable and clearly related tothe actions that caused them. However, there are other forms of karma that areoften far more prolonged and seemingly mundane in nature. The people in ourdaily lives often end up providing us with the strongest karma we everexperience. When we do things that hurt their feelings, we suffer theconsequences. We may have arguments, conflicts, disagreements, andconfrontations. At times, we may feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness,despair, depression, anger, sadness, and jealousy and not realize how commonthis is. As we will see in chapters 7 [part0016.html] and 8 [part0017.html],very few of the relationships we have are first-time encounters in the greatersense—and we may be working on problems we’ve had for centuries, if notmillennia.The Law of One philosophy sheds unique light on the role of the negativelyoriented people in our lives—including the 1 percent of sociopaths. Even if aperson has become extremely bitter, manipulative, and controlling in wakinglife, on a higher level that person is fully aware of who he or she is and whathe or she is doing here. We will explore the arguments in favor of this conceptin chapter 8 [part0017.html], “Mapping Out the Afterlife.” Unbeknownst to thisperson on the conscious level, he or she may well be performing a service, evenwhen doing hurtful things. If you knowingly hurt someone else, your own karmacan be balanced out by someone else who does something completely negative, evencriminal in the eyes of the law, against you. However, even if that person endsup balancing your karma, he or she is not granted a free pass for committingthese hurtful acts. Each person in your life is fully accountable for how his orher actions made you feel, even if you attracted a painful experience in thekarmic sense. Ultimately, all of us must learn the ways of love, and as thisoccurs throughout the cosmos, the universe will again become one and concludeanother cycle of existence.On a global level, the sociopathic power elite groups are creating a powerfulkarmic mirror for everyone. In Law of One terms, they can do only what they areallowed to do by what we have collectively attracted through our own free will.Most people veer between negative and positive in how they treat others, day byday. Everyone has the potential to cause extreme pain and suffering to others,either deliberately or through ignorance. Oftentimes, we want to overlook theseaspects in ourselves and believe that we are entirely good. When otherschallenge us on our negative behavior, we may go into denial and refuse to admitthat we have done anything hurtful. We may also seek to hide our behavior fromothers, swearing our family, friends, and associates to secrecy. The powerelite, with their hidden secrets and clandestine plans, act as a global mirrorof this phenomenon within our own lives. Ultimately, we are meant to learn fromthese global problems. By observing the destructive aspects of hidden secrecyand the lies told by politicians with smiling faces, we learn what not to do inour own lives and are inspired to help others. Without this influence, we wouldbe far less likely to make rapid spiritual growth.AWAKENING TO THE UNITY IN ALLIt is very easy to fall into the illusion that you are a separate being, livingin a separate body. On a physical level, this is true. Your body is separatefrom other bodies. If you fall, your body will be hurt. If someone else falls,your body will not feel physical pain, unless you choose to empathize with thatperson. However, on a deeper level, ageless wisdom reveals that we are all one.No textbooks or scriptures are required to realize this. Simply going deep intomeditation and fully awakening into the present moment—and what that reallymeans—can make it obvious. The identity that is reading or hearing thesewords—the consciousness you enjoy—is not separate from others. The more you canrest and relax your mind, the more obvious the truth will become. You canunderstand the Wheel of Karma and begin putting all the pieces together so youcan see how to heal yourself and master the lessons you are being shown. You nolonger need to endlessly repeat the same cycles with no new insights.SARCASM WON’T CHANGE THE LAWYou may find this discussion of karma to be such a beginner-level concept ofspirituality that no further explanation is necessary, but it is central to ourinvestigation. You may find the whole concept impossible to believe, eveninsulting to your intelligence. You may have already had a rewarding burst ofsarcastic laughter. “That’s not only impossible; that’s ridiculous. You might aswell have just told me you believe in Santa Claus. Science, help me out here.This guy is an idiot.” Actually, science is a very useful tool in proving thatour lives do work this way. Groundbreaking new scientific concepts are oftenheavily resisted and ridiculed before they become commonly accepted. In thiscase, the difference between the world we think we know and the world of truereality is so great that we must move through tremendous fear of being rejectedand ridiculed by our peers in order to see it. Speaking about these subjects canbe very difficult. However, I’ve hardly ever found anyone who doesn’t appreciatea good spiritual story if you keep it light and fun and don’t try to pressureyour listeners into believing you. Hollywood certainly understands this.Many of the things we take for granted in our modern world would be consideredcrazy if we explained them without any visible proof to someone only a fewhundred years ago. Even if we did show them something—such as a modern-daysmartphone—they might come up with a ridiculous, skeptical explanation. You mayeven find out that studying concepts you initially thought of as crazy could endup being the key to living a much happier and more fulfilling life. You mayfinally be able to free yourself from the endless up-and-down cycles of joy anddisaster, or “samsara,” as it was called in the ancient Hindu Vedic scriptures.So let’s create a safe place as you read these words. You don’t have to tellanyone you’re thinking about these things if it doesn’t feel comfortable andright for you to do so. Let’s not worry about whether they will judge you, evenif they do find out. Let’s be willing to keep an open mind and think outside thebox. We can consider new ideas and contemplate the possibilities before weautomatically pass judgment and throw these concepts away with sarcasticlaughter.LET’S CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITIESLet’s consider that life on earth may be a vast, meticulously balanced andfastidiously maintained illusion, a school for spiritual masters in training.Let’s say this illusion is guided and watched over by countless intelligententities who are much more advanced than most of us could ever dare to believe.Let’s say that no matter how smart we think we are, there are people out therewho are far more intelligent than we could ever be—at least at this time.Let’s say that there is a transparent ceiling and that everything we think, say,and do is known to these people, moment by moment. Let’s say that these peoplehave nothing but the greatest love and compassion for us. Let’s say they have adeep understanding of everything we have ever suffered through. Let’s say thatno matter how seemingly heinous of a crime we may have committed againstsomeone, these people genuinely forgave us—and did not shame or disrespectus—even when it seemed like no one else would or could.Let’s say that these people do administer the purifying fire of karma when weinfringe on others’ free will, but this is done with absolute love and respectso that we can be restored to perfect balance. Let’s say that once we have paidoff our karma, we never need to feel fear again, as we can always choose to helpand love others, rather than manipulating and controlling them. Let’s say thatif we keep making positive choices, no new negative karma will need to becreated in our lives. Let’s say we will then be actively protected from painfuland disruptive things that might have otherwise happened, as a very real form ofhealth insurance. We will then invariably begin seeing positive rewards for thegood works we have created.Let’s say these people know exactly what steps we have to take in order tomaster our experiences. Let’s say that a great deal of effort is involved inconstructing the illusion that life on earth, and the things that happen to us,appear to be random—because if it were too obvious, there would be nothing forus to learn. Let’s say that these people are working tirelessly on our behalf,do not need to take credit for what they do, and are happy to keep working evenif hardly any of us understand who they are or what they are doing. Let’s saythat much of their work involves a careful manipulation of events onearth—including subconsciously affecting the actions of others—so that whateverexperiences we create for those around us will then happen in our own lives.Let’s say there are great cycles of time that steer us through a consistentstory line—the Book of Life or Hero’s Journey—again and again. Let’s say thesepeople know this story well and seek to help us master whatever section we findourselves in.Let’s say that these people are ready and willing to talk to you as long as youmeet them halfway and show that you are mature enough to handle thatcommunication by practicing the ageless wisdom teachings in your daily life.Let’s say that synchronicity is a stepping-stone they use to make you aware oftheir presence—at a gradual speed, without fear—so that over time, you canrecognize the full truth. Let’s say that synchronicity is where the same systemthat is constantly being used to create karma is put to a much happier and moreinspiring use.Regardless of whether you are ready to accept these concepts or not, there isabundant scientific evidence that we survive physical death and have alreadyexperienced multiple lifetimes on earth. Any memories of these past lives areusually hidden from us by a veil of amnesia, though it is possible to penetratethe veil in certain cases, such as through hypnotic regression. As it turns out,some things we measure out to others are extreme enough that we cannot balancethem out within one lifetime. Reincarnation is a system through which we candelay the repayment of these actions until we have reached a level of spiritualmaturity at which these balancing experiences could become useful to us assouls."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENREINCARNATIONDid you ever live—in any form—before you were born? Will your life go on afteryour physical body dies? Do you only get one life to live, or does the processof soul evolution extend over multiple incarnations? Dr. Ian Stevenson, aUniversity of Virginia professor of psychiatry at the School of Medicine,interviewed more than three thousand children from all over the world whoremembered having lived before, often in great detail. This epic work tookStevenson more than forty years to complete. The children’s memories wereextremely specific, including names, dates, places, objects, and historicalevents—and even where and how they died. Dr. Stevenson thoroughly fact-checkedwhat the children were telling him, with incredible persistence and attention todetail. Time after time, he discovered that their memories were astonishinglyaccurate. Aging relatives were tracked down, former homes were visited, oldwounds were reopened, and the truth was systematically revealed. One girl fromLebanon remembered the full names and relationships of twenty-five differentpeople from her alleged past life—even though neither she nor her family hadever met any of them before.217 [part0034.html#chapter007fn217] Dr. Jim Tucker,the medical director of the Child and Family Psychiatric Clinic at theUniversity of Virginia, worked with Dr. Stevenson for years and continued hisresearch. Dr. Tucker stated that “reincarnation is the most likely explanationfor the strongest cases.”218 [part0034.html#chapter007fn218]In Dr. Tucker’s book Life After Life, he presents a wealth of evidence fromtwenty-five hundred of Stevenson’s best cases, as well as new profiles heinvestigated himself, and lets you make up your own mind. Children typicallyremember their past lives beginning around the age of two or three, and theirmemories usually fade by age seven or eight. In some cases, the childreninsisted on being called by their former names, and very specific details theygave about their former lives ended up being correct. As a professional childpsychiatrist trained in the scientific method, Dr. Tucker is concerned withprovable evidence. Many of the children had birthmarks or birth defects in theexact locations where their former selves had been mortally wounded. Dr. Tuckeralso used modern facial recognition software to confirm that these childrenlooked like the people they claimed to have been before.219[part0034.html#chapter007fn219] Dr. Jim Tucker is certainly aware of thehostility and skepticism of mainstream scientists on a subject like this.Genetics, biology, evolution, neurology, medicine, and many other reveredconcepts in our modern world—believed to be absolute laws of nature—have to bethoroughly reexamined and reworked in order to incorporate this new information.If our “new” physical bodies bear a strong facial resemblance to who we werebefore, this suggests that there is an energetic aspect to who we are, as humanbeings, that carries over from one lifetime to another. This energetic aspect—inother words, the soul—is able to shape and mold our facial features as well asre-create a mortal wound with a birthmark or deformity. Therefore, the soul hasa direct effect on the structure and function of our DNA. We have already seenenergetic biology experiments in the lab that have confirmed that this ispossible. A given organism can be restructured by energetics alone, such as inDr. Peter Gariaev’s experiment where he transformed frog eggs into salamandereggs. In the same way, our souls apparently transform the DNA of the body weincarnate into, so that our facial features remain identifiable from one life tothe next. There will always be a blending between the hereditary facial featureswe inherit from our parents and the facial features of our deeper soul as wereincarnate from one life to the next. This gives us a scientific explanationfor Dr. Jim Tucker’s many documented cases where children remembered having beensomeone else in a previous life and their faces showed a match with their formerincarnation using forensic software.Children were far more likely to remember past lives in cultures that openlyembraced reincarnation, suggesting that parents who do not believe inreincarnation may be passing up on a great opportunity when their children beginhaving unusual memories. Carol Bowman explored this concept in her 1998 classic,Children’s Past Lives: How Past Life Memories Affect Your Child.220[part0034.html#chapter007fn220] Her fascination with the subject began with acrisis: Her son was suffering from chronic eczema and a strong phobia of loudnoises. Under hypnotic regression from Norman Inge, a clinical hypnotherapist,the child had a comprehensive memory of having fought in the Civil War. Hisaccount was extremely specific, and an expert historian was able to verify manydetails that the child should not have known. After the child remembered andhealed this past trauma, his eczema and fear of loud noises completelydisappeared. Carol Bowman then used this same process to heal her daughter froma chronic fear of the house burning down. Carol’s focus in the first book is onusing past-life regression to heal childhood phobias. Carol was soon delugedwith letters from readers of her first book, providing her with a wealth of newcases that could be studied. One consistent theme she noticed in these letterswas of people reincarnating into the same family, such as by reappearing astheir own great-grandchildren. Through scientific investigation and follow-upson the specific details, many of these cases were validated. This research wassummarized in her second book, Return from Heaven: Beloved RelativesReincarnated Within Your Family.221 [part0034.html#chapter007fn221]The scientific research into reincarnation has proven that it is a genuinephenomenon beyond any reasonable doubt. The new science of a living universeprovides us with extensive criteria to see life as fundamentally energetic innature and to view the biological body as only a projection of this deeper,nonphysical aspect we all possess. Our facial features and birthmarks canapparently be directly sculpted by the energetic wave aspect of our DNA. Westernsociety has often been very slow to embrace new ideas that go against mainstreamthought. If a particular concept is not commonly understood to betrue—particularly by most conventional scientists—it can take many years beforeit is widely accepted, even if the proof is extremely comprehensive.Clearly, one of the strongest obstacles to a widespread embrace of reincarnationin the Western world is the Christian belief that it is not taught in the Bible.Even people in the Western world who do not actively practice Christianity areoften still influenced by what I call the “subconscious Judeo-Christian bias.”The prevailing modern Christian stance on reincarnation is another area in whichpolitical intrigue clearly seems to have obscured the truth, as it was a commonbelief in both the Old and New Testament.REINCARNATION AND CHRISTIANITYReincarnation invalidates the idea of a place of hideous torture that lasts forall eternity. If a soul doesn’t master the lessons this world is ultimatelymeant to teach us within one lifetime, it will always have another chance. Allsouls consistently move through Gehenna—through the fires of purification—asthey work toward the next level of human evolution. The knowledge of eternalforgiveness could be seen as a threat to entrenched power structures, such asthe Roman Empire, which may well have wished to control the people as much aspossible. In the Second Council of Constantinople, in A.D. 553, the Romangovernment officially declared that it was illegal to believe in or teach theconcept of reincarnation. Failure to abide by this law would lead to banishmentand excommunication, which in those days meant almost certain death. The exactedict reads, “If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shallassert the monstrous restoration which follows from it, let him be anathema[excommunicated].”222 [part0034.html#chapter007fn222] The point was furtherhammered home in A.D. 1274, when the Council of Lyons decreed that the soul goespromptly to Heaven or Hell after death. Then in A.D. 1439, the Council ofFlorence reaffirmed this edict with almost the exact same wording.However, in the first century, the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus wrote thatthe Pharisees—a popular Jewish sect—believed in reincarnation. According toJosephus, the souls of people who live a positive life are “removed into otherbodies” so they will have “power to revive and live again.” The apostle Paul wasa Pharisee prior to his conversion to Christianity. The Sadducees, a puristsect, rejected the concept of reincarnation and supported only the orthodoxJewish belief in sheol—the grave. Further historic evidence comes from Origen(A.D. 185–254), who is considered the first great father of the Christian churchafter Paul. Origen had extensive instruction from Clement of Alexandria.Clement, in turn, had studied directly with Peter, one of the original twelveapostles who traveled with Jehoshua. Origen inherited the direct, oral traditionof the teachings of Jehoshua and built a spiritual theology out of thisknowledge. Reincarnation was a crucial aspect of Origen’s theology. Both Origenand his teacher, Clement of Alexandria, wrote about receiving secret teachingsfrom Jehoshua that were passed to them through the apostles. They ardentlyinsisted that reincarnation and preexistence were one of Jehoshua’s mostimportant secret teachings. This quote from Origen summarizes his perspectivenicely: “The soul has neither beginning nor end…. [Souls] come into this worldstrengthened by the victories or weakened by the defeats of their previouslives.”223 [part0034.html#chapter007fn223]SEVERAL REINCARNATION REFERENCES MADE THE CUTThe New Testament was assembled out of a variety of documents in the Council ofNicaea, headed by Emperor Constantine I of Rome, in A.D. 325. Since severalgospels were not included, it is very likely that many references toreincarnation were removed in the process, but it was apparently such a popularconcept that a variety of compelling quotes survived the cut. Several differentauthors have written entire books’ worth of research just on this subject,though here we will give only a handful of the many examples of reincarnationthey found. Our first quote is from Matthew 16:13–14, in which we see peopleopenly speculating about who Jehoshua—the “Son of Man”—had been in otherlifetimes: “‘Who do people say the Son of Man is?’ They replied, ‘Some say Johnthe Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of theprophets.’”In another revealing passage from the book of John (9:1–3), we see Jehoshuaparticipate in a conversation with his disciples, in which reincarnation isspoken about as if it were an absolute, known fact.And as he was passing by, he saw a man blind from birth. And his disciples askedhim, “Rabbi, who has sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be bornblind?”Jesus answered, “Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents—but the works ofGod were to be made manifest in him.”How could a man have done anything—whether it was a sin or not—before he wasborn, if he had apparently never lived before? Jehoshua didn’t stop and say,“Wait a minute, guys, that’s a ridiculous question. How could this man havesinned before he was born?” Instead, he took the question in stride and revealedthat in this particular case, the man apparently chose blindness as an incentiveto turn his focus inward, so he would be more likely to embrace a spiritualpath. This is another critical passage that survived the merciless edits tostrip reincarnation out of the Bible. Jehoshua also directly confirmed that Johnthe Baptist was the reincarnation of Elijah the prophet in Matthew 11:11–15. Thephrase he who has ears, let him hear indicates that Jehoshua is revealing one ofthe secret teachings: “This is the one…there has not risen anyone greater thanJohn the Baptist…. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who wasto come. He who has ears, let him hear.”In Luke 9:7–8, we find out that many people were actively trying to figure outwho John the Baptist had been in a past life—in much the same way that tabloidsfollow the lives of celebrities in our modern world: “Now Herod the tetrarchheard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some weresaying that John had been raised from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared,and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.”THE EDGAR CAYCE LEGACYAny modern discussion of reincarnation and the cycles of history would beincomplete without mentioning the legacy of Edgar Cayce (1877–1945), whoprovided a wealth of verifiable information through intuitive means. Withnothing more than the name and address of a client and an agreement that theclient would be present at that same address during the session, Cayce wouldaccurately diagnose the client’s medical conditions and prescribe effectivetreatments. Problems with the physical body were often associated with spiritualissues, and advice was given that would treat the patient in body, mind, andspirit, in order that a full healing could be attainable. Cayce was notconscious as he performed these medical diagnoses and prescriptions. His teamfollowed a careful protocol that allowed him to be hypnotized into a deep trancestate by an associate. Once Cayce was fully unconscious, he began speaking anddisplayed seemingly omniscient intelligence. The “source” used language that wasquite different from the way he spoke normally—and like the Law of One material,it was often hard to follow. Cayce was a devout Christian, and from thebeginning his readings had a strong Christian focus, which admittedly makes thismaterial off-putting to some readers.Cayce, who was the first to coin the term psychic readings for the process hewas conducting, was quoted in a Birmingham (Alabama) Post-Herald article assaying he had given 8,056 readings by October 10, 1922. Sadly, records of thesereadings were destroyed in a tragic house fire, and in many cases no writtentranscripts had been made. None of Cayce’s readings were systematicallypreserved until September 10, 1923, when Gladys Davis joined the team as Cayce’sfull-time stenographer.224 [part0034.html#chapter007fn224] After that time, anadditional 14,879 readings were conducted and documented—bringing the total towell over 22,000. That still leaves the period between October 1922 andSeptember 1923 unaccounted for, and during this time, Cayce was experiencing ahuge surge of publicity and clientele. In her epic scholarly work Many Mansions,Dr. Gina Cerminara estimated the actual number of Edgar Cayce readings to beabout 25,000—a truly astonishing number.Warner Books published The Edgar Cayce Reader in 1967, twenty-two years afterCayce’s death.225 [part0034.html#chapter007fn225] In the introduction, it isnoted that the ten books written about Cayce up to that time had “totaled morethan a million in sales.” In 1998, fifty-three years after the death of Cayce,Paul K. Johnson published a book called Edgar Cayce in Context with the StateUniversity of New York that offered the following opinion: “[Cayce] exerted aliterary influence comparable to the greatest religious innovators of the lasttwo centuries in America.”226 [part0034.html#chapter007fn226] Cayce can also begiven considerable credit for inspiring the New Age and holistic healthmovements of the 1960s, which have become increasingly mainstream over time.In Edgar Cayce in Context, we find out that by May 1997, 646 books had beenpublished on the subject of Edgar Cayce since 1950—compared to 542 books onEllen G. White (one of the founders of the Seventh-Day Adventists), 264 onJoseph Smith (the founder of the Latter-Day Saint movement), and 121 on HelenaBlavatsky (one of the founders of the Theosophical Society). Cayce didn’treceive full national attention until the final years of his life, after ThomasSugrue’s biography, There Is a River was published in 1942.227[part0034.html#chapter007fn227] This was followed by a September 1943 articleentitled “Miracle Man of Virginia Beach” in Coronet magazine. Cayce was soondeluged with an estimated twenty-five thousand written letters requesting hishelp. There were so many letters that they had to be stacked and tied togetherwith twine—and these bundles of mail lined the walls of his house, unopened.228[part0034.html#chapter007fn228] Cayce began processing eight clients a day,every day, in an attempt to keep up with the demand—four in a morning sessionand four in the afternoon—even though his own readings warned him that thisschedule was very dangerous for his health. Cayce’s waiting list stretched onfor a year and a half, even with this many slots, and his inability to say no toanyone caused him to quickly burn out. He ended up working himself to death byJanuary 3, 1945, just a year and three months after the Coronet article cameout. Many of the letters had included cash payments, and it took years forCayce’s surviving team to return everyone’s money.In a typical Cayce reading, some aspect of his subconscious mind apparentlytraveled directly to the person, could zoom in and out of the person’s body toinspect, diagnose, and recommend treatment, and could go wherever else it wasneeded. In one dramatic example retold in the original Cayce biography There isa River, a Cayce reading prescribed “Oil of Smoke” for a boy with “a veryobstinate leg sore.” No pharmacists had ever heard of it, and they couldn’t findit in any of their catalogs, which undoubtedly caused them to laugh at the wholeidea. Another Cayce reading was taken, and this time it insisted the drug couldbe found at a particular pharmacy in Louisville, Kentucky. A message was wiredto the store manager to request the drug, and he wired back, saying he’d neverheard of it and did not have it in stock. Then, according to Dr. WesleyHarrington Ketchum, the next reading got very specific.We took a third reading. This time a shelf in the back of the Louisvilledrugstore was named. There, behind another preparation—which was named—would befound a bottle of “Oil of Smoke,” so the reading said. I wired the informationto the manager of the Louisville store. He wired me back, “Found it.” The bottlearrived in a few days. It was old. The label was faded. The company which put itup had gone out of business. But it was just what he said it was, “Oil ofSmoke.” 229 [part0034.html#chapter007fn229]Skeptics have used the “oil of smoke” reference to attack Cayce’s credibilitythrough to this day, since it sounds vaguely similar to “snake oil.” However,with further research, we find that “oil of smoke” was one name used forbeechwood creosote in the years before Cayce’s reading was given.230[part0034.html#chapter007fn230] The US Department of Health and Human Servicescites the following traditional uses for this remedy.Beechwood creosote has been used as a disinfectant, a laxative, and a coughtreatment. In the past, treatments for leprosy, pneumonia, and tuberculosis alsoinvolved eating or drinking beechwood creosote. It is rarely used today in theUnited States by doctors since it has been replaced by better medicines, and itis no longer produced by businesses in the United States. It is still availableas an herbal remedy, and is used as an expectorant and a laxative in Japan. Themajor chemicals in beechwood creosote are phenol, cresols, and guaiacol.231[part0034.html#chapter007fn231]While Cayce was performing a reading, lying on a couch with his eyes closed, hewould monitor the handwriting of his stenographer, Gladys Davis, as she tookdictation and make corrections if she spelled something wrong.232[part0034.html#chapter007fn232] When Cayce had clients there in the room withhim, his source would often read their minds and answer the questions they werethinking of before they had a chance to speak them out loud.233[part0034.html#chapter007fn233] Although Cayce spoke only English in his wakingpersonality, his source also had complete conversations with his clients intheir own native languages, or would pass on witty little sayings that made themlaugh. Cayce is estimated to have spoken fluently in more than twenty-fourdifferent languages during his readings.234 [part0034.html#chapter007fn234]However, his source continually emphasized that all of us have the potential todo these things.Cayce’s medical advice often led to miracle healings in patients the medicalestablishment had written off, and his readings concocted successful medicineswith ingredients no one had ever thought to use, like baking soda and castor oilfor warts.235 [part0034.html#chapter007fn235] A Canadian Catholic priest washealed of epilepsy; arthritis was cured in a young high school graduate fromDayton, Ohio; a New York dentist’s migraine headache that had hammered him fortwo years was completely eliminated in just two weeks; a mysterious anddebilitating skin disorder known as scleroderma236[part0034.html#chapter007fn236] was cured in a young female Kentucky musicianafter one year, despite her being written off as a hopeless case; and aPhiladelphia boy with infant glaucoma, normally considered incurable, regainedhis full eyesight.237 [part0034.html#chapter007fn237]Upon awakening, Cayce could not remember anything he had said, and the wordingwas often cryptic and awkward, using long run-on sentences with languageresembling the King James Version of the Bible.238[part0034.html#chapter007fn238] However, the readings also had a down-to-earthpersonality like Edgar’s waking self, including a witty sense of humor.239[part0034.html#chapter007fn239]THE CAYCE READINGS ON REINCARNATIONOn August 10, 1923, Arthur Lammers was the first to ask Cayce’s source whetherhe had ever lived on earth in previous lifetimes.240[part0034.html#chapter007fn240] Much to his surprise, Lammers was told thatCayce had had three past lives, including one he spent as a monk, and that hiscurrent personality was strongly influenced by this former incarnation. Thiscreated a serious crisis for Edgar Cayce in his waking mind, as he was a devoutChristian, and Christians did not believe in reincarnation. Cayce certainly didnot want to contradict the official doctrines of the church. However, by thispoint he’d seen the effectiveness of his readings in helping people for morethan twenty years, and he could not deny that they were genuinely beneficial.Over time, he came to accept that reincarnation was a reality as his readingsgave extensive, detailed information about his clients’ past lives after thisinitial breakthrough in 1923. The average person has probably had as many asthirty-five to forty different past lives, according to the Cayce readings.241[part0034.html#chapter007fn241]More than twenty-five hundred of Cayce’s client readings dealt with past lives,and even if the readings were years apart, further analysis confirmed that thespecifics always remained consistent. Obscure historical details included in thereadings were found to be accurate. One client was told he had been astool-dipper, and when Cayce looked up this term in an encyclopedia, not knowingwhat it was, he found out that it was an archaic expression for the earlyAmerican custom of dunking people who were accused of being witches into coldwater.242 [part0034.html#chapter007fn242]Cayce’s readings often gave the exact names of his clients in their priorlifetimes—and occasionally these names were verifiable. One of the most dramaticexamples occurred with a Cayce client who had started out being legally blindbut was able to restore partial sight in one of his eyes by following hisreading’s suggestions. This client was also very interested in railroads and theCivil War. When Cayce later gave him a “life reading,” the client was told hehad been Barnett Seay, a soldier in General Robert E. Lee’s army in the Southwho had worked on the railroad and had lived in Henrico County, Virginia. Thereading said that the records of Seay’s life could still be found in Virginia.The client first visited Henrico County, Virginia, but was told by the clerk ofthe court that many records had been recently transferred to the Department ofOld Records at the Virginia State Historical Library.243[part0034.html#chapter007fn243] Eventually, through a careful search of theserecords, Cayce’s client did find a record of a color-bearer in General Lee’sarmy named Barnett Seay. The records specifically indicated that Seay hadenlisted in 1862, when he was twenty-one years old.244[part0034.html#chapter007fn244] This was certainly a unique name—and thus thelikelihood that this was a coincidence was extremely small.GROUP REINCARNATIONS ORGANIZED IN CYCLES OF HISTORYOver time, Cayce’s group became aware that certain patterns of places and timesin history kept showing up in the past lives of people who received readings.This suggested the intriguing possibility that people in a given country orregion may share a common heritage, reincarnating with others from their ownsociety in a variety of geographical locations over time. Further study of thereadings confirmed that this does indeed happen. Almost all of Cayce’s clientswere American Caucasians. One common example of a repeating pattern was thatapparently the people from the lost civilization of Atlantis hadmass-reincarnated in the United States. They apparently needed to reappear in asociety that had enough advanced technology to allow them to re-create similarexperiences as before, with the hope that they would use these resources morepositively. This quote from Gina Cerminara’s Many Mansions explains it well:Many people were given a similar historical background; in fact, the outline ofpeople’s past lives seemed almost to fall into a pattern. One common sequencewas: Atlantis, Egypt, Rome, the Crusades period, and the early Colonial period.Another was: Atlantis, Egypt, Rome, France in the time of Louis XIV, XV, or XVI,and the American Civil War. There were variations, of course—including China,India, Cambodia, Peru, Norseland, Africa, Central America, Sicily, Spain, Japan,and other places; but the majority of readings followed the same historic lines.The reason for this, according to Cayce, was that souls of a given era ingeneral incarnate in a later era together. In the intervening centuries, othergroups of souls are on earth—taking their turn, so to speak. This proceeds withorderly and rhythmic alternation, almost like the shifts of laborers in afactory. Consequently most of the souls on earth today were also together inprevious ages of history. Also, souls related to each other closely by familyties, friendship ties, or the ties of mutual interests were likely to have beenrelated before in similar ties in previous eras—and most of the people securingreadings from Cayce were, in some such way, related.245[part0034.html#chapter007fn245]It would be difficult to scientifically prove that this is true, consideringthat most of our scientific proof for reincarnation has come from childrenaccurately remembering their alleged past lives. The children may remember whothey were before, but they usually are not aware of greater patterns in theliving cosmos that may be governing their incarnations in “orderly and rhythmicalteration.” However, the Cayce readings proved their accuracy in so manydifferent ways that the burden of proof has been satisfied. The data has stoodthe test of time and is still considered highly trustworthy by open-mindedscholars. Reincarnation may be one of the main reasons why history seems to keeprepeating in very precise cycles—as we will see. Gina Cerminara shared the Cayceperspective on the cycles of history in this next quotation: “Every period ofour history has the appropriate tools needed for us to alleviate our karma.”246[part0034.html#chapter007fn246]The Cayce readings did speak about the 25,920-year “Grand Cycle of the Ages,” aswell as the Ages of the Zodiac—and thus directly supported the idea of thesecycles forming an energetic structure for reincarnation to occur. Theseorganized, repeating patterns of events allow for souls to reincarnate ingroups—knowing what to expect, and when. Souls are able to work out collectivekarma as well as individual karma by reappearing in large groups. As societies,they keep running through the same story line, with the same people, again andagain, until they master the lessons they are being shown. This will become muchclearer as we discuss the Hero’s Journey story in chapter 9 [part0018.html].Obviously, if history is cyclical, there is a reason for it, and it would be avery good idea for us to try to understand it. If there is a script we arefollowing, then we need to master it so these wars and atrocities do not keeprepeating.SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PAST-LIFE KARMAThrough a series of specific examples, the Cayce readings shed a great deal oflight on the reason and necessity for reincarnation. It quickly becomes clearthat our actions do have consequences, and when we are sufficiently unlovingtoward someone, we may not be ready to experience similarly painful events inour own lives until a later incarnation. Our soul may not administer thestrongest forms of karma until it feels we are mature enough, on a spirituallevel, to avoid becoming even more negative from having had that experience.Then, the karma we experience is not necessarily an exact duplicate of what wecreated for someone else, but it is at least symbolically related to theoriginal hurt or injury we caused. Many Mansions by Gina Cerminara, a doctor ofpsychology, gives a host of fascinating examples she found in her study of morethan twenty-five hundred “life readings.”For example, a college professor who was born blind was able to restore 10percent vision in his left eye through Cayce’s prescribed treatments, despiterestoration being considered hopeless by medical specialists. He was later toldthat in a Persian lifetime from approximately 1000 B.C., he was part of abarbaric tribe that blinded its enemies with red-hot irons—and it was his job todo the blinding.247 [part0034.html#chapter007fn247] This is an interesting case,because it shows that the Cayce readings did not feel this man needed tocontinue being blind in order to work off his karma. Once he became aware ofwhat had happened and what he needed to understand to forgive himself, he wasable to gain knowledge that directly improved his condition.Another Cayce client was a forty-year-old woman who began sneezing whenever sheate bread and cereal grains. She also developed excruciating nerve pains in herleft side whenever she touched shoe leather and the plastic rims of glasses,among other materials. No doctors had been able to help her. A series ofhypnotic treatments when she was twenty-five years old had caused these problemsto disappear for six years, but then they returned. Her Edgar Cayce reading toldher she had been a chemist in a past life and had created chemicals that causedpeople to itch, apparently very badly. She also had allegedly developedchemicals that could be breathed into someone’s face and would poison them. Herchoice of “karmic alleviation” was to have these bizarre, debilitating allergiesin a later lifetime. Her Cayce reading also said that the types of chemicals shewas allergic to were directly related to the chemicals and substances she hadused to torture and kill others, including a leather pouch that held thepoison.248 [part0034.html#chapter007fn248]Another client was told that he had been an escort and protector to King LouisXIII of France and had excessively overeaten. As a result, when he came to Cayceas a thirty-five-year-old man, he had been through a lifetime of digestiveproblems requiring him to wait several hours to digest a meal. He could eat onlycertain foods in certain combinations.249 [part0034.html#chapter007fn249]In another separate case that Cerminara refers to as “symbolic karma,” aphysician sought a reading for his young boy, who had suffered from anemia sinceearly childhood. Apparently, five lifetimes earlier, this boy had an incarnationduring which he had seized power by brute force in Peru and had shed much bloodin order to establish his dictatorship. The anemia had left him very weak in hiscurrent incarnation—a far cry from the physical power and strength he hadenjoyed before.250 [part0034.html#chapter007fn250] An asthma sufferer,constantly having to deal with shortness of breath, was told he had pressed thelife out of others in another lifetime, causing them to asphyxiate. A clientsuffering from total deafness was told that he had refused to listen to otherswho needed help—on a life-and-death basis—when he was a nobleman during theblood-soaked French Revolution.251 [part0034.html#chapter007fn251]MOCKING PEOPLE IS NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEAJehoshua said that simply calling someone a fool is enough to ignite the Gehennafire and necessitate purification. Insults like this may seem very minor,particularly on the Internet. Nonetheless, the Cayce readings revealed thatmocking others can carry strong karmic repercussions, particularly if thosepeople are suffering or dying in the process. Chapter 5 in Cerminara’s book isentitled “The Karma of Mockery.” Seven different cases are documented in whichpeople with severe disabilities were told they had mocked others with the sameor similar disabilities in other lifetimes. Six of these cases were tied to thehorrific Roman persecutions of Christians, in which gruesome deaths were seen asentertainment. Three of these karmic cases involved polio, where the clients hadpreviously laughed at people who were crippled as they were tortured to death inthe Roman coliseum, perhaps by hungry lions.252 [part0034.html#chapter007fn252]One woman laughed as she watched a girl get ripped open on her side by the clawsof a lion in Rome. She returned with tuberculosis of the hip joint, making herunable to walk.253 [part0034.html#chapter007fn253] Another woman was quiteoverweight due to a glandular imbalance. She was told that she had been abeautiful Roman athlete two lifetimes earlier and had routinely mocked peoplewho were overweight.254 [part0034.html#chapter007fn254] Another client was toldhe had been a cartoonist in the French court and had greatly enjoyed exposinghomosexual scandals, only to come back with powerful homosexual urges himself inhis current lifetime.255 [part0034.html#chapter007fn255] This next quote fromGina Cerminara’s Many Mansions reveals how expensive criticism can be from akarmic standpoint:Although it costs nothing in terms of money, criticism may be a very expensiveamusement in terms of the psychological price that must someday be paid. Thesource of information, as Edgar Cayce called his power, from its vantage pointof seeing cause and consequence over long spans of time, frequently gave sharpand explicit warning to people who erred conspicuously in this direction.256[part0034.html#chapter007fn256]KARMA IS MEMORYAn eleven-year-old boy had had a chronic bed-wetting problem since the age oftwo, and his parents had spent many years working with doctors in an attempt tofind a cure, all to no avail. His parents were told he had been a Christianpreacher in the early Puritan years and had been a stool-dipper—punishing peoplesuspected of witchcraft by repeatedly ducking them underwater while they werestrapped to a stool.257 [part0034.html#chapter007fn257] These tortures usuallyled to the suspect’s drowning. If the person survived the process, it wasbelieved that this was due to their supernatural power as witches. They werethen put to death anyway because their powers had been exposed.Interestingly, the treatment prescribed by the readings to help heal this boy ofhis chronic bed-wetting problem was for his mother to repeat certain affirmativestatements to him—in a slow, monotonous voice—as he was falling asleep: “‘Youare good and kind. You are going to make many people happy. You are going tohelp everyone with whom you come in contact.’”258[part0034.html#chapter007fn258]The boy did not wet the bed that night—for the first time in nearly nine years.The mother continued repeating these suggestions each night for several months,and the problem never returned. Gradually she was able to reduce the treatmentdown to only once a week and eventually was able to stop it altogether, withoutever having the problem repeat itself. This woman was not inclined to believe ina fairy tale—she was a lawyer and a trusted staff member who worked for adistrict attorney. As the boy grew older, he became exceptionally tolerant ofothers and went from being an extreme introvert to a “perfectly well-adjustedextrovert” on the Johnson O’Connor Human Engineering Laboratory test.Cerminara therefore concludes that one significant aspect of karma is apsychological holdover of the guilt and shame we feel from actions performed inother lifetimes. The Cayce readings often said that karma is a function ofmemory, and the key to breaking this cycle is to forgive ourselves for what wemay have done to others in the past. “In forgiveness lies the stoppage of thewheel of karma.” Forgiving ourselves can be just as important as—if not moreimportant than—forgiving others. Consciously, we may not remember any of ourpast lives, but apparently our subconscious has an ongoing, robust knowledge ofexactly who we have been—and what we did that hurt others. Many of us end uppunishing ourselves, subconsciously, well beyond the point where the necessarybalance would have been achieved in the absolute sense. This is a verysignificant point in the Cayce readings, one that most people discussingreincarnation and karma are not familiar with. Once you can truly love andaccept yourself and treat others with respect, you can balance out your karmaand eliminate a vast amount of needless suffering. Genuinely shameless people,such as sociopaths, are not exempt from karma either. Free will is an absolutestandard of balance that we all must work through.SUSPENDED KARMAChapter 7 in Gina Cerminara’s book deals with another interesting subject:suspended karma. The Cayce readings revealed that if we seriously infringe onthe free will of someone else, it may take centuries for the right situation tocome along to balance that karma. Even more important, we have to become strongenough, from a spiritual standpoint, to be able to work through the situationwithout suffering even more and creating additional hurts for others that wouldthen require even more karma to balance. Though this concept may seem quitedisturbing on a conscious level, there is apparently nothing we can do about itother than to bravely and honorably work through the challenges we face. Nomatter how much we may rage at the seeming injustice we are going through, onthe spiritual level we will inevitably carry through with our karma and pay offour debts. Every effort is made to ensure that these debts are not paid off anyfaster than we can handle and ultimately benefit from. Gina Cerminara stated theunderlying teaching of the Cayce readings very clearly in Many Mansions: “Notall people are sufficiently evolved spiritually to be capable of achieving inone lifetime that all-consuming, all-embracing love which is the essence of thetrue Christ-consciousness—and thus achieve liberation from the debt ofkarma.”259 [part0034.html#chapter007fn259]PAST LIVES STRONGLY INFLUENCE OUR PERSONALITIESIt is also surprising to discover how much of our waking personalities can beaffected by what we apparently experienced in our past lives, according to theCayce readings. In one case, an extremely prejudiced white supremacist had beenimprisoned, tortured, and beaten to death by black soldiers in another lifetime,and his hatred of all people of color carried through multiple lifetimes. Ananti-Semitic newspaper columnist had a past-life experience as a Samaritan inPalestine, in which she was frequently and violently attacked by her Jewishneighbors. A thirty-eight-year-old unmarried woman could not trust men on a verydeep level and was never able to form lasting relationships. She had beendeserted by her husband in an earlier lifetime when he went off to join theCrusades.260 [part0034.html#chapter007fn260]A woman with an exceptional tolerance of other religions had earlier been aCrusader among Islamic people and found that they were kind, merciful,courageous, and idealistic. This had such a positive impact on her that hersense of religious tolerance carried through into multiple future lifetimes.Another Cayce client was severely distrustful of all religion and had onceparticipated in the Crusades, where he was highly disgusted by the difference hesaw between people’s religious ideals and their actions.WHY THE VEILING BETWEEN LIVES IS NECESSARYOn page 119 of Many Mansions, Dr. Cerminara addresses a frequent complaint frompeople who oppose these theories of reincarnation. They may feel that it is notfair to be held responsible for something you did in another lifetime of whichyou have no direct conscious memory. If this other person represents a differentpersonality—with different parents, different influences, a different culture,and different experiences—then why should you be held responsible in the hereand now for what he or she did in another lifetime? Apparently, the answer isthat the personality we enjoy in our waking, conscious mind is only a smallportion of our eternal identity. Much of who we really are is veiled from us, asthis next quote from Gina Cerminara reveals: “The eternal identity—like an actoroffstage—can remember all its past, but as soon as it takes on a personality, asan actor takes on a role, then it is prevented by a protective provision ofnature from remembering anything but the sum totals or the principles which [it]had learned before.”261 [part0034.html#chapter007fn261]This is called “the veiling” in the Law of One series, and it is a veryimportant point. Our current level of existence, “third density,” is referred toas “the Choice.” In order to graduate into fourth density, we must clearlychoose between the path of service to others or the path of service to self. Theunified mind of the galaxy is referred to as “the Logos.” If we were consciouslyaware of the existence of the Logos and of the grand design for our soulevolution, we wouldn’t learn anything. The veiling makes it difficult, butcertainly not impossible, for us to see the truth.21.9 It is necessary for the third-density entity to forget [its past lives]—sothat the mechanisms of confusion or free will may operate upon the newlyindividuated consciousness complex.262 [part0034.html#chapter007fn262]77.14 Above this [third] density there remains the recognition of thearchitecture of the Logos—but without the veils which are so integral a part ofthe process of making the choice in third density.263[part0034.html#chapter007fn263]81.32 Question: I am assuming that in this particular [cycle of the universe’sexistence,] the experiment of the veiling and the extending of free will musthave started, roughly, simultaneously in many, many of the budding or buildinggalactic systems. Am I in any way correct with this assumption?Answer:…You are precisely correct.264 [part0034.html#chapter007fn264]82.29 To cross that threshold [from third to fourth density] is difficult. Thereis resistance at the edge, shall we say, of each density. The faculty of faithor will needs to be understood, nourished, and developed in order to have anentity which seeks past the boundary of third density. Those entities which donot do their homework, be they ever so amiable, shall not cross.265[part0034.html#chapter007fn265]83.18 The penetration of the veil may be seen to begin to have its roots in thegestation of green-ray activity—that all-compassionate love which demands noreturn. If this path is followed, the higher energy centers shall be activatedand crystallized until the adept is born. Within the adept is the potential fordismantling the veil to a greater or lesser extent—that all may be seen again asone. The other-self is primary catalyst in this particular path to the piercingof the veil—if you would call it that.266 [part0034.html#chapter007fn266]GROUPS OF PEOPLE KEEP REINCARNATING TOGETHERThe people you know and love—as well as those you bicker and argue with—may verywell have been with you many times before. Cerminara summarized this Cayceteaching very eloquently and succinctly: “No marriage is a start on a cleanslate. It is an episode in a serial story begun long before.”267[part0034.html#chapter007fn267]So much of our present lives are influenced by the past that apparently no majorrelationship we have with anyone—whether a friend, family member, or romanticpartner—is a first-time involvement. We are intuitively drawn to the same peoplewe have lived with many times before, in order to continually work through ourissues. The classic book The Egyptian Heritage by Mark Lehner is a highlycomprehensive examination of the Egyptian/Atlantean period, in which more thantwo hundred of Cayce’s closest associates had appeared. The amount of detailgiven about this period, from dozens of different client readings, isstunning—as is the process of seeing how these various characters reincarnatedin subsequent lifetimes.268 [part0034.html#chapter007fn268]The Lives of Edgar Cayce by W. H. Church is one of the most fascinating books onthe Cayce readings—and their perspective on reincarnation—despite being somewhatdifficult to read.269 [part0034.html#chapter007fn269] In it, Church traces thefascinating story of how the people in Cayce’s life had been incarnating withhim, again and again, in a variety of contexts. Thirteen different past lives ofEdgar Cayce are presented—twelve directly from his readings and another from hisdreams. Additionally, two future incarnations are presented: one in which heappears in Virginia Beach in 1998, and another in which he appears in A.D. 2158.Cayce’s full list of his own past-life names is: King Asapha, a spiritual rulerin Egypt approximately fifty thousand years ago; the revered Egyptianpriest-king Ra-Ptah, who allegedly designed the Great Pyramid with Thoth-Hermes;an unnamed angelic messenger who appeared to warn the people of Sodom; thePersian warrior-king Uhjltd, lost to the pages of history; the Greek soldierXenon, who committed suicide in a moment of extreme terror; the famous scholarand father of geometry, Pythagoras; the Greek chemist Armitidides, who knewAlexander the Great; Lucius of Cyrene, who wrote the book of Luke in the Bible;an unnamed Arawak Indian on Hispaniola; two incarnations of the self-servingEnglishman John Bainbridge (as grandfather and grandson within the same family),who was an alcoholic and used his psychic abilities to cheat at cards; RalphDahl, the illegitimate son of Louis XIV’s daughter Gracia, who was murdered atage five to prevent a male heir from reaching the throne; a Civil War soldierfrom the United States; an unnamed lifetime in 1998; and an unnamed lifetime in2158.270 [part0034.html#chapter007fn270]One of many interesting things we see in this timeline of lifetimes is how thesoul rises and falls in its level of maturity and evolution. Traumatic events,such as the suicide as Xenon, and other negative events in the lifetime as theArawak Indian can have a ripple effect that requires multiple incarnations topeacefully resolve.The John Bainbridge incarnations are consistently the most surprising of theCayce history of past lives, when seen in context with the historical figures hewas also alleged to have been. At two different times in the 1700s, heincarnated as an Englishman from the same family, and sailed to America toexplore the new frontier. He was a gambler, womanizer, and hard drinker, and heused his psychic abilities to cheat at playing cards as well as the shell game.Apparently he enjoyed this lifestyle so much that he reincarnated a second timeto repeat the same self-serving behaviors. This accrued a great deal of karma,but his soul created an opportunity for him to resolve it in a most dramaticway. At the end of his life there was a terrible famine. He could feel himselfdying of starvation; he knew that the food he had with him was the very last hecould find, and it wouldn’t sustain him for long.He noticed a child who was starving—a young boy—and had a complete heart openingof compassion for him. Bainbridge realized that if he gave the boy his food, theboy might have a chance to survive—or, at the very least, he wouldn’t suffer asmuch. Bainbridge gave the boy the very last of his food, for which the boy wasextremely grateful and cried—and Bainbridge cried as well. He died soonafterward. The Cayce readings spoke very fondly of this moment, saying that inthis one gesture of selfless service—giving up his own life so that a youngerperson might live—he erased two lifetimes’ worth of negative karma. This isobviously an extreme case, and there are much gentler ways to alleviate karma,but for some souls, aggressive methods like this are preferable. This selflessservice directly paved the way for the soul to regain what it had lost, in termsof its overall level of maturity and soul evolution—and made it possible formuch greater psychic gifts to appear in the subsequent lifetime of Edgar Cayce.The data linking these stories together bridges more than twenty years’ worth ofreadings, for dozens of different clients within Cayce’s inner circle. The studyof all the different configurations that occur from one lifetime to another ismassive. Each of us definitely appears to have a “soul group” we keepreincarnating with again and again. We are reacquainted with our soul group eachtime we transition into the afterlife. Understanding this mysterious in-betweenpoint is vital to our exploration of synchronicity, the cycles of history, andreincarnation. The amount of information available on the afterlife is far morespecific and detailed than most people are aware of. Learning the likely truthof what happens to us after we die can be a profoundly useful insight for ourown daily lives as we gain a greater understanding of the purpose we are here tofulfill, and how the synchronicities and karmic events in our lives are beingmanaged behind the scenes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTMAPPING OUT THE AFTERLIFEIf reincarnation is a scientific fact, recognized in many of the great worldreligions, then does anything actually happen as we transition between one lifeand the next? Do we simply pop out of one body and pop into another, with noconsciousness or experience in between? Or is there an elaborate afterlife we gothrough, complete with a full set of experiences that help us plan out our nextincarnation? Does the “veil” lift in between lives? Do we step into a fullerlevel of who we really are? Do we now have a comprehensive understanding of whatwe’re hoping to learn from our lifetimes in the different cycles of history onearth? Do we formulate a game plan for how we can learn our lessons andpenetrate the veil in future incarnations? This is another area in whichscientific research has shed key light on the destiny we all must eventuallyface.Clinical death involves a cessation of the heartbeat, of breathing, and of allbrain-wave activity. Without brain waves, the thinking mind should cease toexist—at least in conventional biology. Once you are brain-dead, no electricalactivity occurs in the brain whatsoever. Conventional scientists believe thiselectrical activity is the root of consciousness—and without it, you have nothoughts. Nonetheless, many people report a continuing set of experiences thatoccur after they have been declared clinically dead and are then successfullyresuscitated and returned to their bodies. Even if someone has no priorknowledge of any reports of an afterlife, there are remarkable similarities inthe reports found all over the world. Dr. Sam Parnia and his associates at theUniversity of Southampton examined a wide variety of professional scientificstudies into near-death experiences, or NDEs, and found many commonalities amongthem. “A number of recent scientific studies carried out by independentresearchers have demonstrated that 10–20 percent of people who go throughcardiac arrest and clinical death report lucid, well-structured thoughtprocesses, reasoning, memories and sometimes detailed recall of events duringtheir encounter with death.”271 [part0034.html#chapter008fn271]Dr. Pim van Lommel, a cardiologist in the Netherlands, conducted the largesthospital-based study of NDEs, years after hearing a patient report seeing atunnel, a light, and beautiful colors and hearing wonderful music during aclinical death in 1969. This was a full seven years before Life After Life, Dr.Raymond Moody’s groundbreaking book on the near-death experience, firstappeared. Dr. van Lommel didn’t investigate NDEs any further until 1986, afterhe read a stunningly detailed NDE story that took place while a person wasclinically dead for a full six minutes.After reading [this] book I started to interview my patients who had survived acardiac arrest. To my great surprise, within two years about fifty patients toldme about their NDE…. So, in 1988 we started a prospective study of 344consecutive survivors of cardiac arrest in ten Dutch hospitals…. 62 patients(18%) reported some recollection of the time of clinical death…. About 50% ofthe patients with an NDE reported awareness of being dead, or had positiveemotions, 30% reported moving through a tunnel, had an observation of acelestial landscape, or had a meeting with deceased relatives. About 25% of thepatients with an NDE had an out-of-body experience, had communication with “thelight,” or observed colours, 13% experienced a life review, and 8% experienced aborder….Patients with an NDE did not show any fear of death, they strongly believed inan afterlife, and their insight in what is important in life had changed: loveand compassion for oneself, for others, and for nature. They now understood thecosmic law that everything one does to others will ultimately be returned tooneself: hatred and violence as well as love and compassion. Remarkably, therewas often evidence of increased intuitive feelings.272[part0034.html#chapter008fn272]Dr. van Lommel’s study of these sixty-two cases of near-death experience revealsthat we do seem to know who we are and what we are really doing here when wemove into the afterlife. We are fully aware of the law of karma and that we arehere to learn to love each other. We may often regret the unloving things wehave done, but we are very focused on coming back to repeat the same lessonsagain, in the hopes of learning to open our hearts.The website Near-Death.com features an impressive list of fifty-one differentproofs for the reality of near-death experiences.273[part0034.html#chapter008fn273] In the studies of Dr. Kenneth Ring, peoplereported witnessing real events that occurred during the time of their clinicaldeath. Some of these events were happening right there in the operating room astheir brain-wave activity, heartbeat, and respiration had gone completely flat.In other cases, they successfully observed and remembered things that happenedat distances that were significantly far away from where their physical body hadbeen. They were able to bring back specific memories of things people said anddid around them that could later be proven correct. Most surprisingly, somepeople actually appeared in front of their loved ones as ghosts—partiallyvisible images of their former selves. They were able to have full conversationswith their loved ones in this ghostly form. Both the patient and the familymember having the same conversation—after the patient was resuscitated.274[part0034.html#chapter008fn274]This data is extremely compelling. We already use eyewitness testimony toestablish proof in a court of law. Eyewitness testimony can sentence someone tolife in prison or even to death. However, in the case of phenomena likenear-death experiences, eyewitness testimony is consistently ignored,overlooked, or attacked with dubious-sounding and often ridiculous skepticalexplanations. These attacks are much more akin to religious zealotry—from theatheist’s perspective—than they are to the spirit of true science, in which theresults of the data lead the investigation.DR. MICHAEL NEWTON BUILDS A MODEL OF THE AFTERLIFEIn time, Dr. Michael Newton may be seen as one of the most influentialresearchers of the twentieth century. Dr. Newton began working as a hypnotist in1947, when he was only fifteen years old. Dr. Newton became a specialist intreating various psychological disorders through hypnotic suggestion, atechnique used to help change behavioral patterns that were not in the client’sbest interest for common goals such as losing weight and stopping smoking.Occasionally, Dr. Newton’s clients asked him if he could bring them back to apast life, but he always refused. He was an ardent skeptic and did not believein reincarnation or the afterlife. However, Dr. Newton’s perspective began tochange while he worked with a young man who had experienced chronic pain on hisright side throughout his entire life. Under hypnosis, the man was directed tomake the pain worse. This is a common technique that helps a client learn tomanage and control his overall pain levels. This client consistently used theimage of being stabbed as he performed this exercise. Dr. Newton probed for theorigin of this stabbing symbolism and the man told him, without hesitation, thathe had been killed by a bayonet in France in a previous life during World War I.The detail was intriguing, and Dr. Newton’s own clients encouraged him to pursuethis direction with them further: “Initially I was concerned that a subject’sintegration of current needs, beliefs, and fears would create fantasies ofrecollection. However, it didn’t take long before I realized our deep-seatedmemories offer a set of past experiences which are too real and connected to beignored.”275 [part0034.html#chapter008fn275]Newton explains that people under hypnosis are not dreaming or hallucinating—andin this state they are not capable of lying. They report whatever they see andhear in their subconscious minds as if everything is a literal observation.While under hypnosis, it is possible for them to misinterpret something they areseeing, but they will not report on anything they do not feel to be the literaltruth.I learned the value of careful cross-examination early in my work—and I found noevidence of anyone faking their spiritual experiences to please me. In fact,subjects in hypnosis are not hesitant in correcting my misinterpretations oftheir statements…. As my case files grew, I discovered by trial and error tophrase questions about the spirit world in a proper sequence.276[part0034.html#chapter008fn276]I also found that it did not matter if a person was an atheist, deeplyreligious, or believed in any philosophical persuasion in between—once they werein the proper superconscious state of hypnosis, all were consistent in theirreports…. I built up a high volume of cases…. While these years of specializedresearch into the spirit world rolled on, I worked practically in seclusion…. Ieven stayed out of metaphysical bookstores because I wanted absolute freedomfrom outside bias.277 [part0034.html#chapter008fn277]One of Dr. Newton’s interesting observations was that when people are broughtinto the “superconscious” state, they do not want to reveal much detail abouttheir experiences in the afterlife. They tend to be evasive—as if they arefollowing a code of ethics telling them that we, in the living world, aresupposed to have only limited access to their knowledge. Dr. Newton graduallylearned the pattern of experiences everyone went through, and by developing afamiliarity with their world, he was able to speak on their terms. This allowedhis clients to trust him enough that they would feel comfortable in sharing whatthey knew. Dr. Newton became quite surprised to discover that there wasincredible consistency in these reports. In fact, clients who never met eachother in waking life often used the same words, colloquial sayings, graphicdescriptions, and expressions for things they encountered in the afterlife.278[part0034.html#chapter008fn278] This, coupled with the fact that everyone wentthrough the same stages of events in the same order, suggested that we all knowthe afterlife very well once we are hypnotized into the superconscious state.Interestingly, Dr. Newton discovered that no one client was able to take himthrough all of the stages he had identified.279 [part0034.html#chapter008fn279]The clients seemed to jump into a certain stage of the process and stay there orprogress forward through a few others. Dr. Newton’s complete overview of thejourney through the afterlife had to be built up by interviewing many differentclients. A great deal of clinical experience and research, spanning many years,went into his overall model.Newton’s first book, Journey of Souls, guides us through ten distinct stagesfrom initial death to final reincarnation: Death and Departure, Gateway to theSpirit World, Homecoming, Orientation, Transition, Placement, Life Selection,Choosing a New Body, Preparation and Embarkation, and Rebirth.280[part0034.html#chapter008fn280] Life Selection and Choosing a New Body aretechnically two halves of the same stage in Dr. Newton’s model and occur in thesame relative location in the afterlife, but the experiences are differentenough that a separate chapter is dedicated to each of them. The overall body ofinformation Dr. Newton has provided is both highly fascinating and essential tounderstanding the greater reality we live in, so we will now review each ofthese stages and the experiences we will all encounter along the way.STAGE ONE: DEATH AND DEPARTUREYou find yourself floating over your body. You see people around your body whoare grieving your death. You often find yourself trying to convince them—withoutsuccess—that you are still there, only in another form. Soon you feel a pullingsensation that draws you away from your body. There is an ecstatic feeling offreedom and brilliant light. Some people see the light all around them, whileothers see it in the distance and feel pulled toward it. This is what createsthe commonly reported effect of moving through a dark tunnel with a light at theend.281 [part0034.html#chapter008fn281]Some people are not interested in staying near their bodies after their physicaldeath. They feel the strong pull of the afterlife and do not want to wait aroundto experience it. Many others will stay around the earth for a few days of ourtime, until shortly after their funerals. Dr. Newton’s participants haverevealed that they have a greatly accelerated sense of time in the afterlife,and what we think of as days may take only minutes to pass by for them.282[part0034.html#chapter008fn282] Most people are not interested in seeingthemselves buried—as they do not experience emotions like we do—but they doappreciate the respect and tributes their friends pay them.At this stage, people may also report specific factual details of who they wereand where they lived. Dr. Newton says that the average person has an astonishingability to reveal dates and geographic locations of past lives, which can oftenbe verified. Even though the borders of nations and the names of places changeover time, the specific details have consistently proven to be correct.283[part0034.html#chapter008fn283] This mirrors the results that Dr. Ian Stevensonand Dr. Jim Tucker obtained in their own exhaustive reincarnation research aswell as the results seen in the Cayce readings.STAGE TWO: GATEWAY TO THE SPIRIT WORLDThe second phase Dr. Newton cataloged—the Gateway to the Spirit World—is wherewe see the dark tunnel, enter it, and reach the light at the end. Not everyoneexperiences this sequence of events the same way. Some see the tunnel appearright over their bodies, while others have to fly high above the earth beforethey can enter it, but in most cases the tunnel appears quickly after we leavethe earth. Only the most disturbed spirits attempt to stay near their bodies forany length of time. Younger souls with fewer past lives may take a little longerto head out than more experienced souls, who tend to move on quickly.The common stereotype, in which a person ends up in a flowing field of tallgrass or wildflowers as soon as he or she leaves the tunnel, with all his or herfriends and relatives there, did happen in some cases but was by no means astandard. However, everyone seems to experience a spectacularly inspiring set ofvisions at this point. Most people are somewhat confused when they first emergeand are not sure how to interpret the forms, colors, and energies they areseeing. It will often take you time to understand and explain what you areseeing in any tangible manner to the hypnotist. Almost immediately after theirdeath, most people do hear beautiful music or sound vibrations—which continue tobe audible as they move through the early stages of their entry into theafterlife. Others report seeing layers of energy in which different activitiesseem to be happening.Case five in Dr. Newton’s book is a man who reported seeing an absolutelygigantic and incredibly beautiful vision as soon as he came out of the tunnel.He witnessed a staggeringly large “ice palace” made of gorgeous crystals. Hesaid that most of the crystals were grayish or white but that he also saw colorsin glittering mosaics. He could see no end to this gorgeous city; as he keptlooking, it seemed to stretch on forever. The sheer size, scope, and grandeur ofwhat he was seeing didn’t even seem possible.284 [part0034.html#chapter008fn284]Although each of us may have a completely different vision, whatever we see isinvariably a majestic sight. We may see stunning castle towers in the distance,beautiful rainbows in a vast blue sky, or colorful fields. Interestingly, thesescenes seem to stay consistent over the course of many lifetimes for a soul. Dr.Newton has observed that these scenes often relate to beloved memories from ourphysical lives—such as “an unforgotten home, school, garden, mountain, orseashore”—in order to help us feel familiar and comfortable when we arrive inthe spirit world.285 [part0034.html#chapter008fn285] This is the only part ofour journey that has so much variety. After we move through this stage, ourobservations become much more standardized.286 [part0034.html#chapter008fn286]We also find out, at this point in the book, that we do not immediately becomeomniscient after death. We may still be confused, sad, bewildered, andtraumatized by what has happened. If we experience sadness and confusion at thispoint, we are generally approached by our main guide in the afterlife. This is avery loving and supportive person who then helps us move through our initialgreeting and orientation. Our guide helps us work through whatever emotions weare feeling with patience and expertise. Younger souls are more apt to begreeted this way, whereas more experienced souls will remember where they areand know where they are going. Even in cases where people are still experiencingtrauma, they are quite fascinated by the beauty and the majesty of what they seeall around them.STAGE THREE: HOMECOMINGStage three in Dr. Newton’s mapping of the afterlife is called Homecoming. Thisis when we are more formally greeted into the spirit world, not just by ourinitial guide, but by others who are close to us. These people often appear asmasses of luminous energy, but they can project faces we are familiar with inorder to help ease us into our new surroundings. The face of a former lifetimeis only one of a theoretically limitless number of different forms a soul cantake on in the afterlife, since our energetic bodies are completely thoughtresponsive.Another very interesting thing Dr. Newton discovered in his research, which ismore fully explained in his second volume, Destiny of Souls, is that we will seepeople we know who are still alive on earth as well. Even if their physicalbodies are alive, they also have an energetic body that remains in the afterlifethe entire time. This is quite different from most people’s view ofreincarnation. Again and again, Dr. Newton’s clients revealed that we projectonly a certain percentage of our total essence into the human form at any onetime—the rest remains in the afterlife to guide and watch over what we aredoing. This is explained in Dr. Newton’s second book, Destiny of Souls, in thesection entitled “Soul Division and Reunification.”287[part0034.html#chapter008fn287] The average, less-advanced soul will put between50 and 70 percent of its energy into a physical body, whereas more advancedsouls will never transfer more than 25 percent.288[part0034.html#chapter008fn288]Dr. Newton explains that the volume of energy we put in is less important thanthe overall quality and refinement of the wisdom and experience of the soul—andtherefore, more mature souls do better by using less of their energy, as itleaves them with more flexibility in the afterlife. Some highly ambitious soulsalso divide themselves into two or even three simultaneous physical incarnationson earth, in the hope of dramatically speeding up their evolution, and may onlyleave 10 percent of their soul’s energy behind in the afterlife. Once you committo a path like this, you have to carry through with it for the entire length oftime your body or bodies are alive on the physical planet. Dr. Newton discoveredthat most souls quickly see the folly in this path, are warned not to do it bytheir guides, and will not attempt it more than once or twice before decidingthat it is not a good idea. This, of course, also means that overlaps, in whicha soul will project itself into a new body well before an existing incarnationhas faded out, can and do occur. This upsets most people’s idea of a linear,one-to-one schedule of reincarnation, if they’ve ever taken the time to thinkabout these concepts.We also find out that if a soul were to project 100 percent of its energy into abody, it would literally fry the electrochemical circuits of the brain.Furthermore, the brain would be totally subjugated to the power of the soul, andthis would eliminate the veiling referred to in the Law of One series as anecessary aspect of our evolution. Without spiritual amnesia, we would not havethe potential to grow; we would come into our physical incarnation on earthalready knowing everything.Therefore, you will invariably see the people you know and love the most whenyou go through the Homecoming phase, even if they are still alive on earth.There is a lot of hugging and crying and an incredible feeling of love,acceptance, and belonging at this stage. This has a tremendously positive effecton us and greatly eases our passage into this new world. Also, at this point webegin very clearly remembering multiple lifetimes we have shared with each ofthese people. All our lifetimes start to blend together as we realize how manydifferent times we’ve incarnated and interacted with the same folks.289[part0034.html#chapter008fn289]However, if we have committed atrocities toward others, such as murders, ortoward ourselves, such as suicide, then we may go off to be alone with our guideto rehabilitate and quickly plan out our next incarnation. This is all discussedin Journey of Souls, chapter 4, “The Displaced Soul.”290[part0034.html#chapter008fn290] People who go through this process are alwaystreated with patience and love, not the fiery world of torment and purgatory inwhich most people have been taught to believe.291[part0034.html#chapter008fn291] However, they do end up reviewing and relivingthe ways in which they hurt others, and they experience it from the other sideas a direct reliving of how they made others feel by their actions. The Law ofOne series clearly reveals that suicide is a very bad idea. It creates the needfor a great deal of healing work and a renewed dedication to go through the samelessons again in a subsequent lifetime—hopefully without committing suicide thenext time.292 [part0034.html#chapter008fn292] Violent, unethical acts require usto choose difficult life events that we hope will balance out our karma if wehandle them lovingly. If we do come into the afterlife with this type ofsignificant damage, we can spend quite an extended amount of time in isolationbefore getting the opportunity to again mix with our friends and loved ones.Furthermore, once we are allowed back into our group, we are then closelysupervised.293 [part0034.html#chapter008fn293]In case ten, one of Dr. Newton’s clients reported on a man who had terribly hurta girl during his most recent life and as a result did not reconnect with hissoul group. He had to go through “extensive private study” with his guide andquickly chose to reincarnate as a woman who was physically abused and treatedwith cruelty. This helped him appreciate and understand what it feels like to gothrough these experiences, so he would be far less inclined to hurt others insubsequent lifetimes.294 [part0034.html#chapter008fn294] This man was not judgedby his guide—in the afterlife, we are well aware of what our goals are in thephysical plane. If we see that we have not learned the lessons we chose, we willcooperate with our guides to determine how we may best be restored to balance.The people we meet at the Homecoming stage may not interact with us further,except at a distance. Once we move into the later stages, we are reacquaintedwith our “soul group”—a team of people sharing a similar level of spiritualdevelopment with us. Also, as we become more advanced as souls, no welcomingcommittee is necessary at the Homecoming stage and we will quickly move on torejoin our soul group. In these cases, we seem to be pulled quite naturallyalong wavelike bands of light.At this point, Dr. Newton also reveals that even though there is full thoughtsharing in the afterlife and telepathic communication occurs among everyone, itis still possible for two individuals to have a private conversation by touchingeach other. Most of Dr. Newton’s clients are unwilling to divulge any detailsabout the contents of these intimate discussions.STAGE FOUR: ORIENTATIONOnce we go through the Homecoming process, we go through an interesting seriesof experiences to help us reorient and refamiliarize ourselves with theafterlife. Our guide is often intimately involved with us at this stage. Thefirst and most important part of this process is an energetic form of healing inwhich the traumas we carried in from our physical lives are washed away. Dr.Newton thinks of this as akin to a hospital stay, and his clients consistentlyuse similar words and phrases to describe it. The most common phrase is “theplace of healing,” but it might also be called a chamber, a berth, or a stopoverzone. Once we reach this hospital-like chamber, we go through what Dr. Newtoncalls “the shower of healing.” Our guide often directs this process. We moveinto a specific room of light and are bathed in a stream of liquid healingenergy that appears like a beam coming toward us and moving through us. Many ofDr. Newton’s clients reported that the sensation is similar to a refreshingshower after a hard day’s work, but in this case the effect is much deeper.New souls in particular come to earth in a very positive, loving state of mindand expect to be treated fairly.295 [part0034.html#chapter008fn295] We areshocked as we realize how cruel and hurtful people can really be. Negative,traumatic memories, fears, and worries are washed away at this point. We againfeel whole. We are inspired, renewed, and restored and are finally able to letgo of the emotional bonds to our previous lifetime.The second phase of Orientation is a substantial counseling process with ourguide. The guide asks us probing questions about how we lived our lives, andwhether we lived up to our own expectations, as we had chosen them before birth.This process is done with gentle grace—not a harsh, accusing tone ordemeanor—but we are still expected to be honest, soul-searching, and thorough.Our guide already knows our strengths and weaknesses, our fears and fixations,and is willing to work with us as long as we keep trying. It is impossible forus to hide anything from our guides due to the inevitable reality of instanttelepathy in the afterlife. This counseling process often seems to occur in aparticular room, and the room may have similarities to places we knew from ourown lives on earth.Some people have a much more difficult time with this counseling than others,and this is due to the overall maturity of the soul. Great humility is required,and we still experience our waking personality, to varying degrees. We are notexalted beings who have reached a state of total soul perfection. We have wants,needs, and desires; we may feel embarrassed, awkward, fearful, and disappointed.Therefore, this process certainly is not easy, but it is often necessary. Wealso discover the many different ways in which our guide attempted to influenceus telepathically to make positive choices in our lives, such as throughsynchronicity. In order to progress, we must honestly admit how we disregardedthose messages and chose to act in weakness, ignorance, and fear instead. Thiswhole process is a private warm-up for a much more significant meeting thathappens later on, when we meet with a highly evolved group many people refer toas the Council of Masters, or Council of Elders, at the end of stage five. Themore advanced souls do not require any counseling at the Orientation stage andsimply move on to their ultimate destination.STAGE FIVE: TRANSITIONOnce we are bathed in healing light and have been open and honest enough to movethrough our initial counseling session with our guide, we go through what Dr.Newton calls the Transition phase. The visions we experience here can be some ofthe most breathtaking of our entire journey through the afterlife. We move intoan enormous area where we see souls coming and going, much like at a train orsubway station, but on an utterly vast scale. Gravity does not apply in theafterlife, so there will often be a vast, interconnecting web of energetictunnels leading souls to their eventual destinations. One of Dr. Newton’sclients referred to this area as the hub of a great wagon wheel—and once youreach the tunnel to your destination, you move out of the wheel and begintraveling down one of the spokes. People are typically very excited by what theysee at this stage, and they find themselves traveling along “lines of light.”There is no darkness here—everything is glowing with light at different levelsof brightness. We are usually well aware, by this point, that once we movethrough this tunnel to our eventual destination, we will be reacquainted withthose we love the most. As we think about these people, we telepathicallyconnect with them and experience an initial meeting in that form before weactually leave the tunnel. These people are at the same relative level of soulevolution as we are, and we learn from one another’s experiences and comparenotes in the afterlife, often with a great deal of humor.[../images/00016.jpeg]Fig. 8 [part0006.html#l8]: Etching of one of Dante’s heavenly realms, by GustaveDoréWe do not have much control over our movement at this stage. The tunnelsnaturally bend as we go along, and Dr. Newton’s more advanced clients revealthat higher entities are responsible for guiding the movement.296[part0034.html#chapter008fn296] These entities are often called “the directors,”or another similar term. As we travel through the tunnels, we see plenty ofdestinations where other people have gathered. These areas appear as clumps orclusters of light—almost like buds that have grown off the stem we are travelingthrough, much like a flowering or fruiting plant.However, once we arrive at our own area and enter it, the scenery often becomesmuch more conventional looking, from the standpoint of our experiences on earth.We will often see large areas that are familiar to us, including towns, schools,beloved homes, and landmarks that help us feel safe and secure. We are now fullyreacquainted with our soul group—people with whom we keep reincarnating, againand again, as they play different roles. They may appear as parents, romanticpartners, siblings, teachers, coworkers, or friends in various lifetimes.Members of our soul group who are incarnate in human forms on earth may seem tobe half-asleep, radiating a dimmer light and staying fairly quiet. They maygreet us briefly but tend to keep to themselves. Most of us at this stage areimmediately aware of who is in a body and who is between lifetimes. Once we’vetaken some time to reconnect with our friends and loved ones and enjoy thesefamiliar surroundings, we are ready to meet with the Council of Elders. Dr.Newton’s second book, Destiny of Souls, goes into much more detail about thisgroup counseling session that occurs at the end of stage five. The process issimilar to the initial counseling we went through with our guide—only now we areaccountable to a group of highly evolved beings.STAGE SIX: PLACEMENTOnce we’ve completed the group counseling at the end of the Transition stage, wemove into Placement. This is where we are reacquainted with familiar groups ofvarious sizes. At this stage, we experience a return to a school-typeenvironment. The classrooms can be quite beautiful and will have scenery chosenfrom our favorite places on earth. Apparently many Westerners choose a Greektemple as their main location. We study with our own soul group—our closestfriends, who enjoy a level of evolution similar to ours. This group can rangebetween three and twenty-five souls, but the typical number is about fifteen.297[part0034.html#chapter008fn297] This group will often be called the InnerCircle, and it stays consistent from lifetime to lifetime. We also come intosome degree of contact with a much larger secondary group of souls who incarnatewith us to varying degrees. Dr. Newton says that these secondary groups arenever seen to have less than a thousand souls and can often be significantlylarger than that. When we combine this observation with what we find in theCayce readings, we see that entire towns, cities, nations, or ethnic groups cankeep moving, in clusters, through different locations and eras. And, as we areabout to explore in Part 3 [part0021.html], these eras are organized into cyclesof historical events that repeat very precisely until we finally learn ourlessons and they no longer need to continue occurring.We perform real work in this school setting, which usually comes in the form ofsitting down with what Dr. Newton’s clients usually call a “life book.” Althoughthis first appears to look like a typical, large, bound leather book, it actsmuch more like an advanced holographic projection technology once we open it.Each “page” of this book represents a given period of time in our lives. As wego through the book, we review all the different experiences we went through inour lives—in vividly realistic detail. This process is much like virtualreality, in the sense that we often end up directly projecting into the sceneswe are reviewing. Special emphasis is placed on projecting into the minds andhearts of those we interacted with, particularly if we caused them to feel hurtor pain in some way. We now get to personally experience everything we put themthrough, including the most painful events. The Law of One series reveals thatthis process can be significantly shortened if we remember events where we hurtothers while we are still living in a physical body and forgive ourselves forwhat we did.Not all of the Placement stage involves the difficult work of reviewing ourlives and forgiving ourselves for what we have done to hurt others. There arealso periods of recreation, where souls of many different levels of evolutiongather together for enjoyable activities. This may include forming circles withothers to unify our thoughts and feelings more fully and to project energy. Suchinteractions with others may involve singing, or the energetic equivalent of it.We also interact with our guides, who are on a higher level of evolution, and wefeel a great sense of community.SEVEN DIFFERENT LEVELSOnce we reach this point in the book, Dr. Newton begins discussing the sevendifferent levels he discovered that souls move through in the afterlife. Thiswas initially discovered by people describing the colors of their own energybodies, as well as the colors of those around them. Level I was white, Level IIreddish yellow, Level III yellow, Level IV dark yellow with traces of blue,Level V light blue, Level VI dark bluish purple, and Level VII purple—which isvery rare. Newton considers Level I to be beginner, Level II lower intermediate,Level III intermediate, Level IV upper intermediate, Level V advanced, and LevelVI highly advanced. One client referred to Level VI beings as “the sages,”whereas Level VII beings are the “old ones,” who are rarely seen—and highlymysterious. There is astonishing agreement between Dr. Newton’s independent,hard-earned observations and what we read in the Law of One series about theseven different “densities” corresponding to the colors of the rainbow and theevolutionary level of beings we find there. Dr. Newton found that 42 percent ofhis clients were Level I, 31 percent were Level II, 17 percent were Level III, 9percent were Level IV, and only 1 percent were Level V.298[part0034.html#chapter008fn298]WANDERERSNot one of Dr. Newton’s clients was a Level VI. He found that souls at Level Vwere usually working in the helping professions or working to alleviate socialinjustice in some form while living on earth. They beam with kindness,composure, and stability and are not motivated by self-interest.299[part0034.html#chapter008fn299] The lack of Level VI clients in Dr. Newton’spractice may be because people at this advanced level would not normally seekout hypnotherapy. In the Law of One series, higher-level souls—including thosefrom fourth, fifth and sixth density—do occasionally take on physicalincarnations and are known as “Wanderers.” In this next quote, it is importantto point out that the word distortion is not a bad thing in the Law of Oneseries. Anything other than “intelligent infinity” is a distortion of the pureawareness that the universe is formed from. Therefore, space, time, light,matter, energy, and biological life are all distortions, as are any choices wemake. Some distortions move us closer to unity, while others move us fartheraway. The goal of all Wanderers is to help us remember who we truly are.12.26 Question:…You spoke of Wanderers. Who are Wanderers? Where do they comefrom?Answer:…Imagine, if you will, the sands of your shores. As countless as thegrains of sand are the sources of intelligent infinity. When a social memorycomplex [a group soul usually in fifth density or sixth density] has achievedits complete understanding of its desire, it may conclude that its desire isservice to others with the distortion towards reaching their hand, figuratively,to any entities who call for aid. These entities whom you may call the Brothersand Sisters of Sorrow move towards this calling of sorrow. These entities arefrom all reaches of the infinite creation, and are bound together by the desireto serve in this distortion.Question: How many of them are incarnate on Earth now?Answer:…The number is approximate due to a heavy influx of those birthed at thistime due to an intensive need to lighten the planetary vibration…. The numberapproaches sixty-five million.Question: Are most of these from the fourth density? What density do they comefrom?Answer:…Few there are of fourth density. The largest number of Wanderers, as youcall them, are of the sixth density. The desire to serve must be distortedtowards a great deal of purity of mind and what you may call foolhardiness orbravery…. The challenge/danger of the Wanderer is that it will forget itsmission, become karmically involved, and thus be swept into the maelstrom fromwhich it had incarnated to aid the destruction.Question: What could one of these entities do to become karmically involved?Answer: An entity which acts in a consciously unloving manner in action withother beings can become karmically involved.Question: Do many of these Wanderers have physical ailments in this third…Earthsituation?Answer: Due to the extreme variance between the vibratory distortions of thirddensity and those of the more dense [higher] densities, if you will, Wanderershave as a general rule some form of handicap, difficulty, or feeling ofalienation which is severe. The most common of these difficulties arealienation, the reaction against the planetary vibration by personalitydisorders, as you would call them, and body complex ailments indicatingdifficulty in adjustment to the planetary vibrations such as allergies.300[part0034.html#chapter008fn300]“WHO DO YOU THINK NATURE IS?”In the Placement stage, we also can travel great distances from our originalhome base as we become intermediate- and advanced-level souls and venture outinto exotic locations. Pages 161 through 166 in Journey of Souls reveal afascinating discussion about what one client called “the World of Creation andNon-Creation.”301 [part0034.html#chapter008fn301] This is a three-dimensional,physical world—like the earth—in which biological life is just getting started.Souls begin visiting worlds like this once they reach Level IV. If weextrapolate from the percentages in Dr. Newton’s own client pool, one out of tenpeople now on earth is pursuing these activities in between lifetimes. One ofDr. Newton’s clients named the planet these individuals were visiting “EarthII.” These souls directly participate in designing the life-forms that aregrowing on the planet they visit. “Earth II” happened to be larger and somewhatcolder than earth, with fewer oceans.Such planets are considered “vacation spots,” but our journeys there also servea valuable purpose; we are learning to become co-creators of life itself. We areable to form physical, living organisms by focusing our own soul energy.Teachers are on hand to assist us with this process. This particular client,case twenty-two, was working only with basic elements—for example, using gasvapors to create water or combining dust, water, air, and fire to create rocks.His soul’s own energy was able to manipulate heating, pressure, and cooling. Inhis waking life he worked at a charitable organization feeding the homeless, andin the afterlife state he described the process of making rocks as “tricky, butnot too complicated.” When Dr. Newton said he thought nature was responsible forthe creation of these things, his client laughed and responded, “Who do youthink Nature is?”302 [part0034.html#chapter008fn302]Case twenty-two, whose name in the spirit world was Nenthum, was also working ondeveloping plants, but he didn’t yet have the sophistication to create themproperly. Sometimes he deconstructed his attempts to make plants before anyoneelse could see his mistakes, as a form of self-protectiveness and pride. Thereason for these mistakes was apparently that his energy was not applied“delicately enough” to combine the chemical elements to get the desired results.Dr. Newton’s research revealed that souls are not able to make realcontributions to the development of living things until they reach Level V,though Level IV souls are the first to begin exploring this process of creation.Another client at Level V, known only as case twenty-three, was a woman in hermidthirties working as a substance-abuse counselor. As it turned out, she was anold pro with creating life on many different “earth-type planets” and hadalready worked her way up through a variety of oceanic life-forms. She said thatthe first biological life souls learn to create is microorganisms—and this is“very difficult to learn.”303 [part0034.html#chapter008fn303] Early in hercareer as a co-creator, she started out with basic forms of oceanic life such asalgae and plankton and worked up to more complex creatures such as fish overtime. This prompted Dr. Newton to ask her a revealing question.Dr. Newton: A soul who becomes proficient with actually creating life must beable to split cells and give DNA instructions…. You do this by sending particlesof energy into protoplasm?S: We must learn to do this, yes—coordinating it with a sun’s energy…. Each sunhas different energy effects on the worlds around them.304[part0034.html#chapter008fn304]This unique energetic method of creating biological life is validated by the newscientific discoveries we have discussed—in which DNA can be seen as a quantumwave and life is written into the basic laws of quantum mechanics. Unbeknownstto him on any conscious level, Dr. Newton’s results have now been independentlyverified with new scientific discoveries, and this certainly lends support tothe overall credibility of his work. After he heard this surprising answer, Dr.Newton became concerned that if individual souls are participating in thecreation of life-forms that could live on for millions of years on a givenplanet, they may be interfering with its overall evolutionary course. Casetwenty-three then said that these life-generating activities are a natural partof the co-creative nature of the universe, where souls grow further and furtherinto living embodiments of the Creator. Other souls at higher levels carefullywatch over the process to ensure that everything progresses smoothly and in abeneficial direction.We also find out that larger groups of advanced souls can create full-scalestars. Case twenty-three revealed that she was already creating “small bundlesof heated, highly-concentrated matter.” She told Dr. Newton that if he were tosee these creations of hers when they were finished, they would look likeminiature solar systems.305 [part0034.html#chapter008fn305] She had already beenable to create suns the size of basketballs and planets the size of marbles. The“concentrated energy of the Old Ones”—those at Level VII—was required to makephysical universes—and space itself.306 [part0034.html#chapter008fn306] Thisgives us a very interesting way of seeing the living universe—namely, thatplanets and stars can be created by the focused thoughts and energies ofadvanced souls, who could also be experiencing incarnations on earth. These Lawof One quotes shed further light on what Dr. Newton independently heard from hisclients.13.16 Each step [of creating a planet] recapitulates intelligent infinity in itsdiscovery of awareness. In a planetary environment, all begins in what you wouldcall chaos—energy undirected and random in its infinity. Slowly, in your termsof understanding, there forms a focus of self-awareness. Thus the Logos [themind of the galaxy] moves. Light comes to form the darkness, according to theco-Creator’s patterns and vibratory rhythms, so constructing a certain type ofexperience. This begins with first density, which is the density ofconsciousness—the mineral and water life upon the planet learning, from fire andwind, the awareness of being…. Picture, if you will, the difference betweenfirst-vibrational mineral or water life, and the lower second-density beingswhich begin to move about within and upon its being. This movement is thecharacteristic of second density—the striving towards light and growth…. Thesecond density strives towards the third density, which is the density ofself-consciousness or self-awareness.307 [part0034.html#chapter008fn307]82.10 The One Original Thought is the harvest of all previous, if you would usethis term, experience of the Creator by the Creator. As It decides to knowItself, It generates Itself into that plenum, full of the glory and the power ofthe One Infinite Creator which is manifested to your perceptions as space orouter space…. Gradually, step by step, the Creator becomes that which may knowItself, and the portions of the Creator partake less purely in the power of theoriginal word or thought. This is for the purpose of refinement of the oneoriginal thought. The Creator does not properly create, as much as Itexperiences Itself.308 [part0034.html#chapter008fn308]51.10 This Creator is to be understood, both in macrocosm and microcosm, tohave, as we have said, two natures: the unpotentiated infinity which isintelligent; this is all that there is. Free will has potentiated, both theCreator of us all, and our selves, as co-Creators with intelligentinfinity—which has will.309 [part0034.html#chapter008fn309]75.25 It is well for each to realize its self as the Creator. Thusly each maysupport each, including the support of self by humble love of self asCreator.310 [part0034.html#chapter008fn310]74.11 The heart of the discipline of the personality is threefold. One, knowyourself. Two, accept yourself. Three, become the Creator. The third step isthat step which, when accomplished, renders one the most humble servant ofall—transparent in personality and completely able to know and acceptother-selves.311 [part0034.html#chapter008fn311]18.13 All serve the One Creator. There is nothing else to serve, for the Creatoris all that there is. It is impossible not to serve the Creator. There aresimply various distortions of this service.312 [part0034.html#chapter008fn312]TASTY BITS OF COSMIC TRUTHDr. Newton’s clients revealed that souls can visit planets throughout ourgalaxy—and possibly beyond it—though this notion is refuted in the Law of Oneseries. Many souls develop a fondness for certain planets and continue returningto them between incarnations.313 [part0034.html#chapter008fn313] Most people arenot able to bring back any clear memories of life on other worlds under hypnoticregression; only the rare and advanced client is able to access thisinformation. Dr. Newton speculates that mental blocks may be put in place by ourguides so that we do not recall information that would be beyond our ability touse and appreciate in a positive way.One midlevel client described his desire to take a break from life on earth andreincarnate somewhere else. He was sent to a world of humanlike intelligentbeings who were quite different from us. They were small and thickset and hadchalk-white faces that were incapable of smiling. They did not experiencelaughter like we do and were thoughtful and somber. The client ended up beingquite outside his normal element, did not integrate well there, and decided toreturn to earth after one incarnation.Natural stargates, or “time doors,” are also discussed at this point. Thesenatural passageways, which exist throughout the universe and allow us to travelto different times and places, are routinely used by souls as a basic form oftravel. In the spirit world, past, present, and future can all be seen as onecontinuum. Years can pass by as quickly as seconds—and the events that occurduring this time can be observed as if you were fast-forwarding a video.Traveling though different times is as easy in the spirit world as travelingfrom one place to another is in this world. Much of the second half of TheSource Field Investigations is dedicated to exploring the scientific proof thatexplains how there is a parallel reality in which time is three-dimensional.This, again, was based on the complex discussions in the Law of One series.Dr. Newton concludes that time and duration were both created so that we have anopportunity to experience evolution, as souls, at a given rate. If past,present, and future were all accessible at once, there would be no mystery, nosurprise, and no challenge that would help us grow. Yet in the spirit world itis very important for us to be able to perceive our greater reality from the“overview” perspective so we can find out where we keep repeating the samelessons, from one lifetime to another, and design lessons in future incarnationsthat will help us work through these difficulties.Another interesting connection between Dr. Newton’s research and the Law of Oneseries is his discussion of “spiritual substance” in the afterlife. In Law ofOne terms, different planes of existence are measured not by “dimensions” but bydifferent densities of energy. These densities can be physically experienced inthe afterlife as different levels of thickness. Dr. Newton’s clients reportedexactly the same phenomenon—observing different forms of spiritual substance asbeing lighter or heavier, thicker or thinner, and larger or smaller.THE COSMIC HEARTBEATOne of Dr. Newton’s clients, named Thece in the afterlife, described that theuniverse moves through cycles of expansion and contraction314[part0034.html#chapter008fn314]—and this also is mirrored directly in the Law ofOne series. We are also told that there is no real center of the universe; it isall around us, can be found in any one location, and functions much like thebeating of a heart. Both time and space are driven in these regular rhythms.Cycles, therefore, will occur throughout the universe, at all different levelsof size and duration, and are driven by a heartbeat-like pulsation. Again, thisis exactly how the Law of One series describes the nature of reality.27.6 Intelligent infinity has a rhythm or flow as of a giant heart—beginningwith the central sun, as you would think or conceive of this, the presence ofthe flow inevitable as a tide of beingness without polarity, without finity; thevast and silent all beating outward, outward, focusing outward and inward untilthe focuses are complete. The intelligence or consciousness of foci have reacheda state where their, shall we say, spiritual nature or mass calls them inward,inward, inward until all is coalesced. This is the rhythm of reality as youspoke.315 [part0034.html#chapter008fn315]27.13 Love…[is] the great activator and primal co-Creator of various creationsusing intelligent infinity…Love uses light and has the power to direct light inits distortions. Thus vibratory complexes [such as your human form] recapitulatein reverse the creation in its unity, thus showing the rhythm or flow of thegreat heartbeat—if you will use this analogy.316 [part0034.html#chapter008fn316]In the Placement stage, souls may also project themselves into various naturalsettings or life-forms as a recreational or vacation-type activity. Rocks cangive a feeling of density. Trees can convey a powerful sense of serenity. Watercan give a feeling of flowing cohesiveness. Butterflies can help the soul feelbeautiful and free, and whales can help the soul feel powerful and immense.317[part0034.html#chapter008fn317] As enjoyable as the Placement stage of ourjourney often is, sooner or later we have to get serious and plan out our nextincarnation. In Dr. Newton’s experience, souls do not gain the opportunity tostop reincarnating in physical bodies until they have reached at least Level V.STAGE SEVEN: LIFE SELECTIONLeaving the spirit world can be a horribly difficult process. You are knowinglyturning your back on a world of love, peace, wisdom, and blissful happiness toreturn to a world that can often be filled with suffering, pain, betrayal, anddisappointment. Some souls resist this process for as long as they can andgenuinely wish they did not have to return—but sooner or later, they must. Somesouls move on to other worlds if the world they had been living on is no longeravailable to host physical human life.318 [part0034.html#chapter008fn318] In Lawof One terms, once earth has fully transitioned into fourth density—estimated tobe between one hundred and seven hundred years after 2011—anyone who still needsthird-density incarnation for their evolutionary growth process will naturallyend up moving to a new and different world.Case twenty-four reveals that he will not be returning to earth in his nextlife. He plainly states that in the future, some earth people have been moved toanother planet and the earth has fewer people and is less crowded.319[part0034.html#chapter008fn319] Several of Dr. Newton’s clients indicated thatsomething like this will happen in our future. This concept of “planet hopping”in Dr. Newton’s work precisely validates what we read in the Law of One seriesabout the shift from third to fourth density “green-ray” life on earth. It isalso interesting to note that Newton observed every color in the rainbowspectrum appearing in his clients’ souls fairly routinely, except forgreen—which is almost never seen. In Law of One terms, the earth has to make aquantum leap into the green-ray level before any of its inhabitants can become“activated”—which is when their souls fully transition into the green-raydensity. We will discuss this process in Part 4 [part0027.html]. Higher-levelentities, from blue ray and indigo ray, can and do visit earth as Wanderers,usually to help out the planet while massively speeding up their own evolutionas well.Dr. Newton’s research about the timing between incarnations closely mirrors whatwe find in the Cayce readings. Dr. Newton found that during Neolithic-type timeperiods, hundreds or even thousands of years can elapse between physicalincarnations. Once we see agriculture and animal husbandry, reincarnation beginsto happen more often—but lifetimes can still be separated by as many as fivehundred years. Dr. Newton’s clients lived an average of once every two hundredyears between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1500, and after A.D. 1700 they lived once percentury. It is very common for souls to incarnate more than once a century as wehead into the 1900s. All of this research very neatly parallels what we learn inthe Cayce readings.THE RING OF DESTINYThe main responsibility we have in the Life Selection stage is to reach a placethat some of Dr. Newton’s clients called the “Ring of Destiny,” which oftenappears as a sphere of bright light. Moving into this stage, we are full ofbright hope and lofty expectations as we think positively about our nextlifetime, and we are excited about the possibility of making real spiritualgrowth. Once we move into this sphere, we often feel like we are stepping into ahighly futuristic cockpit. Different screens float around us, giving us visualimpressions of the different lifetimes we could choose for our next incarnation.We also have a control panel that allows us to review these different screens,including fast-forwarding and rewinding the events that will happen in theselives. The screens are in dynamic, fluid-like movement within the sphere oflight. As we pull up one screen for review, it flows toward us, while othernearby screens move away. We also have the opportunity to project into thesedifferent scenes and experience them as if they were really happening to us.Some part of our awareness still remains at the control panel, but most of whatwe experience is now happening within the scene itself.Each lifetime we can choose from has different events, and some could bechallenging or difficult, such as debilitating injuries. These events areultimately intended to help us grow and evolve as souls. We see that choiceswill be placed in front of us as these events occur, and we cannot be sure whatdecisions we will make once we reach those points. We are not allowed to seewhat the consequences of those decisions will be as we move into the futurewithin these lifetimes. We may try to make guesses, but the future reality ofthose choices is not made visible to us—for a very good reason. If we knew andcould foresee the consequences of the events that will happen and the choicesthat we will make, there would be no real free will and learning experiences aswe select a given lifetime. A typical Life Selection process within the Ring ofDestiny will involve a choice from among four different lifetimes.320[part0034.html#chapter008fn320] Our guides are not present to advise us at thisstage—we run through the entire process by ourselves.In some cases, souls volunteer for lives that will end prematurely, in violentdeaths, or through sudden, fatal illnesses. One client chose to be an AmericanIndian boy who would die when he was only seven years old. In this case, a shortlife as a mistreated, starving child gave him a fast lesson in humility, whichhelped burn off a great deal of karma very quickly.321[part0034.html#chapter008fn321] Another client chose to incarnate at the Dachauconcentration camp with three others of her soul group, giving her the chance tocomfort the children and try to help them survive. She accomplished her missioncourageously, and she undoubtedly created a great deal of positive karma forherself in the process.322 [part0034.html#chapter008fn322] Bear in mind thatsouls do not haphazardly choose missions like this—they will choose them only ifthey feel they are strong enough to handle them. These missions, of course,don’t always go as planned—but the souls do go in with the highest and best ofintentions.STAGE EIGHT: CHOOSING A NEW BODYDr. Michael Newton does not consider “Choosing a New Body” to be a separatestage, since this process also occurs within the Ring of Destiny–Life Selectionarea. Nonetheless, a separate chapter is devoted to this aspect of the processwe all must go through, and it heavily influences our decision-making processfor whichever life we will choose. In this stage, on the screens that floataround in this cockpit-like area, we are presented with various bodies withinwhich we can choose to incarnate. We can see how the bodies will look and feel,how they function, and how they think—throughout the different levels ofbiological age we will experience. Every human body we see around us, no matterhow it looks, is the product of a careful soul choice. A great deal of time andattention is paid to the specifics of each body; there is usually no such thingas a hasty decision. This is generally not the first time we have thought aboutour next body—we often spend time deliberating which body we will choose in theearlier stages and will talk the choice over with our guide and the people inour soul group.Dr. Newton found that most major injuries we go through in our lives are chosenat this stage, before we are born. Choosing a body involves a full awareness ofwhat will happen to it throughout a given lifetime. Again, we are prevented fromseeing exactly how these events will shape our personality. Each body hasdifficulties that come along with it, and we take our time and choose carefully.If we have recently come out of a life that was relatively easy and stress-free,we may well decide to come back into a body and a life that will present us withmany more challenges. Dr. Newton’s research found that bodies with physicaldifficulties of various sorts almost always end up producing an acceleration ofour spiritual evolution.323 [part0034.html#chapter008fn323]LETH: THE VIKING’S CYCLE OF KARMACase twenty-six in Dr. Newton’s book is fascinating in terms of showing howwildly a soul’s choice of a body can vary from one incarnation to the next. Casetwenty-six was a tall, athletic, well-proportioned woman who had sufferedrecurring leg pains throughout her life. Doctors could not find any medicalreason for her pain, but it persisted nonetheless, and she was willing to tryanything, including hypnotherapy, to seek relief. Dr. Newton suspected that theroot cause of the pain might be found in a past life, so he put her throughregression. In the superconscious state, she found herself in the Ring ofDestiny after having requested a life in one of the strongest, healthiest, andmost powerful bodies on earth at that time.She had the choice between a Roman soldier, who would have suffered through ahierarchical system of control, or a Viking named Leth, who could run free anddo as he pleased. She chose Leth, and in this lifetime, from around A.D. 800,she appeared as this brutal and powerful man. As a soul, she enjoyed theexperience of the power of the body and all the material pursuits—includingdrinking, fighting, pillaging, and sexual conquests. Leth never got sick and wasunresponsive to physical pain. He could never get enough food, drink, fighting,plundering, and sex. Apparently, everyone in this era had similar behaviors andattitudes, so Leth did not stand out as an unusually aggressive or negativesoul. Nonetheless, the infringements he caused to the free will of others cameback around—quite strongly. He may well have needed to wait several lifetimesuntil he was strong enough to balance the karma he had created as Leth. Thiscase also reveals that younger souls do not necessarily understand the law ofkarma. If they want to go into a life that will most likely involve hurtingothers, their guides will knowingly allow them to do so. They are offeredchoices of new life situations and new bodies—but until they become moreadvanced, they may not realize that the preprogrammed disasters that must happenin those bodies are the direct result of the choices they made in earlierincarnations.When Dr. Newton asked this woman to explore the reason for her recurring legpains, she immediately moved into her most recent past life. She was now asix-year-old girl named Ashley who was living in New England in the year1871—more than a thousand years after her lifetime as Leth. While Ashley wasriding in a horse-drawn carriage that was heavily burdened with weight, she fellout. The wheels ran over her legs above the knees and crushed them. Ashley’slegs never healed properly, and she spent the rest of her life having to walkwith wooden crutches. She also suffered frequent swelling in her legs and diedat a relatively young age in 1912. By this point she had worked as a writer anda tutor of disadvantaged children and thereby had built a great deal of positivekarma as a soul.In the afterlife state, she realized that she had chosen this injury to help herdevelop the power of mental concentration, but she did not appear to understandthat it was also a karmic balancing of the experiences she had created forothers as Leth. In her lifetime as Ashley, she spent most of her time in bed andlearned to read, write, and communicate well. She was then able to see how shehad directly worked, from the afterlife state, to arrange the carriage accidentand to make sure it would happen properly, at the chosen time. This involved atelepathic coordination between her soul and her body on the subconscious level.She had also given herself subconscious memory tags to know and expect thismoment. Although she had a period of time when she could have chosen not to gothrough with the carriage accident, she knew it was the best move she couldmake. She had options for other bodily injuries but had specifically chosen thisaccident because it would limit her ability to walk. This would compel her todevelop her mind more fully, since she had long periods of unbroken solitude.She made good use of the experience, with the sole problem being that she wasslightly too indulged and pampered in that lifetime.324[part0034.html#chapter008fn324] Dr. Newton was able to run her throughdesensitization exercises, while under hypnosis, that removed her subconsciousmemory of leg pain entirely. Later, she reconnected with Dr. Newton and happilyrevealed that her leg pain had never come back and she was routinely playingtennis.Dr. Newton also reveals that an energetic handshake of sorts must be madebetween the soul and the physical body. Without the influence of the soul, aperson wouldn’t be very interesting—he or she would be fairly primal in natureand would be ruled by emotions. The soul can determine whether someone is anextrovert or an introvert, whether the person is emotional or intellectual, andwhether the person is rational or idealistic in nature. Many of our personalityattributes carry over from one life to the next, but there are also personalityinfluences that are a direct result of the body itself, its heredity, and itsexperiences.Some souls consistently choose to return as people who are critical,domineering, and cold, even though they will end up being fully accountable forthe hurts they cause to others by their attitude and behavior.325[part0034.html#chapter008fn325] Souls like this can offer a great deal of karmaand growth experiences to others—and are often needed to help others balance outtheir own debts. Some souls realize that they need to have people like this intheir lives, people who are strong and tough, or else they will end updominating and manipulating everyone around them. Souls with this dominant,critical personality type appear to have greater difficulty than most inblending themselves with the human body and brain they have chosen in a givenlifetime. The soul often cannot get messages through or does not have muchinfluence on the body when the body is going through great stress or strongemotions.326 [part0034.html#chapter008fn326]STAGE NINE: PREPARATION AND EMBARKATIONIn the Preparation and Embarkation stage, we leave the Ring of Destiny and havean intensive planning meeting with the people who will play key roles in ourlives, usually from our soul group. This stage of the afterlife is very relevantto our discussion. Many synchronicities we will experience are planned out atthis point, in order to ensure that we take certain steps at certain times.Higher-level guides help us plan out the symbols and events that will help steerus through these key moments. If we choose to be in a relationship with someone,we may deliberately plan a symbol that will appear when we first see thatperson—a particular place, a particular object they are wearing, something funnythey say, some specific music we hear in the background, and so on. We struggleat this stage to memorize each of these cues, so that we will know what to dowhen we see them. Once we have incarnated in a physical body and these signalsappear, we generally will not remember the careful and deliberate planning thatwent into these events, but the memory trigger encourages us to make certaindecisions.A male client, case twenty-eight, described a prebirth agreement he made inwhich a woman he meets as a child will be wearing a shiny silver pendant on anecklace, and the sunlight then gleams off of it. Once he was alive in aphysical body, living in his hometown, this same woman walked every day on hisstreet, and she always wore a silver pendant. The first time he met her with it,the sunlight reflected off it, just as he had intended it to in theafterlife—and this event activated his memory trigger. He was immediately drawnto become her friend and engage in conversation, without consciously knowing whyhe felt so strongly about doing this. Even though he knew her for only a shorttime before his family moved, she gave him a very valuable lesson in learning torespect others.327 [part0034.html#chapter008fn327]As we go through the Preparation and Embarkation stage, we may be concernedabout our level of stubbornness and resistance to the synchronicity and gutfeelings that our souls use to communicate with us. In cases like these, we maylayer in several different memory tags that will appear as synchronicities inour lives, just to reinforce one particular decision we intend to make. Casetwenty-eight describes multiple planned triggers he would experience whenmeeting the woman he had chosen to be his wife. Both of them agreed on thesememory triggers and would cooperate, as souls, to make sure they happened. Thisincluded a laugh of hers that would remind him of the sound of tiny bells orchimes, a familiar perfume scent he would notice the first time he danced withher, and the way her eyes would look. Her chosen memory triggers included hisbig ears, the fact that he would step on her toes when they danced the firsttime, and the specific way she would feel when she first held him.After planning out these synchronicities to keep us on track, we often haveanother meeting with the Council of Elders before we head into the Rebirthstage. This meeting is used to remind us of our goals and of how important it isthat we stick to our ideals in our next lifetime. On page 261, a client of Dr.Newton’s reports the Elders as all being hairless, with oval faces, highcheekbones, and smallish features—much like the appearance of certain types ofextraterrestrials people have reported seeing.328[part0034.html#chapter008fn328] These people did have eyes like ours—not blackovals—but many extraterrestrial witness reports do feature this type ofappearance. The Elders are bathed in light, and there is a strong sense ofdivinity. This meeting is akin to a last-minute pep talk encouraging us to havepatience, to hold true to our values, to trust ourselves in the midst ofdifficult situations, and to avoid indulging in anger and negativity. We mayalso receive an energetic boost from the Elders that appears as a burst ofpositive power helping inspire us and charge us with love.STAGE TEN: REBIRTHThe final stage Dr. Newton identified is Rebirth. After the meeting with theCouncil of Elders, some souls become quiet and introspective before theyreincarnate, whereas others joke around with their friends and have alighthearted attitude about the reincarnation. Once we finally depart, we have asense of plunging downward, through areas of luminous energy. We may also seeanother dark tunnel, only this time we are returning to the earth in it, ratherthan leaving the earth through it. As soon as we exit the tunnel, we findourselves in the body of a baby within our new mother’s womb.Up until our new child begins school at around age five, we still have enoughflexibility that we can leave the body for various lengths of time. We may gooff and enjoy traveling with our friends to revisit places we lived in otherlifetimes. The minute the baby is in any physical danger or distress, weinstantly snap back to take care of the problem.329[part0034.html#chapter008fn329] While we are in the baby’s body, we work tointegrate our own soul energies with the brain of the physical body. We may alsoget the baby to do things that will help smooth out the relationships within thefamily. For example, if our mother and father are fighting, we may do somethingcute, such as poking their faces with both hands, smiling, or giggling, todistract them back into positive thoughts. It is well within the power of thesoul to get the baby to laugh when needed.CYCLES OF HISTORY AS THE MASTER ORGANIZING FILE FOR REINCARNATIONThe scientific proof for a living universe is quite far-reaching in scope. DNAand biological life appear to be written into the laws of quantum physics andmanifest as an “emergent phenomenon” wherever and however they can. Stars andplanets exert strong energetic influences on our conscious minds, whether werealize it or not. Our waking personalities are the result of a fusion betweenthe body and the soul, and we cycle through many different incarnations tomaster the same lessons. We ensure that we will see most of our friends in eachlifetime, and we also reincarnate within larger groups of people aswell—potentially in the hundreds of thousands, if not more. We may very well betied to them through common bonds of karma, and we need to keep moving throughthe ups and downs, the highs and lows, the triumphs and disasters of life.Within these secondary groups, we keep repeating the same experiences until wechoose, as a collective, to make more loving and positive choices. Ourexperiences are organized into extremely precise time cycles, as we will explorein Part 3 [part0021.html].We’ve all heard the saying that history repeats itself, but until I encounteredthis incredible body of data—and did far more research on it myself to see if itwas really true—I had no idea how structured our experiences really are. Globalevents seem to be completely random, formed by an impossibly complex array offactors. However, it turns out that all the experiences we go through, fromlifetime to lifetime, are being guided by a hidden template of spiritualevolution known as the Hero’s Journey. In the Law of One series, theseexperiences are called “the archetypical mind,” which represents the personalityof the galaxy. The fourth and final book in the original Law of One series isalmost entirely dedicated to studying this galactic mind.90.14 The archetypical mind is part of that mind which informs all experience.Please recall [our earlier] definition of the archetypical mind as therepository of those refinements to the cosmic or all-mind made by thisparticular Logos [our Milky Way galaxy] and particular only to this Logos. Thus[the archetypical mind] may be seen as one of the roots of mind, not the deepestbut certainly the most informative in some ways. The other root of mind to berecalled is that racial or planetary mind, which also informs theconceptualizations of each entity to some degree….Each Logos [galaxy] desires to create a more eloquent expression of experienceof the Creator by the Creator. The archetypical mind is intended to heightenthis ability to express the Creator in patterns more like the fanned peacock’stail—each facet of the Creator vivid, upright, and shining with articulatedbeauty.330 [part0034.html#chapter008fn330]This epic story is written into every movie and television show in existence—andI soon found out, through a great deal of pain and suffering, that you can’teven write a Hollywood screenplay that sells without having studied itextensively."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHE HERO AND HIS STORYScience and spirit have finally caught up to each other. There is a ghost in themachine. Life on earth is nowhere near as random or haphazard as many of usthink. Synchronicity is a powerful, day-by-day means of awakening us to our trueidentity—and it is also happening on a much larger scale in the cycles ofhistory we will soon be discussing. If Dr. Newton’s research is correct, a greatdeal of our experiences are being coordinated from the afterlife—and this mayinclude very precise cycles of time, in which the events in our own history arerepeating with incredible precision. This information can be a powerful tool tohelp us awaken to this much greater reality that surrounds us, particularly forthose who are hungry for physical proof. These cycles can be hundreds or eventhousands of years in length and can operate with astonishing exactness andeffectiveness.In this new science, everything is alive, including planets, stars, andgalaxies. Each level of the universe, from quantum to galactic, has a hiddenenergetic structure, driven by a pulsing heartbeat, that directly affects ourfree will. According to the Law of One series, the beating of your heart in yourphysical body is meant to be a holographic mirror of this greater reality thatsurrounds you. As we drift through different energetic regions as a planet,every one of us experiences different influences. The thoughts we think and theactions we take—even among those of us who are the most negative—are beingguided by this hidden architecture of time. This is truly where synchronicitybecomes a science, stepping out of the realm of the personal and subjective andinto the world of the global and provable.In order to understand these cycles of history, we first must grasp that theyare telling us a story, also called the Book of Life. Each soul is going throughcycles of joy and despair, as we said at the beginning. The Wheel of Karma isnot at all random. There is a very precise series of experiences—a greatstory—that we keep repeating, over and over again, from lifetime to lifetime,until we master it. This story is written into all the world’s greatestmythologies, and it also appears in the cycles of historical events. Every movieand television show you’ve ever seen is based on this story, as I eventuallyfound out through extremely difficult personal experience. Once we understandthe structure and function of this global Wheel of Karma, we may conclude thatit has the power to create a full spiritual enlightenment and Golden Age forhumanity.THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKSIn 2005, I gave my first-ever lecture in the fast-paced world of Los Angeles, atthe Conscious Life Expo. I was soon approached by a Hollywood producer who hadworked with A-list actors including Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, and SylvesterStallone. He told me that if we made a documentary film about thesesubjects—including the idea that DNA is formed by a quantum energy wave—it wouldbe very helpful to others and could potentially be a huge commercial success. Ihad honestly never even thought of making a film out of my work. I was stillliving in Milton, Kentucky, at the time, renting a three-bedroom house just amile and a half away from a nice plot of land that was owned by L/L Research,which produced the Law of One series. Volunteers who worked on that land wereusing my house as a place to live, or at least to visit for a shower and someconversation. Milton was a quiet, sleepy town—not much bigger than the strip ofhighway it was built around. If you walked into any of the stores on theKentucky side of the bridge that led to Madison, Indiana, the cigarette smokewas so thick it would curl around you as you walked down the aisles.The biggest events that happened around my home were the neighbor’s dog barkingtoo much and their cows breaking through the fence from the pasture next door. Iwas in complete seclusion, and I definitely enjoyed the solitude. The only humaninteractions I had were with people at the post office or grocery store, thevolunteers, or clients who called me up for a dream reading, which was my solesource of income at the time. I had discovered that, in addition to being ableto give people an Edgar Cayce–style deep-trance intuitive reading, I would alsodream about them on the day they were going to have the session with me. I wouldpersonally go through their deepest and darkest shadow experiences in my dreamas if it were happening to me. It was quite common for the client to begincrying as I described the dream to them, because in almost every case there wereastonishingly accurate connections to their personal lives. I did five hundredof these readings from 1998 to 2005 and had a 99 percent satisfaction rate.However, because I had no regular staff to sit with me for these sessions, theyhad become very draining. I also had a huge waiting list, forcing me to workmuch more than I was comfortable with. Some client dreams were so intense that Istarted to feel a loss of personal identity; I couldn’t tell whether thesepainful dreams were warnings about me or just reflections of my clients. I knewI had to retire, for my own good, and focus on things that could help many morepeople all at once—and this film was the key.In this monastic, country environment, I worked through nine feet worth ofprinted and bound books I had compiled from many different Internet websites, aswell as a huge number of links and excerpts I had saved in my daily journal. Byearly September 2005, after an incredible, fourteen-hour-a-day effort,everything I had ever researched about the living universe was summarized in amaster set of data, which I then used to inspire the creation of this newdocumentary film. I had intended to call this film Convergence, ever since thename first appeared in a dream from 1996. This body of research was eventuallyincorporated into The Source Field Investigations, as well as this book you arenow reading.That same September, we attached to the project a bright female director who hadpotential connections to A-list actors and who worked as a film professor in LosAngeles. She felt that a feature film built around a fictional story line wouldbe much more effective than a documentary. Of course, I knew nothing aboutscreenwriting, and for the first fifteen months of the project, I felt I wasmuch too busy to dig into a bunch of books on the subject. We did raise enoughmoney to pay for me to retire from doing readings for one year, and I moved to anoisy, lower-floor apartment in Los Angeles in January 2006, so I could be “inthe business.” For an entire year, I poured my heart and soul into writing whatI thought were good screenplays. This was sometimes done with co-writers,including our first director, but in those early days, none of our employeeswere specialists in the art of screenwriting; they all had other jobs in film aswell.Again and again, these scripts were openly laughed at and ridiculed by thescript advisers my team had asked to give us “reads.” Although this type ofattitude was apparently an industry standard, the cruelty and sarcasm Iexperienced was shocking, and my mother was quite upset by what she saw aftersitting in on one particular meeting. Our new director lasted through only twoscript cycles before we parted company and started over from scratch. Otherslasted for only one version of the script before we were forced to try again.This repeating cycle of pain was a valuable personal experience for me, as Irealized I had been so attached to my own creative works that I perceived anycriticism of them as a savage personal attack. I had to learn to clearlyseparate myself and my self-esteem from my creative output. Yet, I was stillexperiencing crushing pressure to perform. As I revealed in public lectures Igave the following year, every day I got the same call, which could besummarized as “What are you doing and what have you done? How many pages?” Weeven joked that I could use a touch-tone phone system instead of answering thephone, and just punch in the number of pages I had written each day.This incredible pressure to perform gave me powerful anxiety attacks, deepdepression, and even paranoia and hopelessness. I had to make sure I had a storyto tell, every day, about how hard I was working to finish the script—and Icertainly was not willing to lie, given what I knew about karma. I hardly wroteanything on my website and basically did nothing to contribute to the lives ofothers online. I felt totally alone. Everything about who I was as a personseemed to revolve around whether or not I could write a screenplay, and all ourinvestors were counting on me to get the job done. I went through cycle aftercycle of what felt like total betrayal and utter humiliation. I would workthrough weeks or months of relentless, crushing pressure and physical andemotional fatigue to finish a script or a rewrite, only to hear the sameresponse, again and again: It’s terrible. Ridiculous. Childish. Laughable. Whowrote this? Or—this time it’s only bad, not terrible. You might be able to fightyour way through freshman entrance exams into film school with something likethis. Maybe.As this grinding initiation went on, I came to feel as if writing a script wasvery mysterious. Even with my level of intelligence and my background as awriter, I couldn’t produce something that was seen as a mature, effectivescreenplay. I couldn’t seem to control whether someone liked it or not—theyeither did or they didn’t. I was forced to start over from scratch, with newcharacters, new ideas, and new co-writers, several times. Ultimately I said thatif this one college film professor keeps criticizing my scripts the most, andhis opinion obviously carries the greatest weight, then let’s hire him and bringhim in to co-write the next version with me.SYNCHRONICITY SAVES THE DAYRight after this, in early 2007, I moved from the crushing noise and pollutionof Santa Monica to the relaxed, serene mountains of Topanga. A great deal ofguidance, through synchronicity and dreams, steered me to this new location,where I still live today. Before I moved, synchronicity and dreams had guided meto transcribe tapes of dreams and deep-trance readings from as far back as 1999.I had gotten so busy over the years that I never went back to transcribe thoseearly tapes, and I couldn’t afford to pay anyone to do it. Now I was doing allthe work myself. I found, to my amazement, that there were many specificreferences to exactly what I was doing now. I had dreams that very preciselyindicated I would be living in Los Angeles and working on a film. The charactersI was interacting with, including female friends who commiserated with me, wereall clearly described, with astonishing specifics—as was the pain of my failedscreenplays. One dream even referred to there being sweet potatoes on the top ofmy refrigerator that had sprouted and grown into tall stalks. That sceneappeared in an eight-year-old dream tape—but now, for the first time, I wasstunned to realize this had really happened in my apartment.I had to work through a great deal of frustration and many dead ends before Irealized where I was being guided to live. I had been absolutely convinced thatI wanted a place in Santa Monica by the ocean, but every time I thought I hadsomething lined up, disasters would strike. Realtors would rent it out fromunder me minutes before I was about to show up. Power lines would be two feetaway from the window, a deal breaker. Calls never got returned, even after boththe owner and I were ready to sign. One time, when I thought I had the perfectplace and was literally picking up the phone to make the final call, a birdslammed into my window with so much force that it broke its neck and was deadbefore it hit the ground. I became very frustrated, and I cursed the universe,saying that I needed to have a nice place to live, I was running out of time,and I could not bear the thought of signing another one-year lease in themadness I was living in now.Finally, I realized that synchronicity might have been interfering with myplans. I went back to the Law of One series for inspiration and remembered thatthe team was told a “sylvan atmosphere”—among trees—was the best place to livefor spiritual work.331 [part0034.html#chapter009fn331] A friend of mine had justtold me about Google Earth, where you could zoom over the land from a satelliteview, in three dimensions, and I soon found myself projecting over Los Angeles,looking for where the most trees were located. Right away, I could see that thebest area was Topanga. I swallowed hard but knew this had to be right. Back whenI lived in Virginia Beach, from early 2000 to the end of 2002, my ex-girlfriendhad frequently insisted that we move to Los Angeles—and specifically to TopangaCanyon. Again and again, for three years, I told her, “Forget it! I am nevermoving to Los Angeles—and I will never live in Topanga Canyon!” Now, it waslooking like Topanga was exactly the right place to go. I realized thatsynchronicity had been working through her all along, even though it had made mevery frustrated with her at the time.I quickly began searching for places in Topanga and found some leads. I wantedan affordable private space but decided to check out a house that was offering alower-floor, single-room rental as well. When I went to bed the night before Iwas going to see the house, I had already decided not to bother going. I wasovertired and I couldn’t bear the thought of being on the lower floor everagain. I had endured an entire year of music, partying, screaming children, carhorns, bus noises, diesel exhaust, cigarette smoke, barking dogs, people peeringin my windows, and the chaos of being on the lower floor, including a woman whostomped her foot whenever I spoke on the phone, and who ran her dishwasher rightover my head every morning at eight thirty sharp. I had to get out—but there wasno way I would ever be on the lower floor again. Sleeping in would be betterthan taking the time to drive out to see that apartment. That same night, whileI was fast asleep, my hand flew up and hit the headboard of my bed, causing megreat pain—and immediately waking me up. Nothing like this had ever happened tome before—nor has it ever happened again. I had red marks and a bit of skindamage on my knuckles, but I managed to fall back asleep. Later that samemorning, I thought I heard my phone ringing, and I was waiting for calls onseveral potential apartments. I dashed awake and bolted my hand out to answerthe phone, only to realize that I’d had some kind of dream hallucination.However, now my heart was pounding, I was wide-awake, and I said, “Okay, fine,I’ll go see the house in Topanga.” The whole time I drove there I felt verynegative, saying, “I’ll just rule this one out and get a look at theneighborhood.” The drive was a lot longer than I thought, and I becameincreasingly pessimistic about how far away it was from civilization. Then, whenI finally made it to the driveway, I had to keep on going, because a black SUVwas coming down the hill, and there wasn’t enough room for me to go up there atthe same time. The SUV belonged to the Realtor, who was leaving because I was solate. The owner was still there when I drove up, and he and I had a greatconnection. I was stunned by the house and went from being completely negativeto thinking, “My God, I will do whatever it takes to get this place.” Peoplewould literally commit atrocities to get parking spots in Santa Monica. On thebiggest streets, Santa Monica’s finest would ticket you within seconds of whenyour meter ran out. I’d never gotten so many tickets in my life. If you parkedon the street in unmetered areas, there was the constant, inevitable threat ofhaving to move your car on the street-sweeper days or pay another exorbitantfine. Now I was seeing a huge driveway that could easily park twenty-five cars.I was hooked.Once I moved in, I felt much better. I was renting a single bedroom in a nicehouse, with a great view, and my housemate traveled two or three weeks a month.I was finally able to re-create the country serenity of Milton, Kentucky, in LosAngeles County—only this was much better, because I was now living in theentertainment capital of the world and could focus on getting my work out to amuch larger audience. I began writing for my website again—more than ever—andupdated people on the status of the film. I wrote a new piece of music called“The Journey” within days of my arrival, describing in musical form the cyclesof joy and disaster we go through. I continued transcribing my eight-year-oldcassette recordings of dreams and readings and was dazzled to discover that manyvery specific details about the house—including the sloping driveway, themountain view, the soaring hawks, and the personalities of the people I was nowinteracting with—were precisely embedded in these recordings, which I “just sohappened” to have forgotten to transcribe until now. Some part of me was able toread my future just as clearly as if it were a roadmap—and I was very curious tosee where it was going.STRUCTURE: THE BIGGEST SECRET OF SHOWBIZAt this point, we hired our main story consultant—a head professor at a top filmschool in Los Angeles—to sit down and co-author a script with us, as a group, inweekly meetings. He couldn’t hate a script that he himself had co-written withme. I quickly found out that his favorite genre seemed to be the psychologicalspy thriller, in which a complex story is told with a big twist at the end,which only the most perceptive viewers could have seen coming, but that makessense once it arrives. He began speaking to my film partner about somethingmysterious he called “structure,” which was apparently the basis of allscreenplays. At first I had no idea what they were talking about. This had nevercome up before. I had no idea what they meant when they said a film was brokeninto three acts. There was a lot of technical jargon, and at times it was almostlike a foreign language. Nonetheless, I soon found out that there was a scienceto screenwriting. It was not random, and it did not require any mysterious forcethat only certain talented writers could possess.The industry had a carefully guarded secret. Screenwriting was vastly moreformulaic than I had ever realized in all the years I’d watched movies, but youwere utterly forbidden from calling it a formula. That was sacrilege. The mediawas certainly never going to talk about structure in films, TV shows, magazines,or newspaper articles, as it would give away the keys to the kingdom, but therewere plenty of screenwriting books you could read that revealed the big secret.I had been deeply hurt by the criticism my previous scripts had received, and Ihad a very strong desire to be respected in these weekly meetings. I begandevouring all of the most revered and credible books on screenwriting I couldfind—and taking copious notes—throughout all of 2007. I managed to master thecontents of the thirteen best books I could find, each of which gave me newperspectives on the same underlying concepts.By the end of the year, I had learned the hidden language of Hollywood, whichallowed me to talk to the big shots on their own terms and finally claimrespect. I shared this knowledge in a 2008 video called The 2012 Enigma, filmedat the same Conscious Life Expo in the same hotel where I first got invited intothe film business. I had no idea that in December 2009, this video would be seenby Jim Hart—the principal author of the movie Contact—after becoming the numberone most viewed video of the day on Google, thanks to the publicity machine forthe movie 2012. Jim Hart had worked with Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola,and other A-list directors—and I had always used Contact as the model for myearly attempts at screenwriting. I was absolutely stunned when I got an emailfrom Jim, inquiring about whether I might want to hire him as a writer forConvergence. Before long, we raised enough new money to bring him on board inearly 2010—and again started over from scratch. As I complete this book, he isfinishing the final draft of our screenplay—based on the suggestions we receivedfrom a top production company—and he feels it is one of the finest films he’sever written.Once I studied the art of screenwriting, I was shocked to discover that almostevery movie we know and love—regardless of whether it is a comedy, drama,thriller, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, or romance—is telling exactly the same story.This is stunning—and it seems impossible to believe until you understand thatthis story is more of a set of guidelines than a specific series of characters,locations, and details that must happen a certain way. Every film is supposed totake a main character, with obvious flaws, and send him or her on a quest forsomething that is deeply, passionately desired. The main character must gothrough a really rough time in pursuing this goal, even in the funny movies.There are indeed some films that break away from this structure, but allHollywood studio execs expect it to be there. They know exactly what they’relooking for. They even know what pages these story elements are expected toappear on. If you don’t “play the game” and do this, it is very unlikely thatyou will be able to finance your script. In fact, your work will probably nevereven make it past the readers the studios and investors hire to review it.Perhaps the best book on the market about structure and its connection toancient mythology is The Writer’s Journey by Christopher Vogler332[part0034.html#chapter009fn332]—who also happens to be an old friend andcolleague of Jim Hart’s. Vogler’s groundbreaking book was adapted from a shorterbriefing document originally prepared for Disney executives.Time has proven that the public votes with their wallets. They want to see thesame story told over and over again, perhaps with a few new twists or doses ofvisual excitement along the way. You can still innovate, but if you want yourfilm to be a commercial success, you must channel your creativity through theguidelines. The same is true for any novel, particularly if you ever hope for itto be adapted into a film. Once you understand structure, you will easily seehow James Cameron’s Avatar, currently the top-grossing movie of all time, is apoint-by-point illustration of it. Since I now understood this story-makingbackground, once I saw Avatar, the structure was so obvious that it completelypulled me out of the film. Two other classic, best-selling examples of filmsthat meticulously follow the structure in Vogler’s book are the original StarWars movie, and the original film in The Matrix trilogy. Disney’s The Lion Kingwas also heavily worked around Vogler’s blueprint. Many people noticed that theAvatar story line was similar to Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas—not realizingthat these were only two of the more obvious comparisons that could be made.JOSEPH CAMPBELL EXPOSES THE ARCHETYPES WITHIN ALL MYTHOLOGYHow did Hollywood reach this point? All stories can be broken down into threeacts—beginning, middle, and ending—and this basic structure was first spelledout by Aristotle. In traditional plays there is a curtain call between acts,giving the audience time to get up and use the bathroom, allowing the actors torelax, and giving the stagehands time to rearrange the sets. However, the hiddenDNA of storytelling started to be exposed much more fully in 1856, when MaxMüller noticed similarities between ancient epic stories in his classic“Comparative Mythology,” first published in Oxford Essays. Other researcherssubsequently explored the same idea. The study of comparative mythology reachedits fruition in 1949, when Joseph Campbell first published The Hero with aThousand Faces, an astonishingly far-reaching scholarly work. In thiselectrifying book, Campbell exhaustively analyzes myths from all over the world,in all different time periods, and finds that they have remarkable similaritiesto one another. Campbell calls the overall story the Hero’s Journey. It’s how wework through our fears, our weaknesses, our limitations—each and every day. Itis ultimately the blueprint of our evolution—and the path to a Golden Age.Anyone who writes an engaging, believable screenplay is tapping into the Hero’sJourney story structure, whether they realize it or not. Those who are aware ofit have a much better chance of success.Campbell drew heavily on the legendary work of Dr. Carl Jung, who found thatthese various ancient myths keep repeating in our dreams with certain ongoingthemes he called archetypes.333 [part0034.html#chapter009fn333] These archetypescan be so specific that people will paint pictures of what they saw in theirdreams, without realizing they are illustrating ancient mythological artwork.Although it is a very complex discussion that is outside the scope of this book,one Amazon reviewer summed it up nicely: “The most important archetypes appearto be the Shadow (the inferior aspects of the self which we hide from others),the Anima/Animus (our object(s) of desire), and the Wise Old Man [or Mentor,](e.g., teacher, medicine man). [Jung] also discusses a Mother archetype and aChild archetype, and indicates the existence of numerous others. Identifyingstrongly with an archetype leads to psychosis.”334[part0034.html#chapter009fn334]Another key archetype, which this reviewer missed, is the Prodigal Son—a herocharacter who runs away from home, thinks he’s in big trouble for leaving, andeventually comes back, fearing the worst…only to find out that he’s been lovedthe entire time, is completely forgiven, and is welcomed home with open arms.The Law of One series gets a lot more specific, revealing that there aretwenty-two archetypes altogether—seven for the evolution of the mind, seven forthe evolution of the body, seven for the evolution of the spirit, and one finalstand-alone that represents the Prodigal Son, who is also known as the Fool—thehero who is just starting on this quest.335 [part0034.html#chapter009fn335]These twenty-two archetypes were given symbolic images to illustrate them andbecame the Major Arcana in the Tarot cards. These archetypes developed over timeas the mind of our galaxy became increasingly aware of how to design the bestspiritual course for us.91.18 The archetypes were not developed at once but step by step, and not inorder, as you know the order at this space/time, but in various orders.336[part0034.html#chapter009fn336]George Lucas heavily credits Joseph Campbell with the inspiration that helpedconsolidate the world he had built for Star Wars: “In the three decades since Idiscovered The Hero with a Thousand Faces, it has continued to fascinate andinspire me. Joseph Campbell peers through centuries and shows us that we are allconnected by a basic need to hear stories and understand ourselves. As a book,it is wonderful to read; as illumination into the human condition, it is arevelation.”337 [part0034.html#chapter009fn337]What exactly did George Lucas mean when he said Campbell’s book was an“illumination into the human condition” and a “revelation”? At this point wewill quote from Fredric L. Rice, author of the ironically titled Skeptic Tankwebsite. Rice’s article is found in a subfolder called Atheist2, as you can seefrom his website link, so his beliefs are clear. Nonetheless, even as a devoutskeptic and atheist, when Rice honestly considers the scope and importance ofCampbell’s work and its influence on modern society, he makes some surprisinglycandid confessions. Rice believes The Hero with a Thousand Faces will easilybecome the most influential book of the twentieth century in the fullness oftime. He also acknowledges that Campbell’s epic work has had a huge impact onfilm-making and story-telling in general. Filmmakers like George Lucas, StevenSpielberg, and Francis Ford Coppola are all heavily indebted to the ancientstory pattern that Joseph Campbell identified.The ideas in [Campbell’s book] are older than the Pyramids, older thanStonehenge, older than the earliest cave painting. Campbell’s contribution wasto gather the ideas together, recognize them, articulate them [and] name them.He exposed the pattern for the first time—the pattern that lies behind everystory ever told…. What [he] discovered in his study of world myths is that THEYARE ALL BASICALLY THE SAME STORY—retold endlessly in infinite variation….Campbell was a student of the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and the ideas in THEHERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES are often described as Jungian. The book is based onJung’s idea of the “Archetypes”—constantly repeating characters who occur in thedreams of all people and the myths of all cultures. Jung believed that thesearchetypes are reflections of the human mind—that our minds divide themselvesinto these characters to play out the drama of our lives. The repeatingcharacters of the hero myth, such as the young hero, the wise old man, theshape-shifting woman, and the shadowy nemesis, are identical with the archetypesof the human mind, as shown in dreams…. [Shape-shifting refers to suddenlychanging emotional states—which may be depicted as physical changes in form in amythical story.]Stories built on the model of THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES have an appeal thatcan be felt by everyone, because they spring from a universal source in thecollective unconscious, and because they reflect universal concerns. They dealwith universal questions like “Why was I born?” “What happens when I die?” [and]“How can I overcome my life problems and be happy?”338[part0034.html#chapter009fn338]It is surprising to hear a devout skeptic and atheist describe a “universalsource in the collective unconscious” that causes every human being to admireand dream about the same story. Although he may explain this as a biologicalphenomenon—the result of having a human body and mind—it nonetheless is agroundbreaking concept. Our subconscious minds are influencing us stronglyenough that we keep wanting to hear the exact same story, over and over again.The use of Campbell’s work as a hidden structure in Hollywood screenwriting canbe traced back to at least September 26, 1964, when Stanley Kubrick advisedArthur C. Clarke to study The Hero with a Thousand Faces while working on thescreenplay for 2001. Clarke found Campbell’s book to be “very stimulating.”339[part0034.html#chapter009fn339] In order to further explore the work of JosephCampbell, and how it affects us, Kristen Brennan summarized years of exhaustingresearch in her detailed, far-reaching Star Wars Origins website.In 1949 Joseph Campbell (1904–1987) made a big splash in the field of mythologywith his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. This book built on the pioneeringwork of German anthropologist Adolph Bastian (1826–1905), who first proposed theidea that myths from all over the world seem to be built from the same“elementary ideas.” Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung (1875–1961) named theseelementary ideas “archetypes,” which he believed to be the building blocks notonly of the unconscious mind, but of a collective unconscious. In other words,Jung believed that everyone in the world is born with the same basicsubconscious model of what a “hero” is, or a “mentor” or a “quest,” and that’swhy people who don’t even speak the same language can enjoy the same stories.Jung developed his idea of archetypes mostly as a way of finding meaning withinthe dreams and visions of the mentally ill: if a person believes they are beingfollowed by a giant apple pie, it’s difficult to make sense of how to help them.But if the giant apple pie can be understood to represent that person’s shadow,the embodiment of all their fears, then the psychotherapist can help guide themthrough that fear, just as Yoda guided Luke on Dagobah. If you think of a personas a computer and our bodies as “hardware,” [then] language and culture seem tobe the “software.” Deeper still, and apparently common to all homo sapiens, is asort of built-in “operating system” which interprets the world—by sortingpeople, places, things and experiences into archetypes.340[part0034.html#chapter009fn340]Most of us do not realize that we have a built-in “operating system” and that weall have a deep, undying need to hear the same story repeated back to us againand again. We innocently ask to hear this same story in endless variations,often on a day-to-day basis, as we routinely watch TV and movies. This isCampbell’s great contribution—leading the skeptic Fredric L. Rice to concludethat The Hero with a Thousand Faces will eventually be seen as the mostinfluential book of the twentieth century.PRECISELY CALCULATING HOW MUCH MONEY A FILM WILL MAKE—THROUGH STRUCTUREHollywood certainly doesn’t publicize how much it uses this story structure,because if it were more widely known, it might start to become too obvious.Nonetheless, this hidden structure has such a huge impact on how many peoplewill pay to see a movie that computer programs have now been written that cantell you exactly how much money a film will make—within a surprisingly narrowwindow. This method was developed by Dick Copaken and his friend Nick Meaney,who built their company Epagogix341 [part0034.html#chapter009fn341] around thisincredible concept. They use powerful computers to analyze screenplays using aform of artificial intelligence called a “neural network.” A variety ofdifferent script characteristics are studied through this process, as revealedin the May/June 2013 issue of The Economist: Intelligent Life.When Meaney is given a job by a studio, the first thing he does is quantifythousands of factors, drawn from the script. Are there clear bad guys? How muchempathy is there with the protagonist? Is there a sidekick? The complexinterplay of these factors is then compared by the computer to their interplayin previous films, with known box-office takings. The last calculation is whatit expects the film to make. In 83% of cases, this guess turns out to be within$10m of the total. Meaney, to all intents and purposes, has an algorithm thatjudges the value—or at least the earning power—of art.342[part0034.html#chapter009fn342]Some film critics think this whole idea is crazy, believe Copaken and hisassociates are scam artists,343 [part0034.html#chapter009fn343] and can’tbelieve it could ever work. However, the truth really seems quite simple. We allshare the same “operating system,” as Campbell and others discovered, and thecloser a movie gets to revealing it, the more successful the film will be. Thereal-world financial success of the film can then be calculated, in advance,with astonishing precision. This quote from Malcolm Gladwell’s article in TheNew Yorker summarized it nicely in 2006.In the summer of 2003, Copaken approached Josh Berger, a senior executive atWarner Bros. in Europe…. [They ran] sixteen television pilots through the neuralnetwork, and [tried] to predict the size of each show’s eventual audience…. Insix cases, Epagogix guessed the number of American homes that would tune in to ashow to within .06 per cent. In thirteen of the sixteen cases, its predictionswere within two per cent. Berger was floored. “It was incredible,” he recalls.“It was like someone saying to you, ‘We’re going to show you how to count cardsin Vegas.’ It had that sort of quality.”344 [part0034.html#chapter009fn344]This earlier accuracy rating of 99.94 percent is very impressive—seeminglyimpossible by any normal standards. And that’s not all.Copaken then approached another Hollywood studio. He was given nine unreleasedmovies to analyze…. On one film, the studio thought it had a picture that wouldmake a good deal more than $100 million. Epagogix said $49 million. The moviemade less than $40 million. On another, a big-budget picture, the team’sestimate came within $1.2 million of the final gross. On a number of films, theywere surprisingly close. “They were basically within a few million,” a seniorexecutive at the studio said. “It was shocking. It was kind of weird.” Had thestudio used Epagogix on those nine scripts before filming started, it could havesaved tens of millions of dollars.345 [part0034.html#chapter009fn345]So what was the big trick? Let’s find out.“I was impressed by a couple of things,” another executive at the same studiosaid. “I was impressed by the things they thought mattered to a movie. Theyweren’t the things that we typically give credit to. They cared about the venue,and whether it was a love story, and very specific things about the plot thatthey were convinced determined the outcome more than anything else. It felt veryobjective. And they could care less about whether the lead was Tom Cruise or TomJones…. There’s always a pattern,” he went on. “There are certain stories thatcome back, time and time again, and that always work…. It’s the consistency ofthese reappearing things that I find amazing.”346[part0034.html#chapter009fn346]There’s the key! Certain stories come back. Very specific things about the plotdetermine how successful a movie will be. Comparative mythology—and particularlythe work of Joseph Campbell—reveals the answer. Hollywood is already doing itsbest to follow these guidelines—but Hollywood may not have fully realized thatthe story is the most important element of all.HOW DO WE TELL THE STORY?So how do we tell the story? Most of the screenwriting books seem to agree onthe main points. Some of the concepts are extremely basic. You have a beginning,middle, and ending—setup, conflict, and resolution—and these phases are calledthe first act, second act, and third act. As I said, this goes all the way backto Aristotle, who was the first to identify these segments. Again, in the olddays of stage plays, you had curtain breaks between acts, when the curtainsclose, the audience has time to get up and go to the bathroom, the stagehandsload in the new sets, and the actors can hang out and relax backstage. Then thelights dim, everyone sits back down, the curtain re-opens, and the next actbegins. Modern films, of course, no longer do this, but the breaks between actsare still very much there in screenplays.If you want to write a film script that will sell, it is expected to be almost,if not exactly, 120 pages long—though some studios now want the same sequence ofevents to happen within 110 pages, as outlined in Save the Cat! by BlakeSnyder.347 [part0034.html#chapter009fn347] Each page is expected to take about aminute of screen time, usually a little less. The first act is thirty pages. Thesecond act is sixty pages. The third act is the final thirty pages. Veryspecific story points need to happen in each of these acts, and we also see anoverall change in the scenery and the pace of events as we move through eachact.[../images/00017.gif]Fig. 9 [part0006.html#l9]: Diagram of the three-act structure of modernHollywood screenplaysThough there are rare exceptions to the rule that did become successful films,every commercial script must start out with a main character—the hero—who hasobvious flaws. The story is all about the changes that this character goesthrough as he or she works through personal weaknesses to achieve the one goalhe or she wants more than anything else in the world. All of us instinctivelyresonate with this concept. This appears be a collective, subconscious memory ofthe goals we set for ourselves between physical incarnations. We have a deep,subconscious knowledge that we are here to grow and evolve and move through ourflaws to achieve greater levels of spiritual maturity.If you try to write a film with more than one main character, it is much harderto follow the story—and unless it’s really well written, your script will neversell. With TV you can write what is called an episodic narrative, where multiplemain characters have converging destinies that guide each of them through theirown version of the story, but this is very difficult to pull off in a two-hourmovie. One of the main reasons why this is so challenging is characterdevelopment, which is what separates the amateurs from the pros. Anyone canlearn the basics of how to paint by numbers within the structure of thestory—and many do try—but what the industry bigwigs really want to see iscompelling, believable characters that make the story come alive. One of theclassic giveaways of an amateur screenwriter—which I also got blasted forseveral times in the early years—is that each character’s dialogue reads like itwas written by the same person.When we watch a film, we immediately try to figure out who the main characteris. Generally speaking, this is the first person we meet who says or doesanything interesting. At the beginning, we are subconsciously looking for themain character’s flaws. This allows us to identify with the hero—which literallymeans we have transferred our identity into that character for those ninetyminutes or so during which we “engage the story.” If we don’t engage thestory—if we don’t identify with the hero, if structure is not followed—then weget pulled out of the story. This is the kiss of death. The magic spell isbroken. We realize we are watching a movie. We begin analyzing what we don’tlike about it. We may even laugh at moments in the film that are not supposed tobe funny. Audience members whip out their smartphones and text their friends,telling them not to see it. Critics lambaste it. The film is a failure.THE GRAND JOURNEY OF INITIATION—INDIVIDUALLY AND GLOBALLYWe already know the hero will go through an initiation in the film—when he willhave to confront his flaws directly. In a happy-ending film, the hero isvictorious, and in film noir, the hero’s flaws are victorious, but either waythe hero goes through a transformation. The story will always be a tale ofcharacter change. It’s about evolution—even if that means we go through a cyclewhere we mess up, things end very badly, and we have to do it all over again. Inour own lives, this may amount to literally dying and reincarnating once again,only to repeat the same lessons even more. The cycles that characters runthrough in movies and television shows are experiences that we may spend manylifetimes mastering. By watching the story play out—through the entire range ofevents—we are hopefully left with a renewed sense of wisdom and inspiration thatcarries into our daily lives. We identify these same cycles in our personalrelationships and gain new insights into how to work through them.When we compare the classic Hollywood story line to the rise and fall of nationsthrough various cycles, there are parallels. Nations begin, have some obviousflaws at the outset, develop a clear nemesis, go through increasingly gravestruggles as they fight the nemesis, and often get overtaken by their flaws anddie out. A classic example would be a nation that experiences great prosperitybut does not know how to conserve its resources. The nemesis can be as simple asa group of greedy people who are overconsuming the wealth of the nation. Oncethese resources finally run out, the nation’s economy collapses. That wouldobviously be a story with a “down” ending. However, if a corrupt government isthen overthrown in a coup, and a more positive government emerges in its place,that may be seen as an “up” ending. The idea of “fourth density,” or a GoldenAge on earth, would be the worldwide “up” ending—in which we’ve finally gonethrough these cycles enough times that we get the point and are brave enough tomake the changes that will create the outcome we desire."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTHE FIRST AND SECOND ACTS OF THE HEROIn the first act, the hero starts out in the ordinary world. Everything thathappens to the hero—every event, every conversation—is a reflection of thatordinary world. Importantly, the ordinary world represents the hero’s ego—theuninitiated mind, with all its flaws. We will clearly see the weakness of thehero, for example, lack of courage, lack of intelligence, naïveté, selfishness,greed, and so on. Blake Snyder specifically recommends putting “Six Things ThatNeed Fixing” in the hero in the first five pages.348[part0034.html#chapter010fn348] Snyder also recommends you insert a “ThemeStatement,” in which a character nonchalantly says something that becomes athesis, which the rest of the film sets out to prove. The most obvious “hidden”example of this in modern films is in the beginning of The Matrix, when themescaline-dropping, computer-hacking rogue Choi tells our hero, Neo,“Hallelujah. You’re my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.” Choi appearsto be thanking Neo only for the computer disc he was just handed, but in factthe theme statement is carefully inserted at this point—and subconsciously, theviewer knows it. The scenes and events surrounding the theme statement willfurther establish the setting and tone of the message the film intends toconvey.Then, a major event, often called the “Inciting Incident,” draws our hero into agreat quest. In action films, this is often a sudden tragedy that hurts ordestroys someone or something our hero loves very dearly. In romances, this isoften the moment our character first sees a new romantic interest. The motivefor the hero to enter this great quest could be revenge, love, justice, mystery,or greed, but it will always be something we will easily identify with. It issomething the hero now wants more than anything in the world. The incitingincident usually happens around page 12 in a commercial script, after we’veestablished the theme of the film and the ordinary world of the hero. Ingeopolitics, the inciting incident is often the spark that triggers a war, suchas the bombing of Pearl Harbor or 9/11. When you start watching the beginning ofa commercial film, you know something big is coming, and this is always going tobe the inciting incident that propels our main character on the Hero’s Journey.It is important that this quest is deeply primal, coming from the hero’sstruggle to fulfill the most basic emotional needs and desires. However, thereal key is that this quest will cause the hero to face his worst flaws anddefeat them in order to get what he wants.Throughout the many interlocking cycles of history we will discuss, the incitingincident will often be the spark that starts a war, but it could also be apositive event. We may see an amazing new burst of progress in society, like thediscovery of electricity. There may be a massive public gathering likeWoodstock, a brilliantly inspiring work of art, or the election of a revered newleader. Cycles can also overlap each other, so that the grand, triumphantconclusion of one cycle can become the inciting incident of another.DEBATE, THE MENTOR, AND THE MAGIC GIFTAfter the inciting incident, there is a period of hand-wringing debate when thehero decides whether or not to go on the quest. The hero usually spends abouteighteen pages weighing the pros and cons of this decision, getting distracted,and shifting back and forth. This is often where the mentor or wise old mancharacter first appears to give our hero valuable advice. On a subconsciouslevel, we recognize the mentor as our main guide in the afterlife, steering usthrough each incarnation. We also receive a magic gift or talisman from ourmentor that might not seem important at the time but is a tool that laterbecomes extremely vital to our survival when we need it most. In Star Wars, thisis when Obi-Wan Kenobi gives Luke his father’s lightsaber. In some stories, themagic gift is not a physical object but a call—a decisive statement orrevelation that inspires our hero to pursue the quest. The magic gift may alsobe a piece of information that is planted in the hero’s mind and becomes veryimportant later on. In The Writer’s Journey, Christopher Vogler indicates thatthe gift could be “a magic weapon, an important key or clue, some magicalmedicine or food, or a life-saving piece of advice.”349[part0034.html#chapter010fn349] In the afterlife, the magic gift could be seenas the synchronicities and “memory triggers” we plan out in advance and committo memory to inspire us to take on an important quest at a key moment in ourlives. The great cycles of history keep everything organized, so we know thatcertain events will happen at certain times, thus allowing us to plan out ourexperiences very precisely.In order to follow the pattern of the story, our hero must choose to go on thequest rather than simply getting thrown into it by circumstances beyond his orher control. We make a conscious decision to join the quest and follow thetimelines it puts us on. The wisdom and guidance of the mentor help us make thisvaluable decision—much like the decision we made of which lifetime, and whichbody, we would take before our current incarnation. If we don’t accept thischallenge of the Hero’s Journey, we will slip back into the ordinary world ofour ego, with all its flaws, and continue living our boring lives, endlesslyrepeating the same hurts and fears.Many of us fail to take on a quest in our own lives. We are paranoid, fearful,and distrustful of the outcome. We may settle for a lot less than we couldachieve if we were courageous enough. Films and television shows allow us to ask“What if?” What if we were bold enough to take that leap of faith and pursuethat one thing we want more than anything else in the world? In a feature film,it is a given that our hero will jump into the quest.THE SECOND ACT BREAKOnce our hero finally commits to the quest, we have our second act break. In acommercial script, this happens around page 30. Our hero must now enter themagical world—a new set of experiences that are both thrilling and highlychallenging at the same time. In modern romance films, this is when therelationship between the two characters begins to get interesting and there is arush of new emotions. In the ancient mythologies, mystical things happen in thismagical world that are not a part of conventional reality as we know it. Modernfilms often strip this mystical aspect of the story out, but in the ancientstructure, which is far older than human life on earth, magical events are avital part of the story. Good directors will change the whole look and feel ofthe movie—the colors, the textures, the locations, the characters, the musicalscore, everything—once we enter this magical world. We also meet new friends anddevelop key alliances with them that will help us out on our quest later on.Given everything we’ve now learned about reincarnation, the magical world seemsto represent the afterlife—at least in one of its key forms. All of ussubconsciously remember what the afterlife is like, so when this part of thestory features genuine magic, as we see in Avatar, we are more likely toinstinctively feel as if we have returned to our true home.In the cycles of a nation’s history, the second act may be when the peoplefinally embrace the decision to go to war. This plunges them into a strange newworld of challenges and fears, new allies and friends, sinister enemies lurkingbehind every corner, prayers to divine forces for protection, and unexpecteddisasters that threaten to destroy the safety and security of the ordinary worldthey had lived in before. This stage of the quest may also appear in morepositive ways. If the inciting incident and magic gift both appear as atechnological breakthrough, such as the lightbulb, this new invention may createthe quest for a world that is transformed by such awesome technology. Then thesecond act would represent the early stages of that technology appearing insociety. Of course, there will be struggles to work through along the way, suchas corrupt industrial lobbies that do not want to be put out of business. Thetechnology itself, once seen as our savior, may shape-shift into our greatestnemesis. The journey of discovery does create a magical world, but it is stillfraught with challenges.Consider the American history of the railroad as one example of the Hero’sJourney story playing out through technology. Granted, there was a vision for atranscontinental railroad that would connect the East and West, but the realitywas that the Native Americans provided significantly violent opposition. Thereal threat of moving out west transferred into many personal stories as well asa collective national story. Whether it was a triumph or a tragedy depends onwhom you talk to and when in history that conversation takes place.THE NEMESISIn the early stages of our time in the magical world, we have what Blake Snydercalls “Fun and Games.”350 [part0034.html#chapter010fn350] At this point, we getto catch our breath, temporarily distract ourselves from the intensity of thequest, and experience all the wonders and delights of this new state ofexistence. Many of the film’s most entertaining and memorable scenes appear inthis section and often appear in the film’s promotional trailer. This pointseems to be similar to the top of the Wheel of Karma—the peak point at whicheverything seems to be terrific, and things are only going to get better andbetter. However, as the pages flip ahead, we increasingly find out that all isnot well. If we didn’t already figure it out in the first act, we soon realizethat there is a nemesis out there—a really dark, dangerous adversary who wantsto terminate our quest with prejudice.Joseph Campbell refers to the nemesis as the Guardian of the Threshold. Thisultimately represents the part of our personality that blocks the doorway, orthreshold, that leads to the fulfillment of our goal. In ancient mythologies,the Guardian of the Threshold may be a dragon, and once we cross the thresholdthe dragon is guarding, we find the virgin, symbolizing the virginal state ofthe superconscious mind; the gold, symbolizing the riches of wisdom and geniuswe will find when we regain contact with our higher self; and the afterlife.Campbell also demonstrated that the most important treasure is the “Elixir ofImmortality”—a magical companion, substance, or piece of knowledge that cantransform the ordinary world we originally came from.351[part0034.html#chapter010fn351] The nemesis usually has a variety of allies, or“minions,” whom we have to confront along the way—with ever-increasingdifficulty—as we seek this treasure. Within ourselves, the nemesis or Guardianrepresents the ego. Our proud, strident ego refuses to listen to the whisperingsof the soul, which compels us to continue on our quest for greater truth, love,and meaning.On a global level, the Cabal or so-called Illuminati represent the ultimateGlobal Adversary. The more rocks we turn over in the cold, dark pockets of theInternet, the more we find the same, squiggling creatures hiding underneath. Wehave entered the magical world. We are on a quest. We want to know the truth,and it keeps getting weirder and weirder. Once we choose to read these creepyarticles, listen to the disturbing radio shows, watch even more disturbingYouTube videos, and decide not to fall prey to the Sheep Effect and turn away,we realize that the world we have lived in—the world of mainstream media liesand deception—is not reality. There is something more out there—somethingdeeper. The Illuminati dragon may well be guarding the ultimate Elixir ofImmortality—technologies inherited from our extraterrestrial relatives thatcould give us spontaneous healings, limitless free energy, antigravity flightcapability, teleportation, space travel, and incredible prosperity for everyone.It is terrifying for us to confront this hidden reality, but we also know thepromise of what awaits if we can defeat it—freedom, peace, new technology, andharmony on a level most people could never have even dreamed of. However, thepath of gaining this information is fraught with danger. Not everyone willbelieve us. Our family and friends may turn against us. We may fear that shadowyforces will disrupt our lives simply because they do not want us to possess thisinformation. Unbeknownst to us, we are moving through our own Hero’s Journey andare now spinning on the Wheel of Karma. The challenges and fears we now gothrough along the way are burning off our karma, much like the Gehenna firespoken of by Jehoshua. Once we gain full self-acceptance, through love andforgiveness, we do not need to be plagued by fear, and the Wheel of Karma willfinally remain at the highest and most rewarding point. The nemesis fades awayto insignificance or transforms along with us.Just like in the symbolic logic of a dream, in our story the nemesis mustrepresent the hero’s shadow, which is another name for the ego, that part of usthat denies the greater spiritual reality we live in. In the ancient story, thenemesis is a mirror image, or projection, of the hero’s own ego in its darkestmoments. In some screenplays, we roll the nemesis and the hero into the samecharacter. If we combine these two characters, then the nemesis appears when thehero’s own negative emotions emerge and take him over. In romantic comedies, thehero’s love interest may also be the nemesis, and this character will“shape-shift” between roles during the film. In many other films, the nemesis isthe classic villain, the man behind the curtain, whose identity may not berevealed until the big twist at the end.Either way, if you want to follow structure and write a commercial script, yournemesis must show us an exaggerated version of the hero’s flaws. The nemesis isthe mirror image of the hero, showing what happens if the quest is rejected andthe most negative and self-serving choices are made. On a soul level, we allknow this selfish choice is exactly what we want to avoid; we’ve been trying tosteer ourselves into making more loving decisions at key crisis points for manylifetimes. If we let the nemesis win, we will keep reincarnating over and overagain and repeating the same lessons—both personally and collectively. We arewell aware that the nemesis is within us, but by transcending those personalweaknesses and learning to accept and protect ourselves and others, we finallyachieve the great victory that cycle after cycle of human lives are meant toteach us. As the hero finally gains the courage to confront the nemesis, he orshe will be healed through the struggle. This phenomenon is also happening on aglobal level. As we move through and release the Sheep Effect, we are moving outof a global childhood and into a true global adulthood, stepping into genuinespiritual maturity for the first time.In order to make this hero-versus-nemesis standoff reach the deep, subconsciousroots of the viewer’s mind and connect to his or her journey through theafterlife, the screenwriter must have a healthy understanding of symbolism. Itdefinitely helps to know how dreams work—where every character, every setting,every object, and every event is a reflection of the dreamer. Excellentscreenplays are written very much like dreams without the audience ever evenrealizing it. Every character secretly symbolizes some part of the maincharacter’s personality structure. This includes the sidekick, or windowcharacter, who knew the hero before we did. The sidekick gives valuable feedbackthat teaches us more about the hero, such as things the hero said or did in thepast that directly relate to what is happening now. The sidekick may alsorepresent the hero’s flaws and may resist the changes the hero makes on thequest. Anatomy of a Screenplay by Dan Decker is one book that puts strong focuson the grand trinity of hero-sidekick-nemesis as the three main aspects of thehero’s psyche.352 [part0034.html#chapter010fn352]THE MOVIE ALIEN: AN EXAMPLE OF THE NEMESIS MIRRORING THE HEROOne of the most obvious examples of the nemesis mirroring the hero is in RidleyScott’s film Alien. In his book Crafty Screenwriting, Alex Epstein provides anexcellent review of how this film tells the great, ancient story once again.353[part0034.html#chapter010fn353] The hero of the movie, played by SigourneyWeaver, is confronted with a serious problem. One of her men has a nasty, alienoctopus thing attached to his face. Rather than making any attempt to save him,she decides to sacrifice his life—and the lives of the other innocent men whowere outside her ship with him—in the hopes of protecting her own life and thelives of her crew. An aggressive member of her crew overrules her authority andlets them in anyway. After a slow boil of ever-increasing tension, the nastyoctopus thing falls off the man’s face. He seems to be fine, but then the alienbursts out of his chest and runs away, leaving him dead. The alien quickly growsinto a full adult and shows absolutely no respect for the lives of the hero’screw; it kills almost everyone.Sigourney Weaver’s character didn’t respect the lives of the innocent menoutside her ship. She wasn’t willing to take any risks in trying to save theirlives. Even though they were almost certainly uninfected, she was perfectlywilling to kill them off just to make sure. The alien shows us an exaggeratedversion of what Weaver’s character could have turned into if her unrestrainedego kept getting worse and worse; it kills everyone, with no care for anyone butitself. Ultimately, Weaver’s character must face off against the alien directly.To defeat the nemesis, she must give up her greatest flaw, which was herwillingness to sacrifice the lives of others in an attempt to save her own. Shetakes a huge risk to save a trapped little girl—as well as a cat—even though shecould have easily escaped without them. (This is also why Blake Snyder named hisbook Save the Cat!) Our hero was willing to sacrifice her own life in a valiantattempt to save the lives of others. This is the critical character change andspiritual realization she makes that is the ultimate goal of her entire quest.This tells us, in the story, that the alien—her shadow—can now be vanquished.She has now learned the lesson the adversary was teaching her. The mostimportant part of the entire quest—the breakthrough into courageous love,acceptance, and forgiveness of others—has now been achieved and turned intosolid action.THE WHEEL OF KARMA KEEPS TURNINGOf course, we play out these dramas in our personal lives through the peoplewith whom we surround ourselves. If we don’t love and respect ourselves, theuniverse won’t send in a bunch of loving, respectful people to make us feel warmand comfortable. Although the people in our lives may seem kind enough at first,we may soon find them turning on us and playing the nemesis role. Statisticallyspeaking, of all the people we meet, the sociopaths will number between 1 and 3percent—and possibly many more if we are attracting certain lessons through ourown unwillingness to grow and evolve. These people will provide us withexceptional difficulty as we struggle to understand why they keep hurting us—andtry to find out how we can get them to change. The same patterns play themselvesout, and we may repeat certain sections of the story over and over again.The emotional pain you go through in these cycles can be unimaginable. Until youtruly face your fears and gain enough courage to weed out the villains, users,and manipulators in your life, you will never truly finish your quest. You maybe terrified of hurting other people’s feelings, even if they have no problemhurting you. Sometimes the solution can be as simple as realizing that thegreatest gift you can give them is to prevent them from manipulating you anyfurther, so they may eventually learn to respect others. Yes, they will verylikely take your actions personally and complain about how much you hurt theirfeelings. This may well be the only way they can learn their lesson. On a highersoul level they may be thanking you greatly. You may be saving them from havingto reincarnate, suffer profoundly, and play the villain yet again. When youlovingly block their attempts to manipulate you, they are being given theopportunity to gain great new insights. Their soul, their guide, their innercircle, and their extended family of friends and supporters in the afterlife mayhave all been praying that they will be able to achieve these realizations, sothey will not need to keep suffering again and again."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENFACING YOUR FEAR AND COMPLETING THE QUESTMovies are very satisfying for us to watch on a subconscious, spiritual level.Every film takes our hero on a neat, compact journey through cycles of soulevolution, like those we have been working on throughout multiple lifetimes withthe same group of people, reincarnating again and again together. Newadversaries immediately replace the older ones in our lives until we trulymaster the lessons they bring us. Love—for ourselves and for others—is theultimate Elixir of Immortality that these nemesis characters block us from beingable to consistently feel and share. Our big breakthrough occurs once we becomestrong enough to stand up and face them. Our current understanding of time isthat it moves in a linear progression, but in spiritual terms, time moves inrepeating cycles. These cycles have been called the Wheel of Karma or the Bookof Life, the great story of the Hero’s Journey. We move through these cycles aswe struggle to learn the lessons of love on a sustainable, ongoing basis withinour own lives.THE TURNING OF THE WHEELWe start at the top of the wheel feeling great, with little or no consciousawareness of our key flaws. We may be self-serving, narcissistic, lacking incourage, unwilling to take responsibility, and immature. We may step on otherpeople’s feelings without even realizing what we are doing. We may not havelearned to truly love and accept others. This becomes the ordinary world that welive in each and every day, repeating the same mistakes. As the wheel startsturning, our ordinary world is soon disrupted by an inciting incident. Somethingjolts us out of our unconsciousness and compels us to take on a great quest. Nowwe want something on a very deep, primal level, with all the passion in ourhearts. The second act begins as soon as we start actively pursuing this newgoal—and now we’re in conflict. The great quest is under way. We have tofight—hard—for what we want. The wheel then takes us down to our lowest point.We are left with no choice but to crawl back out, move through unspeakablemisery, and eventually fight our way to the top once again.This is the basis of all great storytelling; it is the deep, hidden logic of thestory itself. Film screenplays break up the wheel into three sections, or“acts”—beginning, middle, and ending, or setup, conflict, and resolution. InHollywood screenplays, the climb back up from the bottom takes much less screentime than the journey downward. The second act builds up to the moment ofultimate courage when the hero chooses to face off against the nemesis in orderto complete the quest. This confrontation is never easy. Near the end of thesecond act, the hero reaches the rock-bottom point on the Wheel of Karma. Thispoint is also known as the “dark night of the soul.” All of us go through thesecrippling, terrifying, desperate moments in our own lives. These are the timeswhen negative karma strikes us the hardest. We have accidents, we are betrayed,we lose our jobs, our money, our friends, our health, our belongings, and ourstability, and we feel that all is lost.As I said, perhaps my single favorite Law of One quote is, “In forgiveness liesthe stoppage of the wheel of karma.” Once you can forgive those who have hurt,betrayed, and disrespected you, the wheel no longer has to keep dragging youdown through the same cycles. Your life will not be defined by a constant,painful struggle against a nemesis. You will no longer need to attract nemesischaracters into your life, because your ego is not running the show. The thingsyou want the most in life will manifest without bitter, painful struggle andjeopardy. This can, and will, happen on a global level as well. The Wheel ofKarma will rise to the top and stay there so we can continue to function at ourhighest and best possible level. I am one of many seekers who know from personalexperience that this practice really does work. Once you can stay at the top,you open yourself up to other timelines that can bring in even greater levels ofhappiness and spiritual achievement. The same logic applies to nations andcivilizations as well as individuals.WATCHING THE CYCLES PLAY OUT IN GLOBAL EVENTSGetting back to the story structure, in order to climb up from the absolutebottom, you have to love and respect yourself enough to face your deepest flaw,your strongest and most consistent weakness. You have to risk everything yourego holds most dear—and sacrifice those very things—in order to heal. If yourmain flaw is a lack of bravery, then you will have to release that flaw and findthat core of courage within yourself to complete your quest. If your main flawis that you have too much pain inside to truly love someone, you will have toopen your heart in order to move past the threshold and gain the happiness youseek. If your main flaw is a lack of responsibility and a desire to remain in achildlike state, you will have to become a true, spiritual adult in order torealize your greatest dreams and ambitions.20.25 The greater preponderance of your entities find themselves in what may beconsidered a perpetual childhood.354 [part0034.html#chapter011fn354]The patterns that keep repeating on a worldwide level in the grand cycles oftime fit the Hero’s Journey story line precisely. The childish immaturity of theleaders often reflects the lack of development within the people who voted forthem. There are thousands of different cases where one political group has builtits identity out of extreme religious principles, refusing to tolerate anyonewho doesn’t believe the way they do. They face off against another group whoshows them a funhouse mirror image of themselves, and the groups clash. Eachnation runs its own Wheel of Karma by seeing itself as the hero and the othernation as the nemesis. Both sides may have valid reasons for thinking the waythey do—but in the greater sense, who is right?Racial, religious, and other stereotypes are generally used by both sides toexaggerate the negative aspects of their adversaries. In so doing, they attemptto classify those people as “other,” so they become nonpersons. As a child inthe 1970s and a teenager in the late 1980s, I certainly remember mediadepictions of Russian people as mindless, robotic drones: armies of ugly, warty,sweaty, and obese women, wearing the same gray outfits and mopping floors. Theclear message was that they were leading sterilized, colorless, inhuman,militarized lives and were acceptable casualties in a nuclear war against theEvil Empire. If a government can successfully paint its opponents as villains,then the people no longer feel it matters if “the enemy” is hurt, abused,tortured, or killed. Future cycles will then be required to balance everyone outand teach them the basic lessons of loving and respecting others.The great cycle of 25,920 years and all its smaller subcycles of historicalevents appear to guarantee, through repetition, that these seething, ancientconflicts will be exposed, healed, and resolved. One of many examples is thedifference between how early American pioneers saw Native Americans, and viceversa, and the level of respect and appreciation that now exists. JamesCameron’s Avatar presented this age-old conflict very well, and that’sundoubtedly a significant part of why it succeeded. We all know that we have tomove into greater unity as a planet if we want to survive. The Golden Age maywell represent the time when we finally stop throwing these projections at oneanother, collectively speaking, and we all learn to just be nice.FOUR EQUAL PARTSAs we return to the basic elements of the story that we need when we are writinga film, our battles with the foot soldiers of the nemesis and the many other“initiation experiences” must get increasingly difficult through the entiresecond act. Right in the middle of your 120-page screenplay, you need to have apeak, or the midpoint, where there is either a false victory or a false defeatfor the hero. (We’ll explore that in a minute.) This ends up dividing the entirestory into four equal parts, with the key plot points on pages 30, 60, and 90.[../images/00018.gif]Fig. 10 [part0006.html#l10]: Diagram of the Hollywood screenplay structure asfour equal partsThe grand historical cycles discovered by Professor Anatoly Fomenko (featured inchapters 15 [part0025.html] and 16 [part0026.html]) are also divided into fourequal parts, as we will see. Perhaps the reason the Hollywood formula—thestructure—divides the story into four equal sections is that this is exactly howhistorical events move along, but in cycles that extend well beyond any oneperson’s lifetime. On some subconscious level, it appears that we know thestory, even though we may have to experience more than one physical lifetime tosee the full sequence take place within a given nation or political climate,depending on the length of the cycle. Some cycles take more than two thousandyears to complete.The midpoint occurs in the exact middle of the script, in terms of page count,and divides the script into four equal pieces. Things may seem to have resolvedpeacefully at this point, without the hero having to face the great nemesis (thefalse victory), or it may seem that the quest is impossible to complete, anddefeat is certain, so it’s time to walk away (the false defeat). Regardless ofwhich way your midpoint goes, the underlying concept is always the same. Thehero does not want to have to face the nemesis, but ultimately there is no otherway to complete the quest. Once you study this phenomenon and begin watchingfilms with an educated eye, you will be amazed by the number of movies you knowand love that are structured precisely along these lines.A PERSONAL EXAMPLE OF THE HERO’S JOURNEYFor example, let’s say you are the hero in our story. Let’s say your obviousflaw is that you are irresponsible on the road and drive too fast. I know, ofcourse that’s not you, but this is a hypothetical example. The inciting incidentcould be the moment when you get pulled over and the officer writes you aticket. The second act begins when you stop the debate within yourself andfinally decide you’re going to fight the ticket rather than just pay the fineand be done with it. Beating the ticket is now your quest. You go through fearsand a lot of discussion with various people, including some laughter about thewhole thing. You end up going to court, knowing that if the police officerdoesn’t show up, you won’t have to pay the fee. The false victory midpoint isthat moment when you think the officer isn’t coming—only to find out that hewalks right in as soon as you were convinced you were free. Now you know you’regoing to have to stand trial after all and endure the final confrontation withthe nemesis, the judge. Within the history of a nation, the false victory couldoccur when the country the nation is warring with appears to have surrenderedonly to come back even more ferociously, with a new surprise attack, forexample. The big lesson of your traffic ticket story may well be that the judgefinds you guilty, but as a result, you learn to slow down and take your time.This may actually end up saving your life as well as the lives of others. Adramatic and painful scene could reveal how this seeming loss in court becameyour ultimate salvation.THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL: ALL IS LOSTAs the final showdown with the nemesis continues, our hero’s initiationexperiences get worse and worse. This ultimately leads to the critical moment inthe whole story, near the end of the second act. It’s known as the “dark nightof the soul,” or what Blake Snyder calls “All Is Lost.”355[part0034.html#chapter011fn355] At this point, the hero seems to be totallydefeated. The quest seems impossible to fulfill. There appears to be no hope.You also get what Snyder calls the “Whiff of Death,” where the hero often seemsto have literally died. Not every film has our hero experience the threat of aphysical death at this point, but every film will have a scene where we feel thehero’s goal is utterly and completely unachievable. Snyder recommends that someform of death—even a symbolic reference such as clouds, a flying bird, or holein the earth—be inserted here to make this part of the story reach the viewer onthe deepest possible level.In a romance, the all-is-lost point could be a terrible event that makes it seemimpossible that the hero will ever be able to get together with his loveinterest. We have no idea how this problem can be solved. This is invariably thebiggest tearjerker moment in every film. As a kid, I remember when my fathercame home one night, said he just saw an incredible movie called E.T. theExtra-Terrestrial, and told us we had to go see it as soon as possible. He wasso excited that I could barely wait. I had trained myself to be strong and notto cry, especially at movies, but when E.T. was dying and looked like he wascovered in oatmeal, and nothing seemed to be able to save him, tears ran freelydown my face. I literally bawled like a baby when E.T. died—as did most of theother kids in the theater around me.This may seem like the end of the road for our hero—the darkest moment, and thecomplete failure of the quest—but in symbolic terms, all that really dies atthis point is the ego. Many movies milk this section of the story to the lastdrop. The hero often appears to be truly dead for five full pages of screentime. You will hear people all around you in the theater sniffling and sobbingif this part is really done well. Occasionally, movies actually kill off thehero at this point, just to keep us guessing, but this is very, very rare.Knowing that a resurrection is built into every screenplay does take a lot ofthe surprise out of it. However, in many films the mentor does die at thispoint—just as Obi-Wan Kenobi died in Star Wars. This can make the hero hit rockbottom and feel it is impossible to go on.In the case of a country playing out the cycles of history, the all-is-lostpoint could be a seemingly grave defeat in battle, a horrifying economiccollapse, or the loss of a highly revered and influential leader. Either way,all the doomsayers are certain it is the end of time, and the world will ceaseto exist as a result—but it never does. From this perspective, the times we’rein as I write this book in 2013 can still be considered our collective darknight of the soul. We’ve been building up to this moment for hundreds, if notthousands, of years, depending on which of the cycles we’re looking at. Since sofew of us really understand the story on a conscious level and realize that thesame events keep happening in regularly repeating cycles of history, we thinkthe dark night is the end—the defeat is total and complete, and the story isfinished. This is not so.WORKING THROUGH THE DARK NIGHTThe hero has cherished his or her flaws from the very beginning of the story.These are the negative habits, the selfish thoughts, the irrational fears, andthe irresponsible behaviors that have allowed the hero to cope without facinghis or her inner demons. In a romantic comedy, it may be the hero’s fear ofloving someone because he or she was hurt before. Now, in the dark night of thesoul, the hero realizes that his or her love interest will be completely lost ifthe hero’s fear of intimacy is not healed. In an action film, a hero who hasbeen a coward and has been ruled by fear now finally gains the courage to facethe nemesis against seemingly impossible odds.The hero drops the ego—the flaws holding him or her back—and in so doing gainsinsight into how to complete the quest and defeat the nemesis. The talisman thehero received from the mentor often plays a very important role at this point,giving the hero that magic element needed to complete the quest. In a romance,once the hero finally lets go of his or her flaws, he or she may receive a keypiece of information from the love interest that reveals how to satisfy thequest. In action films with a romantic “B story,” this new information maysimultaneously teach our hero how to get the love interest and defeat thenemesis. This information can be as simple as a kiss from the love interest,giving our hero the courage to acknowledge his or her love and face the bad guy.FACING THE NEMESIS—IN MOVIES, PERSONAL EVENTS, AND GLOBAL CONFLICTSA commercial script must have the hero face the nemesis directly and eitherdefeat the nemesis (“up” ending) or be defeated by the nemesis (“down” ending).You can write a movie where someone or something else defeats the nemesis, andyou may even get it financed and developed into a film, but it won’t be anywherenear as popular as the films that follow the ancient structure. If ascreenwriter uses some mysterious, unexpected, magical force to get the hero outof a jam at this point, without having the hero do the work, this is called deusex machina—“a god from a machine”—and is considered very sloppy screenwriting.Some films do have this happen, but it is widely frowned upon; it does notconform to the ancient story. Our hero must summon the ultimate courage and facethe nemesis. This is because every character in the film is ultimately a keyaspect of the hero, just as we see in our dreams. If the hero doesn’t face thenemesis directly, then the dream symbolism we receive each night is not beingadequately portrayed in the story we are being told.Let’s say a nation built everything around a glorified leader. This masked theirown flaws because they looked to someone else to provide them with the strengthand leadership they were not willing to generate within themselves. When theylose their leader, either to death or perhaps to political forces beyond theleader’s control, it does seem that all hope is lost. The people may be cryingand shaking with fear, convinced that the nemesis they’ve been strugglingagainst is now certain to overtake them.However, as the people work through their grief and become increasingly brave,they reorganize and are willing to stand tall against the problem, which may bea physical, external enemy but could also be a social issue such as illiteracy,hunger, economic failure, and the like. New allies suddenly step up to help thepeople complete their quest. If the people succeed, then the qualities of theleader have inspired them to such a degree that they can now steer theircivilization on their own. They don’t need the leader’s help anymore but canwork as a community, along with their new allies.THE THIRD ACT: FINAL SHOWDOWN, TRIUMPH, AND SEIZING THE ELIXIRThe third act doesn’t begin until the hero has worked through the dark night ofthe soul and has discovered a solution by which to achieve the one thing he orshe wants more than anything. Once the answer becomes obvious and the hero knowswhat has to be done, the third act begins. Let’s not forget that in traditionalplays, the curtains close at this hopeful point, where the final solution is nowin sight—not at the cliffhanger moment that modern television shows often end onto compel us to “tune in next week!” This act break inspires a great deal ofexcitement in the viewer. Now our hero seems to have the answer! Can the hero doit? Will the hero succeed? I can’t believe the hero has made it this far! Whatdo you think is going to happen? The excitement of a pending solution reachesdeep into the roots of the tree of mind. We love to reach this moment in our ownlives because it means that all our hard work is about to pay off. We now havean opportunity to integrate the nemesis within us and stop the Wheel of Karmafrom causing us to suffer. As souls, we know this is our ultimate goal, andsubconsciously we hunger for it.At this point, the hero must be brave enough to take whatever steps are neededto ensure that he or she can face the nemesis—the Guardian of the Threshold—andachieve triumph. This plan may be fraught with peril; there is no guarantee thatour hero will succeed. However, the ancient structure ensures that the Hero’sJourney will lead to victory, even if the hero ends up dying in order to achieveit. Once the hero is brave enough to let go of his or her flaws and commit tothe final solution, another key moment occurs in the great story. Now that thehero has fully embraced honor and destiny, the allies we met in the second actsuddenly flood in—seemingly out of nowhere—to help defeat the nemesis. This isthe other tearjerker moment in our story. Right when this happened in Avatar, Isaid, “The allies—of course!” The hero’s quest had felt very lonely by thispoint, as if the hero had to complete the quest all alone. Now, suddenly, thekindness the hero showed others returns—in a remarkable burst of “goodkarma”—when the hero needs it most.The allies represent other aspects of the hero’s personality that suddenly cometo his or her aid once the hero has discovered how to vanquish the selfishdemands of the ego. One of these characters could embody strength. Another couldembody humor, cunning, bravery, wisdom, love, or the trickster. In well-writtenand well-developed films, we may cry with exultant relief when we see all ourfriends from the second act suddenly return to help the hero at the exact momenthe or she needs it most.In Hollywood, happy endings are far more commercial, far more popular, and fitinto the original story much more closely than unhappy ones. The hero achievesvictory, lives through the struggle, and seizes the treasures of fullillumination that the nemesis has been jealously guarding. Once you face thenemesis within yourself and knock down the defense mechanisms of the ego thathave walled you off from loving others, you are ready to cross the threshold—andfinally get a sense of your authentic self. The people who showed you kindnessin the past, once you began pursuing your quest, have reappeared as valuableallies. Your authentic self is not the personality that built its identityaround worry, pain, and fear but is the original core of who and what you are.In spiritual terms, this is the ascension—the evolution of your soul to a higherlevel. Every triumph we experience in life is a smaller version of this samebreakthrough.Once the nemesis is vanquished and the threshold is crossed, the hero must seizethe Elixir of Immortality. This is the magic ingredient that makes the entirequest seem worthwhile. Again, the elixir can be an important person, amysterious substance, a powerful device, a great treasure, or a valuable pieceof knowledge that can transform the world. Some movies roll the credits right asthe elixir is seized, but the ancient story does not. For this reason, viewersmay feel as if they’ve been cheated when movies do this, but they don’t quiteknow why.THE RETURNWithin the great story, after the hero seizes the elixir, he must then return tothe ordinary world in his newly transformed state—and improve it. He may bechased out of the magical world by the nemesis once again or by some otheropposing force. Either way, once the hero makes it back to the ordinary worldwith the elixir, we know the quest has finally been completed and the hero hastransformed the world for the better. The more the hero improves the world as aresult of his or her triumph, the stronger he or she fulfills the promise of theancient story written into the mind of our galaxy.Let’s go back to our historical example of a nation that lost a glorifiedleader. All along, the people were helping their leader but were too afraid toget directly involved. After his or her tragic death, the people finally developcourage and face their problems directly. Together, they find a seeminglymagical solution for their problems—a better, cheaper way to print books tocombat illiteracy, a new process for cultivating more food in less time to fighthunger, or a useful product they can manufacture that stimulates their economy.When we reach the return part of the story, the elixir is put to use and startsappearing as an enhancement within everyone’s daily lives.The return part of the story is well outlined in the final film in the Lord ofthe Rings trilogy. Frodo finally gets to return home to the Shire, after castingthe Ring of Power into the lava, forever destroying the evil forces of Sauron,and freeing the land from fear and pain. Similarly, George Lucas spent a goodbit of time creating an epic awards ceremony for Luke Skywalker and his alliesat the end of Star Wars: A New Hope, the first film in his original trilogy. Inthis crowd-pleasing scene, a huge crowd roars with approval for Luke’ssuccessful completion of his quest as he is honored by his lost sister, PrincessLeia. Similarly, at the end of Return of the Jedi, the entire galaxy erupts incelebration as Luke’s mentors look on with approval in their ascendedlight-bodies.In plays, this final celebration often appears as the curtain call, when all theactors step out onstage, one-by-one. Our hero, the ultimate guest of honor,comes out last. Every actor smiles and waves at the adoring audience, and oncethey are all together, they take a bow. The fourth wall is finally broken, theactors make eye contact, and the audience becomes a direct part of the story. Ona subconscious level, this reminds us that all the world is a stage, and we aremerely players in the story of our own lives. We are working our way through anelaborate script we wrote in the afterlife, and we have a much greater existenceoutside the story. Someday, we will be reunited with our friends once more andcelebrate the joys and disasters of the life we lived.The return and curtain call are very satisfying parts of the story, but manymodern films overlook them because of time constraints or as a stylisticconvention. Many films roll the credits as soon as the hero vanquishes thenemesis and achieves the goal of the quest, leaving you to finish the storywithin your own mind and heart. In some cases, this move feels right, but manyviewers end up feeling like they’ve lost something important if they don’t getto enjoy the hero’s return along with him or her. Some movies carry our herothrough incredible ordeals and roll credits as soon as the first real sign ofrelief arrives. Movies like this may still sell well, but something is missing.THIS IS STORYThis is “story.” This is what many of us are constantly driven to surroundourselves with whenever we have free time. Every time we turn on the television,every time we see a movie, every time we call up friends and tell them about aproblem we have and how we’re trying to solve it, we are in the story. It is aspiritual ceremony. We are drawn to it because we are spiritual beings.Hollywood presents it to us because we hunger for it.We often lack the incredible patience it takes to watch the story slowly unfoldon the worldwide level over the course of what might be hundreds or eventhousands of years. We can easily see the problem and yearn for the answer wellbefore everyone else on earth is fully ready to have it delivered. At thispoint, we must turn to the story of our own lives and work on healing ourselves.In so doing, we heal the world—and we can change the story’s outcome.SEPARATION, INITIATION, AND RETURNWe already mentioned the beginning, middle, and ending as being setup, conflict,and resolution—or first act, second act, and third act. Blake Snyder also refersto these divisions as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.356[part0034.html#chapter011fn356] Joseph Campbell breaks this three-part sequencedown into separation, initiation, and return. In the separation phase, you feelcut off, you feel alone, you feel, in the deepest sense, that love, or thecreator, has abandoned you. This causes you to build up defense mechanisms toprotect your sensitive core. In the initiation phase, you face your fears,confront your shadow, and ultimately let go of your deepest flaws. In so doing,you achieve triumph, or illumination—the spiritual ascension into the realm ofpure knowledge, where that true love is the Elixir of Immortality that is nowreadily available to you. In the return phase, you go back to your normal lifeand transform it, with the new understandings you have reached. Even if the oneyou loved ends up dying at the end, you realize that you have yourself, andtherefore you can never be alone. Once you learn to love yourself, you gainwhatever your true heart desires—and you help others in the process.We run through these cycles every day of our lives. We run through them over thecourse of years with parents, teachers, friends, bosses, and romantic partnerswho have been returning to be with us in lifetime after lifetime. Ultimately, werun through these same cyclical patterns on a worldwide level. It’s all the sameidentity, moving through the same story in a worldwide lucid dream. At the endof each lifetime, we get another grand curtain call and again have the fullawareness that the life we just lived is only one facet of a much greater jewel.We are reacquainted with our inner circle—the same troupe of friends who havechosen to play different parts in each new story that comes along. We are ableto step back, take a deep breath, and appreciate that the struggles we thoughtwere so all-important—which seemingly threatened the core of our existence—weremerely reminders. We placed these apparent obstacles in our path to help usawaken to our core identity as eternal souls who are perfect, holographicprojections of a loving Creator.Intelligent, self-aware co-creators have been working through and mastering thisstory, individually and collectively, since long before there were ever humanbeings on earth. Some of the older ones may become mentors who appear in ourdreams and help steer events on earth to a more favorable outcome, behind thescenes. When we see that story acted out in songs, poems, books, plays,television shows, or movies, we are inspired. We are moved. Deep down inside, weknow this is our story—the Book of Life—and we know the book is written to havea happy ending. We now begin to awaken within the dream. And what might happenonce we fully and completely wake up? Will we penetrate the veil and touchintelligent infinity?THE WORLDWIDE THIRD ACTWe have not yet figured out, on a worldwide level, that this Book of Lifeapplies equally well to the events in our own history—that is, the Hero’s Story.Nor do we consciously realize that we are now well into the third act—the finalstruggle with our own worldwide ego projection. We have worked through the darknight of the soul, we have identified the Guardian of the Threshold, and we knowwhat we have to do in order to defeat this guardian, the nemesis. No more SheepEffect. We must face the truth—for the truth will set us free. In thenot-too-distant future, we may even head into a worldwide curtain call. Realityas we know it may be revealed as an elaborate illusion orchestrated from higherlevels for our own evolution within a living universe. In this grand, triumphantmoment of ascension, on a global scale, the angelic players who have helped usall along may finally step out from behind the veil and take a bow. The datacollected in this book makes it a lot easier for us to imagine that somethinglike this may actually happen. Synchronicity is the key that is helping usawaken on an individual and collective level.We already discussed the pope’s shocking resignation in 2013 and lightningstriking the Vatican that same night. This was a stunningly perfect embodimentof the symbol for the dark night of the soul that is written into “the roots ofthe tree of Mind,” in Law of One terms. Considering the depth to which theoriginal Roman church modified Christianity, this symbolism is extremelypoignant. Another interesting example from our recent history was that onThursday, January 15, 2009, just five days before Barack Obama’s inauguration,Captain Chesley Sullenberger pulled off a successful water landing of hiscritically damaged passenger airliner in the Hudson River. This was the symbolicopposite of the airline disaster of 9/11. As I wrote on my website,357[part0034.html#chapter011fn357] this appeared to be another manifestation of theworldwide lucid dream we’re all experiencing, in which seemingly random worldevents in fact have symbolic meaning.Many people felt that something profoundly mystical was going on in the Miracleon the Hudson, but they didn’t really understand it. Among other things, Ipresented video proof that the exact moment all the survivors lined up on thewings in the iconic photograph was 3:33 P.M. This was only weeks after Obama’svictory was announced in the election, once he garnered 333 electoral votes. The333 stayed on everyone’s television screens during John McCain’s entireconcession speech.358 [part0034.html#chapter011fn358] I must admit it was agreat surprise to see 333 appear on a worldwide level in two different obviousways over such a short period of time.I do not believe either of these events was contrived or planned by anyone hereon earth, nor do I think they make Obama a savior figure. Each of us must becomethe hero in this global story in our own way. The fact that Obama won twoelections shows that the people voted for the message he gave them, whether hecould live up to it in office or not. At the time of this writing, he hasstarted his second term, and there is widespread discontent with the way thingsare going. These “geo-synchronicities,” like the Vatican lightning strike andthe Miracle on the Hudson, may be the result of direct spiritual interventionsinto our collective story—sending us all a powerful message that a positivefuture will appear. Within the framework of the story, events like this arecalled foreshadowing, or harbingers, hints that the hero will indeed besuccessful in his or her quest, regardless of how dark the road may seem at thetime.In the Miracle on the Hudson, the symbolism appeared to be telling us that underthe violent, imperialistic policies of the Bush administration, the world wasrapidly spiraling into a complete disaster, including the massive economiccollapse of 2008. September 11 was a grand symbol of that catastrophe. However,the public awakened enough to vote for the candidate who promised to end thefear, who did not see people in foreign lands as “the enemy,” and who vowed thathe would bring everyone in, together, for a safe landing—regardless of theirrace, nationality, or religion. The heroic pilot achieved the impossible—facingthe threshold of death, vanquishing the same airline demon that brought down theTwin Towers on 9/11, and seizing the Elixir of Immortality. This stunning eventsubconsciously showed the world that there can be a happy ending within even themost troubling and disturbing of global predicaments. Sullenberger’s rescue wasconsidered a miracle that inspired millions around the world and is now praisedas “one of the most dramatic escape stories in aviation history.” 359[part0034.html#chapter011fn359]Whether you call them the Illuminati, the New World Order, the Cabal, the ShadowElite, or the Bad Guys, the planetary elite do represent a worldwide projectionof our own ego, distorted to funhouse-mirror extremes. There are anever-increasing number of harbingers that this collective nightmare is indeedcoming to an end, and I consistently track them on my website. The Elixir ofImmortality that this “dragon” is guarding is far more significant, andfantastic, than most people could ever have imagined—and will have a huge impactupon our world. It includes the full and complete knowledge that we are notalone in the universe and is the gateway to meeting our long-lost relatives in aglobal curtain call. Given the ever-increasing pace of events now unfolding, andthe incredible number of prophetic dreams I’ve been having about the disclosureand defeat of the Cabal, there may already have been very significantdevelopments between the time I finish writing this manuscript and the time thebook is published.On a directly physical level, the increasing problems of earthquakes, tsunamis,hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and climate change are also key aspects of ourworldwide dark night of the soul. These upheavals appear to be a verysignificant part of the grand design to awaken us, according to almost allancient myths and prophecies worldwide. Regardless of our race, country, color,or creed, the oil spills, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,and the like are a global wake-up call. We all need to have solidarity in theface of these catastrophes, particularly if we realize that they may haveenergetic causes that we can change for the positive by our own thoughts andactions. The Law of One series directly indicates that these global problems areintended to awaken us on a planetary level.65.6 [Your people will have a] greater opportunity for service due to the many[earth] changes—which will offer many challenges, difficulties, and seemingdistresses, within your illusion, to many who then will seek to understand—if wemay use this misnomer—the reason for the malfunctioning of the physical rhythmsof their planet.360 [part0034.html#chapter011fn360]READY TO EXPLORE THE CYCLES OF HISTORYNow that we have established the structure that spiritual evolution istaking—written into our galactic mind within this living cosmos—we are finallyready to explore the cycles of history. This knowledge presents us with ashocking, revolutionary, and utterly world-transforming change in perspective.It is the ultimate unveiling of the grand nature of the illusion we are livingin and the intelligence of the greater cosmos that surrounds us. We will soonsee that many, if not most, of the events that happen in our world—even theworst mass atrocities—are not random at all. They appear to be themanifestations of an intelligent structure in time that we keep moving through.The ancient story seems to keep being told, over and over again, until we learnthe lessons it is meant to teach us. If we see others as separate fromourselves, as less than, as the enemy, then the nemesis is winning—and we willkeep suffering right along with our forgotten brothers and sisters. Wars andfatalities will keep repeating, again and again, until we finally see that weare all one, and everyone has a right to live with freedom and peace. Ourleaders cannot steer us into wars unless at least a certain percentage of usbelieve that violence is necessary to solve our problems.Sociopaths are very clever at concealing themselves and convincing us that wewant the same things they want, but that is all changing now. Once the truth isexposed, it can never be stopped. Our individual and collective free will hasbeen neatly kept within certain guidelines, moving and dancing within energeticinfluences that most of us would never believe could exist. At various points inthe ancient Hero’s Journey, single individuals can embody certain characterarchetypes within the story on a personal, regional, national, or even globallevel. The great inventors were mentors who handed us the talismans, or magicgifts, that allowed us to transform our society into the magical world. Themysterious new force of electricity was harnessed for positive ends, enhancingthe simplest things we needed in our daily lives, such as washing laundry,cleaning dishes, reading books, storing and cooking food, traveling, andcommunicating with one another. The nuclear bomb represented the great evil thatthis technology was capable of creating. Now we have reached a point at which wehave isolated the enemy that is threatening us with this and other weapons ofmass destruction, and we can seize the much greater benefits of technology thatwill follow in its defeat.The energetic influences that are causing members of our society to jump intothese archetypal roles and fulfill them according to this ancient pattern seemto be caused by our earth’s movement. Specifically, our planet is slowlydrifting through different areas of space that are ultimately alive andintelligent. Our earth’s axis traces out a slow, 25,920-year wobble, and thecycles of history follow neatly along. As we will review in Part 4[part0027.html], this Great Year is ultimately the orbit that our entire solarsystem is tracing around a mysterious Black Sun companion star. The energeticfields of our sun’s companion are structured in perfect, harmonic geometricpatterns, and our free will is being precisely guided by these fields on anindividual and collective level."},{"pageContent":"PART THREECYCLES OF VICTORYAND DEFEAT[../images/00019.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEJOAN OF ARC RISES AGAINTHE GREAT CYCLES OF HISTORYThe Law of One series has some intriguing quotes on the true meaning of history,which give us an excellent starting point for this discussion. We are remindedthat there really is only one story being told again and again. The specificdetails, times, and places are much less important than the philosophy ofspiritual evolution these cycles are ultimately meant to teach us.16.21 There is no history, as we understand your concept.

The teach/learning which is our responsibility is philosophicalrather than historical.363 [part0034.html#chapter012fn363]1.1 We are not a part of time and, thus, are able to be with you in any of yourtimes.364 [part0034.html#chapter012fn364]16.22 There is past, present, and future in third density. In an overview suchas an entity may have, removed from the space/time continuum, it may be seenthat in the cycle of completion there exists only the present.365[part0034.html#chapter012fn365]AN EPIC MYSTERY—ENCODED IN MYTHS ALL OVER THE WORLDIn The Hero with a Thousand Faces,366 [part0034.html#chapter012fn366] JosephCampbell revealed that all lasting myths, worldwide, tell us the same story,which he called the Hero’s Journey. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechendfound that dozens of these same myths, from all over the world, had hiddenmetaphors of the 25,920-year precession—or Great Year—very deliberately encodedwithin them. We know that there is a slow, counter-rotating wobble in theearth’s axis that takes 25,920 years to complete, but conventional science hasno explanation for why it was considered so important in so many differentancient mythologies. The hero’s triumph over the nemesis in these myths seems toreveal a clear prophecy of a coming Golden Age—a new level of human evolutionthat is called “fourth density” in the Law of One series. There is one, greatHero’s Journey story that takes 25,920 years to complete, with many subcycles inwhich the same story keeps repeating itself in different ways. These cycles ofhistory appear to be referred to in the book of Ecclesiastes (3:1, 2, and 15):For everything its season, and for every activity under heaven its time: a timeto be born and a time to die…. Whatever is has been already, and whatever is tocome has been already—and God summons each event back in its turn.The Hindu scriptures repeatedly discuss cycles of evolution in thecosmos—including a full “day and night of Brahma,” which they believe is theentire cycle of the universe—at 8 billion, 640 million years.367[part0034.html#chapter012fn367] The 25,920-year cycle is also mentioned, as wellas its divisions into the twelve 2,160-year Ages of the Zodiac. The Hinduscriptures teach that we are now moving through the greatest age of darkness—theKali Yuga—when there is a progressive decline in morality, as well as an excessof materialism and violence. This paves the way for the coming transformationinto the Satya Yuga, or the Golden Age, when great avatars will reappear.Krishna speaks of himself as an embodiment of the reappearing hero archetype inthe Bhagavad Gita (4:5–11):I have been born many times, Arjuna, and many times hast thou been born. But Iremember my past lives, and thou has forgotten thine. Although I am unborn,everlasting, and I am the Lord of all, I come to my realm of nature—and throughmy wondrous power I am born. When righteousness is weak, and faints, andunrighteousness exults in pride, then my Spirit arises on earth. For thesalvation of those who are good, for the destruction of evil in man, for thefulfillment of the kingdom of righteousness, I come to this world—in the agesthat pass.I first became aware of the idea that history may be moving in cycles when Iread The Great Pyramid Decoded by Peter Lemesurier in the summer of 1993:History…[may] indeed [be] cyclic, as we earlier surmised, and as the Maya alsolong believed…. [This] cyclic view of history…[is] capable of being expressed interms of astrological notions derived from the precession of the equinoxes…. Wemight perhaps more justly conceive of the progression of the ages in terms of aspiral. The march of evolution and history, in other words, displays a circularmotion, but each revolution takes place at a different level (presumably ahigher one)—and is characterized by accomplishments of a different order.Indeed, the fact that the ancient Aztecs apparently regarded the conch-shell assymbolic of the succeeding ages would suggest that they subscribed to some suchnotion. Nor is the idea without its distinguished modern adherents: evenEinstein is alleged to have subscribed to it….There appears to be nothing improbable in a cyclic view of world history. Infact, the only real obstacle to the more general acceptance of such a view isthe apparent lack of specific archaeological evidence to back it up—which mayhave more than a little to do with lack of knowledge of what to look for, orwhere exactly to look for it. Whether, as Edgar Cayce has claimed, such evidencewill in due course be found, only time will tell.368[part0034.html#chapter012fn368]THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED—SIX YEARS LATERI continued thinking about this mystery, on and off, for another six years afterI first read Lemesurier’s vastly complex work of scholarship. Finally, during abirthday party my friend David Steinberg threw for me on March 7, 1999, hehanded me an unpublished, yellowing manuscript of a book he had been hired totranslate from French into English. He considered this decaying stack of papersto be extremely precious and wanted it back as soon as I finished reading it. Isoon realized it was very synchronistic to receive the ultimate magic gift at mybirthday party, as this was the shift point in my own yearly cycle. I was aboutto upload my first full-length online scientific book, Convergence II, to theInternet the very next day, and I briefly mentioned the book David lent me atthe very end of Convergence II’s conclusion.369 [part0034.html#chapter012fn369]More than a year and a half later, I told David this book really had to beonline and offered to scan and publish the entire manuscript. He agreed, and itappeared on my website on January 10, 2001. The book is called The End of OurCentury, by François Masson, and the chapter that stands out above the rest iscalled “Cyclology: The Mathematics of History.”370[part0034.html#chapter012fn370]Masson had the hard evidence to prove exactly what Lemesurier had suggested inhis book from 1977. History does indeed appear to be moving in very precisecycles—and Masson gave extensive, astonishing evidence to prove it. I was quitesurprised that no publisher had been willing to carry such a fascinating book.However, in March 2013, I conducted an Internet search and found that analternate English translation of this book did actually get published by DonningCompany Publishers in 1983 and was entitled The End of Our Era.371[part0034.html#chapter012fn371] This book is now out of print and may beavailable only by interlibrary loan, but Steinberg’s translation is freelypublished on my website. The Library of Congress lists The End of Our Era asbeing copyrighted on June 25, 1982, and revised on March 22, 1984,372[part0034.html#chapter012fn372] proving that the book did appear in public as of1982–1983.Masson highlighted the discoveries of Michèl Helmer, who presented a vast andcompelling new theory in the course of multiple articles for the journal LesCahiers Astrologiques over the course of sixteen years. Helmer argued thathistorical events repeat themselves in very precise cycles of time—with stunningaccuracy. Masson wrote the following in 1980: “In the Cahiers Astrologiques(journal) of 1960, M. Helmer presented his theory on the cyclic repetition ofevents—a cycle based mainly on using the Ideal pre-eminent Number 25920 and itsfactors. Applying his theory enabled [Helmer] to make many exactpredictions—both economic and political.”373 [part0034.html#chapter012fn373]Helmer does not appear to have any publications in the Cahiers Astrologiquesjournal archives for 1960, but his work may have been reprinted that year. SinceCahiers Astrologiques still has an online record of all its publications we doknow that Helmer wrote “Solar Revolution” in issue 75 of Cahiers Astrologiques(1958); untitled articles in issue 91 (1961) and issue 99 (1962); “EncryptedDocuments of Heaven and Earth” in issue 100 (1962); and untitled articles inissue 114 (1965), issue 118 (1965), and issue 121 (1966). Helmer also wrote “TheHarmony of the World Is Based on the Rhythm of the Golden Section, What Do YouThink?” in issue 126 (1967); “Discovering the Mystery of the Sothic Cycle” inissue 131 (1967); and untitled articles in issues 132 and 133 (1968).374[part0034.html#chapter012fn374] Helmer also contributed to “Pluto SurveyAnswers” with ten other authors in issue 168 (1974).375[part0034.html#chapter012fn375]IF THIS IS TRUE, THEN IT CHANGES EVERYTHINGIf Helmer’s core hypothesis is true, then the implications are staggering. Wecan no longer trust in our own free will—nor can we trust in the apparentrandomness of world events. The things that are happening now have happenedbefore, and these events may well be following a mysterious ancient script,written into the very fabric of space and time itself. This is a very different,and much more hopeful, way of viewing our lives—and indeed of our entire“reality” on earth. No matter how bad things may look, we’re never really inthat much trouble; we are going through organized cycles of events that aredesigned to promote our collective spiritual evolution. Graham Hancock combinedCopenhaver’s376 [part0034.html#chapter012fn376] and Scott’s377[part0034.html#chapter012fn377] modern translations of the ancient EgyptianHermetic texts to reveal their prophecies of a Golden Age. These Hermeticprophcies called for a “new birth of the Cosmos; it is a making again of allthings good, a holy and awe-inspiring restoration of all nature; and it iswrought inside the process of Time, by the eternal Will of the Creator.” 378[part0034.html#chapter012fn378] What exactly is the “process of time” theseancient Hermetic writings referred to? Helmer and Masson seem to have found theanswer.Helmer was able to verify, in great detail, that “history repeats itself.”Specifically, he found that there were a variety of different cycles in whichevents curiously repeat themselves. Of course, these events are not preciselythe same. The names, the places, and the specific details change, but the exacttiming of major events, such as the biggest wars, repeat with astonishingprecision. Cycles that last hundreds or even thousands of years can trigger newwars within days of when they appeared in the previous cycle. Almost all of thecycles Helmer discovered were perfect subdivisions of the Great Year, in whichearth orbits around the sun 25,920 times. The most well-known subdivision of25,920 years is the Age of the Zodiac at 2,160 years in length. There are, ofcourse, twelve of these zodiac cycles within the Great Year. Helmer also foundthat each Age of the Zodiac could be further divided into four equal pieces.This gives us a 540-year subcycle in which historical events can repeat.THE 539-YEAR CYCLEHelmer concluded that we need to shave one year off this 540-year cycle in orderto truly appreciate its magic. Once we knock it down to 539 years, we getadditional “harmonics” that do not appear in the number 540. For example, a539-year cycle is evenly divisible by seven and eleven. This allows us to createperfect subcycles of seven and eleven years in which historical events may berepeating. If you do the math, you will see that there are exactly seven cyclesof seventy-seven years in 539 years, as well as forty-nine cycles of elevenyears. We already know that our sun goes from a very quiet, tranquil surface toa boiling inferno of sunspot activity in cycles that typically run ineleven-year units. The Russian scientist Tchijevsky proved that all the mostsignificant events on earth do occur during the peak of the sunspot cycle.Helmer further proved that Tchijevsky was right; the eleven-year cycle has adirect effect on human civilization. Tchijevsky never considered that thiseleven-year sunspot cycle might only be the building block of something muchlarger.Helmer also speculated that this 539-year cycle might have been alluded to inthe Bible as “7 times 77.” The best match I found is in Matthew 18:21–22 (NIV):“Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, ‘Lord, how many times shall I forgive mybrother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?’ Jesus answered, ‘I tellyou, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.’”Why would Jehoshua reveal the numbers seven and seventy-seven, back to back,when he was discussing the true art of forgiveness? Was this some kind of ahidden message, since Jehoshua often spoke in dreamlike riddles, or parables?Other translations have Jehoshua saying “seven times seventy.”379[part0034.html#chapter012fn379] Helmer apparently had a Bible translation whereJehoshua actually said “seven times seventy-seven.” We must multiply the numbersseven and seventy-seven together to decipher the hidden message. If Jehoshuadid, in fact, “penetrate intelligent infinity” and become an embodiment of thehero—the original mind of our galaxy—then he may have gained the directknowledge that history moves in 539-year cycles. Jehoshua may be telling us thatthis cycle is written into the mind of the galaxy as a cycle of forgiveness thatwe move through in the course of multiple lifetimes. Through these great cyclesof time, we work out our karma—and heal our society on a collective basis.The Bible connection may seem to be a bit speculative, but according to Masson,there’s good science behind the cycle itself: “This [539-year] cycle is surelythe most important of those whose scope we can comprehend: it is the turningpoint of the basic cycles of a civilization.”380 [part0034.html#chapter012fn380]Using this cycle, Helmer was able to predict, in 1960, that very powerful eventswould take place in French history by 1968. According to Masson, Helmerpublished these predictions openly in 1964—though again, Masson may have seen areprint from an earlier edition of the journal, since the online record does notshow that Helmer wrote any new papers that year. Either way, this prophecy was avery bold move. If Helmer was proven wrong, his career and credibility would bedestroyed—but by this point, he had already identified this cycle at work inmodern-day France. Helmer must have been quite excited, as he knew that thesecycles were building up to a moment where the public would be inspired to riseup against their nemesis, and a newer and stronger form of freedom would result.According to Masson, “Helmer chose as his starting point the year 1429—when thetide turned against the English in the Hundred Years’ War. This affected thewhole history of Europe.”JOAN OF ARC’S CYCLE REPEATS IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY FRENCH HISTORYAfter this critical turning point in the Hundred Years’ War, England largelystopped attacking its own European neighbors, including France, and focused onbuilding its empire overseas. This crucial defeat of the English was triggeredby none other than Joan of Arc—a nineteen-year-old girl with seemingly mysticalpowers to communicate with the magical world of the spirit. Joan of Arc was putin charge of the entire French army because of her unique abilities. Joan of Arcis, therefore, a perfect hero character within our collective Hero’s Journey.The ancient three-act structure is prewritten, in perfect form, in the story ofJoan of Arc. There is no need to add, delete or reorganize any of the eventsthat took place in order to tell the story. Joan of Arc’s epic tale is a perfectexample of how specific individuals can become embodiments of the main characterin the Hero’s Journey story at various points in history. It may ultimately beeveryone’s destiny to fulfill this ancient pattern in our own unique ways. Joanof Arc’s critical victory against the British in the city of Orleans occurredfrom April 29 to May 8 in the year 1429. Helmer’s prophecy did not disappointhis readers in the least: “539 years later, practically to the day, the Frenchyouth, on another level of the spiral, brought about the shift and incredibledestruction of a whole state of mind belonging to the past.”381[part0034.html#chapter012fn381]ALL YOU NEED IS LOVESure enough, on May 3, 1968, just 539 years and four days after Joan of Arc ledthe previous uprising, there was a new uprising in France, led by young collegestudents. The Beatles’ groundbreaking Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band—nowvoted the number one rock-and-roll album in history by Rolling Stonemagazine—had just come out the year before. The Beatles also released the hitsingle “All You Need Is Love” on the first-ever live, global television programon June 25, 1967, entitled Our World. An estimated 400 million people intwenty-six countries tuned in to see this broadcast,382[part0034.html#chapter012fn382] and the BBC commissioned the Beatles to write asong for the United Kingdom’s contribution to the program.The sexual revolution was in full swing, but French students were kept locked upin separate single-sex dormitories under strict security. No “newspaper taxis”appeared on the shore, and the “girl with kaleidoscope eyes” was held away underheavy guard in a private room. Love, apparently, was not something Frenchcollege students needed—at all. The students were not allowed to visit oneanother in their homes at any time, day or night—and this was enforced withrigid, military strictness. This total lockdown on freedom clearly seemed to bean archaic, leftover relic from an increasingly irrelevant religious codepromoted by a hyperconservative government, but these harsh rules affected thelives of the college students quite dramatically. How were they ever supposed tomake friends with members of the opposite sex if they weren’t even allowed topay each other a friendly visit during the day? The Independent revealed thatthis strict rule had created a tense political climate in France by March 15,1968: “Pierre Viansson-Ponté said that France was suffering from a dangerouspolitical malady: ‘boredom’. Elsewhere, he said, from Spain to the US, studentswere protesting about wars or fundamental liberties. ‘French students are mostlyconcerned that the girls…should be able to visit the bedrooms of the boys, whichis a rather limited conception of human rights.’”383[part0034.html#chapter012fn383]A NEW HERO ARISES—AND HISTORY REPEATS ITSELFDaniel Cohn-Bendit, a fiery, red-haired twenty-two-year-old, became the new herocharacter in the next turn of the 539-year cycle when he led a mob of threehundred students into a full uprising. His army of frustrated students occupiedthe administrative block of their school and demanded change. This put them atrisk of being expelled, which would have cost them all the money they and theirfamilies had invested in their education. This did not stop them from takingaction and defending their right to freedom. The Independent revealed that thenemesis tried to crush this political uprising just as we saw in the case ofJoan of Arc, 539 years earlier: “Several students, including Cohn-Bendit, wereaccused of ‘agitation’ and threatened with expulsion. A demonstration in supportwas planned in the courtyard of the venerable Sorbonne, in the centre of Paris’sLeft Bank, on 3 May.”384 [part0034.html#chapter012fn384]This dispute soon escalated into a clash with armed riot police—the minions ofthe great nemesis that must be confronted on the Hero’s Journey. The policeseemed to enjoy their jobs too much and began committing acts of brutality, butthe people fought back: The police were wearing “old-fashioned uniforms andold-fashioned helmets. They looked rather like French soldiers from the 1914–18war.” This may well be part of the overall symbolism of the story revealingitself, through synchronicity—showing how the police represented the minions ofthe old, crumbling, oppressive world order in France.The demonstrators had been promised that they could leave freely. About 400 ofthem were brutally arrested. Larger demonstrations gathered. The first “pavés,”or cobble stones, were thrown at the police. The Paris police, supported by afew busloads of the notorious CRS riot police, responded with indiscriminatebaton charges and volleys of tear gas—assaulting students, journalists,passers-by, tourists, cinema-goers and elderly couples who were sitting at caféterrasses watching the fun. Many of the younger victims, and some older ones,joined in the riots. By that night, there were barricades all over.385[part0034.html#chapter012fn385]MUCH GREATER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE INSPIRED TO RISE UPJoan of Arc’s key battle ended on May 8, 1429. Although she and her group ofsoldiers lost the battle, her story was so powerful—hitting the Hero’s Journey“button” within everyone’s subconscious mind so strongly—that she inspired muchgreater numbers of people to rise up against tyranny and defeat the nemesis. Thekey turning point in the student uprising happened 539 years and two days afterJoan of Arc’s landmark battle on May 8. A group of students armed with nothingbut their bare hands made direct, violent attacks against the police ringing thecourtyard in their riot gear: “A week [after May 3rd], a large crowd of studentstried to ‘liberate’ the Sorbonne, which had been ringed by the CRS [policeforces]. Trees were ripped up, cars overturned and cobble stones hurled—exposingyards of sand.”386 [part0034.html#chapter012fn386]Of course, this only caused the police to fight back even harder. Once again, itseemed like an all-is-lost point. The students did their best, but thegovernment was fighting back with brutal military force. However, the studentshad fulfilled their role in the Hero’s Journey, just as Joan of Arc haddone—they faced off against the nemesis directly. This is where the allies fromthe second act can now come rushing in. Back 539 years ago, Joan of Arc’s braveactions sparked a much greater uprising, which ultimately freed France and otherEuropean countries from the nemesis. In the French student rebellion, aftertheir main attempt to defeat the riot police was crushed, more than 8 millionpeople were soon inspired to jump into this new battle for freedom. The alliesstormed in just three days after Daniel Cohn-Bendit and his army of students haddone their best to “liberate” the Sorbonne—and failed: “The tradesunions—against the better judgment of their own leaders—called a one-day strikeand demonstration. The government ordered the CRS to withdraw, and an immensestudent and worker demonstration choked the Left Bank. But the strike did notend after one day, as the union leaders planned. Eight million workers went onindefinite, wildcat strike—the largest labour stoppage in French history.”387[part0034.html#chapter012fn387]A TRULY POWERFUL EVENT THAT CHANGED HISTORYThe Independent revealed the scope and power of this student-led uprising—almostexactly 539 years to the day after Joan of Arc worked her magic in the previouscycle: “There were other student revolts in Europe and America, before and afterMay 1968, [but] in no other country did a student rebellion almost bring down agovernment. In no other country did a student rebellion lead to a workers’revolt, one that rose up from the blue-collar grass roots and overwhelmed thepaternalistic trade-union leadership as much as the paternalistic, conservativegovernment.”388 [part0034.html#chapter012fn388]The effects of this revolution continued beyond just a student uprising: “Theleaders of the young people who built barricades and overturned cars in theParis Latin Quarter in 1968 went on, in many cases, to become seniorjournalists, writers, philosophers, and politicians (including the presentforeign minister, Bernard Kouchner).”389 [part0034.html#chapter012fn389]Masson also explained that “since that year 1968, which saw the same youthmovement appear throughout the world—in France, Czechoslovakia, the USA, Mexico,Japan, West Germany, etc.—no one can depend on his title [of nobility or agraduate degree] to be obeyed, but must prove his abilities.”390[part0034.html#chapter012fn390]HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED?These are astonishing correlations—particularly when we remember that Helmerpredicted, in writing, that Joan of Arc’s revolutionary overthrow of herpeople’s nemesis would precisely repeat in French history 539 years later. Howcould Helmer possibly have made such an accurate prophecy at least four years inadvance? How could the key turning point have happened only two days apart ineach of these cycles? Now the 2,160-year Age of the Zodiac cycle doesn’t seem soarchaic, boring, and useless in our modern world anymore. This may turn out tobe an incredibly advanced science, requiring the very best computer power wehave to truly map out and understand. Once we divide the Age of the Zodiac intofour equal pieces and subtract one year to make the cycle into a more harmonicnumber, we see historical events repeating with remarkable precision. Thischallenges everything we think we know. If historical events are not random,then what about free will? Suddenly, the science of the ancient gods from allover the world seems far more modern than we ever realized.The Ages of the Zodiac were highly revered in Sumer, Egypt, Greece, Rome, andIndia—and appear to be the original inspiration for the idea that “historyrepeats itself.” Skeptics might argue that Helmer just “got lucky” and thefulfillment of his prophecy—within two days of total perfection—was somehow justa coincidence. However, this is only one of hundreds of examples, extendingthroughout documented history, in which events reappear in perfect cycles oftime—as we will see in future chapters. Helmer and Masson found dozens ofstriking examples that fit this same pattern very precisely—and as we will see,I was able to continue their work and prove that these events have continuedhappening ever since. That, for me, was the final proof I needed. In 2010, Idiscovered that 9/11 and several key events before and after it were preciselycorrelated with similar wars and political upheavals that had occurred 539 yearsearlier in Europe. The battle that corresponded to 9/11 in the previous cycleoccurred only six days apart from where it appeared in our time—exactly onequarter of the Age of the Zodiac later—on September 11, 2001.I honestly don’t know how long it will take for our society to discover andaccept that this is really happening. My guess is that unless we see amonumental historical event—such as a genuine disclosure of the extraterrestrialpresence on earth, in both modern and ancient times—most people will simplyignore this. Many other amazing scientific discoveries are already beingdismissed, without question. I will be happy to fight for the truth—but I admitthat the whole concept sounds so outrageous to most people that the only waythey will ever be convinced is if we can provide mountains of proof and presentan entirely new cosmology that supports this new information. Thankfully, wehave that new scientific paradigm already. If the universe is indeed a living,conscious being, and there are many scientific discoveries that prove it, thereis a solid body of evidence to model how this might be happening—and why. Thefirst steps of this model will be shared in Part 4 [part0027.html], though itcalls for a much deeper investigation.THINGS GOT BETTER THE NEXT TIME AROUNDIt is interesting to note that in the next turn of the cycle in France, no onehad to die, neither the students nor the police. The entire cycle played out ina much more peaceful way. Both sides—the conservative old guard and the liberalyouths—were able to grow up and stop seeing the other as their nemesis. Thissuggests that as we move through these great cycles, there are no real “sides.”The hero and the nemesis are both aspects of who we are as a society. We do notneed to declare ourselves “right” and others “wrong,” simply because we do notagree on everything. By finding ways to forgive one another and get along as aplanet, we are collectively purifying and transforming our ego mind on a larger,worldwide level, as well as on an individual basis. The students were forgivenfor wanting to have sex before marriage, and the government was soon forgivenfor having tried to enforce a traditional code of ethics."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENTHE 2,160-YEAR CYCLE BETWEEN ROME AND THE UNITED STATESThe 539-year cycle was very impressive, demonstrating mathematical precisionthat was accurate to within forty-eight hours across more than half amillennium. Michèl Helmer predicted there would be a major French rebellion atleast four years in advance—and indeed, more than 8 million people were inspiredto join the students’ fight for freedom. If Helmer and Masson were right, theneach Age of the Zodiac breaks down into quarter cycles, in which historicalevents will repeat themselves with astonishing accuracy. If you read theoriginal translation on my website, you will find many different examples ofexact turning points in history, separated by 539 years.391[part0034.html#chapter013fn391] No one but David Steinberg, his immediatefamily, and the potential book publisher had ever seen this manuscript. As faras I could tell, no one other than Helmer and Masson had ever discovered thesecycles repeating in our history, though Peter Lemesurier’s book had put me onthe lookout six years earlier. Helmer and Masson’s research seemed to beunique—and utterly groundbreaking. If this phenomenon was real, there should bemany more examples of the 539-year cycle than Helmer and Masson discovered,which should be detectable through further research. It should be possible tocrunch vastly detailed historical databases with supercomputers in order to lookfor more patterns like this.I was equally surprised when I found out that the 2,160-year Age of the Zodiaccycle was precisely guiding the movement of historical events as well.Furthermore, for me, an American, this data was up close and personal, as therewas a direct connection between historical events in the Roman Empire andtwentieth-century events in the United States. A 2,160-year zodiac cycle seemsstaggeringly long. If we go back 2,160 years, that’s older than the NewTestament and older than the time Jehoshua walked the earth. We now findourselves back in an area we lovingly call “B.C.”—but the great cycles ofhistory do not even blink across this seemingly vast distance. Masson’s researchhad not been updated since 1980 in the version of the manuscript I was given.Once I started combining thirty years’ worth of research together in 2009 and2010 to write The Source Field Investigations, I soon found myself irresistiblydrawn into a new quest. I had to know if this zodiac cycle was still at worktoday. It didn’t take long to discover that these cycle connections between Romeand the United States were still working just as well in the 1980s, 1990s, and2000s as they were when Masson wrote the book in 1979–1980. Before I show youhow well the zodiac cycle is still working, I will take you through all thestunning data points Helmer and Masson discovered.Once I saw the truth, everything changed. I had to step back, take a deepbreath, and rethink everything I thought I knew about life on earth. The greatstructure of story that we find in almost every ancient myth and modern-daymovie on earth is guiding our lives, far more than we could ever believe. Eventsin our history become equivalent to major turning points in screenplays, buthardly anyone on earth understands that there is a hidden intelligence directingall of this. The political events of the 1960s had many interesting connectionsto the Hero’s Journey story line—and they will take on even more significanceonce we see how they connect with similar political events in Rome.POLITICAL EVENTS FROM THE 1960S AND 1970S FIT THE HERO’S JOURNEY STORY LINEThe assassinations of JFK, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedycertainly qualified as dark nights of the soul or all-is-lost moments—and couldalso be classified as inciting incidents that sparked millions of new quests.The Beatles quickly rose to enormous popularity in America after their landmarkappearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964—less than three monthsafter John F. Kennedy was shot on November 22, 1963. America needed a new hero,and the teenage girls in the studio audience screamed and cried for the simplelove songs of the Beatles with unprecedented, ear-shattering volume. This wasthe most-watched event in television history for its time, drawing an estimated73 million viewers—but the Beatles songs were so new that most of the audiencemembers didn’t know the lyrics, as you can see in the original footage. This wasa major historical event that triggered a huge boom in the music industry knownas the “British Invasion.”The tears and “primal screaming” of the young women in the Beatles audiencehelped to purge the collective terror and sadness that Kennedy’s brutalassassination had caused less than three months earlier and that other difficultevents, including wars and political assassinations, would cause as well. Thiscathartic, ear-shattering screaming continued happening at every show andultimately caused the Beatles to retire from all public performances just twoand a half years after their landmark Ed Sullivan appearance—in August 1966.They no longer felt their shows were about the music and couldn’t even hearthemselves performing. They immediately began work on their groundbreaking Sgt.Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album in late November 1966.392[part0034.html#chapter013fn392] Paul McCartney, with a little help from JohnLennon, may have been trying to cheer up the crowds by writing a song with thechorus “It’s getting better all the time” on this album—and helped set the tonefor a positive future. George Harrison wrote “Within You, Without You,” whichhad a surprisingly deep spiritual message, including the idea thatlove—individually and collectively—could save the world. It was set totraditional Indian musical instruments and modern orchestra, further enhancingthe mystical feel of the song.When you’ve seen beyond yourself, then you may find peace of mind is waitingthere. And the time will come when you see we’re all One—and life flows onwithin you, and without you.393 [part0034.html#chapter013fn393]This music helped spark multiple revolutionary changes, but none quite sowidespread as the French student rebellion. However, the battle against thenemesis that seemed to have killed Kennedy was not yet over. The struggle becameeven more personal when the Vietnam War dramatically expanded under thepresidency of Richard Nixon in 1968. Now, hundreds of thousands of youngAmerican men were being drafted into the military to fight an apparent waragainst communism that no one really understood or supported. Nixon had runagainst Kennedy in the previous election and lost—and now Nixon was thefigurehead ordering every young man in America into the Vietnam death machine.Everyone suspected that “the government” killed Kennedy because he wouldn’tdance the way they wanted him to. The media was humiliated by supporting theridiculous idea of a single bullet that zinged around in several differentdirections and made right-angle turns, in a feeble attempt to explain howKennedy suffered two different gunshot wounds from completely different angles.This widespread public suspicion of a media cover-up could be seen as the magicgift—a talisman of embarrassing truth that would inspire the media to comeroaring back with a vengeance in their pursuit of the Watergate scandal.Five years after Kennedy was assassinated, tens of thousands of young Americanshad been sent to their deaths under the Nixon administration. Hundreds ofthousands more were traumatized with the horrors of war after being drafted intomilitary service against their will. Anyone unlucky enough to be betweeneighteen and thirty years old in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was in alife-and-death struggle against the ultimate nemesis in a way that teenagers ofthe 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s would never understand with the same degree ofimmediacy and passion. My father was one of them. He volunteered for the ArmyReserve in the hope of avoiding Vietnam but ended up having to go anyway. TheBeatles, who had originally served only as a convenient distraction in theaftermath of Kennedy’s assassination by writing simple, nonpolitical love songs,became genuine mentor figures. The Beatles songs were talismans that inspired asocial and spiritual revolution with titles like “All You Need Is Love,”“Getting Better,” “All Together Now,” “Here Comes the Sun,” “Revolution,” JohnLennon’s first solo single “Give Peace a Chance,” and John Lennon’s “Imagine.”In the Watergate scandal, journalists became heroes in the great story,revealing a key weakness in the nemesis that was sending young men to theirdeaths. Nixon’s Republican Party was secretly wiretapping the offices of theDemocrats, in order to listen in on their strategies to defeat them in theelection. This was a very real form of election rigging and revealed that theadministration was willing to lie, cheat, and steal to get what it wanted. TheWatergate scandal plunged America into a third act—where Americans could win amajor victory against their own nemesis. By this point, the dark night of thesoul had been worked through, and a practical way to fight the behemoth of theVietnam War was finally achieved. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison’s songsprovided the perfect soundtrack for this critical moment in the story. PresidentNixon was fully exposed, was threatened with impeachment, and ultimatelyresigned from office before his inevitable downfall occurred. On a deeper level,Watergate provided absolute proof that the government was lying and set inmotion a truth movement that has been growing ever since. Never again could theCabal rely on mass ignorance and a complacent lapdog media to cover up theiractions. The full outcome of this third-act struggle has not yet beenrealized—but again, these cycles can take many years to culminate.What very few of us have realized, until now, is that Roman wars and, in somecases, political events in the Age of Aries correspond precisely with Americanwars and political events—including the Watergate scandal—in the Age of Pisces.I wouldn’t be surprised if we find a popular movement in the Roman arts thatcorresponds very nicely with the Beatles, although I have not yet found aresource that is specific enough to conduct that research. However, theprecision with which Roman history reappears as twentieth-century Americanhistory in the next zodiac cycle, 2,160 years later, is nothing short ofdazzling—and it’s still working, as we will see in chapter 15 [part0025.html].Rome was clearly the biggest empire in the Age of Aries, and the United Statesbecame the sole superpower in the twentieth century, within the Age of Pisces.The Edgar Cayce readings revealed that most Americans are part of a “secondarygroup” of people who had previously incarnated in Rome. This same core group ofRomans apparently re-created their society, in a new form, and then experiencedthe same major historical events—again—in the hopes of creating a more favorableoutcome.SPECIFIC 2,160-YEAR OVERLAPS IN ROMAN AND AMERICAN HISTORYIn order to see the parallels between Roman and American history, we must seehow countries can become characters that oppose each other in the story, muchlike the hero opposes the nemesis. Prior to 264 B.C., Rome and Carthage werecomparable in size and strength as republics, which created a vigorous powerstruggle between them. Rome soundly defeated Carthage in the First Punic War,which raged from 264 to 241 B.C. This consolidated Rome’s status as an empire.Rome became the sole superpower of the day. As one historian wrote, “The PunicWars, the first of which began in 264 B.C., mark the beginning of a transitionof Rome the Republic into the Roman Empire.”394 [part0034.html#chapter013fn394]If we go 2,160 years into the future from this period, we have the years 1896 to1919 in the United States. Encyclopedia Britannica lists almost these exact sameyears—1896 to 1920—as part of the subheading “United States: Imperialism, theProgressive Era, and the Rise to World Power.”395[part0034.html#chapter013fn395]The First Punic War was an aggressive attempt by Rome to expand its power. And2,160 years later, in 1896, McKinley won the election and immediately began anaggressive expansion of US power. The United States became an imperialist nationas soon as McKinley was elected—just as Rome became an imperialist nation whenit attacked Carthage in 264 B.C.The USS Maine sank on February 15, 1898, creating an inciting incident thatcontributed to the start of the Spanish-American War. The United States quicklywon this war, which further expanded its imperial powers. The Spanish-AmericanWar was only one front in a much greater battle the United States was wagingagainst Europe in general, but particularly Germany—the other “big kid on theblock”—in its struggle to achieve global economic control. The Federal ReserveSystem consolidated US economic power in 1913, outsourcing the issuance ofAmerican currency to a small, highly powerful cabal of bankers, many of whomwere not US citizens. This allowed the United States to provide the raw powerthe Cabal needed in their battle for global financial control. America’seconomic war again became a military war when it entered World War I in 1917against Germany. The United States provided the critical support that led toGermany’s total defeat.We now have solid evidence that the Cabal financed both sides of World War I sothey would emerge victorious, regardless of which side won. This may havehappened in Roman history as well, between Rome and Carthage, though it wouldprobably be very difficult to find documentation to prove such a conspiracy forevents that happened well over two thousand years ago. Although a single cabalappears to have been playing both sides against the middle in World War I, thiscabal exploited real tensions that existed among the people. Their goal was toget the people angry and convince them that their own country’s alliance was thehero and the opposing country’s alliance was the nemesis. Then the people couldbe moved to support a major, bloody conflict once again, rather than seeingdiplomacy and negotiations as a viable road to peace.Again, just to review, the First Punic War against Carthage started in 264 B.C.Exactly 2,160 years later, McKinley transformed the United States into anaggressive, imperialist nation that declared economic war on Europe—andparticularly Germany. Rome’s first Punic War ended in 241 B.C. Exactly 2,160years later, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, ending World War I on June28, 1919. Article 231 of the treaty made Germany financially responsible for alldamages the war had caused in other countries. This ensured that Germany’sdefeat would be total. The Cabal stripped the German people of their wealth,diverting their resources into corporate contracts that would rebuild theindustries and infrastructure that had been destroyed by the war. Thesecontracts were made with corporations owned by the Cabal itself, thus ensuringthat the economic pillaging of the German people strengthened the Cabal’scorporate power even more. This economic disaster also created widespread fearand anger—which allowed for the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party.396[part0034.html#chapter013fn396]This looting strategy is one of many ways in which by 2011 the Federal Reservebanking cabal secretly had come to control 80 percent of all the money earned onearth—as revealed by Dr. Glattfelder’s team of scientists. America became thesupreme economic power in the world—just as Rome’s defeat of Carthage in 261B.C. drained the Carthaginians of their wealth and quickly transformed the RomanRepublic into the Roman Empire.THE SECOND PUNIC WARAccording to Masson, “The Second Punic War, the gravest and most dangerous forRome, started in 218 B.C. and ended in 201 B.C.” This war “brought Rome within ahairs-breadth of destruction.” This is an important point, as there is noguarantee that these aggressive, imperialist moves will actually succeed in anygiven cycle. The health of an entire country and its people is put at grave riskas these geopolitical chess games are being played out. Yet, just as Romenarrowly managed to achieve victory in the previous zodiac cycle, the UnitedStates accomplished a similarly difficult triumph in the Age of Pisces.The Second Punic War, which, again, started in 218 B.C., according to Helmer andMasson, was followed 2,160 years later by America’s entrance into World War IIin 1942. The Japanese created an inciting incident by bombing Pearl Harbor onDecember 7, 1941—just three weeks before the year 1942 began. America’s entranceinto World War II therefore came within months or even weeks of Rome’s entranceinto the Second Punic War in the previous zodiac cycle. The mystical power ofthe zodiac cycle again becomes clear. The “cycle equivalent” of Carthage in ourown Age of Pisces clearly appears to be Germany—and World War II again pittedthe United States (Rome) against Germany (Carthage). Rome was nearly defeated inthe Second Punic War—just as the United States was nearly defeated by Hitler andhis army of Nazis.HITLER WAS NOT THE FIRSTHitler: the most ruthless, aggressive military strategist of our time. The faceof pure evil. A compelling leader who roused the most lethally effectivemilitary campaign in the Age of Pisces. Is there anyone like Hitler in theearlier version of World War II—the Second Punic War in the Age of Aries?Yes. He is considered the greatest military strategist in history. His name alsostarts with an H. His name also shares the letters I and L with Hitler. He wasthe face of pure evil in the Age of Aries. He created naked, mass aggression ona scale never before seen on earth. His name was Hannibal. Just like the wordHitler in our time, the name Hannibal is synonymous with pure evil; ittranslates as “Ba’al is my lord”397 [part0034.html#chapter013fn397] or “With thegrace of Ba’al.”398 [part0034.html#chapter013fn398] In biblical Hebrew, Ba’al isthe equivalent of Satan—Ba’al zebhubh, or “Lord of the Flies” in Hebrew, becomesBeelzebub. Hannibal’s name proclaims Ba’al to be his lord, guiding his everyaction. Matthew Barnes, who earned a master’s degree from the InterdisciplinaryCenter in Herzliya, Israel, made a direct comparison between Carthage underHannibal and Germany under Hitler, having no conscious idea of their zodiaccycle connection:The First Punic War came to an end after twenty three years of bitter fightingon both land and at sea. As the victor, Rome became the dominant Mediterraneannaval power and Carthage suffered a humiliating defeat. Carthaginian expansionwas checked, their influence challenged and their pride severely damaged. It isfrom this background that Hannibal Barca, the son of Hamilcar Barca, a FirstPunic War general, came to the fore. Carthage after the First Punic War wascomparable to post World War One Germany, for a great power was beaten, humbled,reduced and forced to accept terms which whet the appetite for revenge. It couldbe argued that Carthage had been spoiling for a fight since the day of theirdefeat at the Battle of the Aegates Islands.399 [part0034.html#chapter013fn399]Hannibal raised a huge army with an estimated one hundred thousand men, and 37or 38 elephants.400 [part0034.html#chapter013fn400] He started his incrediblemarch in Spain, crossed the Rhône in France, and ordered the entire army throughthe Alps—in the wintertime—to attack Italy, Rome’s home country, from the north.This army was extremely powerful and destructive, and the use of large elephantsas an effective battle strategy puts one in mind of Hitler’s use of tanks.Hitler also mounted the Alps in his own war campaign. Hannibal attacked by landbecause Rome dominated the seas—as Matthew Barnes revealed in his research paperon the Second Punic War.The Second Punic War began in 218 B.C. under the auspices of the talented younggeneral Hannibal, whose deeds have gone down in history marking him as one ofthe greatest leaders of the ancient world. His plan was bold and aggressivebecause it consisted of a land war in which he would take the fight to his enemyin their own back garden. His march is legendary, but it was also necessary,because although an invasion by sea was infinitely more appealing, it was notpossible due to the new naval power reality post First Punic War. Hannibal’s warhad to be confined to land—and it was here that he showed his greatness, despitebeing born into a maritime power.401 [part0034.html#chapter013fn401]Another publicly stated insight into the connection between Hannibal and Hitlerappeared in a Daily Mail article from 2010. Since the historian the paper quotedis a Holocaust denier, let me be absolutely clear that I believe the Holocaustwas real, I have done my own research, and I do not believe thesecounterarguments are credible. The key here is that a very effective comparisoncan be made between Hitler and Hannibal and was featured in the Daily Mail in2010. Both of these men captivated the worlds they lived in with terrible warsof unprecedented scale—and both engaged in the fiercest aggression for sixyears: “Controversial British historian David Irving…who was once jailed inAustria for denying the Holocaust, also told tourists that the German dictatorshould be compared to Hannibal, the leader of Carthage that fought against andwho almost overpowered Rome. The historian said: ‘He was like Hannibal. He heldthe military forces of the rest of the world for six years. Exactly likeHannibal.’”402 [part0034.html#chapter013fn402]There was no turning back for Hannibal. Just like Hitler, it was win or die—aswe see in this quote from Hannibal and Me by Andreas Kluth.Conquer or die. Rarely in life are choices that stark. But Hannibal’s strategyhad brought him into exactly this situation. He had decided not to be a defenderbut an invader. From this point on, his dream, his quest, and his life dependedon one thing: winning. Projecting invincibility—not only to Rome but to Rome’senemies, and even more to Rome’s allies in Italy—was the premise of his entireplan…. Hannibal needed to win—and then to keep winning. If he lost only onemajor battle, his invasion would fail—and his army, unable to retreat, wouldalmost certainly be exterminated. So he really was like his Alpine prisoners. Hehad volunteered to win or die.403 [part0034.html#chapter013fn403]HIDDEN INTENTIONSI discovered the Hannibal-Hitler connection only at the very end of writing thisbook—by pure synchronicity. Despite how obvious it seemed to be in hindsight,Masson never mentioned this parallel in his book, and I still have not been ableto track down Helmer’s original research articles. I discovered theHitler-Hannibal connection by studying the zodiac cycle of 2,160 years,beginning in Hitler’s time. It started when I was researching Hitler’s use ofstaged terrorism, also known as “false flag” attacks. This is where a governmentattacks its own country and blames the attack on its enemy in order to justifyfurther aggression. After Hitler was defeated, his top generals and strategistsrevealed their actual plans for the first time during the Nuremberg trials—anunprecedented moment of truth. Thanks to Nuremberg, we found out about OperationHimmler—a revolting plan in which the Nazis created multiple fake,government-sponsored terrorist attacks against their own country.404[part0034.html#chapter013fn404] Concentration camp prisoners were dressed inPolish uniforms, given fatal injections by a doctor, and shot. Their bodies werethen positioned where each operation was staged.405[part0034.html#chapter013fn405] The Nazis would storm various buildings on theborder with Poland, scare the locals with inaccurate gunshots, vandalize thebuildings, and retreat, leaving the planted bodies in Polish uniforms behind.The most powerful attack under Operation Himmler was the Gleiwitz incident, whenHitler attacked his own top radio station and broadcast anti-German messagesthat appeared to originate from Poland, his main enemy. This and thirteen otherattacks all happened on the night of August 31, 1939, and became the incitingincident that started World War II in Europe.406 [part0034.html#chapter013fn406]Hitler used the Gleiwitz incident to declare war on Poland the very next day—asyou can read in his own words: “Recently in one night there were as many astwenty-one frontier incidents: last night there were fourteen, of which threewere quite serious. I have, therefore, resolved to speak to Poland in the samelanguage that Poland for months past has used toward us…. I will continue thisstruggle, no matter against whom, until the safety of the Reich and its rightsare secured.”407 [part0034.html#chapter013fn407]During the Nuremberg trials, we discovered that Hitler told the truth about whathe was doing, and why, to his generals on August 22, 1939: “I will provide apropagandistic casus belli. Its credibility doesn’t matter. The victor will notbe asked whether he told the truth.”408 [part0034.html#chapter013fn408]HANNIBAL’S RISE TO POWER WAS NOT SO DIFFERENTI subtracted 2,160 from 1939 and got 221 B.C. as the corresponding year. Iimmediately discovered that Hannibal became commander in chief of theCarthaginian army this same year—221 B.C.—after his brother-in-law Hasdrubal wasbrutally assassinated. Was Hannibal secretly responsible for this attack?Historian Chuck M. Sphar concluded that the answer is likely yes—and wrote aboutit in a novel he is developing called Against Rome: “Did Hannibal assassinateHasdrubal the Handsome, his predecessor as governor of Spain? There’s noevidence to suggest that he did, but Livy (1965, XXI, 1) and others do say thata Spanish native assassinated Hasdrubal (see Note 4), and given Hannibal’s verylikely impatience to be on with his work, it seems plausible that Hannibal couldhave given the native a push. Anyway, it makes for a good story, so I’ve usedit.”409 [part0034.html#chapter013fn409]Hannibal’s father, Hamilcar, was clearly a vicious man who traumatized Hannibalseverely enough to make him capable of committing mass atrocities. In oneinstance, Hannibal begged his father to take him along on an overseas war.Hamilcar grabbed his son, dragged him into a sacrificial chamber, and held himover a roaring fire, demanding that he swear he would never be a friend of Rome.In this gripping scene, with a tempest of orange flames beckoning his body toits doom, Hannibal—the servant of Ba’al—made his covenant: “I swear! So soon asage will permit…I will use fire and steel to arrest the destiny of Rome!”410[part0034.html#chapter013fn410]This type of trauma bonding can be very strong, and Hannibal must have beendevastated when his father later died in battle. Hannibal’s brother-in-law,Hasdrubal the Handsome, became commander of the Carthaginian army, with Hannibalserving as only an officer underneath him. Hasdrubal started working to formdiplomatic relationships with neighboring tribes in the hopes of consolidatingCarthage as a power. The turning point for Hannibal may have been the day hefound out that Hasdrubal signed a treaty with Rome, his father’s mortal enemy.Hasdrubal made a deal that Carthage would not expand north of the Ebro River aslong as Rome did not expand south of it. This was very different from whatHannibal had sworn to over the roaring flames. Hasdrubal was killed by a Spanishassassin almost as soon as he got to Italy to conduct even more negotiations,and his head was sent to Hannibal, who then became commander in chief.Once I realized Hitler and Hannibal both rose to power the same year andprobably used very similar means to get there, the story started comingtogether. Then I quickly looked up Hannibal to see his face. I was stunned.Hannibal was Hitler with a beard. The facial similarity was astonishing.Although this has not yet been done, Dr. Jim Tucker could easily use forensicfacial recognition software to establish their linkage. Given all the othersimilarities, including the length of their main military campaigns, I thoughtfor sure that someone must have already seen this, but an Internet search didnot turn up any other results.[../images/00020.jpeg]Fig. 11 [part0006.html#l11]: Carthaginian warlord Hannibal and Adolf Hitler.Notice stunning facial similarity to Hitler.Another curious synchronicity may suggest that Hannibal’s army also reincarnatedwith him—and remembered their past history on a subconscious level. Admiral KarlDönitz conducted one of the largest emergency evacuations in history as theSoviet army was bearing down on German soldiers and civilians in Courland, EastPrussia, and the Polish Corridor. Hitler had insisted that the war go on, rightup until his suicide, but Dönitz heroically realized it was too late. This massevacuation transported between eight hundred thousand and nine hundred thousandrefugees and 350,000 soldiers across the Baltic Sea to Germany and Denmark,which was still occupied by Germany—possibly saving more than a million lives inthe process.411 [part0034.html#chapter013fn411] The code name of this massevacuation was Operation Hannibal.412 [part0034.html#chapter013fn412]THE KOREAN WAR—AND A CHANCE FOR PEACEFUL COEXISTENCEThe zodiac cycle gets slightly harder to follow once we see that the SecondPunic War lasted until 201 B.C.—which is 1959 in our own Age of Pisces. Eventhough World War II seemingly ended in 1945 with Hitler and Japan’s defeat, theUnited States immediately began fighting another Cabal-financed superpower—theUSSR. The Cold War started directly after the end of World War II with thehighly deadly nuclear arms race, threatening all life on earth. Thissignificantly raised the stakes from the previous age, as no matter how muchRome attacked and defeated its neighbors, life on earth was never threatened inan overall sense.The war against the USSR went hot from 1950 to 1953, when the United Statesbattled the USSR’s hidden ally, North Korea, in the Korean War. The SovietCommunists were supporting North Korea, while the United States was supportingthe pro-Western regime of South Korea. The United States considered this a fightagainst global communism, and the threat of a much bigger war with the USSR orChina was always looming. Five million soldiers and civilians were killed inthis war.413 [part0034.html#chapter013fn413] The Cold War continued escalatingafter the Korean conflict ended in 1953, until a remarkable breakthrough finallyoccurred. On September 25, 1959, Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev visited theUnited States to meet with President Eisenhower. This highly influential visitoccurred exactly one zodiac cycle after the Second Punic War ended in 201 B.C.This was the first time in the entire history of the Cold War that a Sovietleader had visited the United States.As revealed on Politico.com, in this groundbreaking summit, Khrushchev“denounced the ‘excesses’ of [communist] Stalinism and said he sought ‘peacefulco-existence’ with the United States…. In a joint communiqué, issued after twodays of meetings, the leaders said…they believed that ‘the question of generaldisarmament is the most important one facing the world today.’”414[part0034.html#chapter013fn414] Although the talks didn’t last, this meeting wasa key harbinger of a positive future, as it presented the people with a realopportunity to end the war, and achieve true, lasting peace. Hardly anyone knew,at the time, that a very similar peace opportunity had occurred exactly 2,160years before, when the second Punic War had ended in 201 B.C.THE MACEDONIAN WARRome’s taste of peace was very short-lived, as the Macedonian War began the verynext year, in 200 B.C. Macedonia is a very small country just north ofGreece—and in our modern zodiac cycle, its equivalent may be Cuba. Throughreincarnation research, we may eventually find that many Cubans in the 1960swere also Macedonians in or around 200 B.C. In March of 1960, 2,160 years afterRome attacked Macedonia in 200 B.C., the United States drew up plans to attackCuba. The conflict between the United States and Cuba was another proxy warfought between the United States and the USSR. The Soviet Union had madeeconomic and trade agreements with Fidel Castro, the prime minister of Cuba, inFebruary 1960, and the United States felt the need to mount an immediatecounterattack.415 [part0034.html#chapter013fn415] Cuba was directly southeast ofthe continental United States, just ninety miles from the southern tip ofFlorida. This provided the USSR with a valuable strategic location from which towage war—including the potential placement of first-strike nuclear weapons thatwould hit before the United States could effectively counterattack.On May 1, 1960, the United States provocatively flew a U-2 spy plane overRussian airspace. The Soviets shot it down and captured the pilot, GaryPowers.416 [part0034.html#chapter013fn416] The Cold War immediatelyrestarted—precisely 2,160 years after Rome plunged into another war withMacedonia. Kennedy won the 1960 presidential election and was sworn in onJanuary 20, 1961. In February 1961, very soon after his inauguration, Kennedytrusted his new, Cold War veteran advisers and authorized the CIA’s plan toinvade Cuba. Air strikes began on April 14, 1961, in B-26 bombers disguised asCuban aircraft, but the planes were quickly identified as belonging to theUnited States.Kennedy was embarrassed and canceled the next round of air strikes, but the landinvasion went ahead on April 17, 1961, at the Bay of Pigs. Twenty thousand Cubantroops were waiting for the invading force of about fourteen hundred Cubanexiles who had been trained by the United States. The battle quickly ended with144 of the exiles killed and 1,189 captured. This was a great embarrassment forthe United States and immediately threw its fledgling president into full-scalecrisis.417 [part0034.html#chapter013fn417] In terms of the ancient story, thefailed Bay of Pigs invasion would be seen as another all-is-lost point for theUnited States—a nationwide dark night of the soul in its battle against theSoviet nemesis.Predictably, the USSR then began beefing up Cuba with weapons—including nukes.This caused the United States and USSR to come very close to full-scale nuclearwar during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which reached its peak on October 22, 1962.On this day, Kennedy addressed the nation to present solid evidence that theSoviets had positioned nuclear weapons in Cuba. This was a tense third-actmoment: The United States had regrouped, learned from the dark night of the soulin the Bay of Pigs disaster, and gained the strength to confront their ownSoviet nemesis through its proxy state in Cuba. Out of a total of 1,436 B-52bombers in the Strategic Air Command, fully one-eighth were sent airborne—to beready to strike at a moment’s notice.418 [part0034.html#chapter013fn418] USmilitary forces worldwide were placed at DEFCON 2, requiring an increase inforce readiness. Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52 bombers were placed in orbitwithin striking range of the Soviet Union as well.419[part0034.html#chapter013fn419]After a series of terrifying moves in a very high-stakes chess game, Khrushchevadmitted what the USSR had done and announced it would pull back as of October28. All offensive weapons in Cuba would be dismantled and returned to theUSSR.420 [part0034.html#chapter013fn420] This was a great triumph moment forKennedy and for America as a whole in the ancient Hero’s Journey story line, andthe dramatic events have triggered multiple movies, novels, and TV adaptations.The last US missiles were removed from Turkey on April 24, 1963, ending theconflict on both sides.421 [part0034.html#chapter013fn421] In Rome, the Battleof Cynoscephalae ended in 197 B.C.—exactly 2,160 years before the Cuban MissileCrisis ended. The Battle of Cynoscephalae was the decisive turning point thatled to Macedonia losing the war.It’s not always easy to figure out what our modern equivalents may be for thecountries against which Rome waged war. The Age of Pisces equivalent ofMacedonia appears to be Cuba, but the USSR was the real nemesis lurking behindthe scenes all along. It seems that the great cycles of history describe anoverall script of what types of events will happen, but various characters hereon earth will shift in and out of those roles, ultimately depending upon how thepeople in each cycle respond. And, of course, not all events fit perfectly intothese cycles. Multiple cycles can be intersecting and colliding at once,providing a push-pull of competing influences that we may not be able to map outwithout a great deal more information and computer power. Nonetheless, it isamazing to see how well the biggest events, and the most significant wars, allseem to reappear so precisely across the zodiac cycle.The Macedonian War did not actually end at the battle of Cynoscephalae; it endeda year later, in 196 B.C. Although Kennedy was assassinated on November 22,1963, Khrushchev was ousted on October 14, 1964—exactly 2,160 years after theMacedonian War finally ended for Rome.422 [part0034.html#chapter013fn422]Although Khrushchev appeared to have been secretly working to negotiate peacetreaties and alliances all along, he was still the primary figurehead for theUSSR in worldly terms.There may well be a vast wealth of other interlocking events that are notsignificant enough, in the Roman Empire, to be well documented as historicalevents—such as examples of music or theater that had as much of an effect as theBeatles would in the next cycle. There may well be a vast array of details thatare repeating with equally stunning precision. This may all seem very hard tofathom, since we are used to thinking of time as completely linear. However, ifwe begin envisioning time as cyclical, moving through circular loops that arecreated by the celestial energy fields we move through as a planet, it makesmore sense. Each time our planet reaches the same position in the circle, theevents from previous rounds are much more likely to bleed through into our ownreality—and repeat again."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENVIETNAM, WATERGATE, AND THE FALL OF THE IRON CURTAINRome went to war against Antiochus III in 192 B.C. Antiochus III was a king whoruled over Greater Syria and western Asia. Antiochus III invaded Greece with aten-thousand-man army, triggering the Roman-Syrian War, which raged from 192 to188 B.C. When we advance this same time period ahead by 2,160 years, we have1968 to 1972. This precisely corresponds to the key turning points of theVietnam War—which also was a war in Asia. The United States first began covertoperations in North Vietnam in 1964. On August 2, 1964, three North VietnamesePT boats fired on the USS Maddox. This led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, inwhich Lyndon Baines Johnson, Kennedy’s former vice president, gained permissionto wage war against North Vietnam without a congressional declaration.423[part0034.html#chapter014fn423] The United States began bombing North Vietnam in1965 while troop levels topped two hundred thousand. In 1967, Secretary ofDefense Robert McNamara said the bombing raids were not effective enough tosolve the problem and more needed to be done.Then, in January 1968—2,160 years after the Asian king Antiochus III invadedGreece with ten thousand men, plunging him into an all-out war with the RomanEmpire—North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces swept into South Vietnam. The Asianenemy attacked several cities, including the capital—similar to Antiochus’sattack on Greece in the Age of Aries. This bold and daring military maneuver wascalled the Tet Offensive. Though this attack was repelled, it was a politicaland psychological victory, causing great questions about whether the UnitedStates was involved enough in the war. General William Westmoreland requested adoubling of the troop presence in February, calling for an additional 206,000men. The idea of ordinary young men being drafted into military service suddenlybecame a very real and very terrifying prospect.Then, on March 16, 1968, American soldiers massacred hundreds of innocent peoplein the village of My Lai. In 1969, when the incident became public knowledge, itcaused shockwaves through the American political and military establishment aswell as the general public. The American people had an opportunity to demand theend of the war right there, but the political will was not yet strong enough.These three events—the Tet Offensive, the proposed doubling of the trooppresence, and the My Lai massacre—dramatically increased the emotional impact ofthe war. The number of young men being drafted suddenly skyrocketed. Again,these events all occurred in 1968—precisely 2,160 years after Rome went intofull-scale war against the Asian king Antiochus III in 192 B.C.A BITTER TASTE OF TREASON—SERVED ON A FIFTY-TWO-YEAR-OLD PLATTERFurthermore, on March 17, 2013, it was revealed that presidential candidateRichard M. Nixon had deliberately sabotaged peace talks with Vietnam that sameyear, 1968. I happened to find this article through synchronicity, while lookingfor other information on Nixon to help flesh out this part of the book. Thisincredibly treasonous story was covered by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, as well as inother media outlets, but I wouldn’t have found it if I hadn’t already beenlooking for links to Nixon and 1968. We now know that Nixon bribed theVietnamese with promises that they would get a much better peace deal if theyheld off until he became president. This shocking betrayal of the Americanpeople guaranteed that the deadly Vietnam War would grow much, much larger—andfar more profitable for the military-industrial complex. This treasonous secretdeal with the enemy provided fuel for much greater military power in Nixon’spresidency. President Eisenhower had warned America about the growing,potentially “disastrous” menace of the military-industrial complex in hisclosing address on January 17, 1961. Eisenhower was another mentor figure whogave America a magic gift in this speech, which could ultimately be used todefeat the nemesis: “In the councils of government, we must guard against theacquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by themilitary-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplacedpower exists—and will persist.”424 [part0034.html#chapter014fn424]The president at the time, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was aware of Nixon’streasonous deal but said nothing. Nixon thereby sentenced hundreds of thousandsof additional young men into the military draft, and tens of thousands moreAmerican soldiers into their deaths—when it was all entirely preventable. Theaudiotapes that proved Nixon did this were declassified by the LBJ PresidentialLibrary in 2013. The story was published literally the day before this chapterof the book was being revisited for its final publication for the first timesince 2010.425 [part0034.html#chapter014fn425]It is interesting that fifty-two years elapsed between Eisenhower’s propheticwarning in January 1961 and the final exposure of Nixon’s treason in 2013. TheMaya strongly believed that history moved in fifty-two-year cycles, which weremade up of four smaller cycles of thirteen years. People throughout Mesoamericacelebrated this “Sacred Round” cycle as “the Binding of the Years” and used itto help them understand past and future events.426[part0034.html#chapter014fn426] For example, the Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortésbegan destroying the Aztecs shortly after his initial, peaceful visit inNovember 1519—causing the Aztec prophecy of “nine hells” of fifty-two years tobegin.427 [part0034.html#chapter014fn427] Five “Sacred Round” cycles offifty-two years add up to the tzolkin cycle of 260 years, which was widelyrevered throughout Mesoamerica. Australian professor Robert Peden discoveredthat the 260-year tzolkin cycle is a perfect “common denominator” for all theorbits of the planets in our inner solar system.428[part0034.html#chapter014fn428] The period of 260 years is a subcycle thatdivides perfectly into the exact length of every orbit within the inner solarsystem. It is quite astonishing that the “primitive” cultures of Mesoamericawere somehow able to discover this number. They also constructed an estimatedthree hundred to five hundred pyramids out of huge stone blocks—which againsuggests they may have had access to advanced technology.THE END OF THE ROMAN-SYRIAN WAR AND THE END OF VIETNAMAccording to Helmer and Masson, Rome went to war with the Syrian king AntiochusIII in 192 B.C.; 2,160 years later, in 1968, the Vietnam War dramaticallyexpanded. (Remember that we now have absolute proof that Nixon bribed theVietnamese government to extend the war.) The Roman-Syrian War lasted fiveyears, finally ending in 188 B.C. If we advance 188 B.C. forward by 2,160 years,we arrive at 1972, which is the exact year that a cease-fire was negotiated byHenry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho.John Lennon’s song “Imagine,” released in September 1971, now seems oddlyprophetic as a foretelling of the defeat of the Cabal. In archetypal terms,“Imagine” was a harbinger of the Elixir of Immortality that would soon beseized—the promise of peace—once the dragon of the Cabal, and its military draftof ordinary young men, had been slain.I hope someday you’ll join us; and the world will live as One.429[part0034.html#chapter014fn429]The final peace treaty was signed with Vietnam and went into effect on January27, 1973. This led to the formal announcement of the end of the draft and thewithdrawal of the last American troops from Vietnam.THE SCIPIO AFRICANUS SCANDAL AND RICHARD NIXONIn 187 B.C., the year after the Roman-Syrian War ended, a scandal began brewingaround the Roman consul Scipio Africanus. It started when his brother Lucius wasprosecuted for hiding a payment of 500 talents he accepted from Rome’s mortalenemy, Antiochus III.430 [part0034.html#chapter014fn430] Within two years,Scipio himself stood trial on charges that he had accepted this payment fromAntiochus III as a bribe to end the war. The beginning of this scandal in 187B.C. corresponds to the year 1973 in the Age of Pisces. Why would ScipioAfricanus have accepted secret bribe payments from Rome’s apparent enemy? Whydid Nixon bribe the Vietnamese to extend the war by telling them they’d get abetter peace deal once he became president? Why did the Cabal finance both sidesof World Wars I and II—as the data clearly shows, if we are strong enough tolook at it? These actions are difficult, if not impossible, to understand untilwe remember that 1 percent of the people in our society are genuine sociopaths,who have no regard or respect for anyone outside their own elite circle. Whatmakes the Cabal so frightening for the average person is the idea thatsociopaths banded together to strengthen their power and have pursued long-termgoals that could stretch on for hundreds of years.The treasonous collusion between Scipio Africanus and Antiochus III may havegone much deeper than a bribe that Antiochus paid to end the war. If Nixon wasreplaying a series of events that occurred, in secret, in the previous zodiaccycle, then Antiochus may have agreed to invade Greece with ten thousand men inthe first place as part of a secret agreement he made with Scipio. In moderntimes, this could correspond to the secret agreement Richard Nixon made with theVietnamese to significantly intensify and prolong the war—exactly 2,160 yearsafter the Roman-Syrian War started.If an earlier version of the same Cabal was secretly financing both sides of theRoman-Syrian War, they were well aware that their wealth, power, and controlcould be consolidated by pulling the people into full-scale warfare. In thesetimes of great crisis, people will spend a lot more, lose their life savings tothe Cabal in an invasion, and give up their lives to fight for what they believeto be a higher purpose. Although the full, ugly details of treason may not havebeen provable, Scipio Africanus had now been caught in a critical lie. He andhis brother had accepted a payment of 500 talents from Antiochus III,431[part0034.html#chapter014fn431] ostensibly to end the war. This epic mistake mayhave been enough to trigger even more unsavory disclosures—possibly includingthe idea that wars were being deliberately engineered to plunder wealth from thepeople—but such information never came to light in the previous cycle.THE BIG THIRD-ACT RESOLUTIONThis trial was the big moment, the third-act resolution, in which the Romanpeople had been through the dark night of the soul, ended the war, and could nowdirectly face the nemesis—in this case their own leader—and defeat him. Scipio’sbrother Lucius was brought to trial in a grand public exhibition that captivatedthe republic. The court forced Lucius to produce his brother’s accounting books,which were being demanded as evidence. These financial documents were the“smoking gun” that would prove, at the very least, that Scipio had accepted abribe from Antiochus to end the war. It is entirely possible that othertreasonous payments, going even further back in time, might have been found aswell. According to the written historical record of Polybius, in anastonishingly brazen move that electrified the people of the Roman Republic,Scipio grabbed the books and tore them up in front of the entire coliseum.432[part0034.html#chapter014fn432] Everyone knew that this meant Scipio waspublicly admitting he was guilty, but he was too proud to say it. The Romanpeople may not have considered that other evidence might have been in Scipio’sfinancial books that would have been even more damning. Scipio left Rome andeffectively resigned three years after the scandal began, in 184 B.C., disgracedby the conspiracy, and his trial for what we would now call an impeachment wasdiscontinued.433 [part0034.html#chapter014fn433][../images/00021.jpeg]Fig. 12 [part0006.html#l12]: Emperor Scipio Africanus and President RichardNixonIf you know anything about late-twentieth-century American history, this storyis probably sounding very familiar by now. As Masson wrote, “2,160 years [afterScipio’s scandal began,] in 1973, it was the Watergate scandal that forcedNixon, who had honorably terminated the Vietnam War, to resign and retire to hisestate—just as Scipio had done 2,160 years earlier.”434[part0034.html#chapter014fn434] Given the science of reincarnation, as revealedby Dr. Ian Stevenson, Dr. Jim Tucker, the Edgar Cayce readings, the between-liferegressions of Dr. Michael Newton, and others, it is entirely possible thatScipio Africanus reincarnated as Richard Nixon in order to repeat these samecycles of karma once more. Scipio had been Hannibal’s archenemy in the SecondPunic War, and now it appears that he also reincarnated to fulfill a similardestiny. This time, Nixon would not walk away as easily as his predecessorScipio did in Rome. Nixon had to complete his own cycle of karma by being forcedto confess to his wrongdoing in a wild television interview. Journalist DavidFrost became the hero who aggressively bullied the fallen nemesis into admittingwhat he had done.This epic Hero’s Journey story was effectively adapted into Ron Howard’s 2008film Frost/Nixon,435 [part0034.html#chapter014fn435] which received AcademyAward nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, BestDirector, and Best Editing. Although this karmic loop may have taken 2,160 yearsto come full circle, if Nixon was Scipio, then this time he had to admit what hehad done to the public in much more detail. Further compelling evidence forreincarnation is in the remarkable facial similarities between Scipio and Nixon.Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker both provided extensive evidence that the“real” reincarnation cases feature strong face matches. Scipio and Nixondefinitely resemble each other—including the general shape of the nose, cheeksand chin, the bags under their eyes, and the “lazy eye” in the way they stare.Is it possible that this same soul reincarnated to again work out the sameissues it had created 2,160 years earlier, in a previous cycle of the zodiac? Ifso, Scipio really didn’t seem to learn very much and ended up playing the samerole he occupied in the Age of Aries. The on-air confession Nixon gave to DavidFrost in 1977 may have helped alleviate some of his karma, however.CATO, MEET CARTERAfter serving as Roman consul, Cato was elected to become the new “censor” ofRome in 184 B.C.436 [part0034.html#chapter014fn436] This was considered animportant position, as one key role of the “censor” was to guard the morality ofRome. 2,160 years later, in 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected president of theUnited States. You may have already noticed that there is an immediatesimilarity in their names—both start with the letters CA, and these two lettersare soon followed by a T. Cato came from a family of farmers, as did Carter.When Cato’s father died, Cato quit the armed forces and went back to cultivatehis land. Carter did exactly the same thing. According to Helmer and Masson’sresearch, Cato was the politician who demanded that Scipio and his brother turnover their records and accounts to the public, beginning in 187 B.C. 2,160 yearslater, there is no direct evidence that Carter, who was then the governor ofGeorgia, had any role in the Watergate scandal. However, Carter certainlybenefited from Nixon’s wrongdoing when he became president three years later.The public was hungry for a squeaky-clean, snow-white character who was theantithesis of Richard Nixon in every way—and they got one.[../images/00022.jpeg]Fig. 13 [part0006.html#l13]: President Jimmy Carter and Cato the CensorThere are remarkable and undeniable facial similarities between Cato and Carter.The structure of the nose and the shape of the ears are almost identical, andthere are strong similarities in the shape of the lips, cheeks, and chin. Catoput Rome through a period of censorship, during which he tried to restoremorality to the republic. Cato issued several decrees in an attempt to slow downthe greedy, overconsuming economic behavior and lifestyle of the Romans—and hiscensorship was so strict that he ultimately had to defend himself against 44different accusations and attempted prosecutions.437[part0034.html#chapter014fn437] 2,160 years later, Carter took very similaractions to rein in the overconsumption of energy in America. On February 2,1977, just two weeks after he took office, President Carter tried to encouragethe American public to keep the heat much lower in their homes—in the midst of avery cold winter: “All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keepingour thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees atnight we could save half the current shortage of natural gas.”438[part0034.html#chapter014fn438] Carter delivered this request while wearing athick cardigan sweater, which became a focal-point for the right-wing media tomock him.439 [part0034.html#chapter014fn439] Even in 2009, this speech was stillremembered as a historical event, though this writer did not give the correctyear it was delivered: “There’s another problem—the ghost of Jimmy Carter’ssweater haunting the discussion [of energy conservation]. During the 1979 energycrisis, Carter put on a cardigan, said the nation was suffering a “crisis ofconfidence,” and told everyone to turn the thermostat down in the winter. Savingenergy somehow became permanently associated with malaise and discomfort.”440[part0034.html#chapter014fn440] In this same 1977 speech, Carter announced hewas reducing the size of the White House staff by one-third, and recommended allhis cabinet members reduce their own private staff by the same amount. Carteralso said the following in his Report to the American People on Energy.We have eliminated some expensive and unnecessary luxuries, such as door-to-doorlimousine service for many top officials, including all members of the WhiteHouse staff. Government officials can’t be sensitive to your problems if we areliving like royalty here in Washington. While I am deeply grateful for the goodwishes that lie behind them, I would like to ask that people not send gifts tome or to my family or to anyone else who serves in my administration…. I’veasked the people appointed by me to high positions in Government to abide bystrict rules of financial disclosure and to avoid all conflicts of interest. Iintend to make those rules permanent.441 [part0034.html#chapter014fn441]Carter’s campaign to rein in American energy consumption continued when heraised taxes on big gas-guzzling cars442 [part0034.html#chapter014fn442] andinstalled a solar heating system on the roof of the White House.443[part0034.html#chapter014fn443]Cato became one of the most revered politicians in ancient Rome, and hecontinued to remain politically active until his death in 149 B.C., whichcorresponds to the year 2011 in our current Age of Pisces. Carter is still aliveand well in 2013 and has also remained highly politically active. Cato producedmany respected literary works, including a history of Rome in Latin.444[part0034.html#chapter014fn444] Carter has released twenty-seven books since hispresidency,445 [part0034.html#chapter014fn445] including Palestine: Peace NotApartheid446 [part0034.html#chapter014fn446] and a fictional novel about thehistory of America entitled The Hornet’s Nest: A Novel of the RevolutionaryWar.447 [part0034.html#chapter014fn447] Although Carter served only one term aspresident, leaving office in 1981, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002after multiple previous nominations. Here is a quote from the official Nobelwebsite on Carter’s award.[The Nobel Peace Prize was given for Carter’s] decades of untiring effort tofind peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy andhuman rights, and to promote economic and social development…. [He] has servedas an observer at countless elections all over the world. He has worked hard onmany fronts to fight tropical diseases and to bring about growth and progress indeveloping countries…. In a situation currently marked by threats of the use ofpower, Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must, as far aspossible, be resolved through mediation and international co-operation based oninternational law, respect for human rights, and economic development.448[part0034.html#chapter014fn448]THE FIRST CELTIBERIAN WAR AND THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, 1979 TO 1986After Cato’s election, the next significant event in Roman history was the firstCeltiberian war, in which Rome had to confront an uprising in its Spanishterritories. The First Celtiberian War began in 181 B.C.449[part0034.html#chapter014fn449] and initially ended in 179 B.C., but there was amajor Celtiberian revolt in 174 B.C., in which 15,000 Celtiberians were eitherkilled or taken prisoner;450 [part0034.html#chapter014fn450] 2,160 years later,this brings us to the time period of 1979 to 1986. François Masson finishedwriting his manuscript in 1979, so no further investigation could be done at thetime. I did not consider myself a historian, and when I published Masson’smanuscript on my website in 2000, it seemed like far too much work to try toexplore whether or not these cycles were still working. There was not enoughinformation uploaded to the Internet to mount an effective investigation at thetime.I soon forgot about it, got captivated by many other things, and never botheredto go back and check on the zodiac cycle connection between Rome and the UnitedStates any further. However, once I wrote the first draft of these chapters in2010, I realized that it was now or never and pursued that line of questioning.The volume of information that was available on the Internet had vastlyincreased in the preceding ten years, which made it much easier to do theresearch.Again, the first conflict with the Celtiberians stretched from 181 to the revoltin 174 B.C. This becomes 1979 to 1986 in the Age of Pisces. As it turned out,the United States fought another proxy war with the USSR during this exactperiod of time in Afghanistan. It appears that the people of Spain in the Age ofAries may have mass-reincarnated as the people of Afghanistan in the Age ofPisces. This new proxy war between the United States and USSR began in1979—right when Masson had expected it to.ANOTHER PROXY WAR WITH THE SOVIET UNIONAlthough the SALT II nuclear weapons treaty with the USSR was signed in June1979, President Carter signed a directive on July 3, 1979, that secretlyprovided aid to the people in Afghanistan who were fighting against their ownpro-Soviet government. According to Carter’s Cold War adviser ZbigniewBrzezinski, “We didn’t push the Russians to intervene, but we knowinglyincreased the probability that they would.”451 [part0034.html#chapter014fn451]Russia did indeed respond with shocking violence in less than six months.Russian paratroopers landed in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, on ChristmasDay, 1979. These Russian soldiers are now believed to have shot the president,Hafizullah Amin, two days later.452 [part0034.html#chapter014fn452] This was ablatant display of military power by the Soviet Union that created searing newgeopolitical tensions in 1979, the same year the Celtiberian war began in theAge of Aries. The United Nations condemned the invasion as early as January1980. The United States strongly opposed Russia’s sudden, violent presence inAfghanistan; banned the export of grain to Russia; ended the SALT talks; andboycotted the Olympic Games that were scheduled to be held in Moscow in 1980.According to Brzezinski, “Other than that, America did nothing. Why? They knewthat Russia had got itself into their own Vietnam.”453[part0034.html#chapter014fn453]Rome’s Celtiberian War ended in 174 B.C. If we move ahead 2,160 years after thisrelieving conclusion to the original war between Rome and its Spanishterritories, we have 1986. This exact year, 1986, was the decisive tipping pointinto defeat for the Soviet Union in its war for control of Afghanistan. TheUnited States had been fighting the proxy war the entire time by secretlytraining and supporting the resistance movement in Afghanistan to fight theSoviets—and in this case, the resistance prevailed. As of 1985, the CIA begantraining the Afghan resistance to use car bombs, assassinations, andcross-border raids into the USSR. Then, in 1986, the United States armed theresistance with hundreds of Stinger antiaircraft missiles. The United Statesalso donated another $600 million in aid and secured matching financing from thePersian Gulf states. China sold tanks, assault rifles, rocket-propelledgrenades, and other weapons to the Afghan resistance in 1986 as well. The USSR,realizing it had been defeated, began formulating an “exit strategy” this sameyear, 1986. The USSR began training the Afghan armed forces to fight the Afghanresistance on their own and built them up to an official strength of 302,000.454[part0034.html#chapter014fn454]ANOTHER FOILED PEACE OPPORTUNITYRussia’s glaring defeat in this proxy war with the United States also led to anopen attempt to make peace—and permanently end the Cold War. This made the year1986 an even stronger match with the end of the first Celtiberian War in 174B.C., during the previous zodiac cycle. On September 15, 1986, Gorbachev sent aletter to Reagan asking for “a quick one-on-one meeting, let us say in Icelandor in London,” to discuss the total abolition of all nuclear weapons. The summittook place in Reykjavik, Iceland, beginning on October 12, 1986.455[part0034.html#chapter014fn455] This presented the world with another phenomenalopportunity to defeat the Global Adversary and bring about true peace, but weweren’t quite ready for it yet. The Iran-Contra scandal soon erupted, forcingReagan’s key ally in the struggle for disarmament, National Security AdvisorJohn Poindexter, to resign.456 [part0034.html#chapter014fn456] This occurredafter Attorney General Edwin Meese III revealed that Poindexter knew that theprofits from selling arms to Iran were being covertly redistributed to aparamilitary group that was fighting socialism in Nicaragua, called theContras.457 [part0034.html#chapter014fn457]The US military soon “presented huge estimates of needed additional conventionalspending to make up for not having the [nuclear] missiles” if Gorbachev andReagan’s total ban on all nuclear weapons went through.458[part0034.html#chapter014fn458] In another signal that the entrenched Cabalbureaucrats had no intentions of going along with Reagan and Gorbachev’s treaty,the United States announced it was expelling all fifty-five US-based Sovietdiplomats on October 22, 1986.459 [part0034.html#chapter014fn459] The UnitedStates ordered all Soviet diplomats to leave by November 5, 1986.460[part0034.html#chapter014fn460]A NEW US-USSR PROXY WAR FROM 1988 TO 1992At this point in the Age of Aries, Rome again went to war with Macedonia from172 to 168 B.C. When we move this time window ahead by 2,160 years, we reach theperiod of 1988 to 1992 in the United States. At first I thought the parallelzodiac cycle timelines between Roman and American wars had finally broken downand failed—but I was wrong. I soon realized that another key phase of the proxywar between the United States and the USSR erupted during this exact timeframe.This time, it ended in the complete defeat and collapse of the USSR—right onschedule with the defeat of Macedonia in 168 B.C.We already learned that Rome’s previous war with Macedonia appeared in our ownAge of Pisces as a battle with the USSR through Cuba as a proxy state. Romebegan fighting Macedonia for the second time in 172 B.C. And 2,160 years after172 B.C.—on February 12, 1988—there was another direct confrontation between theUnited States and the USSR. Cuba was not a staging ground for the battle thistime, freeing it from its previous cycle connection to Macedonia. In this case,the two main adversaries faced off directly. The United States provoked the USSRonce more by sailing a known spy vessel, the USS Caron, into waters off theCrimean peninsula that were claimed by the USSR. History.com revealed that theUnited States was blatantly trying to start a fight by doing this: “In manyways, the incident was an unnecessarily provocative action by the UnitedStates…. The Caron was well known as an intelligence gathering vessel, and itsappearance in waters claimed by the Soviets would be seen as suspicious atbest.”461 [part0034.html#chapter014fn461]The USSR responded by aggressively ramming its ships into the USS Caron and theUSS Yorktown, which was nearby. History.com revealed that this panicked move wasa sign that the “wounded lion” of the USSR was still quite capable of lashingout at its enemies. “For their part, the Soviets probably overreacted. Perhapsthe Soviet military felt a message should be sent that Russia, which wasexperiencing severe economic and political problems, was still a nation to betaken seriously as a major military power.”462 [part0034.html#chapter014fn462]AFGHANISTAN PROXY WAR CONTINUES UNTIL 1992Despite this new provocation, the USSR signed a pact to leave Afghanistancompletely, after nine years of occupation, on April 14, 1988. The GeorgetownUniversity Institute for the Study of Diplomacy’s “US and Soviet Proxy War inAfghanistan, 1989–1992” revealed that the United States and the Soviet Union didnot stop providing military support to their respective allies in Afghanistanuntil four years later, in 1992—which was the same year the Second MacedonianWar ended in the Age of Aries. The United States’ CIA had financed and trainedthe resistance in Afghanistan to conduct car bombings and terrorism inAfghanistan since 1985. This US-backed resistance was a nefarious,ultrafundamentalist Islamic group known as the Taliban. Documents recovered in2011 proved there was a “close working relationship” between Osama bin Laden’sgroup and the Taliban—including a “very considerable degree of ideologicalconvergence.”463 [part0034.html#chapter014fn463] The American corporate mediaalmost completely ignored this previous US support of the Taliban in theaftermath of 9/11. The 2,160-year zodiac cycle continued to influence ourhistory during this time. The Georgetown University article clearly reveals thatthe US-Soviet proxy war did finally end in 1992—which synchronized with theending of the Second Macedonian War in 168 B.C.:The official Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan was by no means the end of theinternecine struggle for power between the US and Soviets in that country. Bothsuperpowers would continue to arm and aid their proxies in the Afghan conflictuntil late 1991, even while the Soviet Union itself was collapsing. After the USand the Soviet Union ended all military support to Afghanistan in 1992, thecountry was left to cope with groups of highly trained, organized and equippedfactions—who engaged in what rapidly devolved into civil war.464[part0034.html#chapter014fn464]THE FALL OF THE IRON CURTAIN—RIGHT ON TIMERome prevailed against its own nemesis when it defeated Macedonia in 168 B.C.This was within months of when the Soviet Union collapsed in the Age of Pisces.A coup attempt was organized against Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev on August19, 1991, where tanks formed a blockade around the Kremlin.465[part0034.html#chapter014fn465] I watched this in amazement on a televisionscreen in the Hasbrouck Dining Hall during my college orientation—and I willnever forget how bored, disinterested, and utterly oblivious the teenagersaround me were as this stunning event was occurring. I seemed to be the only onewho was even bothering to watch as tanks advanced on the Kremlin—the central,beating heart of the United States’ number-one nuclear nemesis—on livetelevision. This coup attempt soon failed, due to poor planning.466[part0034.html#chapter014fn466] Nonetheless, it was the culmination of awidespread dissatisfaction with the communist system, and an ongoing crumblingof the USSR. Russian states began declaring their independence in 1989,beginning with Azerbaijan, and the remaining states all followed in 1990.467[part0034.html#chapter014fn467] However, the USSR didn’t fully collapse untilshortly after the attempted coup in 1991. Gorbachev resigned as president onDecember 25, 1991468 [part0034.html#chapter014fn468]—just seven days beforeJanuary 1, 1992. Macedonia fell to Rome in 168 B.C.—precisely 2,160 yearsearlier. The zodiac cycle had remained remarkably active after more than twomillennia.FRANÇOIS MASSON MADE AN ACCURATE PROPHECYIn his original 1980 book, Masson could see this trouble coming well inadvance—and he issued the following prophetic statement: “This second MacedonianWar could correspond cyclically to 1988–1992, when a direct USA-USSRconfrontation would take place—as during the Cuban affair of 1962. Consideringthe means of total destruction available on both sides, modern wars are usuallywaged through buffer states, and are played out like a chess game—as with Cubain 1962. Let us pray that it will be similar this time, and that mankind willnot rush into mutual suicide.”469 [part0034.html#chapter014fn469]Masson’s prophecy was absolutely correct. This time, the “buffer state” betweenthe United States and the USSR was Afghanistan. The USSR lost the chess game andwas balkanized into a group of nation-states. The United States trained,financed, and armed its next great nemesis—Osama bin Laden and the Taliban—inthe process of fighting the USSR.SEPTEMBER 11, 2001: A PERFECT MATCH WITH THE 539-YEAR QUARTER CYCLEBy now, you must be wondering about September 11, 2001—the next major act of warin US history after the proxy war with the Soviet Union in Afghanistan ended in1992. Is there any corresponding event in the zodiac cycle for Rome that was assignificant as 9/11? Apparently not. The year 2001 corresponds to 159 B.C. inthe Age of Aries. There are no identifiable Roman wars or noteworthy historicalevents that occurred in 159 B.C., other than the invention of the first waterclock. However, when I went back to Masson’s original data, I found that the539-year quarter-cycle dramatically reappeared on 9/11—literally within days ofwhen an epic European battle occurred in the year 1462. Once this connection wasfound, many other parallel events soon lined up with astonishing precisionacross the 539-year quarter cycle as well.This stunning new data gave further support to the 539-year cycle connectionbetween Joan of Arc’s historic battle in 1429 and the 8-million-strong Frenchyouth revolution of 1968. Helmer and Masson were right. We must completelyrewrite our entire cosmology of the universe—and begin seriously considering theevidence that the cosmos is alive. Moons, planets, stars, and galaxies can nowbe seen as vast mega-life-forms in their own right—and are exerting powerfulinfluences on all life around them. They appear to be intelligently guiding usthrough the Hero’s Journey archetypes on an individual and collective scale.These cycles of wars and atrocities will keep repeating until we master thelessons they provide—namely the forgiveness and acceptance of others.I was quite surprised to discover that such a shocking, memorable,world-changing event as 9/11 wasn’t random at all. The country that played thenemesis in 1462 was Germany. Although it’s tempting to get into the specificdetails right now, we need to finish our investigation of the zodiac cycleconnections between Rome and the United States first—to see how the cycle hascontinued operating from 1992 through to the time of this writing in 2013."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENTHE SKY IS NOT FALLING—ONLY OUR BLINDFOLDS AREJoan of Arc’s epic visions compelled the people of France to put her in chargeof an entire army. Her bravery soon inspired her country to rise up against theBritish Empire—and win. Exactly 539 years later, almost to the day, a studentrebellion in France inspired 8 million workers to rise up against theirhyperconservative government—and win. This stunning synchronicity was predictedfour years in advance by French astrologer Michèl Helmer. Additionally, majorwars in Roman history reappear in American history 2,160 years later in the Ageof Pisces, beginning with the imperial aggression of President McKinley againstEuropean powers in 1896. Political conspiracies like the Watergate scandal areprecisely mirrored in Roman history, when Scipio Africanus was accused ofaccepting bribes from the enemy to end the war. Even the two principal consulsin the Roman stories—Scipio and Cato—appear to have reincarnated as PresidentsNixon and Carter. Despite the seemingly vast 2,160-year gap of linear timeseparating these events, we still see high-quality matches in the facialfeatures of these modern presidents and their Roman counterparts, just as Dr.Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker’s scientific research suggested will happen ingenuine reincarnation cases. This may be only one of many other examples thatcan be found synchronized by the great cycles of time. Each one of us may beliving through a series of very specific experiences, repeating what we’ve gonethrough in other lifetimes until we master the lessons. The units of timebetween what we are doing now and what we did before appear to be extremelyprecise. There is no reason to assume these cycles work only on large-scalegeopolitical events.The “ideal” precession-of-the-equinoxes cycle features twelve of these Ages ofthe Zodiac—which add up to 25,920 years. Worldwide myths associated this “mastercycle” with the coming of a Golden Age, which they say is literally paradise onearth. At the time of this writing, I found one quote from François Masson’sfinal, published English version of The End of Our Era online—in a Facebook postfrom June 6, 2011—and it is very relevant:“Aside from all prophetic speculation, one thing is definite: our precessionalentrance into the sign of Aquarius. This motion is mathematically regular—andthe cyclic repetition of religious changes accompanying each zodiacal transitionis undeniable. Whatever else may happen during this time that is upon us, afundamental religious and ideological change is bound to occur.”470[part0034.html#chapter015fn470]A GRAND, COMPASSIONATE DESIGNNow that we have passed the Mayan calendar end date of December 21, 2012, wehave crossed over into the Age of Aquarius, as I argued in The Source FieldInvestigations. This massive change, propelling us into a Golden Age, hasalready begun—and will undoubtedly get more and more interesting as time goesby. We can clearly see that the 25,920-year “master cycle” is much more than aslow, boring wobble in the earth’s axis. Instead, it seems to represent amechanism that is written into the mind of our galaxy and all its stars,planets, and satellites. This grand cycle appears to work like the mainspring ina cosmic clock. It powers our evolutionary path and our events in historythrough the Hero’s Journey archetypes in nice, neat cycles of time. In Law ofOne terms, this grand story was carefully planned out, long before we ever gothere, as the “preferred method” to help us awaken to the basic need to love oneanother—regardless of race, color, religion, gender, or nationality. We keeprepeating the same events and the same atrocities, until we no longer choose tocreate them. Once we finally decide not to discriminate against one another, anddecide to strive for a better world, peace and freedom will finally be ours forthe taking—and we will enter into an unprecedented Golden Age.We can be much more confident that everything is going to work out once weunderstand that the most distressing wars and political events are not random.There is a grand, compassionate design to the workings of history that unfoldbefore us. As a collective consciousness, this appears to be the method by whichwe are ultimately prepared for a whole new way of thinking, acting, and being.Our living universe is not sadistic. We are not meant to simply keep sufferingthe same wars and atrocities, right on schedule, as if this were some form ofongoing, ritual torture. We do have free will, and this means we do meet up withwhatever we create. As we grow and evolve, the histories of our nations canincreasingly detach from negative timelines and gravitate toward other,healthier cycles the earth has to offer us. We may even experience an epic,worldwide curtain call—the ultimate piercing of the veil. In that case, thewhole mechanism and its hidden players, both positive and negative, may finallybe revealed, and we will enter into an entirely new structure of time itself.This is where the dance of free will comes in. What channel of the greatest showon earth are we collectively deciding to watch? What future are we voting for bythe thoughts and actions we take each moment?SMART ENOUGH NOT TO TAKE THE BAITI was very relieved to discover that the United States appears to beincreasingly pulling away from the Roman wars that occurred in the Age of Aries.The potential triggers were still offered to the public, right on schedule, butwe finally got smart enough not to take the bait. Masson believed that theperiod from 1988 to 1992 could be as dangerous as the Cuban Missile Crisisnuclear showdown, if not more so—but the proxy war with the USSR in Afghanistandid not turn into a world nuclear Armageddon.We also saw the original, short-lived Gulf War in Iraq, known as Desert Storm,in the key risk period of 1988 to 1992. This war began on August 2, 1990, whenSaddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Aerial bombardment of Iraq began on January 17,1991. Iraq declared a cease-fire only one hundred hours after the February 24,1991, start of the ground campaign.471 [part0034.html#chapter015fn471] Althoughmany people died in the bombardment, Desert Storm was nowhere near the globaldisaster that Masson had feared it could have been if the zodiac cycle hadexerted the full force of seemingly ancient Roman wars upon the destiny of theUnited States. I graduated from high school in 1991, and that was also the lastyear I watched television on a regular basis. Since there was no Internet backthen, I quickly made friends with books, because every time I turned on thetelevision during the Gulf War, attractive female newscasters and unsmiling maleanchors were interviewing “experts” who insisted the entire Middle East wasabout to light up like a huge, fiery cauldron of violence. Everyone was afraidthat World War III was about to begin, fulfilling biblical prophecy—but theother Middle Eastern countries never took the bait. After all this time, theyfinally broke the old pattern and realized that the nemesis was trying toprovoke them into having a violent reaction, in order to cause much greaterharm—with vastly superior weapons.AMERICAN HEROES BLOCK “BIBLICAL ARMAGEDDON” IN 2006As we learned in the previous chapter, the period 1988 to 1992 in the Age ofPisces corresponds to Rome’s second war with Macedonia—from 172 to 168 B.C.—inthe Age of Aries. The next significant event was Rome’s war againstLusitania—beginning in 154 B.C. When we look 2,160 years into the future, thisbrings us to the year 2006. Although it may seem, at first, that nothingsignificant happened in 2006, we did actually come very close to a disastrouswar that same year. On March 16, 2006, the United States formally declared waragainst Iran. The declaration appeared in that day’s National Security Strategyannouncement: “We may face no greater challenge from a single country than fromIran…. When the consequences of an attack with WMD are potentially sodevastating, we cannot afford to stand idly by as grave dangers materialize.”472[part0034.html#chapter015fn472]This declaration also made it clear that the United States would use nuclearweapons to fight this conflict.473 [part0034.html#chapter015fn473] This was veryserious, and it appeared that a nuclear first strike against Iran was imminent.The Cabal wanted their biblical Armageddon as soon as possible. Thankfully,people in key positions rose to stop the cycle of violence from playing out asit had in Rome during the Age of Aries. John Negroponte, the director ofnational intelligence, became the hero who directly confronted the nemesis whenhe told the press in April 2006 that it would be “a number of years off” beforeIran would be “likely to have enough fissile material to assemble into or to putinto a nuclear weapon—perhaps into the next decade.”474[part0034.html#chapter015fn474]A National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) that made the same conclusions about Iranwas held up for more than a year by the Bush administration. It was finallyreleased on December 4, 2007: “We judge that in fall 2003, Tehran halted itsnuclear weapons program…. Tehran has not restarted its nuclear weapons programas of mid-2007…. We judge with high confidence that Iran will not be technicallycapable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for a weapon before about2015.”475 [part0034.html#chapter015fn475]The very beginning of this groundbreaking report said, “This NIE does not assumethat Iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons.”476[part0034.html#chapter015fn476] The words does not were italicized in theoriginal document. As of this writing in 2013, it’s now been seven years sinceRome started fighting the Lusitanian War in the previous zodiac cycle, duringthe Age of Aries—but we still haven’t seen any overt aggression toward Iran. Norare there any other major new wars. The United States does still maintain apresence in Afghanistan but has now largely pulled out of Iraq. I was quiterelieved to discover that the old cycles finally appear to be breaking down. Ifforgiveness is the key that will stop the Wheel of Karma from spinning, then itappears we are finally learning to love and accept one another. The nemesis cancontinue to harm us only if we fail to learn the lessons of forgiveness—andaccept the temptation to turn against one another.WE CAN CHANGE THE OUTCOMEIt is very important to remember that we can change the outcome in these cycles.We are not trapped—and we do not need to keep repeating the same wars andatrocities again and again. As we learned earlier, we now have direct scientificproof that a small group of people can have a major effect on the behavior ofthe entire planet for the positive. Specifically, a group of seven thousandordinary people was able to reduce worldwide terrorism by 72 percent—simply bymeditating. They had similarly powerful effects in stopping wars, violentoutbreaks, and loss of life.477 [part0034.html#chapter015fn477] Fifty differentscientific studies have validated this meditation effect. This proves that thecycles are not fixed. Wars will not keep repeating, right on schedule. We canchange the outcome. The lesson is that if enough of us begin practicing peace inour lives, the ancient story finally achieves its purpose in bringing all of usface-to-face with the nemesis, so we can integrate our ego and learn not toblame one another for our feelings of pain, fear, and anger. We can finallymaster the lessons this pattern of archetypes is teaching us—and stop projectingour shadow onto others by making them into our nemeses.We may then experience a stunning, worldwide curtain call, such as in a fullbreakdown of government, media, and financial secrecy. Based on the testimoniesof multiple high-ranking witnesses I have personally interviewed, once the Cabalis fully exposed on the world stage, this will quickly lead to a disclosure ofthe advanced human relatives who have been assisting us—and were seen as gods inevery ancient culture on earth. These people have been here all along but appearto have largely stepped behind the curtain since the rise of Islam in the 700s,in order to allow us to become a modern society. Because they remain shieldedfrom public view, each person has the freedom to accept or reject the idea oftheir presence. This premise of free will is very important in the Law of Oneseries, but once we shift into fourth density, at the end of thetwenty-five-thousand-year cycle, everything changes. Apparently, as we settleinto this new reality, we will graduate into an entirely new time structure withsurprisingly different rules.I have often said that if reincarnation has been proven to be a scientific fact,how can we assume that we will just keep coming back and repeating the samelessons, lifetime after lifetime? Isn’t there a point at which we learn thegreatest teachings of the Hero’s Journey—and are now ready to step into a higherlevel of our own human evolution?THE FEDERAL RESERVE: THE HEART OF THE CABALMichèl Helmer did not detect a cyclical connection between the Roman Empire andthe United States before 1896. This was the year that big-business bankers beganseeing their plans realized with the election of the imperialist presidentMcKinley. Under McKinley’s reign, the Cabal soon began an unprecedentedexpansion of its power, using the United States as its new staging area. Aftermany years of planning, the big bankers—such as the Rockefeller–Standard Oildynasty in America and the Rothschild banking dynasty in Europe—pooled theirresources to create the Federal Reserve in 1913. The creation of the FederalReserve effectively overthrew the US Constitution. Harry V. Martin published thefollowing research online in 1995, before so many others discovered the samefacts. Now, even the corporate media is increasingly beginning to discuss thishidden truth. The number of people who know the real story of the FederalReserve has skyrocketed since I first began researching this mystery in 1992.According to Martin, “Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 of the United StatesConstitution provides that Congress shall have the power to coin money andregulate the value thereof, and of any foreign coins. But that is not the case.The United States government has no power to issue money, control the flow ofmoney, or to even distribute it. That belongs to a private corporation,registered in the State of Delaware—the Federal Reserve Bank.”478[part0034.html#chapter015fn478]Senator Ron Paul uttered the following words in a landmark Congressional speechfrom 2002. Ron Paul definitely seems to fulfill the wise old man archetype inour story, giving us the magic gift of knowledge that we still haven’t fullyutilized against our global nemesis.Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, middle and working-class Americanshave been victimized by a boom-and-bust monetary policy. In addition, mostAmericans have suffered a steadily eroding purchasing power because of theFederal Reserve’s inflationary policies. This represents a real, if hidden, taximposed on the American people.From the Great Depression, to the stagflation of the seventies, to the burst ofthe dotcom bubble last year, every economic downturn suffered by the countryover the last 80 years can be traced to Federal Reserve policy. The Fed hasfollowed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money, leading toa misallocation of resources and an artificial “boom” followed by a recession ordepression when the Fed-created bubble bursts.With a stable currency, American exporters will no longer be held hostage to anerratic monetary policy. Stabilizing the currency will also give Americans newincentives to save, as they will no longer have to fear inflation eroding theirsavings.479 [part0034.html#chapter015fn479]THE CABAL’S SECRET SUPPORT OF NAZI GERMANYIn 2007, the BBC revealed that George W. Bush’s own grandfather Prescott Bushwas directly involved in a business plot to overthrow the US government andinstall a fascist regime in 1933. Unless you regularly read “truth media,”you’ve probably never heard of this story before. Even though the BBC calledattention to it, corporate media haven’t gone anywhere near this explosive storyat the time of this writing. Prescott Bush’s goal was not to create a governmentthat would embrace the conservative Christian values his son George H. W. Bushand grandson George W. Bush would later publicly claim to promote. Instead,Prescott wanted to install a fascist government—patterned off Adolf Hitler’sblueprint—to beat the Depression. This is a very different view of history thanthe one most of us grew up with, of course—considering that George H. W. Bushwas vice president from 1980 to 1988 and president from 1988 to 1992, and hisson George W. Bush was president from 2000 to 2008. Fully twenty out of thetwenty-eight years from 1980 to 2008 featured a Bush as either president or vicepresident of the United States. Let’s not forget that Germany was a Christiannation throughout Hitler’s entire rule. Mussolini also rose to power as afascist dictator in Italy—and Italy has always been the seat of the Vatican andthe former home of the Roman Empire.At the time of this writing in March 2013, there is still no one in themainstream media who has been willing to touch this story. The BBC never evenpublished a full article about it, but they have steadfastly maintained the pagethat links to the radio program—along with a synopsis of what the show reveals.Here is the text we find on this surprising page.Document [the radio program] uncovers details of a planned coup in the USA in1933—by right-wing American businessmen. The coup was aimed at topplingPresident Franklin D Roosevelt—with the help of half-a-million war veterans. Theplotters, who were alleged to involve some of the most famous families inAmerica, (owners of Heinz, Birds Eye, Goodtea, Maxwell Hse & George Bush’sGrandfather, Prescott) believed that their country should adopt the policies ofHitler and Mussolini to beat the great depression. Mike Thomson investigates whyso little is known about this biggest-ever peacetime threat to Americandemocracy.480 [part0034.html#chapter015fn480]Granted, the true evils of Hitler were not yet obvious in 1933, but remember, acoup is hardly a minor squabble. These wealthy Cabal bankers and businessmenwanted to engineer the bloody overthrow of the legally elected constitutionalgovernment of the United States. Their plan called for inspiring half a millionWorld War I veterans to get angry enough against their government that theywould rise and do the job themselves.THE PLOT THICKENSAnother mainstream British newspaper, The Guardian, revealed that thisuncomfortable story most definitely did not end in 1933; in fact, it seemed toget even worse.George Bush’s grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director andshareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the financialbackers of Nazi Germany…. Remarkably, little of Bush’s dealings with Germany hasreceived public scrutiny, partly because of the secret status of thedocumentation involving him…. John Loftus…a former US attorney who prosecutedNazi war criminals in the 70s…, [said,] “You can’t blame Bush for what hisgrandfather did any more than you can blame Jack Kennedy for what his fatherdid—bought Nazi stocks—but what is important is the cover-up, how it could havegone on so successfully for half a century, and does that have implications forus today?”481 [part0034.html#chapter015fn481]Exactly how far did this treasonous American involvement in helping the NaziParty really go? Could the Nazi Party have fulfilled its objectives before andduring World War II without the help of the Cabal businessmen? Former USattorney John Loftus, who we just learned had prosecuted Nazi war criminals inthe 1970s, spelled out the importance of American corporate assistance to NaziGermany when he spoke to The Guardian:This was the mechanism by which Hitler was funded to come to power. This was themechanism by which the Third Reich’s defence industry was re-armed. This was themechanism by which Nazi profits were repatriated back to the American owners.This was the mechanism by which investigations into the financial laundering ofthe Third Reich were blunted…There is no one left alive who could be prosecuted, but they did get away withit…. As a former federal prosecutor, I would make a case for Prescott Bush, hisfather-in-law (George Walker) and Averill Harriman [to be prosecuted] for givingaid and comfort to the enemy. They remained on the boards of these companies,knowing that they were of financial benefit to the nation of Germany.482[part0034.html#chapter015fn482]THIS IS NOT ABOUT DOOM AND GLOOMWhen we refuse to look at our problems, they only get worse. This applies on thecollective level as well as the personal. As I said before, the Sheep Effect canbe very strong—and you may even feel physically sick as you read this. I dobelieve that in the fullness of time, everyone will know that Nazi Germany wasonly one visible form of a much larger Cabal—which was far more pervasive thanwe thought. However, when the denial finally breaks, we often rush to theopposite extreme. Almost everyone who writes about these “conspiracy theories”on the Internet has a fatalistic, doom-and-gloom attitude about it. They see theCabal as random, violent, and unpredictable and believe it may well achievetotal victory. Until now, hardly anyone was aware that the timeline of theUnited States synchronized with the timeline of the Roman Empire in the Age ofAries, after an aggressive expansion of power in 1896—which set the stage forthe creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913. This allowed private bankers, manyof whom are not even US citizens, to manipulate the world’s economy bycontrolling the US dollar.Once you are armed with this knowledge of how the cycles work, history doesn’tseem so random anymore. The sinking of the USS Maine. The Spanish-American War.World War I. The defeat of Germany at the Treaty of Versailles. The bombing ofPearl Harbor and America’s entrance into World War II. Khrushchev’s visit to theUnited States in 1959, seeking peace. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Vietnam War.Watergate. The Soviet war in Afghanistan. Gorbachev’s attempt at nucleardisarmament in 1986, signaling Soviet defeat. The US invasion of Soviet waterswith a spy ship in 1988. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Gulf Warin 1991. And a formal declaration of war against Iran, with an intent to usenuclear weapons, in 2006—which was blocked by heroes within the US government.It’s all a big story. Movies give us a condensed, satisfying version of theWheel of Karma. It requires much more patience for us to cycle through it on theglobal stage. But as we see the great story retold, we are reminded—on a soullevel—of its triumphant conclusion.The same patterns will keep repeating themselves, right on schedule, until weawaken, on a worldwide basis, and begin using our power to change the outcome.The more we focus on thoughts of love, peace, and progressive change, the morewe make our hopes and dreams come true. We now have the proof that this reallyworks; all we really need is the collective will for change. If our electedleaders do not reflect that will, it ultimately doesn’t matter. History willalign with our true level of spiritual progress—one way or another. Existingentrenched power structures will be exposed and uprooted so that we will not bedamaged by them.It appears that the story is finally working to awaken the American people, sothey no longer have to play out all the tragic events of Roman history in thesame fashion. This time around, the people did not support the aggressive,imperialistic policies they were being presented with by the media. Neither theAmerican people nor those who were being goaded into taking on the role of thenemesis took the bait. The wars became increasingly less severe than they hadbeen in Roman history, even though they still came and went, right on time, inthe next zodiac cycle. Thankfully, the next major war, scheduled for 2006 in thezodiac cycle, never happened. This was a concrete signal that America hadfinally jumped off of the Wheel of Karma through the forgiveness of those it hadonce seen as faceless foreign enemies.LET’S TAKE AN HONEST LOOKAs we head deeper into an explanation of why the zodiac cycle may have finallybroken down within modern-day America, please bear in mind that I have noproblem with anyone who follows a conservative Christian mind-set. I also feelthere is nothing wrong with gathering your own information and deciding on whatyou feel is truth. I certainly do not want any of these ideas I present to beseen as a religion or a dogma; we have more than enough of those already. Thisis simply a philosophical and scientific viewpoint, and if you don’t agree withit, then you should feel free to reject it.It does appear that the Cabal are posing as wolves in sheep’s clothing and havespecifically targeted Christians for many years now to form a support base. Ithas become increasingly obvious that Republican conservatives have portrayedthemselves as if they support family values while actively pursuing aggressive,imperial policies similar to those of the fascist regimes their forefatherssecretly financed in World War II. These policies are also similar to those ofthe communist Soviet regime they covertly built up in 1917. The fans ofconspiracy websites have become akin to religious zealots in their ownway—increasingly addicted to an endlessly replenished daily diet of sarcastic,victimized, angry, and hopeless rantings that give them a temporary high ofrighteous anger. Each new burst of “fear porn” soon bottoms out into a muchharder and longer-lasting crash in which the conspiracy reader is drowning in aprison of fear, depression, paranoia, and loneliness. This can have a terribleeffect on the peace and harmony of their families as well.Once you’ve read enough of the snarling, attacking propaganda that insists“they’re all in on it” and have reasoned that at least some of it must be true,it can be very difficult to change your mind and accept that heroes can appearwithin any government, military, or corporation. Hate can be a very comfortable,even addictive place to stay. Forgiving the people you have felt the moststrongly betrayed and offended by is never easy. Nonetheless, forgiveness is andwill always be the path to healing, even in the case of the most genuinesociopaths who have done the greatest harms. The Law of One clearly indicatesthat we should draw healthy boundaries with those who try to manipulate us, butthe key to breaking down the Wheel of Karma is to not feel anger or negativeemotions toward them as we protect ourselves and others. To genuinely love them,understand who they are, and see the horrors of abuse they must have gonethrough in their own families to end up that way, while also blocking them fromdoing any further harm, is the final triumph in the Hero’s Journey.In the Wild West of alternative Internet media, facts and journalistic integrityare often thrown right out the window. This makes it the ideal breeding groundfor tabloid-style propaganda to be distributed as seemingly independent andpatriotic reporting. Until we withdraw our projections from the world at large,and embrace and forgive the shadow within ourselves, we will always be lookingfor the next great devil in our global lucid dream. The more public someone is,the easier it is to see that person as the enemy. Yet, despite the massive,day-by-day political attacks, the endless blathering of corporate media, and theconstant attempts to create as much fear and terror as possible, everythingkeeps working out. Although life can be very painful on earth, noArmageddon-type scenario has come along to wipe us out—and I strongly suspect itwill continue to be that way, due to the protection we enjoy. We are not livingwithin a closed system; there are many others out there who are helping us.THE CABAL IS PREVENTED FROM DOING TOO MUCH HARMIt appears that the negative forces wishing to manipulate and control the peoplehave an irreversible handicap that ensures they can never do more than they areallowed to do, thanks to the organizing power of the ancient cycles of time.This is a very important part of the Law of One model. Our planet is beingcarefully guided and managed so that we never see any negativity that is greaterthan what we have invited through our free will. As I wrote in DisclosureEndgame,483 [part0034.html#chapter015fn483] when you read the insider testimonyof Peter David Beter, who appears to have had access to credible information inthe 1970s that was unavailable to the general public, you find out that theCabal has consistently tried to push the world into total chaos anddestruction—both on a military and an economic level.484[part0034.html#chapter015fn484] Underground cities were covertly built for avery good reason; the Cabal was doing its best to create a genuine nuclearArmageddon on the surface. Here is how Beter described this ongoing struggle inhis fortieth audio letter, from November 30, 1978.For more than two years now the United States and Russia have been embroiled insecret hostilities in preparation for Nuclear War One. It began in earnestduring the summer of 1976 when the still-secret Underwater Missile Crisiserupted. Then it expanded into wholesale nuclear sabotage of the United Stateswith weapons now planted at literally thousands of locations nation-wide. Theserange from mammoth hydrogen bombs ready to destroy our largest dams andreservoirs down to tiny nuclear devices called “micronukes” by the Russians…. itno longer makes any sense to speak of preventing Nuclear War One, because it hasalready begun.485 [part0034.html#chapter015fn485]UFOs, apparently piloted by benevolent extraterrestrial humans, haveconsistently interfered with the nuclear arsenals of every country thatpossesses them—not to attack us, but rather to prevent any political factionfrom destroying the planet. On September 27, 2010, Robert Hastings hosted theUFO-Nukes Connection press conference at the National Press Club in Washington,DC, in which seven US Air Force veterans shared their eyewitness testimony ofUFO incursions at nuclear installations during the Cold War era, going as farback as 1948.486 [part0034.html#chapter015fn486] Then, only twenty-six daysafter this event, on October 23, 2010, a cigar-shaped UFO appeared over F. E.Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Fifty Minuteman III missiles powereddown and went completely offline for twenty-six hours. This was the largestmissile failure in American history—and represented fully one-ninth of theentire arsenal. I summarized the evidence in “1950s ETs Prepare Us for GoldenAge.”487 [part0034.html#chapter015fn487] In “Disclosure War at Critical Mass:Birds, Fish and Political Deaths,” I linked to articles indicating that Russia,India, China, and Pakistan have all experienced UFO-related nuclearshutdowns.488 [part0034.html#chapter015fn488] According to India Daily, theIndian government was directly contacted by human ETs after their firstsuccessful nuclear tests in 1998.489 [part0034.html#chapter015fn489]Indian scientists are slowly understanding that the extraterrestrials have thevery unique power of jamming the operational characteristics of any…nukemissiles in the world, including those of India, Pakistan and China….Americans and Russians have experienced the same phenomenon several times in thelast sixty years. The Chinese have experienced the effect, and have in the pastsuspected Americans and others were causing the problem. They have moved theirnuke operational theater way below the earth’s surface, but the jamming effectshave not gone away.According to Indian scientists, if the extraterrestrials ever get to know that acountry is trying to use nuke missiles that will impact over the whole world toa catastrophic extent, they will immediately disable the nukes….Reports from the UK say that the extraterrestrials know every nuke installationvery well—and their exact locations in the world. The main reason why theseunmanned, robotized UFOs visit in so many numbers on the earth is to locate allthe nukes that human beings are making—including the ones made and carried bythe terrorists, like suitcase radiological bombs. According to sources, all theGovernments with nuke capabilities know that their delivery systems can bedisabled by these extra-terrestrials—and that is a major concern for them.490[part0034.html#chapter015fn490]Thanks to Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan of Project Camelot,491[part0034.html#chapter015fn491] a free online video was released in 2009, whereeach of us took turns interviewing Dr. Pete Peterson,492[part0034.html#chapter015fn492] a highly intelligent and clearly genuineinsider. After countless hours of conversation I have had with Dr. Peterson, Iam convinced that he is one of the most important and far-reaching inventors ofclassified technology for the Cabal throughout the second half of the twentiethcentury. Dr. Peterson lost a $6,700-a-month government pension as a directresult of coming forward with us on camera. Several of his technologies have thepower to significantly enhance human health and intuitive abilities. Amongthousands of other data points, Dr. Peterson told me he once had a desk rightdown the hall from Peter David Beter. In our taped interview, Dr. Petersonrevealed that the American economy was planned to go into complete chaos in2001—leading to a total breakdown in civilized society. He was told this wellbefore 9/11. After 9/11, his higher-ups never told him whether this was theevent they had expected or not—but it wasn’t very hard to figure out.Dr. Peterson was also told to expect a similar disaster in 2008—and the economiccollapse happened in the exact time window he was given.493[part0034.html#chapter015fn493] His higher-ups did get the dates of these eventsright—with a very narrow margin of error in both cases—but the social collapsesnever happened. Other imminent deadlines of disaster have come and gone sincethen as well.The same Cabal that hoped to mobilize a half-million-man army of World War Iveterans to overthrow the US government in 1933 and install a fascistdictatorship apparently has been working consistently to see such a breakdown insociety occur for many years. In our video with Dr. Peterson, I pointed out thatdespite these dire prognostications and plans, life on earth has continued. Westill have not seen any worldwide disasters, even though many different attemptshave apparently been made.LET GO OF GUILT AND FEARIf you do find yourself getting sucked into these fear-oriented stories andbelieving them—including any feelings of guilt that you didn’t see the signs andtry to do something about them sooner—there is something you can do to help theworld. Empty your guilt and fear into the peaceful presence of the now. Justbreathe in. Breathe out. Relax. Let go. Consider the great mysteries of ourexistence. Reflect on the many prophecies of a Golden Age, and realize that thechange begins right here, right now, within you. It’s not something you’rewaiting to read about online, see on TV, or find in the newspaper. It happens inthis moment when you let go of the constant chattering, defensiveness, andsuspicion that often plague the mind. It happens when you reflect on theperfection that you already are, right here and right now…as you read thesewords or sit in silence.As many gifted spiritual teachers have said, guilt pulls you into the past andfear pulls you into the future. Either way, you are pulling yourself out of thepurity and serenity of the present moment, where all is well if you simply allowit to be. These incredible repeating cycles of time, humming right along forcountless eons before the dawn of written history, appear to be a carefullyscripted design to help us evolve on a collective level. Nuclear war is notpermitted to occur, as it would disrupt the deeper reason for why these cyclesare allowed to persist—namely, to help us all grow spiritually, from lifetime tolifetime. These cycles also act as a master indexing file we use to structureour reincarnations, so we know what events to expect within a given lifetime.Thankfully, all the suffering and death can finally come to an end if we cantake the opportunity to learn from these cycles and make a collective decisionthat we are indeed ready to enter the Golden Age. Instead of seeing someone youmay disagree with as your nemesis, you can say this: “Whoever you are, whereveryou are, whatever you believe, you will always have a place in my heart. I loveyou. I am sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.”If you can achieve that point of stillness and peace in the now—and believe me,I know how difficult it can be after generations of betrayal and hatred—you havejust become part of the solution. You have vanquished the Guardian of theThreshold and seized the Elixir of Immortality. The power of just a few of us,focusing on the positive, can have a massive effect on the overall level ofpeace and prosperity in the world. If we were to truly have a worldwideawakening—a simple allowing of one another to be as we are—the effect could beso powerful that the old wheelworks of time might break down forever. We mayfinally see a worldwide curtain call—as extraterrestrial humans told the Indiangovernment to expect, sometime after 2012494[part0034.html#chapter015fn494]—when we enter a Golden Age, with a whole newstory. That may very well be what the ancient prophecies were forecasting forthe Age of Aquarius. Either way, it is up to us to make it come true, within theprivacy of our own minds and hearts.THINK ABOUT WHAT JEHOSHUA REALLY TAUGHTIf you consider yourself a Christian, you can be on the front lines of this waveof human evolution by harmonizing with what the great master Jehoshua reallytaught, rather than the politics the corporate media may have encouraged you toembrace. No one is going to hell, since this entire concept was almost certainlya fabrication. Jehoshua’s teaching was very likely mistranslated by the Romangovernment, long ago, for political purposes. Jehoshua’s real message appears tobe that we will keep reincarnating and burning off karma—the Gehenna fire—untilwe learn to love one another. The artificial division of the people between“liberal” and “conservative” is not in keeping with Christian morality orethics. Everyone deserves love and appreciation. If there is someone in theworld whom we do not love, it is our blessing to work this out within ourselves.A very key spiritual principle, echoed in the Cayce readings as well asmainstream psychology, is that whatever we see in others that makes us angry,sad, or jealous is a reflection of an issue we have in ourselves. If we canlearn to love, respect, and forgive ourselves, then we will not be angered andoffended by what we see in others.Conservatives who are angry about gay marriage are secretly feeling abandoned byGod. They feel that if the God they know and believe to be true were really incharge, no one would want to be homosexual. If God were in charge, no one wouldwant to have an abortion. If God were in charge, everyone would want to be aChristian. This sense of profound misery and alienation hasn’t changed inthousands of years—certainly not since the Age of Aries. Political parties riseto power by identifying these biases and prejudices and promising to make lawsthat will further restrict the public’s free will. Traditionally, as themajority of voters have seen these laws get passed and watched their ownfreedoms being increasingly taken away, they have cheered. They felt as if theirside was winning. Maybe God is still alive and well in their homeland, theythink. However, as events go on and the world continues to act in ways theydon’t want it to, they feel an ongoing, deep sense of alienation, anger, fear,and sadness.THE BIG GAME: MANIPULATION OF PERCEPTIONThe big game of politics has always been about the manipulation of perception.Politicians find out who will generate the most votes, and then give them whatthey want—or at least promise to. Then when it becomes impossible to continuethe game, they apologetically change the rules. Rome’s greatest public speaker,Marcus Cicero, became consul in 63 B.C. Marcus’s brother Quintus wrote him abrutally honest letter on how to achieve victory, which is translated andreprinted in How to Win an Election: An Ancient Guide for Modern Politicians.495[part0034.html#chapter015fn495] The translator, Philip Freeman, wrote anintroduction in which he broke down Quintus’s expert advice—probably from thecollective wisdom of an earlier incarnation of the Cabal—into ten steps, asfollows: (1) Make sure you have the backing of your family and friends; (2)surround yourself with the right people; (3) call in all favors; (4) build awide base of support; (5) promise everything to everybody; (6) communicationskills are key; (7) don’t leave town; (8) know the weaknesses of youropponents—and exploit them; (9) flatter voters shamelessly; and (10) give peoplehope.496 [part0034.html#chapter015fn496] Here are some relevant excerpts fromthis section of Freeman’s introduction:5. Promise everything to everybody. Except in the most extreme cases, candidatesshould say whatever the particular crowd of the day wants to hear. Telltraditionalists you have consistently supported conservative values. Tellprogressives you have always been on their side. After the election, you canexplain to everyone that you would love to help them, but unfortunatelycircumstances beyond your control have intervened. Quintus assures his brotherthat voters will be much angrier if he refuses to promise them their hearts’desire than if he backs out later….8. Know the weaknesses of your opponents—and exploit them…. Winning candidatesdo their best to distract voters from any positive aspects their opponentspossess by emphasizing the negatives. Rumors of corruption are prime fodder.Sexual scandals are even better.9. Flatter voters shamelessly…. Make voters believe you genuinely care aboutthem.10. Give people hope…. Give the people a sense that you can make their worldbetter, and they will become your most devoted followers—at least until afterthe election, when you will inevitably let them down. But by then it won’tmatter, because you will have already won.497 [part0034.html#chapter015fn497]Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to George W. Bush,was quite enamored with Cicero’s advice—and issued this quote for the back coverof the book: “Quintus Cicero…[is] a master political strategist…. This primerprovides timeless counsel—and a great read for the modern politicalpractitioner.”498 [part0034.html#chapter015fn498]Gary Hart, former US senator, admits that Cicero’s brutally honest letter proveshow history does indeed repeat itself: “Given the lowly state of politics, thisancient Roman handbook on electioneering shows how little has changed…. [It is]so masterful that one might think it was actually a spoof.”499[part0034.html#chapter015fn499]The hyperconservative French government used these same manipulative tactics toappeal to their conservative base in 1968. They refused to let go of archaiclaws that forced college students to be locked away from one another. Youngadults were not even allowed to spend time together as friends in their ownrooms. How could legitimate marriages ever form if the students were neverallowed to spend any of their time together in their dormitories? The greatcycles had the answer. Right on time, the revolutionary impulses that areprogrammed into the very nature of time kicked in—practically 539 years to theday after Joan of Arc led a massive public uprising against tyranny in her owncycle.ALLOWING LOVEThe wheelwork of time notches us ahead. The gears keep turning, one click at atime. Eventually we throw our cards down on the table, let go of the games, thenames, and the holier-than-thou attitude, and simply allow.50.7 Question: Why must [an entity] come into an incarnation and lose consciousmemory of what he wants to do—and then act in a way in which he hopes [he will]act [while he is still in the afterlife]?Answer:…Let us give the example of the man who sees all the poker hands. He thenknows the game. It is but child’s play to gamble, for it is no risk. The otherhands are known. The possibilities are known—and the hand will be playedcorrectly, but with no interest.In time/space [the afterlife] and in the true-color green density, the hands ofall are open to the eye. The thoughts, the feelings, the troubles: all these maybe seen. There is no deception and no desire for deception. Thus much may beaccomplished in harmony, but the mind/body/spirit gains little polarity [growth]from this interaction.Let us re-examine this metaphor and multiply it into the longest poker game youcan imagine—a lifetime. The cards are love, dislike, limitation, unhappiness,pleasure, etc. They are dealt and re-dealt and re-dealt continuously. You may,during this incarnation begin—and we stress begin—to know your own cards. Youmay begin to find the love within you. You may begin to balance your pleasure,your limitations, etc. However, your only indication of other-selves’ cards isto look into the eyes.You cannot remember your hand, their hands, perhaps even the rules of this game.This game can only be won by those who lose their cards in the melting influenceof love. It can only be won by those who lay their pleasures, their limitations,their all upon the table, face up, and say inwardly: “All, all of you players,each other-self, whatever your hand, I love you.” This is the game: to know, toaccept, to forgive, to balance, and to open the self in love. This cannot bedone without the forgetting—for it would carry no weight in the life of themind/body/spirit beingness totality.500 [part0034.html#chapter015fn500]We can allow there to be love in this moment. We can allow there to be peace inour lives. We can allow this universe to be a perfect place, just as it is. Wecan allow the realization that we will never die, that we will always exist. Wecan allow ourselves to be in allegiance with life—wherever and however it mayappear—as all life is made from the same awareness that is within us.POSITIVE CHANGESThe majority of the American people decided not to support the aggressive,war-mongering policies of the Republican/neoconservative faction when the Cabaltried to create a new nemesis in 2006 by claiming Iran was an imminent nuclearthreat. Instead, there was a landslide in the 2006 election: “The electionresulted in a sweeping victory for the Democratic Party, which captured theHouse of Representatives, the Senate, and a majority of governorships and statelegislatures from the Republican Party.”501 [part0034.html#chapter015fn501]This was not a loss for those who identify with Christian values. Had it nothappened—had we not been ready for it to happen—we may very well have repeatedsome of the most deadly and destructive Roman wars in our own timeline. Manymore lives would have been lost because we weren’t ready to love one another—atleast not enough to save the lives of others we think of as the enemy. Thisdoesn’t necessarily mean that all 2,160-year zodiac cycle crossovers betweenRoman and American history have stopped. Indeed, the shadows of the great clockstill linger as its mighty hands tick forward.THE CATO-CARTER CONNECTION CONTINUESCato maintained his position as consul of Rome for many years. Cato was electedcensor in 184 B.C., which is the same year Carter was elected in the Age ofPisces cycle—1976. Cato remained politically active right through to his deathin 149 B.C.—which corresponds to the year 2011 in our cycle. Obviously, Carterwas president for only four years. Nonetheless, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in2002 for his ongoing efforts to make this a better world.During the last years of his life in the 150s B.C., Cato constantly worked thephrase “Carthage must be destroyed” into any speeches he made—whether it wasrelevant or not.502 [part0034.html#chapter015fn502] This corresponds to theyears leading up to 2011 in the Age of Pisces. Cato obviously was verypassionate about this quest. One historian revealed more details about Cato’sperspective:[Cato] pushed his idea of simplicity and frugality on both the government andthe people during a time when there was an increase in personal wealth and adesire for more…. [He revised] the roles of the Senate and Cavalry…[andinvented] a way to tax luxurious items. But the most popular thing that he didwas…[to promote] the final destruction of Rome’s old enemy, Carthage, afterdiscovering all of the agricultural prosperity that was existing there.503[part0034.html#chapter015fn503]Although many historians consider Cato’s new campaign against Carthage to havebeen an unjust and senseless war, it is possible that he was on to something.Perhaps he had proof that there was indeed a secret, treasonous deal betweenScipio and Antiochus, as the trial suggested, and that this was only one symptomof a much larger problem. Was Carthage the center of the secret Cabal that wasplaying both sides against the middle during that time—just as we see in ourmodern era?THE THIRD PUNIC WAR—AND THE BATTLE TO DEFEAT FINANCIAL TYRANNYCato did ultimately go to war against Carthage in 149 B.C. This corresponds to2011 in the Age of Pisces. I did not know what to expect when I first discoveredthis in 2010, but I certainly kept my eyes open. Shortly after The Source FieldInvestigations was published, Neil Keenan filed a huge lawsuit against the Cabalon November 23, 2011—the forty-eight-year anniversary of the Kennedyassassination.504 [part0034.html#chapter015fn504] This was very much an act ofwar against the Cabal—and if it succeeds, it will become a very significanthistorical event. A 57-nation alliance—which has grown to include more than 160nations—supported this campaign to restore peace on earth, release classifiedtechnologies, and provide full disclosure. Carter may have supported thisalliance all along, though no insiders have confirmed it at this point. Unlikemost wars, this one had to be fought quietly, through legal paperwork andgradual exposure of the truth, and it is still ongoing as of this writing.Keenan’s alliance-led lawsuit was filed two hundred years and sixteen days afterthe Prophet’s alliance of Native American tribes attacked Harrison’s forces inthe Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811. There are 216 cycles of onehundred years in each Age of the Zodiac. Perhaps our grouping of history intocenturies is not arbitrary; it may be another lost inheritance from the sameancient knowledge that revealed the cycles of time. The mass theft of NativeAmerican land in the early 1800s seemed to correspond, very neatly, with themass theft of gold and treasure that the Federal Reserve conducted, worldwide,in the twentieth century. The Battle of Tippecanoe and the filing of Keenan’slawsuit were only sixteen days apart within two turns of a hundred-year cycle,or ten turns of a twenty-year cycle.In Roman history, the Third Punic War lasted until 146 B.C. This corresponds tothe year 2014 in our time. Carthage was indeed utterly and completely destroyed,as Cato had prognosticated. “Cato’s slogan was implemented in typicalthoroughgoing Roman style. The walls of Carthage were torn down, the city put tothe torch. The citizens were sold into slavery, and the Senate passed a decreethat no one could live where Carthage once stood.”505[part0034.html#chapter015fn505]I do not support war and carnage; neither does Carter. Events from the Age ofAries have become significantly less violent as they repeated themselves in ourown age, particularly since the 1980s. Germany’s defeat in 1919 at the Treaty ofVersailles occurred exactly 2,160 years after Carthage was defeated in the FirstPunic War in the Age of Aries. Carter appears to have come a long way in thelast 2,160 years. He is nowhere near as sarcastic and warmongering as he was inhis possible previous incarnation as Cato—where he positively delighted inrepeating that “Carthage must be destroyed.” Based on Carter’s track record,with multiple nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize and a win in 2002, hedefinitely would not want any group, including his own worst enemies, to be soutterly destroyed and defeated as Carthage was in 146 B.C.The great cycles of time are not affected by propaganda. They are not blind tothe deeper truth that exists among all of us. If the mass karma of Carthagereappeared in modern times as the mass karma of Germany, there may be otherconnections between Germany and the Cabal that we haven’t yet covered. I amparticularly fascinated by the fact that the 2011–2014 window in the zodiaccycle also precisely overlaps with our entrance into the Age of Aquarius. Thismay well be the ideal combination of cycles that will synchronize to generatethe mother of all historical events. The Cabal definitely appears to have takenon Carthage’s role within this new 2011–2014 war against the alliance, sinceCarter is clearly working for world peace.PROJECT PAPERCLIPWe already saw that a fascist coup was plotted against the US government in1933—and the Germans were secretly financed by Cabal industrialists such asWalker, Harriman, and Bush and their corporations throughout World War II. Thisis still only one part of a much bigger story. In 2005, BBC News revealed thatthe connection between the German Nazis and the United States became evenstronger after World War II:Sixty years ago the US hired Nazi scientists to lead pioneering projects, suchas the race to conquer space. These men provided the US with cutting-edgetechnology which still leads the way today, but at a cost…. ProjectPaperclip…[was a] US operation which saw [Werner] von Braun and more than 700others spirited out of Germany from under the noses of the US’s allies. Its aimwas simple: “To exploit German scientists for American research—and to denythese intellectual resources to the Soviet Union.”506[part0034.html#chapter015fn506]It is surprising to see how many people have never heard of ProjectPaperclip—but this is another one of many secrets the Cabal obviously does notwant the public to know about. President Truman signed Project Paperclip intolaw as of August 1945, and the first Germans came to America on November 18 thatsame year. They arrived by boat in the United States just months after they hadbeen crushed by the same country they now were relocating to. Truman drew upstrict guidelines that he expected to be followed. He did not want anyone whowas a member of the Nazi Party, or who had participated in Nazi activities orsupported Nazi military plans, to be welcomed in. Let’s now continue with ourquote from the BBC:Under this criterion even von Braun himself, the man who masterminded the Moonshots, would have been ineligible to serve the US. A member of numerous Naziorganisations, he also held rank in the SS. His initial intelligence filedescribed him as “a security risk.”…[Nonetheless,] All of these men were clearedto work for the US, their alleged crimes covered up, and their backgroundsbleached by a military which saw winning the Cold War, and not upholdingjustice, as its first priority.507 [part0034.html#chapter015fn507]Did these Nazi scientists simply let go of their former political beliefs andrelax into the traditional American lifestyle and value system once theyarrived? Or were they able to influence the direction of the country itself? In2007, The Guardian newspaper published a compelling argument by journalist NaomiWolf, in which she showed how the sociopathic “Ten Steps to Fascism” were beingrigorously followed in the United States:If you look at history, you can see that there is essentially a blueprint forturning an open society into a dictatorship. That blueprint has been used againand again—in more and less bloody, more and less terrifying ways. But it isalways effective. It is very difficult and arduous to create and sustain ademocracy—but history shows that closing one down is much simpler. You simplyhave to be willing to take the 10 steps. As difficult as this is to contemplate,it is clear, if you are willing to look, that each of these 10 steps has alreadybeen initiated today in the United States by the Bush administration.508[part0034.html#chapter015fn508]Thankfully, the Cabal was never able to complete those steps—but every one ofthem was rigorously attempted, or actually implemented, by the Bushadministration.THE OCTOBER SURPRISECarter’s reelection may well have been sabotaged by dirty tricks instigated byGeorge H. W. Bush. This sabotage occurred in the so-called October Surprise,when the Iranians were allegedly paid to hold Americans hostage until after theelection. This would cause Carter to appear to be a wimp who could notsuccessfully negotiate the release of these hostages. This secret, treasonousdeal with a country that was supposedly America’s mortal enemy would have helpedensure a smooth victory for the Reagan-Bush ticket. This would also add apersonal element to Carter’s ongoing political struggle for peace ever since.Robert Parry wrote the following exposé of the October Surprise on Truthout:Did disgruntled CIA officers conspire with their former boss, George H.W. Bush,to exploit the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980 to defeat President Jimmy Carter,whose policies had infuriated many CIA veterans? Did that secret CIA operationchange the course of American politics, paving the way for a quarter-century ofRepublican dominance?On Nov. 4, 1980, after a full year of frustrating efforts to free the 52American hostages held in Iran, Carter lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan andhis running mate, George H. W. Bush. The hostages were finally freed afterReagan was sworn in on Jan. 20, 1981.509 [part0034.html#chapter015fn509]This sudden release of Iranian hostages—on the very same day that Reagan andBush were sworn in—was certainly suspicious. Israeli intelligence officer AriBen-Menashe revealed the following in his memoirs, entitled Profits of War:“Carter’s hostage negotiations had fallen through because of Republicanopposition…. The Republicans wanted the Iranians to release the hostages onlyafter the Nov. 4 election,…with the final details to be arranged in Parisbetween a delegation of Republicans, led by George H.W. Bush, and a delegationof Iranians, led by cleric Mehdi Karrubi.”510 [part0034.html#chapter015fn510]Another noteworthy book on this subject was written by Carter’s top NationalSecurity Council aide for Iran and the Persian Gulf and was titled OctoberSurprise: America’s Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan.511[part0034.html#chapter015fn511] His testimony also appeared in the New YorkTimes in 1991, and it was entered into the official congressional record.512[part0034.html#chapter015fn512] Barbara Honegger, a former Reagan-Bush campaignand White House staffer, also supported these allegations in her book OctoberSurprise.513 [part0034.html#chapter015fn513] You can imagine how upset Cartermust have been once he realized what most likely had been done to him. Atreasonous deal was struck with America’s enemy—and the Cabal got away with it.These fifty-two hostages could have been killed and were living in fear. Theirlives were being held as a ransom to ensure Carter would lose the election, bymaking him appear ineffective and unable to lead the United States. Carter isobviously aware that to stand up to the Cabal in a bold, public fashion, atleast at this point in our history, would be certain death. Nonetheless, hecertainly appears to have committed himself to doing as much as he can toimprove the world, within reason. Carter was deeply honored by winning the NobelPeace Prize in 2002, and after receiving the award, he said the following: “WhenI left the White House I was a fairly young man, and I realized I maybe have 25more years of active life…so we capitalized on the influence that I had as aformer president of the greatest nation in the world, and decided to fillvacuums.”514 [part0034.html#chapter015fn514]BREAKING DOWN THE WALLS OF SECRECYWhat types of “vacuums” might Carter wish to fill? It seems likely that he wouldwant to expose and defeat the same Cabal that sabotaged his presidency. He mightalso want to see other hidden truths revealed—on a mass, public scale. InOctober 1969, Carter had a breathtaking UFO sighting. During his 1976 campaign,he made a bold statement: “If I become President, I’ll make every piece ofinformation this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and thescientists.”515 [part0034.html#chapter015fn515] According to BBC News, theGermans might have brought some very powerful secrets along with them to theUnited States as a key part of Project Paperclip.The large number of still-secret Paperclip documents has led many people,including Nick Cook, aerospace consultant at Jane’s Defence Weekly, to speculatethat the United States may have developed even more advanced Nazi technology,including antigravity devices—a potential source of vast amounts of free energy.Cook says that such technology “could be so destructive that it would endangerworld peace—and the US decided to keep it secret for a long time.”516[part0034.html#chapter015fn516]Carter has already proven he is willing to boldly speak out against what heperceives as injustice when, in September 2009, he criticized the ongoing,day-by-day campaign of the Republican Party and its supporters to destroyPresident Obama by fueling racial hatred. “I think an overwhelming portion ofthe intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based onthe fact that he is a black man—that he’s African American.”517[part0034.html#chapter015fn517]Clearly, Carter is not afraid to play hardball. Although I am not personallyaware of Carter being a part of the alliance that is working to defeat financialtyranny at this time, the cycle connections between the Keenan lawsuit in 2011and the Third Punic War against Carthage in 149 B.C. are very interesting. IfCarter’s change of heart represents a shift in the zodiac cycle itself, then thepatriots within the United States who are willing to protect the people againstall enemies—foreign and domestic—may have stepped into the hero’s role as well.The Illuminati dragon is, as I said, guarding the ultimate treasure:technologies that could vastly improve the quality of all life on earth. Is thestruggle to defeat the Cabal the new version of the Third Punic War, timedprecisely with our movement into the Age of Aquarius? Will this battle to exposeand defeat the Cabal reach its peak in 2014? Will Carter use his publicposition, when the time comes, to help create leverage to get the truth out?Will this also lead to the disclosure of the extraterrestrial presence onearth—along with the technologies we have acquired? It is an interestingquestion—and we don’t have to wait very long to find out the answer.Finally, as we head into the next chapter, we will begin discussing theastonishing quarter-cycle connection with September 11, 2001, across the gulf of539 years. Once we see how the pieces fit together within the cycles, we aregiven even more proof that the Cabal’s days are numbered. Was this epic eventreally caused by “Arabs with box cutters” who happened to get lucky and take twohuge skyscrapers down in a single attack? Given all that we now know about theCabal, is it possible that the official story is a lie? Who was the aggressorwhen the same cycle played out 539 years ago? How does this knowledge reflect onthe events we are seeing today? In this case, we will also see another exampleof how two different cycles can overlap and exert a combined effect on theoutcomes of historical events on earth.We will also see that these time cycles are being observed, influenced, andmanaged by those on the other side of the veil, so to speak. Not everything isforeordained; real efforts are made to protect us from the most negativetimelines. I was very fortunate to gain conscious access to those “on the otherside” and be given prophetic information—such as about 9/11—that I published onmy website nearly two years before the event itself. The Internet Archive stillhas a time-encoded record of when these words were posted, proving they weremade public well before 9/11 occurred."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENSEPTEMBER 11 FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE VEILBack in 2010, when I was first summarizing and extending this research, Iimmediately got the idea to check on September 11, 2001. This was, after all,the ultimate inciting incident of my generation—a trigger that awakened manymore people to the existence of the Cabal, further ensuring its eventual defeat.The logic in Masson’s book was simple and straightforward, and there were only afew cycles to choose from. I looked at the 2,160-year zodiac cycle first, butthere were no events in Roman history that lined up with 9/11. The next-bestchoice was the 539-year quarter cycle. I immediately discovered that 9/11 wasonly six days away from a major European battle in the previous turn of thiscycle.If we count back 539 years before September 11, 2001, we have September 11,1462. Six days later, on September 17, 1462, we find the Battle of Swiecino—thesingle biggest turning point in the Thirteen Years’ War, which had captivatedmuch of Europe at the time. This 9/11 correlation was not a single, stand-alone“coincidence.” I soon found at least four direct synchronicities between thebiggest political events in the Thirteen Years’ War and major political eventsbefore and after 9/11 in our modern era. The beginning of each war, the buildingof the alliance against the nemesis, the key turning-point battle in each war,and the end of each war all synchronize—within less than a month—in both cycles.The Battle of Swiecino obviously did not feature airliners crashing into hugeskyscrapers; however, there was a huge storm of crossbow fire that utterlydevastated the losing side.Helmer and Masson both concluded that the literal events that occur in eachcycle are obviously not going to be exactly the same—but there are manyastonishing similarities. Key archetypal moments in the Hero’s Journey storyline also seem to repeat themselves. At first, it appears that bin Laden andAl-Qaeda is on one side of the battle and America on the other when we analyze9/11 for its cycle connections to the Battle of Swiecino. However, once Istarted identifying the key turning points in the cycles and saw who wasfighting in each version, the answers became obvious. The true nature of thenemesis was revealed once more. We need to establish additional backgroundmaterial in order to properly understand how the Thirteen Years’ War and 9/11fit together, and who occupied the role of the nemesis in each version of thecycle.A NEW PEARL HARBORThe official 9/11 story is that the attack was masterminded by Osama bin Ladenand the Al-Qaeda terrorist group. There is obvious truth to this version of theevents, and most Americans have accepted this. These people were involved andthe United States did bring them to justice eventually. But it also appears thatthe terrorists could have had help. It is quite a stretch to believe that threedifferent World Trade Center buildings collapsed into their own footprints, atfree-fall speed, in one day through airliner collisions. Building 7 was nevereven struck by an airplane—it was only hit by falling debris. Both of the TwinTowers were engineered to withstand more than one airliner crash simultaneously.There are no other historical examples of collapses like this happening exceptthrough controlled demolition. Jet fuel is very similar to kerosene, and ifkerosene could melt steel this easily, then every kerosene heater ever madeshould be a tremendous fire hazard.There are dozens more holes like this in the official story, and the informationis so prevalent online that you can spend years analyzing the evidence and printvolumes of books on the subject of what really happened that day. If you havetaken the time to study the facts, you may be able to lecture about this casefor hours—but if you’ve refused to look at it, then you will probably rejectevery piece of evidence you see, and nothing will ever convince you. Each of usmust move through enormous personal fear to imagine a nemesis that would becapable of sociopathic behavior on this grandiose a scale. Ordinary people couldnever get themselves caught up in such a huge, murderous lie and still be ableto put their kids to bed at night. It is terrifying to imagine a governmentcreating a self-inflicted wound of this scope and magnitude in order to attemptto install a military dictatorship and martial law.Just twelve months before 9/11, the neoconservatives publicly revealed, inwriting, that they needed a “catastrophic and catalyzing event—like a new PearlHarbor” to advance their agenda.518 [part0034.html#chapter016fn518] Then, on May25, 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released nationwide. It was the mostexpensive movie ever made—with a budget of $140 million.519[part0034.html#chapter016fn519] Pearl Harbor was a very popular film, grossing$200 million in the domestic box office and $450 million worldwide. Everyone wasviscerally reminded that America had suffered a terrorist attack thatimmediately triggered a world war and a mandatory draft. Three months andseventeen days later, the next Pearl Harbor occurred.In September 2000, the neoconservatives published a document entitled “Projectfor a New American Century: Rebuilding America’s Defenses.” You can stilldownload the PDF from the organization’s website at the time of this writing,March 2013. Scroll down to page 51 and you will read the following: “Further,the process of transformation [to this New American Century], even if it bringsrevolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic andcatalyzing event—like a new Pearl Harbor.”520 [part0034.html#chapter016fn520]This document clearly outlines that the neoconservatives needed a “new PearlHarbor”—a “catastrophic and catalyzing event”—to transform the United Statesinto what they were calling the New American Century. A big-budget movie likePearl Harbor could have been designed to inspire the nation to militarize aftersuffering such a huge terrorist attack and join the new world war in the MiddleEast, if the other Arab countries had joined the fight to defend Iraq andAfghanistan. One of my most deeply placed “insiders” told me the following aboutthis document: “David, hardly anyone really understands what they meant whenthey said ‘New American Century.’ They wanted to create a whole new age in whichthey had total, dictatorial control over the earth—and no longer needed to hidewho they are or what they are doing.”521 [part0034.html#chapter016fn521]Let’s not forget that Prescott Bush and other Cabal associates wanted tooverthrow the US government in 1933 and create a fascist regime modeled on theprinciples of Hitler and Mussolini. They continued covertly financing Hitlerthrough World War II—and got away with it. They transferred the best Naziscientists to the United States immediately after Hitler was defeated—and gotaway with it. Prescott’s own grandson was president of the United States during9/11. During the Bush administration, the Cabal systematically followed the “TenSteps to Fascism” identified by journalist Naomi Wolf. Hitler used the same tensteps to establish his own dictatorship in Germany. Even the new Department ofHomeland Security was very similar to Hitler’s description of Germany as theFatherland. These historical facts give us legitimate reasons to consider thatthe Cabal may have had a vested interest in creating a new Pearl Harbor event tobring about major changes to government and society.THE USA PATRIOT ACTOn September 24, 2001, just thirteen days after the 9/11 attacks, the USAPATRIOT Act was handed to Congress.522 [part0034.html#chapter016fn522] The textof the bill was nearly five inches thick—making it impossible for anyone inCongress to actually read it—but they were all under strong pressure to sign itinto law. The bill was a total blueprint for a fascist dictatorship in America,stripping the people of all the most important rights and freedoms they wereguaranteed by the Constitution.523 [part0034.html#chapter016fn523] Although thisenormous bill was allegedly written in response to 9/11, evidence soon emergedthat it had been sitting on the shelf for some time, waiting for the rightmoment.524 [part0034.html#chapter016fn524] The following excerpt is from aTruthout.org article by Jennifer Van Bergen that emerged in May 2002.Similar antiterrorism legislation [as the USA PATRIOT Act] was enacted in the1996 Antiterrorism Act, which however did little to prevent the events of 9/11.Many provisions had either been declared unconstitutional or were about to berepealed when 9/11 occurred….[The USA PATRIOT Act] allows for indefinite detention of suspected (not“proven”) alien terrorists, without probable cause of a crime, without a hearingor an opportunity to defend or challenge the evidence against them, when theyhave not even been proven to be a threat—and have already established a legalright to remain here…. The USAPA expands the Secretary of State’s power todesignate terrorist groups without any court or congressional review—and allowsfor secret searches without probable cause.525 [part0034.html#chapter016fn525]On October 9, 2001, two of the senators who were calling for rational thinkingand trying to slow the passage of the bill—namely, Senate Judiciary CommitteeChairman Patrick Leahy and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle—were sent lettersfilled with weaponized anthrax. These letters could have been a blatant threatfrom the sociopathic Cabal to everyone in Congress, warning them that they hadbetter sign the USA PATRIOT Act, or else. The bill was signed into law onOctober 26, 2001.526 [part0034.html#chapter016fn526]By September 29, 2001, 130,000 tons of steel were removed from the World TradeCenter crime scene, and an additional 220,000 tons were hauled away soonafterward, leaving nothing behind. Only 150 pieces were held for futureinvestigation with FEMA, and the public still does not have access to most ofthese pieces.527 [part0034.html#chapter016fn527] Every truck that shipped thesteel beams away was equipped with a $1,000 GPS device to ensure that none ofthese “highly sensitive” pieces of evidence wound up anywhere else but thesmelting furnace.528 [part0034.html#chapter016fn528]According to several insiders I am in contact with, the US military quicklyrealized that 9/11 was an inside job. It is their job to look the wolf in theeye and not cower in fear. They realized they were not on a need-to-know basisabout what had happened. They were already aware of the Cabal and how dangerousit was. They also knew they had sworn an oath to protect and defend theConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.However, if they were to openly reveal what they knew, they would neversurvive—so the mission to defeat the Cabal needed to continue on a covert basisin order to ensure success.HIGHER GUIDANCEIn November 1996, after four years of stunning synchronicity, four years ofwriting my dreams down every morning, and eleven months of studying the Law ofOne series, I began pulling in my own intuitive readings. Just twenty-six daysafter I started, on December 6, 1996, I got a very clear prophecy of 9/11.Furthermore, as you are about to see, the readings had expressed a concern aboutthe Cabal from the very first day. A working link to this 9/11 prophecy canstill be found on the Internet Archive at the time of this writing, dating backto January 24, 2000—more than a year and a half before the tragic event tookplace.529 [part0034.html#chapter016fn529] In order to do this techniqueproperly, I carefully followed the protocols of “remote viewing,” where the mainsecret to getting good intuitive data is to avoid trying to understand any of itas it comes in. You go into a deep state of meditation, right on the brink offalling asleep, and listen to the “still, small voice” inside you. Then youdocument the data, being careful to have no emotional reactions, no mentalanalysis, no attempt to understand what it means, and no stopping; you keep abrisk pace. On November 10, 1996, right when I was first waking up, I listened,and I captured any words or sentences that naturally floated into my mind. Assoon as I felt like I understood any of the words, I backed off, breathed moredeeply, and went into a deeper state of meditation. My job was only to listen tothe sound of the words, wake up enough to write them down, go back intomeditation, and keep going. Within less than a month I began dictating the wordsinto a portable cassette recorder instead of writing them down, which greatlyimproved the quality of the data.Right from the very first day, two stunning prophecies took place. The first onehappened almost immediately. I spent about an hour going in and out of a deeptrance state, and writing down anything and everything I had heard each time Ipulled myself out of it. I ended up writing down eight pages of sentencefragments, without paying any attention to what they were saying. When I finallylet myself wake up and read them in a normal state of mind, I was completelyamazed. Much of it was cryptic and mysterious, but some of it made perfectsense. The very last paragraph read, “I love it when people refer to theMidwestern Atlantis. There are also formations in the desert you should knowabout, in Chichen Itza. After I’m done, you should take a walk to them. You cango with your mind, you know? Check it out.” Immediately after I finished readingthis line and understood that it was encouraging me to learn the art of astralprojection, the phone started ringing. A friend of mine from a local UFO groupwas calling to invite me to a seminar on astral projection. I told him what hadjust happened, and he was stunned—but we both knew that paranormal things likethis were not impossible, just unusual.The second prophetic statement was rather cryptic: “One of our women, Teresa, asibling, inoperative—the Christian, psychically.” This clearly seemed to betalking about Mother Teresa, the famous Roman Catholic nun and human rightscrusader. Twelve days after I wrote down those words, on November 22, 1996,Mother Teresa suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized. She had surgery onNovember 29 to clear blocked arteries and was given an electric shock onDecember 11 to correct an irregular heartbeat.530[part0034.html#chapter016fn530] This procedure had to be delayed because she wasalso suffering other health problems, including bronchial pneumonia. Her healthcontinued declining, leading her to step down from the head of Missionaries ofCharity—her own organization—on March 13, 1997.531[part0034.html#chapter016fn531] Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997—justfive days after the tragic death of Princess Diana on August 31, 1997. Manypeople felt that the timing of these two iconic female leaders’ deaths wassynchronistic. By that point I had also received prophetic information aboutDiana’s imminent loss. All of this data can be backed up with eyewitnesstestimony from my housemate, as well as others who were renting adjoiningapartments within the remodeled 1800s schoolhouse we were living in.At the time I pulled in this reading, I was seriously considering joining theMasonic Order. During that time, I knew much less about it than I do now. I didconsider that there could be risks involved, but I also felt like there might besome positive aspects to it as well. The very first sentence gave me a strongwarning against this idea—and since then, I have become well aware that thesecrecy of the Masonic Order has been used as a cover for the Cabal. We also seedirect reference to the idea of “harvest”—the biblical term for thetransformation into a Golden Age—by mentioning “the farmhand.” The term harvestis also used in the Law of One series. What you are about to read is a series ofthe most understandable and relevant excerpts.Sunday 11/10/96—10:00 A.M. Most things in this world are a lateral hell; you canmove about in them. Freemasonry is a vertical hell; you can go down muchquicker…. Does the Farmhand have enough manual labor? The Bible, just analyzeit—I’m too proud of you!…The religions I am concerned with will be somedaylighted—and we will go on to greater heights as a conglomerate being in thecosmos….[Your] country and continuity [is being] shaded by an invisible hand whichcontrols the sound in the lower ear. [It is] the sound of Hades—it massages thetemples. Pause for the government’s actions to be completed…. It could bebetter, for there is sometimes touch and significant contact with the devil.532[part0034.html#chapter016fn532]When the source mentioned “the devil,” it was discussing how some members of theCabal have engaged in Luciferian rituals and believe they are in contact withsuch a being. In these early sessions, the readings referred to the Cabal as“the patriarch” more than once. I was dazzled by the information I was pullingin, particularly after getting invited to a class on astral projectionimmediately after seeing that line in the readings for the first time. MotherTeresa’s heart attack on November 22, 1996, made me even more convinced thatthis was not my imagination. As the days went on and my reception continuedimproving, the messages about “the patriarchy” became even more insistent andcarried a hopeful message, revealing that despite these negative actions, wewould move through this planetary evolution successfully.Monday 12/2/96—7:00 A.M. The patriarch is winding down, landing with such aforce in each stanza. More and more, the barriers are toppling. Those who havefaith in the one capitalizing on the shopping [are misguided;] we all know bynow that this is a malevolent force that will soon disintegrate. Murder is stillbeing sung in the hearts of foul men…. Know that the decades of tyranny areover. Accept that circumstances have changed; there is a new understanding nowthat is being brought out into the light. People will not be the same; with thespeed of thought, they will fly and travel.Tuesday 12/3/96—6:30 A.M. In unison, the voice of the Creator sings out, but whoshall decode the signal? Continued assumptions prove incorrect. It is our pledgeto be of assistance despite the circumstances. Those who learn the truth ofreligion will find themselves in an inverse position to the dictates of society.Tuesday 12/3/96—7:26 P.M. Swiftly come the messengers of destiny, bringing withthem the notions of a new age. It is but for you to perceive it that it maybecome reality…. The technological abuses of Earth’s history will fall away.What you choose to believe is for you to decide. The choice is around you, andyou may drink of it. No one survives in the pathways of the dead. If you believethere is only one mind, how can there be two different people?533[part0034.html#chapter016fn533]Then, on Friday, December 6, 1996, the first direct prophecy of 9/11 camein—almost five years in advance. The information was cleverly disguised, and atfirst I thought it was only speaking about a car crash. However, in hindsightthere were several clues that strongly suggested this was a prophecy of 9/11—andthat the readings were well aware that the Cabal was responsible for theattacks. The term “Rescue 9/11” is directly mentioned, followed by thehumorously ironic phrase “CBS and ABC give it adequate coverage.” We seereferences to the idea of “special effects” being used to create this disaster,and a clear statement that “it’s the greatest science fiction story ever told.”Furthermore, we see multiple references to sickness—and this seems to refer tothe plague of fear that had prevented humanity from being willing to see theCabal. Though the higher forces could have stopped 9/11, through variousundetectable means, they had to let it happen in order to help us move through amass awakening. Interestingly, it also said “the patriarch must bedenominated”—which was an interesting choice of words. When a politician wantsto run for president, he must be nominated by his party, and this curious wordchoice implied that the event being spoken about was ultimately a political one.Friday 12/6/96—7:35 A.M. Under the aegis of friendly planetary transformation,the talk show host has got a new one. They’re all special effects, designed toride the lightning bolts. It’s doctor-recommended; who is going to ask thepediatrician? Who is going to look at the Self with tangible results?Self-awareness is the key to building a foundation. If a person is sick, theyneed constant attention. If a person is real sick, they need to collapse.Sometimes a habit must be dropped cold turkey in order to leave it. Allpleasantries have been exhausted; there is no other way for the energy to flow.The patriarch must be denominated.It’s the greatest science fiction story ever told. Someone comes in—Rescue 911.CBS and ABC give it adequate coverage. A cast-iron fence is wrought around thevictim’s body. An impenetrable wall needs only be potentiated by positiveenergy. In the context of the rest of the people, the material you present istruly a magical gift. Peace be with you in the Light of everlasting Love.534[part0034.html#chapter016fn534]The “cast-iron fence” was another major clue in the aftermath of the attacks.After the Twin Towers fell, a wall of solid steel I beams was left standing atthe bottom—and it did look like a cast-iron fence. The message ended positively,as it clearly said that the seemingly “impenetrable wall” presented by the Cabalcould be transformed “by positive energy.” Eight days later, additional clueswere given that further indicated the readings knew they were talking about anevent we now call 9/11—and that forces within the White House were responsiblefor it.Saturday 12/14/96—6:00 A.M. There is a new, immediate story. Fear is thine worstenemy. Something about the dollar will be increased, and the White House willalso be increased. We are calm about it; it is just a matter of fact.535[part0034.html#chapter016fn535]The readings expertly guided me through a series of jobs, and ultimatelyinfluenced me to move to Virginia Beach—the home of Edgar Cayce’s ownAssociation for Research and Enlightenment, or A.R.E.—on October 4, 1997. I hadhoped to attend the A.R.E.’s graduate school, Atlantic University, and organizedmy move to Virginia Beach through the A.R.E. as well. As soon as I arrivedthere, people began recognizing me as the spitting image of Edgar Cayce as ayoung man. The facial resemblance was astonishing. After weeks of uncertainty, Ifinally had the courage to ask my readings if it was true that I was EdgarCayce’s reincarnation on November 26, 1997—and they answered in the affirmative.Everything changed for me at that point. I really was quite terrified of thewhole thing, because until then my readings had been strictly private. Now,suddenly, the work I had been doing seemed to take on much greaterimportance—and carried a significant responsibility. Even worse, I was told itwould be “considered a felony in the spiritual realms” if I didn’t go publicwith the story of the connection between Cayce and myself. I still wasn’t sureif it was true, despite the resemblance—but once I checked the astrology, I wasstunned. There was incredible synchronicity between the positions of the planetsat the time of Edgar Cayce’s birth and my own. The sun, the moon, Mercury,Venus, and Mars were all in almost exactly the same positions. Later on, anastrologer named Brian McNaughton calculated that my exact birthday—March 8,1973—featured the best possible alignment with Cayce’s astrology, in a 127-yearperiod after his death. The readings also asked me to formally present theevidence to the A.R.E., including the comparison photos and birth charts. Asfate would have it, they told me they had someone coming in every week whoclaimed to be Edgar Cayce. I did also meet with Edgar Cayce’s son, Edgar EvansCayce—and he admitted to me that although he couldn’t believe it was true, I wasthe best contender he’d ever seen.On February 23, 1999, just as I was preparing to debut my own website, I woke upat two A.M. with a prophetic dream of an impending disaster in New York City. Inthis case I thought the dream might be referring to a massive earthquake. Ipublished an article about it on Joe Mason and Dee Finney’s website,GreatDreams.com. A capture of this article can be found in Archive.org, datedOctober 9, 1999. This same article also features a dream from November 10, 1998,in which a “cast of characters…were entering and staying in a hotel…[that]looked more like the White House…. There was definitely some sort of politicalstuff going on…. This dream ends with some incredibly serious Earth Changes, andthe hotel collapsing.” The reading then came in after this and said thefollowing—which appeared to be yet another reference to 9/11.Tuesday 11/10/98—7:23 A.M. A malevolent, brief problem…. We can use thismaterial to predict those occasions where the entire system is breaking down,while simultaneously illustrating why it is that the press releases will bespeaking up for a moment…. What we cannot do is urge the violence to continue….There are indeed those concerns stemming from the direct use of force therein,and the cataclysmic nature of how it functions….Instead of simply letting go of one’s position and one’s power, there are thosesituations where power is being sought after rather continuously. When we bringdown the house, it is designed to enable the awakening process to continue….Great strides are made by those people who never have to become anythingdifferent, but simply accept who and what they are now. Those loving souls thathave followed the Christ pattern to a tee will be available now to illustratefor others what it is that must needs transpire in the present moment. 536[part0034.html#chapter016fn536]In this next excerpt from the same article, we see one sentence describing thedream I had, followed by the analysis I wrote in February 1999. I clearly warnedthat something big was going to happen in New York City, and urged the readernot to panic. A powerful synchronicity had occurred as I was dictating thisdream into the recorder, and this inspired me to write up the article. Right asI said that the dream appeared to be predicting “an imminent disaster, possiblyin New York,” I had a very powerful feeling of ringing in my ears. This hasalways been one of the most powerful and sudden forms of synchronicity Ireceive, and has proven to be useful on many, many occasions.Tuesday 2/23/99—2:00 A.M. I met a client of mine who lives in New York City atone point in this dream, and that seemed to triangulate it to New York….As I lay in bed and dictated this dream, I tried to make sense out of it. Thereobviously was an analogy to Mother Earth “vomiting,” possibly indicatingvolcanic/tectonic activity, and the fact that even though it would happen, itwas still okay. At one point on the tape, I said, “I think this has something todo with an imminent disaster, possibly occurring in New York.” No sooner did Isay this but what a huge, deafening sound pressure came into my ears.My brother also had a dream about tidal waves recently, while he slept for anight in New York City. In this dream, huge waves were coming in, and peoplewere saying, “Well, I guess this is the end of the world.” He was trying to goaround and comfort people, telling them of the positive nature of thistransformation of the planet. Indeed, we all need to stay focused on that partof the picture. These disasters might be very intimidating and dishearteningwhen they happen. Many people might feel hopeless enough to contemplate suicideor other drastic measures. The point here is not to panic.You, the reader of this article, are getting advance notice about what is goingto happen, as well as the positive outcome of it. You will be needed in yourcommunity to keep people calm when these things start to happen. If you needmore convincing of the positivity of what is about to happen to us, please readthe book that I have written, and the readings that have come through me.537[part0034.html#chapter016fn537]These next two excerpts from this same time period can be heard on the originaltapes, and read in the original transcripts I have—including hard drives datingback to 1999. Unfortunately, I never published them on my website—but theynonetheless became much more relevant as time went on.Tuesday 2/23/99—9:34 A.M. Severe wartime. You haven’t asked us about this asoften or as frequently as we would like. There are certain developments nowtaking place that have made this a much more current proposition than before,and at the same time, those differences between the past and the present arelargely ignored in the conscious sense.Monday 3/15/99—8:15 A.M. The Roman empire must again fall, as is the nature ofcycles of time, and of the universe.SUSAN LINDAUER TELLS THE TRUTHMany people who believe that “9/11 was an inside job” consider it to have been ahuge success for the Cabal, when in fact it was a spectacular failure. Dr.Peterson and other insiders revealed that the Cabal expected this event wouldliterally lead to mass starvation, rioting in the streets, and a total breakdownin American society, making it ripe for a military dictatorship and a new worldwar with a mandatory draft and mass death. We did see a huge economic collapseafter 9/11, but society bounced back much better than the Cabal had apparentlyhoped it would.Several insiders told me that Flight 93—the plane that crashed in Shanksville,Pennsylvania—was headed for the Congress. The collision would have been used tokill many, if not most of the members of the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives. This would have created a full-blown constitutional crisis andwould have made it much easier for an emergency government to declare martiallaw and establish a military dictatorship.Susan Lindauer was the top CIA agent working to negotiate with Iraq for the Bushadministration. She worked in the Iraqi embassy in New York from 1996 right upuntil the second Gulf War began. Her job was vital to the safety of America—andextremely important to the Bush administration. United Nations sanctions hadbeen placed against Iraq and were causing mass starvation and terriblehumanitarian crises. The Iraqis were desperate to prove they did not possessweapons of mass destruction. Susan Lindauer was their closest connection to theBush administration, and she was doing her best to orchestrate a peace treatywith them. She was shocked when she was ordered to sabotage thenegotiations—even after the Iraqis offered complete, total, and unconditionalsurrender. They were ready to open every facility, pay every fine, and sacrificeevery concession just to prove that they did not have WMDs.Susan has since come forward and openly testified, in free public videos as wellas in writing, that she was warned in advance about a major attack that wasabout to occur in New York. Independent sources confirmed that Susan gaveadvance warning about the 9/11 attacks. After 9/11, Susan was also told thatFlight 93 had been shot down—and that the pilot who was responsible for downingthe plane has been kept prisoner, in a chemically induced coma, ever since.Susan revealed her full testimony in her groundbreaking book, ExtremePrejudice.538 [part0034.html#chapter016fn538]Susan was about to testify before Congress and reveal everything she knew aboutthe Bush administration’s efforts to sabotage peace negotiations with Iraq.Tragically, before she could ever make it to Congress, she was arrested underthe Patriot Act. She was imprisoned in a Texas military base and kept in achemical straitjacket with the powerful drug Haldol for an entire year without atrial or a hearing. She was then kept indicted for five years without aconviction or a guilty plea. All charges against her were dismissed by theJustice Department—just five days before Obama was inaugurated as theforty-fourth president of the United States.539 [part0034.html#chapter016fn539]THE TESTIMONY OF ELIZABETH NELSONAdditional evidence of the shooting down of Flight 93 comes from ElizabethNelson, a Project Camelot witness whom I had the honor of meeting and spendingtime with.540 [part0034.html#chapter016fn540] I was absolutely convinced of hersincerity and truthfulness once I got to know her, and we got along like oldfriends. Elizabeth (not her real name) first approached Bill Ryan in February2009, revealing that she was in an emergency military command room on September11, 2001, when the order to shoot down Flight 93 was given. This is only a verybrief excerpt of her detailed testimony, which you can hear and read online.541[part0034.html#chapter016fn541]I was in the last six months of my active duty, in training in the US Army,still of the rank of a Private, I believe—Private First Class. I was stationedat Fort Meade under the Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center Hospital. Fort Meadealso has on it the base of NSA, which is the National Security Agency….I remember the room that they took us into. And they told us that we were incharge of getting coffees, any kind of snacks…[and] making photocopies, becauseshe and I had the access codes for the rooms, to get in there…. It was made veryclear to us that we were not to look at them. They sat us in chairs at the farend of the room, not facing them. We were told to look at the wall and notlisten to anything we heard. This was our direct orders.[There were] probably six or seven men around this very large table, just likeyou would see in a big office somewhere. And they had this funny phone. It waslike a conference-call phone…. I didn’t hear a thing about hijackers. We justheard that this plane was flying in a no-fly zone, and they couldn’t makecontact with the plane, or something like this. There was no communication.Protocol says it has to be taken out. And so I was in the room when the decisionwas mutually made by the people talking on the phone…to shoot this plane down….I remember the distinct feeling inside of me of when I saw on the news thatthere was this story that there were terrorists on this plane, and that thepeople overtook…the terrorists and crashed the plane themselves. And how thiswas leaking out as these people being heroes. And I remember the extreme moralfrustration inside of me, of feeling: But that’s not true! That’s not true atall! We shot this down. And a huge conflict inside of me, of knowing that theworld is made to believe this story that’s not true.542[part0034.html#chapter016fn542]BUILDING THE RESISTANCEHighly placed insiders revealed to me, in private conversation, that the trulypatriotic heroes in the US military dramatically intensified their efforts todefeat the Cabal after 9/11. They knew they had to do this in secret or theycould all be tortured and killed. They knew it could take many years beforetheir plans would ever be able to succeed. However, they already had developed acomprehensive blueprint to actually defeat the Cabal—despite its massive,worldwide power and control—in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination.After 9/11, I was told that numerous Cabal offices were secretly outfitted withaudio-video surveillance equipment and that a great wealth of damning footagewas gathered. This surveillance data allowed the alliance to remain one stepahead of the Cabal—and sabotage their plans whenever possible. Although theirwork had to remain secret, the patriotic elements of the US military quietlydeveloped an international alliance that cut off the Cabal’s financial supply,blocked every attempt they made to start World War III, and eventually plannedto expose their wrongdoings publicly once they were too weak to resist. In orderto effectively choke off the Cabal’s financial lifeline, all its biggest sourcesof profit would need to be attacked.FOLLOW THE MONEYThe connections between the Thirteen Years’ War and the events surrounding 9/11might not make sense until we reveal how the Cabal makes its money. As Irevealed in Financial Tyranny, health care companies earned a whopping$64,924,600,000 in 2010. Nine out of the top fifty most profitable Fortune 500companies were health care corporations. Pharmaceutical companies earned anincredible 19.3 percent profit margin in 2008, which would make them excellentstocks to invest in if your goal was to profit as much as possible. This alsomeans nearly 20 percent of the cost of your prescription medicine becomes moneyin their pockets, even if your life depends on being able to pay for thosedrugs. Seven different industries on the Fortune 500 list are health carerelated—out of only forty-three American industries that earn a profit. The onlyother industries that can meet or beat these fantastic profits are oil and gasproducers and national defense contractors, who do not have to publicly revealtheir earnings.543 [part0034.html#chapter016fn543] Senator John Kerry made aninteresting statement about these other two industries in his first 2004presidential debate with George W. Bush.The only building that was guarded when the troops went into Baghdad was the oilministry. We didn’t guard the nuclear facilities. We didn’t guard the foreignoffice, where you might have found information about weapons of massdestruction. We didn’t guard the borders…. I think a critical component ofsuccess in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that theUnited States doesn’t have long-term designs on it. As I understand it, we’rebuilding some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they’ve got arather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you don’tguard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is…“Wow, maybethey’re interested in our oil.”544 [part0034.html#chapter016fn544]A 2009 investigation by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, or FAIR, revealedthat health insurance and pharmaceutical companies are being run by people whoare also on the board of directors of the biggest media corporations. Out of thetop nine media conglomerates—Disney (ABC), General Electric (NBC), CBS, TimeWarner (CNN, Time), News Corporation (Fox), New York Times Company, WashingtonPost Company (Newsweek), Tribune Company (Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times)and Gannett (USA Today), the only company that did not have board members frominsurance or pharmaceutical corporations was CBS.545[part0034.html#chapter016fn545] These same media giants own and control asurprisingly large number of all the movies, television shows, radio shows,magazines, and newspapers that the public has access to.546[part0034.html#chapter016fn546] This may seem scary—but it is a provable fact.THE CONNECTION BETWEEN NEOCONSERVATIVES AND BIG PHARMAThere is also a clear, provable financial relationship between the health careindustry and the Republican neoconservative faction. The business of fightingthe big health care corporations’ political battles has been quite good.Between January and September 2009, health care interests spent $600 million onlobbying Congress, television commercials and lobbying. $38 million, about themaximum that they could give, went to Congress in campaign contributions…[The]health industry profits in 2008 were $8.4 billion…So they were able to pay theirCEOs average annual salaries of $14 million, and still have enough to give bigstockholders huge profits—and still lobby against the American People.547[part0034.html#chapter016fn547]The evidence became even more compelling in 2009, when the first stage of theObama administration’s Affordable Care Act passed in the US Senate. This quotefrom Populist Daily makes the case very nicely: “Right to the end, theNeoconservative Obstructionists in the Senate fought their hardest for thehealth insurance industry, trying to get every benefit they could—and puttingpressure on all Democratic Senators with any political vulnerability. They firedsalvo after salvo at health care reform.”548 [part0034.html#chapter016fn548]Does this mean that the neocons and their associates actually own the top drug,insurance, and health care companies that are profiting from this corruption?Perhaps. This may be one of the main sources of profit for their faction. Eitherway, the Swiss scientific team led by Dr. Glattfelder used supercomputers toreveal that 147 companies are earning 80 percent of all the money there is to bemade on earth. Of these companies, 75 percent are financial institutions—and thetop Federal Reserve banks are the most powerful members of this highly secretivegroup. These financial institutions would need to heavily invest in the healthcare and insurance industries in order to establish maximum control. Therefore,any serious attempt to defeat the Cabal would require a direct attack againstthe enormous profits of the health care industry. And here’s the problem: Thehealth insurance and pharmaceutical companies also have controlling interests ineight of the top nine media corporations. Therefore, the mainstream media wouldbe very unlikely to tell the public the truth about a war against thepharmaceutical / health care industry—and the massive amount of money that is atstake. Much of the struggle to reduce health care profiteering would need to bedone publicly, through legislation—but the real reason for the war has remaineda closely guarded secret at the time of this writing.When we go back in time by 539 years, we find that a very similar war was beingfought on very similar terms. Once again, we have a nemesis that was plunderingmuch of the public’s wealth—by making the people pay extremely high taxes forthe basic things they needed to survive. Imagine having to pay taxes to aforeign government just to sell your neighbor the vegetables you grew on yourown land. Imagine being threatened with huge fines, imprisonment, torture, andeven death for failing to pay these taxes. This was the situation that wasgripping much of Europe in the 1400s. The nemesis in the 1400s was Germany,specifically the Teutonic Knights. In 2010, the Imperial Teutonic Order websiteboldly stated, “For God, The Holy Reich and The Fatherland!” at the bottom,549[part0034.html#chapter016fn549] though this slogan has since been removed. Inour own cycle, the Cabal seems to be repeating the karma of the German TeutonicKnights. The Federal Reserve Cabal financed and built up Nazi Germany—and thenimported their scientists to the United States after Hitler was defeated. Once Isaw how well my readings predicted the events that were still to come, Irealized that none of these developments were random or unexplained. Those onthe other side of the veil could view our future just as easily as we view thepresent. These tragic events had to be allowed to happen because we had invitedthem by our own free will on a collective level. With this knowledge comes thekey to resolving the outer and inner crises, worldwide. An era of unprecedentedpeace and prosperity awaits us once the great cycles of time are reprogrammedwith the knowingness that we have finally learned the lessons the universe hasspent so many thousands of years trying to teach us."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURRESOLVING THE OUTER AND INNER CRISES[../images/00023.gif]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENCYCLES AND PROPHECIES AT THE END OF THE AGETHE THIRTEEN YEARS’ WARA major political event on December 5, 1453, quickly became the incitingincident for the Thirteen Years’ War, which officially started with a formaldeclaration of war two months later. By this point in time, the politicalclimate in Europe had become extremely tense. Prussian cities and states werebeing heavily taxed by the Teutonic Knights. They were being forced, under painof torture, imprisonment, and death, to pay large fees for the “privilege” ofselling the crops they grew on their own farms. This was causing them realeconomic pain, and it was only getting worse and worse. Families were suffering.Children were starving. The people were groaning under the weight of oppression.In 1453, there was no separation between church and state. The Prussian citiesand states needed to appeal to Frederick III, the Holy Roman Emperor, if theywanted these taxes repealed. However, by December 5, 1453, Frederick had refusedto give them an answer for well over a year. Frederick did not want to tell thePrussian Confederation that he had no interest in helping them solve theirconflict with the Germans, as this was likely to trigger a major conflict.However, on December 5, 1453, Frederick was forced to admit that he would donothing to help them. This was the inciting incident that started the ThirteenYears’ War against Germany’s Teutonic Knights.550[part0034.html#chapter017fn550]BUSH LOSES TO CLINTON WITHIN THIRTY-ONE DAYS OF THE WAR IN THE PREVIOUS CYCLEThe Teutonic Knights’ fate was sealed on this very day, December 5, 1453; theyjust didn’t know it yet. When we look ahead 539 years into the future, we haveDecember 5, 1992. This was just one month—thirty-one days—after George H. W.Bush lost the presidential election to the Democratic candidate, WilliamJefferson Clinton. This was the first time the Republican neoconservativefaction of the Cabal had lost an election to a Democratic rival since 1980.George H. W. Bush had been either vice president or president of the UnitedStates for twelve years by the time Clinton prevailed. Once Bush lost the reinsof executive power, the scope of what the neoconservative faction couldaccomplish was significantly reduced. This eight-year gap in Republicanpolitical dominance gave the Democratic opposition some time to begin mounting acounterattack—as we will see.That being said, I do not believe that Republicans are bad and Democrats aregood. The Cabal has penetrated the American government on many different levels,and there are good guys and bad guys on both sides. Both parties have beencompromised to varying degrees. Therefore, the best way to view this conflict isto see it as a modern battle between warring factions in the Cabal. However, asthey fight against each other and weaken each other, the Cabal’s overall abilityto do harm is reduced.CLINTON’S HEALTH CARE REFORM SYNCHRONIZES WITH PRUSSIAN-POLISH ALLIANCEThe Thirteen Years’ War was triggered shortly after Frederick blatantly refusedto help the Prussian Confederation on December 5, 1453. George H. W. Bush lostthe presidential election within thirty-one days of this event in our own cycle.Once we examine the full context, it definitely seems that the PrussianConfederation synchronizes with the Clinton administration, and the TeutonicKnights synchronize with the neocon faction.The Prussian Confederation knew they needed help fighting the nemesis in orderto stop their people from being robbed and terrorized. The German TeutonicKnights were too powerful, and the Prussian Confederation couldn’t fight themalone. Everyone in Europe was being hurt by these painful taxes and lethalthreats, but old animosities had stopped them from realizing they had a commonenemy. During this time, Poland was the big heavyweight. The PrussianConfederation could not win a war against the Germans without Poland’s help. Inour new cycle, Poland seems to synchronize with the US Congress—a much largerlegislative group, with senators and representatives from all fifty states.Clinton could not win the battle for health care reform without the help of theUS Congress. The Prussian Confederation could not win the battle for tax reformwithout the help of the Polish kingdom.In January 1454, associates from the Prussian Confederation, led by Johannes vonBaysen, approached Casimir IV, the king of Poland, and asked him to absorb theirentire alliance into the Polish kingdom. By pooling their resources, they had areal chance to choke off the Germans from their main source of profits—namely,the huge taxes they were imposing upon the people with violent force. The Polishking was willing to talk it over, but he wanted them to discuss it him in a moreformal meeting so they could work out the details. This initial meeting betweenCasimir IV, von Baysen, and his Prussian Confederation associates took place inJanuary 1454. In our own cycle, this becomes January 1993.Clinton was not sworn into office until January 20, 1993—and his very firstpriority was to attack the health care industry for its exorbitant price gougingand corruption. Derek Bok of Harvard University reveals the trouble that Clintonencountered in this process: “Clinton made health care reform a centerpiece ofhis campaign platform…. True to his word, he moved quickly to address the issue,by announcing early in 1993 that he would assemble a task force of experts toreview the subject—and construct a plan that he could propose to Congress.”551[part0034.html#chapter017fn551]Bill Clinton’s wife, Hillary, was named to head the health-care reform taskforce on January 25, 1993.552 [part0034.html#chapter017fn552] Prussia firstapproached the Polish king to discuss this hitherto-unprecedented alliance thatsame month—539 years earlier.THE FIRST IN-PERSON MEETINGS WERE ONLY THREE DAYS APARTClinton got his first in-person meeting with Congress to seek a formal alliancefor health care reform on February 17, 1993. On February 20, 1454, just threedays later in the previous cycle, von Baysen and the Prussian Confederation gottheir first in-person meeting with Polish king Casimir IV to discuss a formalalliance. This is one of the closest time locks we’ve seen yet. Theirnegotiations were finalized and the Prussian delegates formally pledgedallegiance to the king as of March 6, 1454. Clinton did not have as much luck inour own cycle—at least in terms of the specific issue of health care reform.On March 8, 1993, The New York Times published the article “Looking forAlliance, Clinton Courts the Congress Nonstop.”553[part0034.html#chapter017fn553] Clinton’s health care reform package never didpass in the 1990s, although he did manage to develop a cooperative alliance withCongress in other ways. The Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton assecretary of state, did finally pass the Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct (PPACA) on March 22, 2010—fully seventeen years later. This shows how longthis “war” has raged on.554 [part0034.html#chapter017fn554] Theneoconservative-driven media has dubbed this new plan Obamacare and haspresented it to the people as if it is one of the most diabolically evil actsever committed by the US government. As of March 21, 2013, congressionalRepublicans had made thirty-seven different attempts to repeal PPACA.555[part0034.html#chapter017fn555]A LONG BATTLE WITHOUT ANY MAJOR SUCCESSAfter the Prussian Confederation formed an alliance with Poland in 1454, theyhad a long, difficult fight. For the next eight and a half years, they struggledin vain to defeat Germany—but could not. In our own cycle, Clinton wasconsistently dogged by Republican-fueled scandals during his administration,including the Monica Lewinsky scandal—when he was ultimately forced to admit tohaving sex with an intern in the Oval Office. The “All Is Lost” moment in theLewinsky scandal came when Clinton paid $550,000 to Paula Jones on November 13,1998, in an obvious admission of guilt. Johannes von Baysen, the head of thePrussian alliance, died November 9, 1459, at Marienburg Castle, and wassucceeded by his brother. These events are only four days apart in the 539-yearcycle. I have not yet been able to find any image of von Baysen, but I suspecthe looked very similar to Clinton.A PROPHECY OF THE 2000 ELECTION CRISIS—AND BEYONDEight years after Clinton won his first presidential victory, his administrationhoped to remain in power by having Vice President Al Gore run for office. In avery surreal series of events, the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore wasso tight that a winner could not be determined. The entire nation held itsbreath from November 5 straight through until December 13, when Gore conceded toBush after the Supreme Court voted in Bush’s favor. Not long after, the finalvote tallies from Florida revealed that Gore actually won the 2000 presidentialelection by popular vote—but by that point it was too late.On November 24, 2000, nineteen days before this conflict was resolved, Irealized that I had already posted an accurate prophecy of the outcome on mywebsite, embedded within a psychic reading I had done myself. I first starteddoing readings on November 10, 1996, and had many astonishingly accurateprophecies, but this was the first major one that I had clearly published inadvance on my website before it came true. I had very little awareness of what Iwas saying as the words were being spoken but followed a strict protocol ofpraying that only the highest and purest forms of guidance would come through.This prophecy was originally posted within a larger set of readings on June 23,1999.556 [part0034.html#chapter017fn556] The link to the original content waspreserved by Archive.org on October 2, 1999, and can be found near the bottom ofthe main page as “Global Politics Part Three.”557[part0034.html#chapter017fn557] I rediscovered these prophecies on November 24,2000, and wrote “Prophecy: 2000 Election Crisis Predicted in 1999” that sameday.558 [part0034.html#chapter017fn558] The reading itself was conducted on June17, 1999, at 9:21 A.M. The exact wording of the election prophecy was asfollows: “The vice president looks at this as being partly his own authorship,while not realizing that he is completely naked. The interim period decides thenext victor.”559 [part0034.html#chapter017fn559]I was quite astonished when I read this in the midst of the election crisis. Idid not want to see George W. Bush win, but this prophecy clearly said Gore was“completely naked.” It also indicated there would be an “interim period”—anextended wait—before the “next victor” of the presidential election would beannounced. Further support for this perspective was given in a very deep readingI pulled in on April 22, 1999, at 4:13 A.M., and published on April 29, 1999.560[part0034.html#chapter017fn560] The Internet Archive has a time-encoded snapshotof my homepage from May 8, 1999, shortly after this content was published as “ETGovernment Speaks on Kosovo Issue.”561 [part0034.html#chapter017fn561] You canthen click on the link and read the article itself in its original form, thoughArchive.org unfortunately deleted all duplicate snapshots it had taken prior toApril 9, 2001. This reading, from the very early morning of April 22, 1999,directly referred to the “Bush troops” while Clinton was still president. Italso mentioned the discovery of fully preserved Roman galleons that had justbeen discovered and publicized in the news, and suggested that this event haddeeper symbolic meaning—showing the cycle connections between Rome and our ownpresent.Ever wonder about the banking crisis? The top three most valuable computer gurusin the world still don’t realize how exactly they will be affected by this.

Foryou see that all is One, and this senseless killing and violence must not go on.It needs to be established that there is a solid fact behind why there willnever be a one-world hegemony of these financial powers…. Another issue on thetable is the sudden and spontaneous discovery of perfectly preserved Romangalleons, buried beneath the sands of the ocean of time and now brought backinto the public awareness—as though not a day had passed since they first sank.We want you to understand the profound symbology of this. As David has beenstudying the field of cyclology, he can see that many correlations have alreadybeen made between that of the Roman history and the American history. Eventsoccurring upon similar timetables play themselves out in such a fashion, asdescribed in those works….It is a fundamental fact that a connection has been established between theRoman regime and the United States regime. So too is there a fact that theUnited States regime must collapse and fold, as did Rome, once thought to be thegreatest superpower of the world. When the Roman civilization did collapse, itwas cause for great alarm. Similarly, the greed and desire for limitless profitsis also now fueling the stock market’s increases. As this is seen to fall away,there will be many of those who have placed great faith in the stock market whowill suddenly have all of their earnings vaporized—and be left with stock thatis completely devalued.562 [part0034.html#chapter017fn562]This prophecy about a collapse in the stock market did come true, threedifferent times after this reading: the dot-com collapse of 2000, the post-9/11collapse of 2001, and the Lehman Brothers collapse of 2008. My next articlepicked up with new readings after the point where this one left off—and includedthe prophecy of the election crisis, as we are about to see.A SERIES OF STUNNING READINGS IN 1999The forces speaking through me clearly seemed to be able to peer into the futurewith no difficulty—at times. However, not all of the words in the readings Iposted were 100 percent “clean.” That was a frustrating reality. It was entirelypossible to get data that was not accurate. As one notable example, I washeavily influenced by a then-widespread belief that California might have agiant earthquake in 1998 or 1999, which several guests on the Art Bell show werepredicting. With years’ more experience, it is now a lot easier for me to spotthe best material—and see where the authentic messages were encouraging me tokeep refining and tuning my abilities. The deepest readings always have apoetic, metaphorical quality that the less-accurate readings did not display asstrongly. Everything I have included below appears to be “clean,” based on thebenefit of experience and hindsight, and much of the rest of it is clean aswell. The prophecy of the election crisis is hidden within these passages. Thereis a reference to the Constitution being “in deferment,” again tying in to theelection crisis. We also find clear prophecies of 9/11 and the 2011 Fukushimaearthquake disaster in Japan. The earliest, clickable version of this page stillpreserved by Archive.org is from March 11, 2000.563[part0034.html#chapter017fn563]Sunday 5/23/99—4:49 A.M.

You simply now findyourselves in a position where the cycle’s time has come up, and you must beginmaking very serious decisions about who you are—and what you are doing here.566[part0034.html#chapter017fn566]This next published excerpt is from October 1, 1999. Archive.org’s earliestcapture of it is from March 4, 2000.567 [part0034.html#chapter017fn567] We areclearly told that there will ultimately be a moment on earth that will transformhow we see reality “in a matter of minutes,” and that we are not to fear thischange. However, other aspects of the “frequency change” will be slow enoughthat many people will not even realize that anything different is happening.Many will choose to react with fear—particularly as the Cabal becomesever-increasingly visible and exposed.This transformation…is obviously of the deepest and most spiritual sort…. So donot fear them, but simply come to accept the system changes as positive. It is aboldly positive moment on your planet, a moment that will dissolvepreconceptions and alter existing judgments through stamina in a matter ofminutes.We cannot be more clear about telling you that everything is coming to a head.You need to be aware of this on the most fundamental level possible….Even though the content of these readings tends to be quite grandiose anddifficult to believe, it is nevertheless the truth….What follows will be the most intense periods you have ever seen. Do not fearthem…. What we have here is not a bunch of children playing with matches, but abunch of budding God-Selves starting to realize their own abilities and powers.We don’t know whether those on your planet will become more aware of thisfrequency change or not. But you yourself, having studied this material, canindeed rest easy, with confidence, that even as everyone around you is freakingout in a panic, you yourself already know that everything is perfectly onschedule. And with that realization comes the intimate knowledge of your ownprotection and safety.We do remind you again that you are loved more than you could ever possiblyimagine.568 [part0034.html#chapter017fn568]September 4, 1999, featured a prophecy suggesting there will be a massextraterrestrial contact in our future—and this will be seen as a very positiveevent, not as an “alien invasion.”569 [part0034.html#chapter017fn569] I am wellaware that some people, particularly religious fundamentalists, may see this asa demonic event, but my own work with these people has convinced me that themajority of people visiting us from outside the earth are of positiveorientation. I discussed other prophecies of such a mass contact event, sometime after the year 2012, at the end of The Source Field Investigations.When the discs are made visible in daylight, all will then see how the hiddenstrings are being pulled, and who is responsible for these aerialvisitations—certainly not flocks of geese, swamp gas and the like. Rest assuredthat under the most adverse and difficult circumstances, there will be miraclesthe likes of which never before have been seen. We will come with an armada ofspaceships, glistening in the morning light, prepared to do whatever isnecessary to protect you from any and all hardships….You yourselves know that when you want to, you can call upon your own higherspiritual force through prayer. Since we are your guardians, it is ourresponsibility to insure that when the free will has been granted, theappearance will be made. Understand that this has happened many of your times inthe past, wherein open communication has existed between those of humanity andthose from the stars. It should not be much of a surprise to you that we arereadying for this again, only that you can see how it is that there are thosewho still would resist this contact through their own sense of fear andforeboding of some imminent mock alien invasion or the like….When you start seeing yourselves as a social entity as well as a spiritualentity, you will realize the utter futility and nonsense of classism, genderism,racism and the like….We leave you with the notion that the fruit of the vine can produce the purestwine, or the sourest of vinegar. It is up to you how you will decide to milkyour own fruits of the Spirit, so that the lamb may again come and choose to liein your pasture, radiating peace, serenity and believability that there isindeed a Oneness.570 [part0034.html#chapter017fn570]There is much to contemplate in these readings—and what makes it even moreinteresting was that some of the prophecies have already come true, whereas themost grandiose-sounding ones obviously have not, at least at the time of thiswriting. It appears that all of us have access to some higher aspect ofourselves that can peer through time as easily as we look through awindow—thanks to the dynamic interplay of cycles. In the next chapter we willcontinue exploring how this new science of cyclical time may help to validatethe many prophecies I have received about this coming change over the years. The9/11 is only one of a series of events that seem to have reappeared 539 yearsafter the Thirteen Years’ War. Once we see how the political struggles of theThirteen Years’ War apply to current events, we have the potential to gaindeeper insights into the behind-the-scenes war that has been fought against theCabal for many years in our own recent history."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN9/11 AND THE DEFEAT OF THE CABAL: THE CYCLE PERSPECTIVEGeorge W. Bush was inaugurated as president in January 2001, which was aseemingly decisive victory for the neocon faction. During a comparable timeperiod in the Thirteen Years’ War, the Polish alliance still had not been ableto prevail against the Germans. That finally changed in the Battle of Swiecinoon September 17, 1462. This battle was just six days away from 9/11 in our owncycle. It was the first time the alliance had ever scored a decisive victoryagainst the imperialist German Teutonic Knights. The crossovers with our owntime period do have key differences in terms of who attacked first, but theparallels are very interesting.Although we do see specific crossovers between the Thirteen Years’ War and thestruggle for health care reform, the real battle appears to be a secret war tocut off the financial blood supply to the neocon faction. We have alreadysurveyed some of the evidence suggesting 9/11 may have been deliberately plannedby the neocon faction. The neocon faction appears to be repeating the karma ofthe German Teutonic Knights from the last cycle. This context becomes extremelysignificant when we explore the connections between the Battle of Swiecino and9/11.THE BATTLE OF SWIECINO: A BLUEPRINT FOR THE DEFEAT OF THE CABALThe Battle of Swiecino, which was fought on September 17, 1462, was consideredthe most important turning point in the Thirteen Years’ War. The incitingincident for the war occurred on December 5, 1453, when Frederick finallystated, in writing, that he would not help the Prussian Confederation againstthe Germans. This, again, occurred a month after George H. W. Bush lost the 1992election in our own cycle.In the Battle of Swiecino, the alliance struck first. The Germans did not havetime to devise an effective counterattack strategy once they were hit with thefull brunt of this assault. The Germans came under very heavy crossbow fire fromthe Polish infantry, causing huge losses. Many of the German soldiers beganfleeing. The German commander Raveneck ordered his soldiers to stop running anddemanded that they charge one last time. This was an utter disaster, as far asthe German side was concerned. Crossbow arrows rained down on them withferocious effectiveness, like the thunderbolts of the gods. Every German soldierdied, surrendered, or escaped—and Raveneck himself died from a crossbow wound.The Teutonic side suffered more than a thousand casualties, losing ten times asmany men as the alliance did in the initial heat of battle. The Polish army oftwo thousand mercenaries decisively defeated the twenty-seven hundredmercenaries in the Teutonic Knights’ army. Let’s take a look and see what wefind: “The psychological significance [of this battle] was that this was thefirst open field battle won by the royal forces—so it increased the morale ofthe Polish forces, and lowered the morale of the Teutonic Knights. Many militaryhistorians say that the battle of Swiecino was the turning point of the ThirteenYears’ War—leading to the final victory in 1466.”571[part0034.html#chapter018fn571]This battle also recaptured critical territory, allowing the alliance to cut theTeutonic supply chain from Western Europe to Prussia, which significantlyweakened them financially.THE FINAL COLLAPSE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS—AND HURRICANE KATRINAAmazingly, there was only a six-day gap between the Battle of Swiecino and 9/11within the 539-year quarter cycle. However, this was not the end of the ThirteenYears’ War—it was merely the key turning point when the momentum of the warshifted in favor of the Polish alliance. How does the rest of the war in the1400s line up with our own recent past?Although the Teutonic Knights suffered a critical defeat in the 1462 battle ofSwiecino, it took another four years for their control system to finallycrumble. The final tipping point was when Warmia, which had been holding out theentire time, finally decided to join the alliance and fight. This next entry isfrom Wikipedia and is the most detailed resource available about this allianceonline.In 1466 the Prince-Bishop of Warmia, Paul von Legensdorf, decided to join thePolish forces—and declare war on the Teutonic Knights. Polish forces under Duninwere finally also able to capture Konitz on September 28, 1466. The Polishsuccesses caused the exhausted Teutonic Order to seek new negotiations…. The newmediator was Pope Paul II. With help from the papal legate, Rudolf vonRudesheim, the Second Peace of Thorn was signed on October 10, 1466.572[part0034.html#chapter018fn572]The final battle that wiped out the strength and morale of the Teutonic Knightswas on September 28, 1466. This brings us to September 28, 2005, in the nextquarter cycle. September 28, 2005, was just twenty-six days after HurricaneKatrina critically defeated the Bush administration, irreversibly destroyingtheir support base. Hurricane Katrina was much more destructive than 9/11,wiping out an entire American city—and it was as significant a disaster as 9/11in the political sense. The Bush administration’s response to the crisis was soridiculously inadequate that it would appear they wanted to see the city of NewOrleans transformed into total anarchy. According to the insiders I spoke with,this is exactly what they wanted.THE SUPERDOME BECOMES A GIANT DEATH TRAPThe New Orleans levees broke on August 29, 2005, flooding the entire city inwater so deep that some people drowned in their own homes as they tried to swimup through their attic ceilings. The people of New Orleans were told to flee tothe Superdome for their own safety and that they would be taken care of oncethey got inside. Once everyone had gathered, huge chains were placed over allthe doors, locking them in from the outside with very little food, very littlewater, very little sanitation, and no hope of escape for four full days. TheNational Guard did not arrive to help people who were stranded in the Superdomeuntil Friday, September 2.573 [part0034.html#chapter018fn573]How could this disaster response possibly have taken so long, considering thatfighter jets, helicopters, and supply vehicles could have been deployed as soonas they went inside? The public did not know why this was done—and due to theSheep Effect, most of them probably did not want to know. Nonetheless, thisfailing revealed that the Bush administration was woefully incompetent, at thevery least—despite how much they championed the need for greater nationalsecurity in the wake of 9/11.Before this event, more than one insider with access to highly classifiedinformation had told me that the sociopathic Cabal built large sports arenas inevery major city for a reason—to form massive internment camps. This was part ofa plan that went back at least as far as the 1960s. The Cabal planned to usethese arenas during a mass catastrophe that they would engineer, hoping toreduce population and declare martial law. Although it seems impossible tobelieve that any person or group could be this sociopathic, this does sound likea souped-up, large-scale version of a Nazi concentration camp, disguised asnothing more than a humble sports arena. I was told that the Cabal had along-standing plan to create mass chaos and starvation in America, herd peopleinto sports arenas, lock them inside, and prevent anyone from escaping. Withinless than two weeks, everyone inside would die of starvation and dehydration.The sociopathic Cabal could secretly film the entire horrific process with theinstant-replay cameras mounted inside the arena. I had already been warned aboutthe arenas before Katrina but unfortunately never published this information onmy website. After Katrina, I met other insiders who confirmed the existence ofthis same plan.COMPLETE BLOCKAGE OF ALL EMERGENCY SUPPLIESNot long after Katrina, while I was still living in Milton, Kentucky, I spokewith a telephone representative for my car insurance company, which is one ofthe top carriers in America. Once she found out what I was interested in, shetold me, somewhat reluctantly, that their company had sent two fulleighteen-wheel trucks to New Orleans. These trucks were piled to the ceilingwith a treasure trove of emergency supplies for natural disasters—bottled water,toilet paper, bandages, medical supplies, storable food, clothing, bedding,dishes, silverware, and so forth. She told me that both trucks were stopped bythe Federal Emergency Management Association, or FEMA, before they could everreach the areas that were hardest hit by Katrina. Even worse, FEMA officialscompletely emptied both trucks and confiscated the materials inside. The truckswere then turned around and sent back, empty—and the insurance company wasordered to say nothing about what had happened. The representative told me hercompany was considering mounting a very public lawsuit against FEMA and the Bushadministration for the criminal theft of their supplies to cover the cost ofreplacing all the lost goods and to expose a much greater humanitarian crime.This lawsuit never materialized—but this story was soon validated by other,similar accounts that appeared in the mainstream media. This next excerpt comesfrom a September 5, 2005, article in The New York Times.Furious state and local officials insisted that the real problem was that theFederal Emergency Management Agency, which Mr. Chertoff’s department oversees,failed to deliver urgently needed help and, through incomprehensible red tape,even thwarted others’ efforts to help. “We wanted soldiers, helicopters, foodand water,” said Denise Bottcher, press secretary for Gov. Kathleen BabineauxBlanco of Louisiana. “They wanted to negotiate an organizational chart.”…“Why did it happen? Who needs to be fired?” asked Aaron Broussard, president ofJefferson Parish, south of New Orleans. Far from deferring to state or localofficials, FEMA asserted its authority and made things worse, Mr. Broussardcomplained on “Meet the Press.” When Wal-Mart sent three trailer trucks loadedwith water, FEMA officials turned them away, he said. Agency workers preventedthe Coast Guard from delivering 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel, and on Saturdaythey cut the parish’s emergency communications line—leading the sheriff torestore it, and post armed guards to protect it from FEMA, Mr. Broussard said….Dr. Ross Judice, chief medical officer for a large ambulance company, recountedhow on Tuesday, unable to find out when helicopters would land to pick upcritically-ill patients at the Superdome, he walked outside and discovered thattwo helicopters, donated by an oil services company, had been waiting in theparking lot.574 [part0034.html#chapter018fn574]A STUNNING DEFEAT FOR THE NEOCONSERVATIVE FACTIONHillary Clinton, a modern-day representative of the Prussian-Polish alliance inthe previous quarter cycle, soon called for an independent investigation ofthese astonishing crimes. She wanted a comprehensive inquiry, not controlled bythe government, that was similar in size and scope to what had occurred after9/11.575 [part0034.html#chapter018fn575] Gasoline prices increased by atremendous amount in the aftermath of Katrina as well, settling at roughly $4 agallon—ostensibly because of damage to oil refineries in the Gulf of Mexico—andthey never went back down to their former levels, which were less than $2 agallon. This provided the neoconservative faction with a much-needed infusion ofquick cash in the hope of staving off their financial defeat a little longer.Not surprisingly, August 2005 was the last time that any major poll reported amajority of the American people supporting Bush or his policies.576[part0034.html#chapter018fn576]Katrina was the key turning point. It was a landmark political defeat for theneoconservative faction. This crushing loss for the neoconservative factionoccurred within twenty-six days of when the Teutonic Knights were wiped out inthe previous quarter cycle, on September 28, 1466. The alignment between thesetwo political events becomes even greater when we see that Senator Clinton didnot seek a vote for an independent inquiry into these appalling governmentfailures until Wednesday, September 14, 2005.577 [part0034.html#chapter018fn577]This was just two weeks away from when the Teutonic Knights were defeated in theprevious quarter cycle. Even though Hillary Clinton’s proposed inquiry neverwent through, it nonetheless sank in with voters and triggered a massive defeatin the polling booths the following year.In 1466, the critical defeat of the Teutonic Knights did not occur until thepeople of Warmia finally decided to stand and fight. Perhaps the long-reluctantpeople of Warmia correspond, in our timeline, to the Republicans who wanted tosupport the Bush administration as long as they possibly could but eventuallyrealized they could not agree with the administration’s policies any longer. Theneoconservative alliance quickly began to crumble after Katrina, leading tobickering, infighting, and betrayal, whereas until this time they had alwaysstood in solidarity with one another.GERMAN DEFEAT CORRESPONDS TO LAME-DUCK PRESIDENCY IN 2006–2008Poland finally signed a peace treaty with the German Teutonic Knights on October10, 1466, ending the war. This corresponds to October 10, 2005, in the nextquarter cycle. Nothing significant appears to have happened during this timeother than the fact that no independent inquiry ever occurred, and the wholestory about the government’s failed response to Hurricane Katrina was dropped.This was exasperating to the public, who certainly had not forgotten the horrorsof Hurricane Katrina that they had lived through or watched on their televisionscreens. Poll numbers plummeted for Bush as well as all levels of government inthe aftermath of Katrina.578 [part0034.html#chapter018fn578] Seventy-six percentof the public wanted an independent commission to investigate the federalgovernment’s response to the disaster.579 [part0034.html#chapter018fn579] Thefinal loss for the neoconservative faction didn’t become fully visible until2006 in the voting booths—where the Republican Party lost six seats in theSenate, twenty-seven seats in the House of Representatives, and six stategovernorships.580 [part0034.html#chapter018fn580] This created a lame-duckpresidency for the last two years of George W. Bush’s term and severelyrestricted the ability of the neoconservative faction to force their agenda uponthe people. Even in 2009, the Gallup Poll was reporting serious declines inRepublican Party support among all demographic groups except frequentchurchgoers, conservatives, and senior citizens—and admitted that “most of theloss in support actually occurred beginning in 2005, after HurricaneKatrina…which created major public relations problems for the administration.”581 [part0034.html#chapter018fn581]OVERLAPS BETWEEN THE QUARTER CYCLE AND ZODIAC CYCLELet’s not forget that the 539-year quarter cycle is not the only energeticinfluence that is affecting American politics. The zodiac cycle was stillcausing events from Roman history to reappear in the United States as well,fully 2,160 years later. The Lusitanian War began in 155 B.C., when theLusitanians raided Hispania Ulterior (Farther Spain).582[part0034.html#chapter018fn582] This also inspired the Celtiberian tribes ofHispania Citerior (Nearer Spain) to rebel, and the following year, in 154 B.C.,they formed a confederacy with neighboring towns and began building a defensivewall against Rome.583 [part0034.html#chapter018fn583] Therefore, by 154 B.C.,Rome was fighting dangerous wars in two different Spanish territories—and thiscorresponds to the year 2006 in modern times. As we remember, the politicallyneutered neoconservative faction was unable to attack Iran in 2006—even afterissuing a formal declaration of war. They had already lost the political will tocreate change after their shocking attempts to turn Katrina into a massive deathtrap for the people of New Orleans. They continued to hold office until the endof their term in 2008, but their power was effectively checkmated by the massivedefeat their Republican cohorts suffered in the 2006 elections, creating alame-duck presidency.Rome’s war against Carthage from 149 to 146 B.C. in the Age of Aries nowreappears in our own era as the years 2011 to 2014. This carries us through theAge of Pisces, over the long-awaited end of the 25,920-year cycle, and directlyinto the Age of Aquarius. We have already seen how Carthage in the Age of Ariesdirectly corresponded to Germany in the Age of Pisces. Now we are also seeing aclear connection between Germany in the last quarter cycle and theneoconservative faction in modern times. This creates a double reinforcement ofthe connection between Germany and the neoconservative faction within thesecycles. This is quite understandable once we see how Prescott Bush financiallysupported Hitler, bankrolled a failed fascist coup attempt in 1933, and wasundoubtedly involved in the transfer of more than seven hundred top Naziscientists to America immediately after Hitler’s defeat.The Law of One series, the Cayce readings, my own intuitive readings, and a hostof ancient prophecies all suggest that life on earth will transition into a farmore peaceful, harmonious, and evolved level as we move into the Age ofAquarius. The highly credentialed historians de Santillana and von Dechendcompellingly argued that dozens of ancient myths around the world were secretlyencoded with information about this 25,920-year cycle. They urged us to studythe 25,920-year cycle of precession and revealed it would usher in a Golden Age.As we are now seeing, the 25,920-year cycle is indeed the Synchronicity Key; itis the mainspring of the cosmic clock. The Great Year is driving cycles thatsteer our destiny with astonishing precision. I suspect that we have barelyscratched the surface of understanding how far-reaching and powerful thesecycles are. It is also important to mention that the villains in the Book ofLife are not permitted to continue harming others indefinitely. The hero’sjourney structure of archetypes includes an absolute defeat of the nemesis—whichcan be quite gruesome. Karma is often repaid in a very dramatic fashion—and noone is exempt from the great wheelwork of time. However, if we continue to meetviolence with violence, the same cycles may need to continue repeating. Throughforgiveness, we demonstrate that we are ready to graduate into a never and muchmore evolved form of thinking, feeling, and being."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENHISTORY GETS A WICKED CASE OF DÉJÀ VUWe are accustomed to thinking of time as linear, believing that the events thathappen in the present are not influenced by the past. The Synchronicity Keyreveals that time may be structured like a series of circles, overlapping oneanother in a repeating spiral. The biggest circle is the 25,920-year “wobble” ofthe earth’s axis in the precession. In August 2012, I finally found compellingevidence that our sun is orbiting a neighboring star, thanks to WalterCruttenden’s epic book Lost Star of Myth and Time. The energy fields of thisneighboring star create distinct regions of space that affect our collectivebehavior as we move through them.There appear to be twelve major regions, corresponding to the twelve Ages of theZodiac. Each of these regions is then further subdivided into four evenly spacedzones, forming the 539-year quarter cycles. Each of these cycles can bevisualized as a circle. Each time we reach the same point in the circle asbefore, we experience energetic bleed-throughs from events that occurred thelast time. In a quarter cycle, one circle would take us 539 years to movethrough.However, since our solar system is also moving forward through the galaxy at thesame time, these circles must also be extended into corkscrew-shaped spirals. Itis tempting to think that these circles will always stay the same width, formingcycles that will always be the same length, but let’s not forget that they areforming in three-dimensional space. It is therefore possible that some spiralsmay be expanding away from a single point or contracting toward a single pointin nice, neat geometric intervals. The factor of “seven times” that Jehoshuaspoke about in Matthew 18:21–22 may represent one ratio for how fast they expandor contract.[../images/00024.gif]Fig. 14 [part0006.html#l14]: The 540/539-year cycle could divide a sphere with a2,160-year circumference into a four. sided cube shape.This is exactly what Michèl Helmer discovered. Not all cycles are perfectlyround. Some of them expand or contract in very precise geometric ratios—such asa growth factor of seven. The most stunning example of this can be seen when wecompare the French Revolution of 1789 to the Russian Revolution of 1917. Inorder to see the shocking parallels, all we have to do is expand one year ofFrench history into seven years of Russian history. François Masson revealedmany of these astonishing connections in the translation of his book I posted onmy website.THE DOWNFALL OF ROBESPIERREThe French Revolution was one of the worst mass atrocities ever committedagainst a people by its own government—dwarfing the events of Hurricane Katrinain their magnitude and severity. Maximilien de Robespierre was a French lawyerand politician and one of the most influential figures of the French Revolution.There is extensive documentation in William T. Still’s epic work New WorldOrder: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies that the French Revolution was oneof the greatest historical examples of the Cabal deliberately creating a massatrocity by systematically cutting the supply lines of food, water, medicine andother essentials to the people, while simultaneously collapsing their economy sotheir money became worthless. Robespierre sang the virtues of revolutionarygovernment and argued that a government’s terrorism against its own starvingdetractors was a virtuous, necessary, and inevitable reality.If virtue be the spring of a popular government in times of peace, the spring ofthat government during a revolution is virtue combined with terror: virtue,without which terror is destructive; terror, without which virtue is impotent.Terror is only justice prompt, severe and inflexible; it is then an emanation ofvirtue…. To punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency; to forgive them iscruelty.584 [part0034.html#chapter019fn584]Robespierre’s stirring speeches compelled the French government to formallyinstitute terrorism against its people as a legal policy on September 5, 1793.This came to be known as the Reign of Terror, and many innocent, starving peoplewere tortured and executed as a result. Robespierre also tried to convince thepublic to embrace an Illuminati-type religion that he called the Cult of theSupreme Being. He organized a major public festival on the Christian holiday ofthe Pentecost, June 8, 1794. This was the first time the public had ever seenRobespierre. He constructed a small, symbolic mountain in the middle of thefestival and walked down the mountain in a manner that was clearly intended toremind people of Moses carrying the stone tablets. One of Robespierre’scolleagues, Jacques-Alexis Thuriot, was heard saying, “Look at the bugger; it’snot enough for him to be master, he has to be God.”585[part0034.html#chapter019fn585]Karma struck quickly. Just one month and five days later, Robespierre and histop cohorts were charged with conspiracy to commit acts of terror and sentencedto death. Robespierre tried to shoot himself in the head with a pistol butsucceeded only in shattering his lower jaw. Robespierre’s brother Augustinjumped out a window and shattered both his legs. Philippe Le Bas committedsuicide, and another of Robespierre’s co-conspirators shot himself in the head.After shattering his jaw with the pistol, Robespierre lay there on the tablebleeding profusely, awaiting his execution, until a doctor was brought in tostop the bleeding by wrapping a handkerchief around his jaw. Robespierre wasguillotined, without trial, the next day—July 28, 1794. The executioner tore offthe bandage that was holding his shattered jaw together to prepare his neck forthe blade, causing him to scream in agony until he was decapitated.586[part0034.html#chapter019fn586]THE DOWNFALL OF JOSEPH STALINLet’s fast-forward now to the merciless Soviet dictator and mass murderer JosephStalin, who was responsible for the deaths of millions of people and theoperation of prison gulags, which were equivalent to concentration camps. OnFebruary 28, 1953, Stalin went out on an all-night dinner and movie trip withhis interior minister Lavrentiy Beria, as well as Georgy Malenkov, NikolaiBulganin, and Nikita Khrushchev. All four men accompanied Stalin back to hishome that night. Stalin did not appear from his room at dawn, and his guardswere given strict orders not to go inside.Stalin was not discovered until ten o’clock that same night, March 1, 1953. Hewas found lying on his back, drenched in his own stale urine, and utteringstrange, unintelligible sounds. Stalin was believed to have suffered a stroke.He became bedridden, quickly deteriorated, and died on March 5, 1953. In 2003, ajoint group of Russian and American historians concluded that Stalin had beenassassinated with a powerful, flavorless rat poison known as warfarin. Stalin’sautopsy revealed severe hemorrhaging in his heart, gastrointestinal tract, andkidneys, which does not happen in a normal stroke but does happen when a humanbody is given warfarin.587 [part0034.html#chapter019fn587] Malenkov, Bulganin,and Khrushchev all became Soviet premiers, and each of them was with Stalin thenight he fell ill. Both Beria and Khrushchev were in a perfect position to addthe poison to Stalin’s wine the night they went out to dinner with him.588[part0034.html#chapter019fn588] In his 1993 political memoirs, VyacheslavMolotov claimed that Beria told him, with pride, that he personally assassinatedStalin that night.589 [part0034.html#chapter019fn589] A power struggle for whowould succeed Stalin lasted from 1953 until 1958, when Khrushchev finally wonout over his rivals.THE CYCLE CONNECTION BETWEEN ROBESPIERRE AND STALINMichèl Helmer found astonishing connections between the French Revolution andthe Bolshevik Revolution by expanding one year in France to seven years inRussia. The French Revolution began on July 14, 1789. The Bolsheviks achievedtheir initial victory in the Russian Revolution on November 14, 1917. Once wehave these two dates—July 14, 1789, and November 14, 1917—we have our startingpoints. Then we can take any date in the French Revolution and count how manydays had gone by since the revolution started on July 14, 1789. We then multiplythis number of days by 7. Once we have the number, we add it to the start-dateof the Russian Revolution—November 14, 1917. This gives us an exact date intwentieth-century Russian history.Once Helmer did the homework, he found that many events in the French Revolutionexpanded perfectly into the Russian Revolution within only days of each other.François Masson believed the most stunning example of all was the timing betweenthe violent deaths of Robespierre and Stalin, both of whom clearly representterrorist Cabal leaders.590 [part0034.html#chapter019fn590] Once we do the math,the exact date of Robespierre’s execution becomes February 22, 1953, in the newRussian cycle. Joseph Stalin was apparently poisoned by Beria and his cohortsonly six days later, on the evening of February 28, 1953.Many more specifics can be found in Masson’s book on my website. What surprisedme the most was that Masson used this system to predict that Russia wouldcollapse eleven years after he finished writing the book in 1980: “Applying the[1 to 7] ratio tells us that the Soviet regime will end in late 1990 or early1991. These three dates show up on the chart of the precessional cycle—markingthe start and finish of mass movements.”591 [part0034.html#chapter019fn591] TheUSSR didn’t actually collapse until August of 1991, but this was still withinmonths of the prediction Masson had made.TIME TO TAKE THIS MORE SERIOUSLYI was quite surprised to hold this yellowing, typewritten manuscript from 1980in my hands and realize that Masson had been able to make such a stunningprediction. The American corporate media gave no indication that the SovietUnion was on the verge of collapsing until it actually happened. The Cabalneeded an epic nemesis to keep the people in perpetual fear of a nuclear warthat could destroy all life on earth. And yet, once we see how many events inthe French Revolution transferred into the Russian Revolution, the downfall ofthe USSR seemed all but inevitable.This was a very invigorating finding. Cycles of expansion and contraction aremuch harder to find than cycles that repeat by the same number of years from oneturn of the Wheel of Karma to the next. This is another area in whichsupercomputer power could be very helpful, once we can develop a means of usingthis method to analyze similar events in different times of history. However,this method and artificial intelligence will never experience the power ofsynchronicity as Jung, Einstein, and several of the top quantum physics pioneersunderstood it to be. Is it possible that someone could discover many more ofthese cycles, completely independently? Is it also possible that thesediscoveries might be completely independent of Helmer and Masson?PROFESSOR ANATOLY FOMENKO DRAMATICALLY EXPANDS THE INVESTIGATIONMuch to my amazement, I found that a scientist had indeed independentlydiscovered these same cycles of history, apparently in much greater detail thanHelmer or Masson ever did. Back in the year 2000, after I’d already publishedMasson’s book on my website, I found a key article in Saturday Night, which hasbeen Canada’s leading national magazine since 1887.592[part0034.html#chapter019fn592] Timothy Taylor wrote an article entitled “TimeWarp,” which discussed the work of a prominent Russian mathematician namedAnatoly Fomenko and his colleagues. As it turns out, Fomenko was not the firstRussian to discover repeating patterns in history: “The movement [to study thecycles of time] in Russia began with Nikolai Morozov (1854–1946), the rebel sonof a nobleman…. Morozov spent his hard time poring over chronology textsand…drew up functions showing that the pattern of the Old Testament Judaic kingsfrom Rehoboam to Zedekiah matched [up] almost precisely [with] the pattern ofRoman Emperors from Alcinius to Justinian II—over 1,000 years later.”593[part0034.html#chapter019fn593]Morozov was a prominent Russian scientist who wrote seven large volumes ofinvestigative research on this unique subject.594[part0034.html#chapter019fn594] According to Fomenko, Morozov used “the latestdiscoveries in mathematics, astronomy, linguistics, philology and geology” tomake his case, and the first of these seven large volumes appeared in the year1926. Fomenko and other young mathematicians at Moscow State University becamecaptivated by Morozov’s research in the 1970s. They sought to verify and furtherdevelop Morozov’s model. Fomenko conducted this investigation for many years andeventually published his first academic paper on the subject in 1994.595[part0034.html#chapter019fn595] Fomenko significantly enhanced the case byblending in written records for all of recorded Western history. He carried theinvestigation all the way back to the dawn of written history—the Sumerian claytablets, which date back to 4000 B.C.Fomenko used [Morozov’s] model to compare historical dynasties across astaggering range of data. He began by compiling a complete list [ofdynasties]…from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 1800, drawing from all the nations and empiresof Western and Eastern Europe, and stretching back into antiquity—through Roman,Greek, biblical and Egyptian history. Comparing one to another in every possibleway, including differing accounts of the same dynasties, Fomenko foundmathematically what Morozov had sketched…. Several dozen pairs of dynastiespreviously thought to be utterly different had proximity coefficients that werevery small. In other words, they were as close as your two brothers’ differentversions of your family tree.596 [part0034.html#chapter019fn596]The wording in this excerpt is fairly technical, but the underlying concept isquite simple. Timothy Taylor is telling us that “several dozen” periods ofhistory have repeated—far more precisely than most people could ever imagine.These patterns appear throughout all the nations and empires of Western andEastern Europe as well as Rome, Greece, Egypt, China, and the Bible across astaggering fifty-eight-hundred-year gulf of time. Although this data set doesnot appear to include Australian, African, South American, or modern Americanhistory, it is still quite immense in scope and covers the vast majority ofsurviving historical records that are available.This was only one method that Fomenko used to analyze history. Another methodinvolved specific number crunching of hundreds of original written records thathave survived from these various intertwining civilizations. Specifically,Fomenko analyzed how many words were used to write about these civilizations andhow many pages the records were written on. This allowed him to create amathematical function in order to see how closely the written records related toeach other. He found that in some cases, when two countries had a similarpattern of historic events, their written histories were also very similar:“Fomenko claims to have found and confirmed repeating patterns between ancientand medieval Rome, and several instances where periods of the Old Testamentappear statistically identical to stretches of medieval Roman-Germanhistory-from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries.”597[part0034.html#chapter019fn597]STRONG CYCLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BYZANTINE-ROMAN AND ENGLISH HISTORYFomenko is only one of a whole team of scientists who are now working on thisresearch. Some of their papers can be read at New-Tradition.org. When I wentback and revisited this website in March 2013, I studied a very complex paperFomenko wrote in 2002 in which he noticed how events in Byzantine Roman historywere reappearing as very similar events in the British Empire.598[part0034.html#chapter019fn598] In Section 3, “Parallels Between English andByzantine-Roman History,” Fomenko finds very strong cyclical connections betweenthree periods of Byzantine-Roman history and English history.The first cycle shows events in Byzantine-Roman history, from A.D. 378 to 553,duplicating as events in English history from A.D. 640 to 830. Fomenko saysthese events are repeating by a cycle of “approximately 275 years.” The secondcycle reveals how events in Byzantine-Roman history from A.D. 553 to 880 areappearing in English history from A.D. 800 to 1040. Once again, these eventswere “approximately 275 years” apart—and this time the connections were sostrong that Fomenko concluded this happened in a “rigid” form.Let’s talk about these first two cycles before we discuss the third one. Oneimportant clue is that Fomenko admitted the 275-year cycle was only“approximate.” The historical records may not be perfect in all of these cases,and a certain degree of guesswork may be involved. What if the “ideal” cyclelength turns out to be a mere five and a half years shorter, at 269.5 years?This is exactly half the length of our old friend the 539-year Age of the Zodiacquarter cycle. This cycle perfectly linked Joan of Arc to the student revolutionin France, within days of accuracy. This same cycle also revealed that 9/11 waslinked to a decisive defeat of the Germans in the Battle of Swiecino, againwithin days of accuracy. It also connected the Prussian-Polish alliance of the1400s to the Democrats in modern American history, and the German TeutonicKnights to the Republican neoconservatives in several key instances. Thisincluded George H. W. Bush’s loss of the election, Clinton’s campaign for healthcare reform, 9/11, and the political defeat of the Republican neoconservativefaction in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.The third cycle Fomenko discovered was a “rigid 120-year shift” between Englishhistorical events in the period A.D. 1040 to 1327, and Byzantine-Romanhistorical events from A.D. 1143 to 1453. This number immediately caught myattention. There are 360 degrees in a circle, and if you draw an equilateraltriangle in the circle, each side of the triangle will be 120 degrees. Let’s notforget that in Helmer’s model, every cycle of history is a perfect subdivisionof the Great Year of 25,920 earth years. The number 120, as a cycle length, fitsperfectly into Helmer’s model. There are exactly 216 cycles of 120 years in themaster number of 25,920 years. Furthermore, in each Age of the Zodiac there areexactly eighteen cycles of 120 years. Once we divide the Age of the Zodiac cyclein half, we get 1,080 years. You can fit exactly nine cycles of 120 years intothe Age of the Zodiac half cycle.[../images/00025.gif]Fig. 15 [part0006.html#l15]: A triangle naturally divides a circle into three120-degree segments.Therefore, Fomenko’s new cycles, which he discovered through extensivescientific analysis, are a perfect fit with Helmer’s original model. This mayseem impossible and outrageous, but to me, the reason why both sets ofresearchers have discovered similar cycles is because this is how the universereally works. Fomenko hacked the source code of history and found totally newdata that completely validates Helmer and Masson’s findings, as well as the morerecent examples featured in this book.A SINGLE, LARGE PATTERN THAT REPEATS FOUR TIMESFomenko’s most mind-blowing accomplishment was his discovery of “a single largepattern that repeats four times” across a thirty-two-hundred-year gap, from 1600B.C. to A.D. 1600: “[Fomenko’s] most startling assertion emerges from efforts tomap dozens of these ‘discovered’ duplications [of historical events and writtentexts]…. Specifically, there is a stretch from about 1600 B.C. to A.D. 1600 thatmay be mathematically deconstructed to reveal a single large pattern—thatrepeats four times.”599 [part0034.html#chapter019fn599]We will come back to this cycle in just a minute, as it ultimately makes aperfect fit with Helmer and Masson’s model. First, however, we will discuss ahigh-profile endorsement that Fomenko’s work received from one of the topthinkers in Russia.FOMENKO’S DATA ENDORSED BY THE WORLD’S STRONGEST CHESS PLAYERFomenko’s data is so vast in scope that it’s like an incredibly complex chessgame. You have to study countless numbers of different pieces and analyze thehuge variety of ways their “moves” could intertwine with each other. Nothingshort of a grand master chess player’s mind is required in order to read andunderstand what they’ve discovered. According to Chess.com, Gary Kasparov hasheld the top position on the Official World Chess Federation’s list twenty-threetimes and was rated as “the strongest player ever” after his rival chess playerFischer died in 2008.600 [part0034.html#chapter019fn600] Kasparov is not onlyaware of Fomenko’s work; he is an ardent supporter of it and a featuredcontributor to the New Tradition website.Although Kasparov does not agree with all of Fomenko’s conclusions, he doesbelieve these discoveries have “profound implications” for science as we nowknow it, creating “completely new areas of scientific research.” Here is a quotedirectly from Kasparov.If indeed the dates of antiquity are incorrect, there could be profoundimplications for our beliefs about the past, and also for science…. I trust thatthe younger generation will have no fear of “untouchable” historical dogma, andwill use contemporary knowledge to challenge questionable theories. For sure, itis an exciting opportunity to reverse the subordinate role science plays tohistory—and to create completely new areas of scientific research.601[part0034.html#chapter019fn601]Fomenko’s work obviously is far more complex than Helmer and Masson’s cycleresearch. It is just about as thorough as any investigation into this subjectcould have been given the data that is available. However, even with such amountain of provable evidence of neatly repeating historical events, Fomenkoagreed with Morozov’s original conclusion. He believed that the historians hadto be faking their data and were actually reusing the same information over andover again, only making a small number of changes along the way—such as names,places, and the specific details of major events. The following quote is fromone of the papers on the New Tradition website: “These parallels suggest thatthe traditional history of ancient times consists of multiple recounts of thesame events, scattered in many locations at various times.”602[part0034.html#chapter019fn602] Fomenko believed these events only happenedonce—but were then misinterpreted as having occurred in multiple time periods.EARLY HISTORIANS CAUGHT RED-HANDED?Robert Grishin’s initial essay on the New Tradition website openly accuses thepeople who put our historical records together of being “forgers” who have nowbeen “caught red-handed”:Having been armed with mathematics, the most precise of the sciences, [Fomenkoand his colleagues] have shown convincingly that, for example, the wholechronology on which modern history is based is mistaken. They have been findingirrefutable proof of the fact that some of the very same events have beenwritten under various names, and dispatched into various epochs of “ancient”history. They have caught the forgers red-handed—and exposed them before thewhole world.603 [part0034.html#chapter019fn603]At the time the Saturday Night article was written in 2000, Fomenko hadconcluded that we were actually only living in the year A.D. 936. He believedthat large parts of our history have been “faked.” Historians have disregardedFomenko’s findings and dismissed this idea as nonsense. There are many differentmethods they would use to argue their point, including fairly reliable carbondating and intersecting chronologies among various, disconnected nations, thoughFomenko questions both of these dating methods in his papers.604[part0034.html#chapter019fn604] Nonetheless, the Saturday Night article revealsthat these same scientists recognize that something important is going onhere—and we need to find out what it is.Even those who don’t endorse Fomenko’s conclusions agree that valid mathematicalquestions have been raised. “It would be a massive irresponsibility not to dealwith it and either prove that it’s wrong or, if there’s something here, find outwhat in the world is going on,” says math professor Jack Macki. Jacques Carrièreconcludes, “To have a definitive answer to the thing, the problem has to belooked at by other research groups.”605 [part0034.html#chapter019fn605]Of course, other research groups have already investigated this subject—namely,Helmer and Masson—and have directly connected it to cycles of time that werehanded down to us by ancient extraterrestrial humans that visited humanity. Manypeople assume these legends are purely mythological, whereas now our currentlevel of science and technology is finally catching up. We needed to progress toa point where we could gather written records from all over the world, acrossvast lengths of time, in order to be able to identify these patterns. Armed withthis new data, we now have the full potential to usher in an unprecedented,worldwide spiritual awakening."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYFOMENKO’S CYCLES OF HISTORY—AND THE BOOK OF DANIELEven though Fomenko believes that many historical events have been faked, healso concluded that history has a “fiber structure.” This is not unlike the ideaof a timeline or a repeating cycle. Fomenko compares this repeating cycle to atextbook, which breaks down into four chapters of equal lengths, as we see inthis next excerpt from his own New Tradition website. This should sound veryfamiliar by now.A.T. Fomenko discovered a “fiber structure” in our modern “textbook of ancientand medieval history.”…It was proved that this “textbook” consists of four moreshort “textbooks” which speak about the same events—the same historical epochs.These short “textbooks” were then shifted, with respect to each other, on thetime axis—and then glued together…. The result is our modern “textbook,” whichshows a history much longer than it was in reality.606[part0034.html#chapter020fn606]Unlike Helmer and Masson’s work, where the intervals between wars and politicalevents repeat themselves in shockingly precise intervals of time, even down tothe day, Fomenko’s longer-term cycles do not appear to fit together in such anice, neat fashion—at first. Fomenko did notice the “rigid” cycle of“approximately 275” years and another “rigid” cycle of 120 years in theinterplay between Byzantine Roman and English history, which fits our data verynicely. Nonetheless, Fomenko had no reason to see the actual lengths of time assignificant. He also seems totally unaware that this same phenomenon had alreadybeen researched and written about in France. Although many of Fomenko’s keypapers are not yet available in English, we can find solid numbers in thegraphic data available from the New Tradition website.607[part0034.html#chapter020fn607][../images/00026.jpeg]Fig. 16 [part0006.html#l16]: Professor Fomenko’s graph of the four-part“textbook” that repeats in historical eventsThis key graph shows four cycles that repeat between 1600 B.C. and A.D. 1600.According to the timeline at the top, each cycle is about thirteen hundred yearslong, though this changes slightly from one to the next. We also see that thereare four subcycles, or what Fomenko called “textbooks,” within each cycle. Eachof these subcycles is almost exactly the same length. This remains consistentacross the entire graph. This is completely in alignment with what Helmer andMasson suggested happens in history—namely, that there are smaller cycles, ineven intervals of time, in which key events take place.THE 1,296-YEAR CYCLE: THE HERO’S JOURNEY, IN FOUR EQUAL SECTIONSNow we have a single, four-part story that takes approximately thirteen hundredyears to complete and could be broken up into the three-act Hero’s Journeystructure that all Hollywood films are based on. Let’s not forget that once weinclude the midpoint in a screenplay, we break it up into four perfectlysymmetrical pieces—pages 1 through 30, 30 through 60, 60 through 90, and 90through 120. If Fomenko has found that the overall “story” is thirteen hundredyears long, that’s very interesting, because if we knock off four years andshave it down just a bit to 1,296 years, we now have another perfect subdivisionof the 25,920-year precession. There are exactly twenty cycles of 1,296 yearswithin the Great Year itself. Each of these 1,296-year cycles divides neatlyinto four equal parts on Fomenko’s graph, giving us 324-year sections. There areexactly eighty of these 324-year cycles in the 25,920-year precession of theequinoxes.THE 720-YEAR CYCLE: ONE-THIRD OF AN AGE OF THE ZODIACThe 1,296-year cycle fits in perfectly with Helmer and Masson’s model, butadditional information can be found in Fomenko’s graph. When, exactly, did eachof Fomenko’s 1,296-year “textbooks” start, and how much time occurred betweenthem? Since Fomenko believes only the most recent cycle is the correct one, heassumes all the previous cycles must be forgeries. In the graph on his website,Fomenko gives us the exact numbers of when each of these previous cyclesstarted. The first cycle started 1778 years before the most recent one. Thesecond cycle started 1053 years before the most recent one. And the third cyclestarted 333 years before the last one.Notice that Fomenko did not reveal how much time had elapsed between each ofthese cycles. Instead, he only mentioned the total number of years that hadpassed between the beginning of each cycle and the beginning of the last cycle.In order to get the actual length of the cycle itself, we have to find out howmany years elapsed between the starting points of each cycle in the graph.There are 725 years between 1778 and 1053 and 720 years between 1053 and 333.That means all the key historical events within the first three cycles—whichrepresent massive overlaps between the Roman Empire and various aspects of laterEuropean history—take place approximately or exactly 720 years apart from eachother. The second and third cycles are exactly 720 years apart. The first andsecond cycles are 725 years apart, which is only a five-year margin of error.This might be due to a difficulty in properly dating the records themselves. Iwas truly stunned when I first did these calculations, as 720 years is exactlyone-third of an Age of the Zodiac. I immediately remembered that this same720-year cycle was mentioned in Masson’s book and was associated with the threemost important phases of religious development.Lastly, a gap of only 333 years separated the third and fourth cycles. This wascertainly entertaining, as I’ve been seeing the number 333 in synchronisticcircumstances for many years. However, in this case we may have a nine-yearmargin of error. Within the “perfect” 1,296-year cycle length Fomenkodiscovered, each of the four subcycles is 324 years long. We have eighty ofthese 324-year cycles in the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes. Furtherresearch may reveal that Fomenko misinterpreted certain events in the cycles andthat the actual start times of these final two cycles are precisely 324 yearsapart.The first and second cycles in the graph are exactly 720 years apart. The secondand third cycles are very close to 720 years apart once again. Masson’s bookgives other examples of this 720-year cycle appearing in history. I publishedDavid Steinberg’s translation of Masson’s book on my website in 1999, but Ididn’t read the Saturday Night article until 2000. At the time I first found thearticle, I was frustrated by the fact that it was lacking in technical data thatcould have given me some numbers to play around with. Finally, in April 2010, Idug out this old article from my archives, which I’d been meaning to check onfor many years, while I was writing up the initial drafts of these chapters onthe cycles of history. I soon found the New Tradition website, which allowed meto locate specific numbers in Fomenko’s data.FRANÇOIS MASSON ON THE 720-YEAR CYCLE IN CHRISTIANITYMasson associated the 720-year cycle with the growth phases of major religionsand said this cycle was originally discovered by Reverend Father Poucel. I havenot been able to locate Poucel’s work so far, probably because it was written inFrench and may have been published well before Masson wrote his book. Thedefinition of the 720-year cycle as strictly religious in nature is too narrowto describe everything Fomenko discovered, but we can at least consider that incertain cases, major religions have followed this pattern. Masson suggested thatevery culture will go through stages of its spiritual and religious developmentthat divide up into nice, neat 720-year cycles.2160 / 3 = 720 years…pointed out by Rev. Father Poucel. The first phase of 720years is the prophetic period of every religion. The second is the “clericalphase,” and the third is that of the supremacy of the temporal [physical] powerover the spiritual power. For example: [the time of] the Christ’s teaching tothe years 720–750 corresponds to the mystical epoch of Christianity. From A.D.720–750 to 1440–1470, the times changed. This was the epoch of the mastery ofthe ecclesiastical [Church] hierarchy over peoples and governments.608[part0034.html#chapter020fn608]If this 720-year cycle apparently began with the popularly accepted time of thebirth of Jesus, then the first key year we would be looking for is A.D. 720. InA.D. 726 or thereabouts, the Byzantine emperor Leo III began an open campaign of“iconoclasm.”609 [part0034.html#chapter020fn609] This is a technical-soundingname for a culture deliberately destroying its own religious icons for politicalor spiritual reasons. Among other things, Emperor Leo ordered the removal of animage of Jesus’s face over the entrance to the Great Palace of Constantinople.This conflict had started accelerating as of 695, when Justinian II put imagesof Jesus’s face on the back of his gold coins. This caused Islamic caliph Abdal-Malik, who died in 705, to stop using Jesus’s face on his coins and convertthem to letters only. This broke with their tradition of using Byzantine designson their own money.610 [part0034.html#chapter020fn610] We also know that beforeLeo III ordered the idols to be smashed in 726, this rebellion had alreadyreached epic proportions in society. In a letter estimated to be from beforeA.D. 726, the patriarch Germanus wrote to two iconoclast bishops, saying “nowwhole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over thismatter” of using Jesus’s face as an icon.611 [part0034.html#chapter020fn611]Thus, the timing of this period of iconoclasm fits with the 720-year cycle verynicely. According to Masson, this period of iconoclasm was the “first majorcrisis of the Catholic Church.” After this time, the church hierarchyincreasingly strengthened its grip over the governments as well as the people.Then, 720 years later we have 1440. This was within one year of when theRenaissance started, creating the dawning of modern science as we now know it.The Renaissance challenged the church’s authority to proclaim the truth withoutquestion. The Renaissance also led to the Reformation, which forced the churchto release control of the Bible to the people for the first time. According toPaul Robert Walker in his 2003 book, The Feud That Sparked the Renaissance, thissocial, artistic, and scientific revolution can be timed to start precisely in1441. This was the year that Ghiberti and Brunelleschi competed over who got todesign the bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery.612[part0034.html#chapter020fn612]Seven hundred and twenty years after 1440 lands us in the year 2160. Thisappears to be well after the time that the Great Year comes to an end and theGolden Age is predicted to have arrived in various worldwide prophecies, as Iextensively discussed in The Source Field Investigations. However, if we aredealing with a system of cycles that is somehow guided by our own collectiveconsciousness and was intended to reach its final resolution surrounding the endof the Great Year—which was in or around the year 2012—then perhaps other cyclestook effect.WHAT IF A.D. 720 IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW HERO’S JOURNEY?What if we take the year A.D. 720 as the beginning of a new cycle of a differentlength? What if A.D. 720 becomes the beginning of a new Hero’s Journey story?What if the political and social climate of A.D. 720 now represents the“ordinary world,” which the “heroes” of our modern era must all ultimately beinspired to join a quest to escape from, as they move from lifetime to lifetime?The use of Jesus’s face as an icon in Christianity was considered an“abomination.” This was the first time that the church’s authority wasquestioned on such a widespread level. It was the first time that the peoplebecame aware that their beloved religion had become corrupted and was being usedas a tool of social and political oppression. The church militarized and becamean obviously direct arm of the government for the first time in its history.What if we use A.D. 720 as our starting point for one of Fomenko’s 1,296-yearcycles? This would mean that the cycle will end in the year 2016. This is a veryclose fit with the end date for the precession and gives us another year to keepan eye on.THE 1,290-YEAR CYCLE IN THE BOOK OF DANIELAnother possible lead in our investigation is that a very similar cycle—in thiscase 1,290 years instead of 1,296—may have been featured in the book of Danielin the Old Testament. Only very thinly veiled symbolism appears to have beenused to describe a cycle of time in years. A variety of Bible passages revealthat a “day” can symbolize a year.613 [part0034.html#chapter020fn613] In 12:11,Daniel met a glowing, linen-clad man in a vision, which many readers of theBible believe was a vision of Jehoshua. This glowing man in linen told Danielthere would be a final cycle of 1,290 “days” before the end of the age. ManyBible enthusiasts have felt this is a time-encoded prophecy, but they are notsure of the start date that we should use. Here is the exact passage in the bookof Daniel—specifically chapter 12, verse 11—where this prophecy appears: “Fromthe time that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination thatdesolates is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days.”614[part0034.html#chapter020fn614]The “regular burnt offering” is known to be incense that the church uses as asacred ceremonial offering. Here, the “regular burnt offering” may be a symbolthat represents the sacred, mystical aspect of Christianity’s early years—thefirst 720-year cycle that appears throughout history, according to ReverendFather Poucel and François Masson. That means we could potentially set thebeginning of the “time of the abomination that desolates” at A.D. 720. This isthe beginning of the “epoch of the mastery of the Church hierarchy over thepeoples and governments,” according to Masson. In A.D. 720, the government andthe church finally joined forces to dramatically strengthen their control overthe people. This led to many nightmares, including the Inquisition, during whichthose who did not agree with the opinion of the church were tortured. Many holywars were fought, with raping, pillaging, and mass death, including theCrusades.Twelve hundred and ninety years after Masson’s crucial date of A.D. 720 bringsus to the year 2010. I was quite surprised to see this number emerge, as it wasthe year 2010 when I made this calculation. Did this somehow indicate that thegreat cycles already knew when they would be discovered? Were we on a timelinewhere we needed to discover them again at a certain point in our history—andwere, in fact, programmed to discover them again? Is it possible for a prophecyto be time encoded that far back in the past? Given the many 2,160-year overlapsbetween Rome in the Age of Aries and America in the Age of Pisces, including theexact nature of the Watergate scandal, anything is possible. “Nothing elsehappened in 2010,” you might say. However, at this point in Daniel’s vision, aforty-five-year transitional period begins before we receive our “reward.” Wewill explore this soon enough.LET’S LOOK AT THE CONTEXT: HISTORY PROGRESSING FROM AGE TO AGEI’m sure some people will think this is a ridiculous attempt to look for numbercodes in the Bible that back up the overall model. If this were just a randomBible passage, I would definitely agree with you, so that’s why we need to studythe context and see what is written before we reach Daniel 12:11. In 2:20–22, weget a clear mention of history progressing from “age to age,” and we see howthese great cycles move us through the times and seasons, setting up andbringing down kings along the way. This definitely fits our model: “Blessed bethe name of God from age to age, for wisdom and power are his. He changes timesand seasons, deposes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise andknowledge to those who have understanding. He reveals deep and hiddenthings.”615 [part0034.html#chapter020fn615]Indeed, I would consider the knowledge of these cycles to be a “deep and hidden”aspect of “wisdom,” which can be found by “those who have understanding.” Nowthat we are in a modern technological era, we have instant, worldwide access toinformation and can finally understand how these cycles work.DANIEL DESCRIBES HISTORY MOVING IN REPEATING CYCLESThe plot thickens when we find out that the prophet Daniel was commissioned byKing Nebuchadnezzar to interpret one of his dreams. Daniel gave the followinginterpretation—which shows an intimate knowledge of history moving in repeatingcycles.You were looking, O king, and lo! there was a great statue. This statue washuge, its brilliance extraordinary; it was standing before you, and itsappearance was frightening. The head of that statue was of fine gold, its chestand arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feetpartly of iron and partly of clay. As you looked on, a stone was cut out, not byhuman hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and brokethem in pieces. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the goldwere all broken in pieces and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could befound. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filledthe whole earth.616 [part0034.html#chapter020fn616]We clearly see an enormous statue of a man—the hero character in our story—builtin layers of gold, silver, bronze and iron. Each of these layers ends up beingsmashed, one by one. Notice that the resulting rubble was said to look like the“chaff of the summer threshing floors.” Chaff is the unusable material thatfalls out of a mill that is used for grinding—or threshing—grain. The grain millis one of the most common symbolic codes embedded in dozens of different myths,worldwide, to symbolize the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes, accordingto de Santillana and von Dechend. The central axis of the mill symbolizes theearth’s axis as it drifts through the precession in de Santillana and vonDechend’s epic model. Each section of the statue corresponds to an age. TheGolden Age is represented by the head—which is the beginning of each new cycle.In the final age, everything from the previous cycles is smashed by the stone inNebuchadnezzar’s vision—and comes to a rather abrupt end.Daniel clearly interprets each of the four main sections of the statue—gold,silver, bronze, and iron—as corresponding to a major cycle or age of humanhistory. This begins with the Golden Age, represented here by the king. However,this vision seems to be far less relevant to Nebuchadnezzar than he may havewanted to believe at the time.You, O king, the king of kings—to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom,the power, the might, and the glory, into whose hand he has given human beings,wherever they live, the wild animals of the field, and the birds of the air, andwhom he has established as ruler over them all—you are the head of gold. Afteryou shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours, and yet a third kingdom ofbronze, which shall rule over the whole earth. And there shall be a fourthkingdom, strong as iron. Just as iron crushes and smashes everything, it shallcrush and shatter all these.617 [part0034.html#chapter020fn617]We are clearly going through the Iron Age now. Indeed, many traditional cultureshave been crushed and shattered by the introduction of machines and technology.Many of these machines are made out of metal, which is signified by the iron. Aswe continue reading this prophecy, we find out that the people of this age areweakened by how divided they become. Nonetheless, a core of strength remains:“As you saw the feet and toes partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, itshall be a divided kingdom; but some of the strength of iron shall be in it, asyou saw the iron mixed with the clay…the kingdom shall be partly strong andpartly brittle.”618 [part0034.html#chapter020fn618]The degree to which this Iron Age is a prophecy of our modern world becomesclearer when we skip ahead to 7:23: “There shall be a fourth kingdom on earththat shall be different from all the other kingdoms; it shall devour the wholeearth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces.”619[part0034.html#chapter020fn619]Once this Iron Age comes to a close, we again return to the Golden Age. Thisdescription is given in symbolic, dreamlike terms: “And in the days of those[Iron Age] kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never bedestroyed, nor shall this kingdom be left to another people. It shall crush allthese kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever.”620[part0034.html#chapter020fn620]Moving ahead to 12:1, we again get a clear prophecy of the difficult times we’rein now, but also a revealing glimpse of what the Golden Age might be like onceit finally arrives: “There shall be a time of anguish, such as has neveroccurred since nations first came into existence. But at that time your peopleshall be delivered; everyone who is found written in the book.”621[part0034.html#chapter020fn621]Some may believe those in the “book” will only be “the Chosen,” whomever theythink those people may be. Let’s consider that the “book” might actually be thestory of the Hero’s Journey itself. If this is the symbol that is being used,then how do we write ourselves into the book? How do we join the great story? Itcould be that everyone who takes up their own quest for the ancient Elixir ofImmortality finds themselves in the book. Everyone who is willing to face thenemesis in the quest for a better, stronger and more loving world has dedicatedthemselves to the planetary healing process we now must go through. Once wedefeat the nemesis on a global level, we access the treasure it has beenguarding—and can now enter the Golden Age. Daniel’s description of the GoldenAge is very interesting: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shallawake; some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky—and those who leadmany to righteousness, like the stars—forever and ever.”622[part0034.html#chapter020fn622]This appears to be an undeniable reference to the same “fourth-density shift”that is described in the Law of One series. The next stage of human evolution,when we free ourselves from the cycles of birth and death through reincarnation,does seem to involve a movement into a “light body”—much like Jehoshua appearedafter the resurrection. In chapter 21 [part0032.html] we will discover there aremore than 160,000 documented cases of Rainbow Body occurring in Tibet and Chinaalone. This same passage also refers to “those who sleep in the dust of theearth” and then awaken. This is clearly metaphorical, not literal. It is verylikely a reference to people who have remained unaware of the spiritualprinciples that govern the universe, rather than to dead bodies rising out ofthe ground, as many Christian fundamentalists believe.THE CENTRAL PASSAGES WHERE THE ENCODED NUMBERS APPEARFinally, with all that context in place, we return to the central “mystery”passages where the encoded numbers appear. This begins in Daniel 12:6.One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was upstream, “How long shallit be until the end of these wonders?” The man clothed in linen, who wasupstream, raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven. And I heard himswear by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, two times, andhalf a time—and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comesto an end, all these things would be accomplished.623[part0034.html#chapter020fn623]I first discovered the meaning of “a time, two times and half a time” from myfriend and colleague Joe Mason in a phone call I had with him on November 9,1996. He described a series of incredible events that led him to investigatemysteries like this. I was so fascinated that I stayed up way past my bedtimeand struggled like crazy to write down everything he was saying. I soon foundout that the “three and a half” symbolism appeared in a variety of differentmyths, worldwide, according to Joseph Campbell, the same scholar who wrote TheHero’s Journey. In his book The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, Campbell suggestedthat the “three and a half” represented the tipping point between the third andfourth chakras, which are alleged to be energy centers within the body.The “three and a half” symbol therefore represents the tipping point between thelower mind of the ego and the higher consciousness of the heart. Two and a halfyears later, in April 1999, Joe Mason wrote this up on his website,GreatDreams.com.In 1992, after two years of “coincidental” experiences that often related todreams and/or crop circle formations, an incredible chain of many “coincidences”began. I read Joseph Campbell’s The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, and wasimpressed with the information concerning the “midpoint of the chakras”symbolism found in diverse myths in various forms. The midpoint of the sevenchakras is often expressed as three and a half. At the time, I was reading theBible for basically the first time—although I had read a few verses over theyears. Right after reading about the above mentioned concepts, I came toRevelation 11:9 and 11:11, which speak of the two olive trees/lampstands thatlie dead for “three days and a half,” and then stand up on their feet when abreath of life from God enters them…. This page details the various myths thatexpress the “midpoint of the seven” in the various forms, and thedream-coincidences that led me to a quite convincing theory about the meaning ofthe Book of Revelation.624 [part0034.html#chapter020fn624]Mason clearly believed this three-and-a-half point was not only the tippingpoint between the ego and the heart—it also represented the shift between thethird and fourth dimension, or “density,” in Law of One terms. This shiftpropels us into the coming Golden Age that had been so frequently prophesied aswell. Mason explained this in another excerpt from the same article: “It seemsclear that ‘a time, two times, and half a time,’ is yet another form of the 31⁄2 symbolism…. In this case, there is no set period of days or years. Perhapsit means that the changes will come when the human race has reached the requiredlevel of consciousness evolution—however long that will be.”625[part0034.html#chapter020fn625]This conversation with Joe Mason was of extremely high importance in mydevelopment of this investigation. I met him on a forum where I was regularlyposting on the phenomenon of synchronicity and describing data I was gettingfrom my dreams. As I listened to him talk that night, for the very first time, Iwas extremely tired and could barely stay awake. Yet the information he wasgiving me was fantastic. It was connecting hundreds of different dots for me andfelt like a massive download. Even though I was half-asleep, I wrote everythinghe was saying down the best way I could. Joe Mason said that some of theseconcepts were revealing themselves to him through what he called the “DreamVoice.” He said this was a quiet background murmuring that he could hear in hismind when he first woke up and could still remember a dream.Mason told me that if you tune in to this murmuring and listen carefully, youcan pick out words and sentence fragments and write them down. The very nextmorning, I started doing this without paying any attention to what the wordswere actually saying. That was a very important element of the Dream Voiceprotocol. As soon as you start following or understanding the words, they willquickly be distorted. After a prolonged process that generated eight pages ofmaterial, on November 10, 1996, I stopped. I then sat up, breathed normally, andbegan reading what I had written in my waking consciousness. I was stunned athow complex and mysterious the words were. This was my first experience with apsychic reading—and I have continued to practice and develop this ability eversince.DANIEL REQUESTS MORE INFORMATION ON THE “THREE AND A HALF”Mason believed there was “no set period of days or years” in the symbolism ofthe three and a half. When we go back to the book of Daniel, as soon as he hearsabout the “three and a half” symbolism, he asks for more information: “I heardbut could not understand; so I said, ‘My lord, what shall be the outcome ofthese things?’ He said, ‘Go your way, Daniel, for the words are to remain secretand sealed until the time of the end.’”626 [part0034.html#chapter020fn626]This is very interesting. Could it be that “the words [that]…remain secret andsealed until the time of the end” are actually the “pages” of the great storyitself—in other words, the knowledge of the Hero’s Journey? Scholars like JosephCampbell have only very recently discovered this common link interconnecting allthe greatest mythologies in world history. Hollywood used Campbell’s blueprintto write great stories and make money by reaching its audiences at the deepestpossible level. The Hero’s Journey story clearly seems to invoke oursubconscious memory of the afterlife—and what we are really doing here on earth.Long before the era of movies, these myths were acted out as plays—and thecurtain call was arguably the most important part of the whole performance. Thisis where the players break the fourth wall and directly connect with theaudience for the first time. In this all-important moment, we are reminded thatthe ordinary world as we know it is really only a stage, and there is indeed amagical world that we will once again enter. However, we do not have to die inorder to access this magical world. Ultimately, we can awaken our own mysticalabilities and directly access the knowledge of the universe. I began doing thison November 10, 1996, and almost immediately began getting prophecies thatcompletely defeated my notions of linear time. The future was often beingdescribed very precisely without any seeming effort at all. The ancient storytells us that we can only reach this Elixir of Immortality—the treasure of thehigher self—once we defeat the nemesis. Again, the nemesis is represented by theego—all our doubts, fears, jealousies, suspicions, and frustrations.This entire story appears in myths, plays, novels, television shows, andmovies—but these same plot points appear, in the same sequence, throughout ourhistory in regularly repeating cycles of time. Whoever wrote the book of Danielseems to have understood this and was clearly not bound by linear time. Thewords of the book needed to remain “secret and sealed until the end,” but thosetimes may very well now be upon us. The idea that this book is the great storyof the Hero’s Journey, playing out in extended cycles of time, is heavilyvalidated in the book of Daniel. As we continue, we find a clear description ofa 1,290-year cycle just three sentences later. “Many shall be purified,cleansed, and refined, but the wicked shall continue to act wickedly. None ofthe wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand. From thetime that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination thatdesolates is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days.”627[part0034.html#chapter020fn627]Now it makes more sense. Other prophecies from around the world clearly pin theGolden Age as beginning around the year 2012. The time when “the regular burntoffering is taken away and the abomination that desolates is set up” couldeasily be the iconoclasm in A.D. 720, when the church began strengthening itscontrol of the people and the governments. This ended the “mystery” phase ofChristianity, according to François Masson and Reverend Father Poucel. Then ifwe add in one of Fomenko’s cycles of 1,296 years—exactly one-twentieth of theprecession—we get the year 2016. The biblical mention of a figure of 1,290 yearsbrings us even closer to the frequently prophesied date of 2012—specifically,the year 2010. Both of these numbers may be important. With the benefit ofmodern scientific research, we can see that the 1,296-year cycle is a perfectfit with the 25,920-year cycle—but the figure of 1,290 years calibrates thisbiblical passage to the end date of the entire cycle even more closely. This wasalso the year this prophecy was rediscovered.THE FINAL FORTY-FIVE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIODThe end date of the Mayan calendar is December 2012, or 12/12. Interestingly, inDaniel 12:12, we are told that a forty-five-year transition period will begin ator around this time. We see this appear in the difference between the 1,290“days” and another new number—1,335: “Happy are those who persevere and attainthe thousand three hundred thirty-five days. But you, go your way, and rest; youshall rise for your reward at the end of the days.”628[part0034.html#chapter020fn628]In the Law of One series, we are told that the shift into fourth density beginsapproximately thirty years after 1981, or roughly the year 2011. The year 2011is even closer to this apparent time-encoded prophecy in the book of Daniel.However, the Law of One series also indicates that we have to work through atransitional period of “100 to 700 years” before the shift into fourth densityis complete. Before we get there, we have the opportunity to begin experiencingfourth-density abilities within our existing third-density bodies. The quotesthat explain this will be revealed in the next chapter.We’ve been conditioned to think that there is no magic left in the world—thatscience has solved all the great mysteries, and we’re just here to be born, liveour lives, and die, never knowing the beauty of existence again. As far as I’mconcerned, these cycles make science come alive unlike anything else I have everstudied. Now I find myself taking walks and wondering if each step I take isbeing duplicated by some other version of me in another time cycle, either inthe past or in the future. What decisions that I make will reverberatethroughout these cycles? What decisions that I made have been directlyinfluenced by what happened in other cycles? Are there certain story pointsbuilt into the cycles that will steer my free will—whether I consciously realizeit or not?Life becomes a lot more interesting once you know that these cycles reallyexist. You can strongly question the typical atheist’s idea that once we die,it’s over, and there is no greater purpose to anything happening in our lives—orin world events, for that matter.I am invigorated by the challenge of looking at weird stuff like this and seeingif there’s a way we can model it. How might these cycles actually be forming?Are we moving through an energetic structure of some kind, based on thepositions of the planets—and even the position of our sun around a neighboringstar? I didn’t solve this greatest of intellectual puzzles until August of 2012,and until I cracked the code, I did not feel comfortable trying to write thisbook. Once I found the answer, I realized that it had already been stated, quiteplainly, in the Law of One series—I just hadn’t understood what it meant at thetime. This new model gave me a way to visually understand and explain the cyclesof history as well as the energetic springboard that could propel us into theGolden Age.The Hindu scriptures and others suggest that this new Golden Age will not be thefirst. Another Golden Age apparently occurred in our own prehistory. Did thepeople of this Golden Age enjoy scientific knowledge that was significantlyahead of our own in certain key areas? Were they well aware of these historicalcycles that we have now rediscovered? Did our ancestors’ own records of a GoldenAge lead them to believe it would happen again, and even to predict when itwould arrive? Did they already know that the cycles of history would convergeinto a single mega-event at the end of each 25,920-year cycle? Can we study therecords they left behind and find the secrets to demystify the advanced sciencethey once knew? Can we finally locate the Synchronicity Key and unlock the greattreasure chest that holds the Blueprints for a Golden Age?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEEXPLAINING THE CYCLES AND THE FOURTH-DENSITY SHIFTTHE RAINBOW BODYThere are more than 160,000 documented cases of people transforming into theRainbow Body in Tibet and China alone.629 [part0034.html#chapter021fn629] Thisphenomenon has continued straight through into modern times.630[part0034.html#chapter021fn630] As I revealed in The Source FieldInvestigations, this has been witnessed, scrutinized, and investigated by FatherTiso, a Catholic priest, as well as members of the Chinese military in recenttimes.631 [part0034.html#chapter021fn631] In each of these cases, a human beingof flesh and blood is transformed into a “light body” and gains the ability towalk between this physical world and the afterlife. In some cases, peopletransform all at once, spontaneously. However, in many other instances, theirbodies gradually shift into pure rainbow light over the course of seven days,while they are wrapped in a shroud.632 [part0034.html#chapter021fn632] Thesepeople were invariably working in highly advanced spiritual disciplines. Therewas nothing accidental about what happened to them. They were meditating,contemplating, and doing their best to love, forgive, and accept themselves andothers and to see the universe and their own greater identity as the OneInfinite Creator.633 [part0034.html#chapter021fn633] They had reached a point atwhich they mastered what this level of existence is here to teach us. That gavethem the power to move into the ascended state. This is not at all what happenswhen most people die. Nor is this “light body” the same as what we naturallybecome after our physical death. It’s literally a quantum leap in humanevolution. Father Tiso wanted this phenomenon studied more seriously. He feltthat this knowledge could help transform the lives and spiritual paths of peoplein the Western world.[../images/00027.jpeg]Fig. 17 [part0006.html#l17]: Tibetan Buddhist illustration of the “Rainbow Body”THE HARVEST: ANOTHER NAME FOR A WORLD TRANSFORMATIONThe entire Law of One series is built around the idea that something verywonderful will soon be happening to us—something they called “harvest.” Atimeline was given for when this would begin to happen—approximately thirtyyears after 1981. Like many others who studied this material, I had high hopesthat the Mayan Calendar end date would bring a sudden change for the positive.Although there have certainly been harbingers of positive growth at the time ofthis writing in April 2013, we certainly have not seen any sudden, grandioseevents. We will explore exactly what the Law of One source said in much moredetail later on. When you read the cumulative body of data in the Law of Oneseries, it seems very clear that “harvest” refers to a worldwide event. Afterthis event happens, many of us will be able to achieve the Rainbow Body state,which is often called ascension. In The Source Field Investigations, I presenteda widespread body of data showing that many ancient prophecies are expectingthis to happen as well. This includes the Sibylline mystery texts, from which“Novus Ordo Seclorum” in the Great Seal of the United States was quoted.[../images/00028.gif]Fig. 18 [part0006.html#l18]: Near-final draft of the great seal of the UnitedStates in 1782This text was channeled by the Sybil of Cumae, an extremely accurate psychic, inor around 539 B.C. The Roman government kept it hidden in total secrecy, andconsidered it their greatest treasure due to its astonishing accuracy. As itsays on the Antiquities of Rome website, “The Sibyls were gifted seers…. TheSybil of Cumae sold three books of prophesies to the last of the Roman kings,Tarquin the Proud. These books were highly worshipped and consulted by theRomans in their times of greatest need.”634 [part0034.html#chapter021fn634]These books contained a chronological timeline of events that would happen toRome, including exact time windows and cryptic descriptions of the events. Thisposed a huge security threat, as anyone wanting to invade Rome could use it withdevastating effectiveness, and so it was considered highly classified. It wasburied deep in the Temple of Jupiter and guarded by 15 different priests635[part0034.html#chapter021fn635] called the Decemvirs636[part0034.html#chapter021fn636] in the ancient equivalent of Area 51. The bestonline resource for this text—which eventually appeared in Virgil’s FourthEclogue—appears on MIT’s page on the Internet Classics Archive. Here are some ofthe strongest elements of this prophecy:Now the last age by Cumae’s Sibyl sungHas come and gone, and the majestic rollOf circling centuries begins anew:“The majestic roll of circling centuries begins anew” was shortened to “NovusOrdo Seclorum” on the US dollar. This is a clear reference to the 25,920-yearcycle. Let’s see what happens immediately after the part that the FoundingFathers of America quoted from. Indeed, it gets even more interesting as we goon from there, as we seem to have a prophecy of extraterrestrials or angelicbeings making themselves formally known on earth:Justice returns, returns old Saturn’s reign,With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.Only do thou, at the boy’s birth in whomThe iron shall cease, the golden race arise,The terms Golden Race and Golden Age are interchangeable, as I explained in TheSource Field Investigations. This appears to be a clear reference to a worldwidelight-body-type event. Let’s continue from another point shortly after this andsee what happens:This glorious age, O Pollio, shall begin,And the months enter on their mighty march.Under thy guidance, whatso tracks remainOf our old wickedness, once done away,Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear.He shall receive the life of gods, and seeHeroes with gods commingling, and himselfBe seen of them, and with his father’s worthReign o’er a world at peace.This is a prophecy of a very positive event. The earth is freed fromnever-ceasing fear. Extraterrestrial humans comingle with us. We then “receivethe life of gods” and are “seen of them” ourselves. We are also given a timewindow of when this will happen—approximately at the end of the 25,920-yearcycle, which we are moving through at the time of this writing. Near the end ofVirgil’s Fourth Eclogue, which directly quoted this greatest of all Romantreasures, we see another blatant reference to the 25,920-year cycle.Specifically, we see a reference to the tottering of “the world’s orbed might.”This clearly seems to refer to the slow, drifting movement of the earth’s axisas we pass through this cycle.Assume thy greatness, for the time draws nigh,Dear child of gods, great progeny of Jove!See how it totters—the world’s orbed might,Earth, and wide ocean, and the vault profound,All, see, enraptured of the coming time!THE “HARVEST” DISCUSSION IS WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SERIESThis same imminent event is discussed throughout the entire Law of Oneseries—from the very first session to the last. It is clear that the main reasonwhy these higher-level extraterrestrials are here is to try to help as manypeople “graduate” as possible in this magnificent event. All the different godswho visited and civilized ancient cultures and encoded this prophecy into theirmyths were all members of the “Confederation of Planets in Service of the OneInfinite Creator,” in Law of One terms. Therefore, the information that wasplanted into the Sybil of Cumae and eventually ended up in the Great Seal of theUnited States very likely started out as a positive message from theConfederation of Planets. It is interesting that despite the numerous accurateprophecies in them, the Romans were never able to use these prophecies for theirown gain. I think the Confederation of Planets put enough “sizzle” in the booksto attract the Romans’ attention but specifically intended for this prophecy toreach us in modern times. The Law of One source announced the core beliefs ofthe Confederation of Planets in the very first sentence it ever spoke throughCarla Rueckert, the channel:1.0 The Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator has onlyone important statement. That statement, my friends, as you know, is “Allthings, all of life, all of the creation is part of one original thought.”637[part0034.html#chapter021fn637]The exact membership of the Confederation of Planets was given in session 6:6.24 I am one of the members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service ofthe Infinite Creator. There are approximately fifty-three civilizations,comprising approximately five hundred planetary consciousness complexes in thisConfederation. This Confederation contains those from your own planet who haveattained dimensions beyond your third. It contains planetary entities withinyour solar system, and it contains planetary entities from other galaxies. It isa true Confederation in that its members are not alike, but allied in serviceaccording to the Law of One.638 [part0034.html#chapter021fn638]It took me many years to figure out what the source meant by “other galaxies.”It did not mean anything outside the Milky Way galaxy. This was one of the moreconfusing things I was wrestling with when I first read all of this back in1996. We will get back to that in a minute. Most important, the Law of Oneseries specifically says that there will be a quantum leap changing the basiclaws of physics as we now know them sometime approximately thirty years afterJanuary 1981, though the source cannot pinpoint an exact time window for variousreasons. The source uses the name Ra as it once did in ancient Egypt.6.16 Questioner: What is the position of this planet with respect to progressionof the cycle at this time?Ra:…This sphere is at this time in fourth-dimension vibration. Its material isquite confused due to the society memory complexes embedded in itsconsciousness. It has not made an easy transition to the vibrations whichbeckon. Therefore, it will be fetched with some inconvenience.6.17 Questioner: Is this inconvenience imminent within a few years?Ra:…This inconvenience, or disharmonious vibratory complex, has begun several ofyour years in the past. It shall continue unabated for a period of approximatelythree oh, thirty [30], of your years.6.18 Questioner: After this thirty-year period I am assuming we will be afourth-dimension or fourth-density planet. Is this correct?Ra:…This is so.6.19 Questioner: [Is it] possible to estimate what percentage of [the] presentpopulation will inhabit the fourth-density planet?Ra: The harvesting is not yet, thus, estimation is meaningless.639[part0034.html#chapter021fn639]The Law of One series never got more specific than that. The Mayan calendar wasnever mentioned. The year 2012 was never mentioned. Hardly anyone was aware ofthese things back in 1981, including the members of L/L Research, who producedthe material. This idea of a dimensional shift fits perfectly with theprophecies given through the Sybil of Cumae. It also explains the Golden Ageprophecy that was embedded into the mythologies of more than thirty ancientcultures, as Graham Hancock popularized in 1995. Once we come into contact withthis information, do we just sit back and “wait for the magic”? I certainly didnot. There were enough leads given in the Law of One series to mount acomprehensive, scientific investigation. One intriguing clue I found in theearly days was that the Mayan calendar, at roughly 5,125 years, is almostexactly one-fifth of this 25,920-year cycle, coming in at approximately 25,627years.While I was writing The Source Field Investigations, I discovered that each ofthe subcycles the Mayan calendar is tracking—260 days, 360 days + 5, 7,200 days(19.7 years), and 144,000 days (397.4 years)—was directly synchronized with theorbits in our solar system. The 260-day tzolkin is the most widely appearing ofthese ancient cycles in Mesoamerica. Robert Peden, an Australian collegeprofessor, found that 260 days is the smallest possible number that interlocksall the orbits of the inner planets together.640 [part0034.html#chapter021fn640]The Mayans built a whole system of divination around this, tracking a twenty-daycycle and a thirteen-day cycle at the same time. Each day in each of thesecycles has a particular meaning, similar to astrology. The effects we experiencewill change as these two cycles intersect throughout the entire 260-day period.Conventional astronomers would never even believe a cycle like this could exist.The planetary orbits are not supposed to be so precisely interconnected, likethe gears in a grand cosmic clock. How could something as seemingly complex asthe orbits of the planets have such a simple, common denominator? Pedendiscovered this in 1981 but didn’t publish it until releasing it freely onlineon May 24, 2004.641 [part0034.html#chapter021fn641]Ultimately, I concluded that nothing in our solar system is random. Everythingwe now see is the result of a highly intricate system, perfect down to thesecond, which we are only just beginning to understand. So if the Mayan calendarwas tracking these time cycles that correspond to planetary orbits, how didthose time cycles get there in the first place? Why are there almost exactlyfive Mayan calendar cycles in one 25,920-year cycle? As of the summer of 2012, Iwas still searching for some sort of energetic framework that could be drivingthese orbits and their interconnectedness. Let’s say that instead of movingblindly through space, our sun is moving through an invisible matrix of somekind that is actually driving these cycles—including the 25,920-year cycle.WE ARE ORBITING A NEARLY INVISIBLE BROWN DWARF STARIn the summer of 2012, right before I left for New Zealand and Australia, Irealized that our sun was very likely orbiting a brown dwarf companion star, ascertain scholars have argued. The natural forces given off by the browndwarf—which we will discuss in a minute—would give us all the structure weneeded to energetically drive these planetary orbits and to synchronize them.This great orbit of our sun around another star—unknown to most people in ourmodern world—then becomes like the mainspring and central axis in a windupclock. Let’s say the sun is orbiting another star, which is not bright enough tobe easily visible. We can then use computer programs to mathematically round outthat orbit into a perfect circle, in order to show it in its “idealized” form.This may be the natural form the orbit would take if it were not for the gas,dust, and pressure pushing on it as it orbits the center of the galaxy. If weregularize the orbit into a circle, the Mayan calendar cycle length then forms aperfect five-sided geometry within it. This geometry may be the hidden reasonwhy the Mayan calendar works the way it does. This was the big missing piecethat paid off so many years of research. We already see geometry appearing in avariety of different circumstances in the natural sciences. We find it in thestructure of the atomic nucleus, as well as in greater groups of atoms calledmicroclusters. We also see it in the underlying structure of continents andmountain ranges on earth known as the global grid. Additionally, it appears inthe exact positioning of the planetary orbits. I had simply missed the grandfinale. I had not realized what our sun was actually experiencing as it movedthrough space. I was thrilled to solve the mystery—suddenly, everything becameexplainable.Although this is not a popular scientific notion, we can already prove that ourown sun is generating geometric energy waves that structure and drive the orbitsof the planets in our own solar system. The geometric spacing between theplanetary orbits was proven recently by John Martineau in A Little Book ofCoincidence in the Solar System. This is all featured in The Source FieldInvestigations, in detail. Martineau used modern computer technology to smoothout the orbits into perfect circles and then compare their relationships.Importantly, a perfect circle is also the equator of a perfect sphere if youextend it into a three-dimensional form.[../images/00029.gif]Fig. 19 [part0006.html#l19]: John Martineau’s illustration of triangularrelationship between orbits of Mercury and VenusTHE PLATONIC SOLIDSEach of these geometric patterns—whether in the atomic nucleus, microclusters,the global grid or the distances between the planets—is one of the five basicPlatonic solids.[../images/00030.jpeg]Fig. 20 [part0006.html#l20]: The Platonic Solids: forms that naturally appear ina vibrating fluidWhy are these patterns appearing so regularly in nature? It took me years tofind the answer. One early clue was that mathematicians knew these shapes hadmore symmetry than any other three-dimensional geometry we can generate. ThePlatonic solids are the most basic harmonic patterns that appear when youvibrate a fluid. This was discovered by Dr. Hans Jenny, who saw similar shapesappear when he vibrated muddy water.642 [part0034.html#chapter021fn642] Thecloudy dirt in the water was formed by millions of tiny particles of sand.Normally, these fine particles of sand were scattered everywhere, clouding upthe water. However, once Dr. Jenny vibrated the water with pure soundfrequencies, the particles all mysteriously formed into very precise geometricshapes. This also left huge, empty spaces of clean, pure water in between.[../images/00031.jpeg]Fig. 21 [part0006.html#l21]: Dr. Hans Jenny’s illustration of geometry in avibrating fluid. Sand particles form two different complex shapes as soundfrequency changes.These shapes stayed very solid and stable, as long as he continued to play thesame sound frequency into the water. Once Dr. Jenny changed the frequency ofvibration, different shapes appeared. You can see this in the change from theimage on the left, which is a set of cubes in three dimensions, to the image onthe right. Now we see two pyramid-like tetrahedrons, forming a six-pointed Starof David pattern when seen together.THE BIG SECRET OF QUANTUM MECHANICSThe big secret is that “dark matter,” “dark energy,” the “quantum foam,” and soon—the energy most scientists now believe must be creating matter—has fluidlikeproperties. I call this energy the Source Field and have conclusively proventhat it thinks. The Source Field is, quite literally, the energeticmanifestation of a Universal Mind. The vibrations of this “universal fluid”create geometric patterns. Any vibration of the fluid—any change in its basicstate—is what we could call a thought. What was the “one [and] only importantstatement” of the Confederation, in session 1 of the Law of One series?1.0 The Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator has onlyone important statement. That statement, my friends, as you know, is “Allthings, all of life, all of the creation is part of one original thought.”643[part0034.html#chapter021fn643][../images/00032.jpeg]Fig. 22 [part0006.html#l22]: Dr. Robert Moon’s geometric model of the atomicnucleusAt the quantum level, these geometric vibrations of the Source Field—of theUniversal Mind—turn into atoms and molecules. Dr. Robert Moon, who was part of asmall team entrusted to develop the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project,discovered this geometry in the nucleus of the atom in 1987.644[part0034.html#chapter021fn644] Dr. Moon solved many different quantum physicsproblems by developing this model.645 [part0034.html#chapter021fn645] In Moon’smodel, there are no particles in the atom. Each proton in the nucleus is simplyone corner of a geometric shape. Oxygen, for example, has eight protons. A cubehas eight points—four on the square on top, and four on the square on thebottom.The nucleus of the atom also has “shells” in it in Dr. Moon’s new model. Onceyou finish building one geometry, and more energy keeps coming in, anothergeometry begins to form around the first one. This new model also explains howatoms can appear to be “waves” and “particles” at the same time. They can appearto be both because they are made of a fluidlike energy that is vibrating. If youmeasure the energy like a wave, you will see a wave. If you look for a particle,you will see one of these geometric points and find a proton. Ultimately, thismeans that everything we see in the universe is an energy vibration. Nothingreally exists as a solid object. The mystery becomes even deeper once we seethat you can create your own geometric vibrations in this fluidlike energy—whichI call the Source Field—with your own thoughts. You can use this to “magnetize”certain things to you, such as in the Law of Attraction. As you become moreadvanced, you could use this same power to levitate objects with your mind, oreven manifest physical objects out of thin air. Great masters like Jesus wereable to do this because they understood the big secret: they are the SourceField. Thoughts are things. Or, as the young student of the Oracle said to Neoin The Matrix:ORACLE STUDENT: Do not try and bend the spoon. That’s impossible. Instead…onlytry to realize the truth.NEO: What truth?STUDENT: There is no spoon.NEO: There is no spoon?STUDENT: Then you’ll see that it is not the spoon that bends—it is onlyyourself.INTERNAL VIBRATIONS IN THE SUN CREATE THE ORBITAL SHELLSIn the case of our solar system, the sun has a variety of vibrations occurringinside itself, as well as on the surface. This is called “solar seismology.” Thesurface is heaving up and down in regular cycles, as Dr. David Guenther, aprofessor from the Department of Astronomy and Physics at St. Mary’s Universityin Halifax, Nova Scotia, mapped out.646 [part0034.html#chapter021fn646] Theoriginal observations that led to this discovery were made in 1962, by Leighton,Noyes, and Simon in their seminal work “Velocity Fields in the SolarAtmosphere,” published in Astrophysical Journal.647[part0034.html#chapter021fn647] They found that the surface of the sun appearedto be moving up and down in cycles lasting about five minutes. The sun’s surfaceis rising and falling by only a few meters every five minutes. This is stillmore than enough to create waves in a fluidlike Source Field that existsthroughout our solar system.These “vibrations” within the sun create ripples that move throughout thefluidlike energy in our solar system. The waves then bounce off our solarsystem’s outer gravitational boundary and reflect back toward the sun again.Along the way, these ripples collide with one another and form interferencepatterns. These interference patterns are what create the invisible geometricforce fields that hold the planets in their positions. This is the force ofgravity. It’s not just pulling planets toward the sun; it’s pushing them away aswell, in a constant push-pull dance, outward and inward. The Law of One seriestipped me off in 1996 that the solar system must be doing this. Here, the sourcedescribes this rhythmic action as occurring within the first star in theuniverse—the “central sun”:27.6 Intelligent infinity has a rhythm, or flow, as of a giant heart—beginningwith the central sun, as you would think or conceive of this. The presence ofthe flow [is as] inevitable as a tide of beingness without polarity, withoutfinity; the vast and silent all beating outward, outward, focusing outward andinward until the focuses are complete. The intelligence or consciousness of focihave reached a state where their, shall we say, spiritual nature or mass callsthem inward, inward, inward until all is coalesced. This is the rhythm ofreality as you spoke…. The basic rhythms of intelligent infinity are totallywithout distortion of any kind. The rhythms are clothed in mystery, for they arebeing itself.648 [part0034.html#chapter021fn648]GRAVITY IS THE SECRETGravity is ultimately caused by the flow of this fluidlike energy into a planet.Gravity is the Source Field. This constant flow of new energy is what allows theplanet to exist, moment by moment. This flow feeds each atom with new energy, asI demonstrated in The Source Field Investigations. My friend and colleague Dr.Nassim Haramein proved that the physics around the nucleus of an atom areeffectively the same as the physics around a black hole, for example.649[part0034.html#chapter021fn649] The Law of One series also heavily endorsed thework of Dewey Larson, who proposed in the 1950s that there is a parallel realityin which time is three-dimensional.650 [part0034.html#chapter021fn650] Larsonbacked up his theories with a great deal of provable evidence. In this next Lawof One quote, the source endorses Larson’s work. However, the source then goeson to say that a complete theory will need to include gravity and vibration inorder to solve all the mysteries:20.7 Questioner: Just as a sideline, a side question here: Is the physics ofDewey Larson correct?Ra:…The physics of sound vibrational complex Dewey is a correct system as far asit is able to go. There are those things which are not included in this system.However, those coming after this particular entity, using the basic concepts ofvibration and the study of vibrational distortions, will begin to understandthat which you know of as gravity and those things you consider as “n”dimensions. These things are necessary to be included in a more universal, shallwe say, physical theory.651 [part0034.html#chapter021fn651]Again, I read all of this in 1996. It took several more years for me to findscientific proof that the universe is made of living, conscious energy thatbehaves like a fluid and vibrates. These vibrations then form the geometry wehave just explored, from the quantum level on up. This is all very central tothe Law of One scientific model.THE TWENTY-FIVE-THOUSAND-YEAR CYCLEThe Law of One series extensively discusses the “25,000-year cycle,” as thesource calls it. The source says that this is a basic pattern that governs theevolution of all third-density life on any given planet in our Milky Way galaxy.6.15 Questioner: What is the length, in our years, of one of these cyclescurrently?Ra: One major cycle is approximately twenty-five thousand [25,000] of youryears. There are three cycles of this nature during which those who haveprogressed may be harvested at the end of three major cycles. That is,approximately between seventy-five and seventy-six thousand [75–76,000] of youryears. All are harvested regardless of their progress, for during that time theplanet itself has moved through the useful part of that dimension and begins tocease being useful for the lower levels of vibration within that [third]density.652 [part0034.html#chapter021fn652]In the Law of One model, there are literally millions of planets with humanlikebeings on them in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Each of them is very carefullywatched over and guided by beings in higher densities of existence. The humanson these planets are not expected to remain as third-density, flesh-and-bloodbiological life-forms forever. The universe is designed to promote our evolutioninto the Rainbow Body state in fixed intervals of time, spanning roughlytwenty-five thousand years. Each time one of these cycles ends, it is called a“harvest” in Law of One terms, as we saw earlier. Every third-density planet inour galaxy runs through three twenty-five-thousand-year cycles before it movesout of third density entirely and fully transitions into fourth density. We willreview Law of One descriptions of fourth density as we go on.In Western astrology, the movement from the Age of Pisces into the Age ofAquarius began around the end of the year 2012. The Mayan calendar end datelanded on December 21, 2012. The romantic notion was that somethingall-important and magnificent would happen on that very day. The reality is thatnothing obvious has occurred—at least not yet. Does this mean we simply give up,say that this was all a bunch of nonsense, and go back to fear, fear, fear ofthe new world order, martial law, and internment camps? Or, do we simply go backinto the matrix? Do we conclude that extraterrestrials do not exist, that noneof this “2012 stuff” meant anything, and that life on earth is going to stayordinary for the indefinite future? I don’t think it’s that simple. I’m sharingwith you, in detail, some of the information I have been looking at, andmeditating on, since December 21, 2012, came and went without any obvioustransformative effects.Most scientists believe this 25,920-year cycle is caused by a wobble in theearth’s axis. I was taken in by this same belief and spent many years trying tounderstand how it worked—and why it worked—within the Law of One model.[../images/00033.jpeg]Fig. 23 [part0006.html#l23]: The “precession of the equinoxes” is believed to bea 25,920-year “wobble” in the earth’s axis.Why would the earth be wobbling this way? Why should such a seeminglysuperficial movement of our earth’s axis have such massive consequences in theLaw of One model? Are we moving through a geometric pattern that is tugging onthe earth’s axis? What geometry could cause the earth to move in a slowcorkscrew fashion like this? How could this be happening on every third-densityplanet in our entire galaxy—as the Law of One series indicated? Even moreimportant, how could we fit this 25,920-year wobble into the greater model ofhuman evolution given in the Law of One series? I still hadn’t solved thismystery when I wrote The Source Field Investigations, but I was tantalizinglyclose to the answer. It just took me another year to figure out what it was. AsI said, the answer came thundering in on me, all at once, just days before I wasabout to leave on a five-city tour of New Zealand and Australia in 2012. Irealized that the answer was very simple: We live in a binary solar system. Weorbit our companion star over the course of 25,920 years. Our sun’s companionstar does not give off enough visible light to be easily observed. Stars likethis are called brown dwarves. The Sumerians called this companion star Nibiru,as Dr. Zecharia Sitchin meticulously documented in several of his scholarlyworks, beginning with Twelfth Planet.653 [part0034.html#chapter021fn653] Varioussecret societies, including the Masonic Order, know all about this companionstar at the highest levels and call it the Black Sun.Almost every Masonic diagram you can find has three celestial objects at thetop—the sun, the moon, and the Black Sun.Sometimes the Black Sun is also depicted as the Eye of Horus. A triangle mayalso be drawn around the eye. A number of investigators sided with ZechariaSitchin’s conclusions and believed that Nibiru would invade our solar system,cross by earth, and cause a pole shift at any time from 2003 to the end of 2012.I never believed that was possible due to the strong geometric forces we justexamined, which would repel any such large rogue object. Collisions withasteroids are one thing, but once you have objects with as much mass as a planetor star, their gravitational forces will naturally repel each other. Gravity isa push-pull force, unlike what we’ve been told in school. That is another basicscientific phenomenon that has apparently been hidden away by themilitary-industrial complex and its original founders for more than a century.This push-pull explains why the planets do not run out of angular momentum andcrash into the sun. Think about it. The sun has much more mass—and thereforemuch stronger gravitational attraction—than the planets. Shouldn’t the planets“run out of gas” eventually, lose their speed, and crash into the sun? Why dothey keep moving right along? They are being held in place—and pushed—bygeometric energy fields, as Martineau documented. As our sun orbits thiscompanion star, we are also moving through various geometric alignments.[../images/00034.gif]Fig. 24 [part0006.html#l24]: This Masonic illustration shows the Sun, the Moon,and a companion star.[../images/00035.jpeg]Fig. 25 [part0006.html#l25]: This is another one of many Masonic illustrationsshowing the Sun, the Moon, and a companion star.WALTER CRUTTENDEN GIVES THE PROOFWalter Cruttenden sent me his book Lost Star of Myth and Time in 2011, and Iknew that he was arguing in favor of the binary solar system model. I never hadtaken the time to read it, as I was too busy finishing The Source FieldInvestigations—and then I had forgotten about it. Now I realized he had to beright. I rushed over to the bookshelf and immediately started reading it, evenin the last-minute rush to pack for my trip. I was delighted to see severalcompelling pieces of scientific proof that the Great Year of 25,920 earth yearsmust be the direct result of our sun orbiting a companion star.[../images/00036.jpeg]Fig. 26 [part0006.html#l26]: Our Sun’s orbit around a binary companion star,smoothed into a perfect circle—also the equator of a perfect sphere.What if this is also one of the great Masonic secrets, and Freemasons swear onpain of death to uphold the secrets of the order? We can then begin tounderstand why NASA may have suppressed any evidence that would reveal this tothe public. If you want to reach the higher echelons of NASA, it certainly helpsto be a Freemason.Once you survey the evidence, it becomes very obvious. In fact, the excuses thatmainstream scientists have made to prop up the “earth wobble” model of the25,920-year cycle are actually quite laughable once you see how Cruttenden laysit all out. One of the best summaries of the evidence I have found online is inthe article “Is the Sun Part of a Binary Star System? Six Reasons to Consider,”on the website Signs of the Times.654 [part0034.html#chapter021fn654] The reasonwhy the stars move by one degree every seventy-two years through the night skyis that our entire solar system is moving like this. Every planet is affected bythis cycle. This also explains why several key phenomena we see within our solarsystem are not affected by the 25,920-year cycle. If the earth’s axis waswobbling on its own, then certain things like meteor showers, which repeat onthe same day every year for centuries, should have started to drift—but theydon’t. Every year, for as long as humans have been able to write, the meteorscome in, right on schedule, on the same day. Cruttenden also presents NASAevidence that fully 80 percent of the stars in our galaxy are binary stars. Wecan already see that they are orbiting other stars, as both of them are visiblein our telescopes. There are plenty of other stars our scientists haveidentified that do not give off visible light. Within the Law of One system, itwould therefore appear that all stars cluster into groups of at least two stars,if not more. By Law of One standards, any solar system that has planets withthird-density life would have to be orbiting a companion star in orbits lasting25,920 years. Stars are apparently built, by design, to travel around each otherin these 25,920-year patterns—at least during the times they host third-densitylife.LAW OF ONE QUOTES ON STAR SYSTEMS AS GALAXIESIn the fall of 2012, while I was on my extended sabbatical in Canada, I wentthrough the Law of One series again, extensively—and found quotes that stronglysuggested that this is how it works. Our solar system was described as a galaxy.Apparently we are governed by the same laws, on a much smaller level, that theMilky Way galaxy experiences on a larger level. Could a single star beconsidered a galaxy? No. It has to be a “star system.” This was very confusingto Dr. Don Elkins, the questioner. Take a look:16.33 There are many Confederations. This Confederation works with the planetaryspheres of seven of your galaxies, if you will, and is responsible for thecallings of the densities of these galaxies.16.34 Questioner: Would you define the word galaxy as you just used it?Ra: We use that term in this sense as you would use star systems.16.35 Questioner: I’m a little bit confused as to how many total planets theConfederation that you are in serves?Ra:…I see the confusion. We have difficulty with your language. The galaxy termmust be split. We call galaxy that vibrational complex that is local. Thus, yoursun is what we would call the center of a galaxy. We see you have anothermeaning for this term.655 [part0034.html#chapter021fn655]10.17 Questioner: Then would the nine planets and our sun we have here in oursystem, would you refer to that as a solar galaxy?Ra: We would not.656 [part0034.html#chapter021fn656]THESE QUOTES CLEARLY SPELL IT OUTI didn’t really examine and think about these quotes until I was aware ofCruttenden’s evidence supporting a binary solar system model. Once I had that inhand, these quotes jumped right out at me in sessions 10 and 16. The sourceclearly says that our solar system is a galaxy. A galaxy is a star system, notan individual star. This explains why, back in session 10, the source refused todefine “the nine planets and our sun” alone as a galaxy. Our sun is the centerof a galaxy. It is the center of a star system. In order for us to be living ina star system, there has to be more than one star. People from the Confederationof Planets, of which Ra is also a part, clearly appear to have conveyed thisknowledge to the ancients—and it appeared in the Masonic diagrams much later on.According to the Law of One series, these Masonic diagrams were hand-me-downsfrom ancient Confederation of Planets contacts. These contacts were originallyintended to teach people how to be more loving and kind to one another inpreparation for their own “graduation.” Since then, much of this knowledge hasbeen co-opted—and kept highly secret—by negative forces. The symbols and namesare now hated by many.Now I had a model that made sense. Now I could explain how both the Mayancalendar and the Ages of the Zodiac were being driven by geometric energy fieldsfrom our sun’s own companion star. Once again, we have to take John Martineau’slead and round out our sun’s natural orbit around the companion star into aperfect circle. Once we do this, the Mayan calendar cycle length, in years, cutsthe circle into exactly five sections. When we play connect the dots, we get apentagon.[../images/00037.jpeg]Fig. 27 [part0006.html#l27]: The Mayan calendar divides our Sun’s possible25,920-year orbit into five equal segments, forming a pentagon or dodecahedron.In this case, what we are seeing appears to be caused by a dodecahedron that isbeing formed by our sun’s companion. The top of the dodecahedron and the linesthat extend down from it form a pentagonal structure.This would mean that the end of the Mayan calendar is also when we come into ageometric alignment with this massive dodecahedron created by the companionstar. There is strong scientific evidence that every time we hit one of thesenode points on the dodecahedron, our sun has a major energetic shift. The earththen gets a massive boost of energy. The energetic surge directly affects ourclimate. This cycle was discovered by Dr. Lonnie Thompson, a glaciologist. Dr.Thompson never mentioned how close the fifty-two-hundred-year cycle hediscovered was to the Mayan calendar cycle of 5,125 years.[../images/00038.gif]Fig. 28 [part0006.html#l28]: The dodecahedron. Notice how each face is a perfectpentagon.MAJOR CLIMATE CHANGE OCCURRED 5,200 YEARS AGO: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HISTORYCOULD REPEAT ITSELFGlaciologist Lonnie Thompson worries that he may have found clues that showhistory repeating itself, and if he is right, the result could have importantimplications to modern society. Thompson has spent his career trekking to thefar corners of the world to find remote ice fields and then bring back coresdrilled from their centers. Within those cores are the records of ancientclimate from across the globe….A professor of geological sciences at Ohio State and a researcher with the ByrdPolar Research Center, Thompson points to markers in numerous records suggestingthat the climate was altered suddenly some 5,200 years ago with severe impacts….“Something happened back at this time and it was monumental,” Thompson said.“But it didn’t seem monumental to humans then because there were onlyapproximately 250 million people occupying the planet, compared to the 6.4billion we now have. “The evidence clearly points back to this point in historyand to some event that occurred. It also points to similar changes occurring intoday’s climate as well,” he said….Thompson believes that the 5,200-year old event may have been caused by adramatic fluctuation in solar energy reaching the earth…. Evidence shows thataround 5,200 years ago, solar output first dropped precipitously and then surgedover a short period. It is this huge solar energy oscillation that Thompsonbelieves may have triggered the climate change he sees in all those records.657[part0034.html#chapter021fn657]NOW THINGS LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENTThe Mayan calendar may well have been tracking our sun’s movement through thisgiant dodecahedron. Each time we hit one of these points, all life on earth isdramatically affected.Furthermore, the changes Dr. Lonnie Thompson observed from fifty-two hundredyears ago are not going to be as strong as what we would see at the end of theentire 25,920-year cycle. This is because we are also coming into alignment withother geometries at the same time.THE AGES OF THE ZODIACThe Ages of the Zodiac are also the likely result of a Star of David–typegeometry our sun is orbiting through—neatly dividing into twelve equal sections:[../images/00039.jpeg]Fig. 29 [part0006.html#l29]: The Ages of the Zodiac can be modeled by twotriangles, or tetrahedrons, in a circle or sphere—forming a Star of Davidpattern.Here is a breakdown of how this geometry divides the orbital circle into twelveequal sections. Each of these sections is 2,160 years long and forms an Age ofthe Zodiac:[../images/00040.jpeg]Fig. 30 [part0006.html#l30]: The Star of David pattern cuts the circle, orsphere, into twelve equidistant segments.This explains why the ancient Confederation of Planets extraterrestrial visitorscalled this 25,920-year cycle the Great Year. It is literally one “year” of thesun rotating around our companion star. Each Age of the Zodiac is one “month”within the Great Year. Once I finally saw how the pieces fit and startedillustrating it, I thought it was an original discovery. I created the graphicsat our Convergence conference in Phoenix, Arizona, over the weekend of November11, 2012—11/11—less than a month after I had returned from Canada. Once Istarted looking through old Masonic diagrams, the same pattern I had justcreated in Photoshop was jumping right out at me. In Figure 31[part0032.html#f31], we see in the center an S-shaped serpent with an arrowthrough it, surrounded by seven stars. This appears to be a representation ofour companion star. Notice, again, that the sun and the moon are positionedalongside the Star of David geometry.[../images/00041.gif]Fig. 31 [part0006.html#l31]: This Masonic/Thelemic diagram clearly indicates theSun, the Moon, and a Star of David pattern, indicative of the companion star.In Figure 32 [part0032.html#f32], we see an obvious connection being madebetween the Ages of the Zodiac—expressed here as their astrological symbols—andthe geometry of the companion star. In this case, Mercury is placed at thecenter. This is probably the result of people copying over old diagrams and notunderstanding their original meanings.[../images/00042.gif]Fig. 32 [part0006.html#l32]: This Masonic diagram again depicts the Sun, theMoon and a Star of David pattern, though by this point the original meaning mayhave been lost.Part of what makes the end of the 25,920-year cycle so powerful is that we arecoming into alignment with at least two different geometries at the same time:[../images/00043.jpeg]Fig. 33 [part0006.html#l33]: The Mayan calendar pentagon and Ages of the Zodiactriangles all have points that converge at the end-date of the Great Year.As you can see, this is the only time in the entire 25,920-year cycle where thegeometries directly overlap. This will create a region of much strongerenergetic charge than what we experience throughout the rest of the cycle—andsince this energy is ultimately intelligent and responsible for creatingbiological life and DNA as we know it, this grand alignment could indeed havepowerful effects on us as human beings. Once I realized that we were orbiting acompanion star and moving through its geometry, I was able to decipher a Law ofOne quote that had puzzled me for the last sixteen years.63.29 Questioner: Is there a clock-like face, shall I say, associated with theentire major galaxy—so that as it revolves, it carries all of these stars andplanetary systems through transitions from density to density? Is this how itworks?Ra: I am Ra. You are perceptive. You may see a three-dimensional clock face orspiral of endlessness which is planned by the Logos [i.e., the mind of thegalaxy] for this purpose.658 [part0034.html#chapter021fn658]This binary system model also explained a quote I read in session 9—really forthe first time. Now, based on everything we’ve discussed, this should make a lotmore sense:9.4 Questioner: The way I understand the process of evolution [of a] planetarypopulation is that [a] population has a certain amount of time to progress. Thisis generally divided into three 25,000-year cycles. At the end of 75,000 yearsthe planet progresses itself. What caused this situation to come about…[withthe] preciseness of the years, 25,000 years, et cetera. What set this up tobegin with?Ra:…Visualize, if you will, the particular energy which, outward flowing andinward coagulating, formed the tiny realm of the creation governed by yourCouncil of Saturn [i.e., your solar system]. Continue seeing the rhythm of thisprocess. The living flow creates a rhythm which is as inevitable as one of yourtimepieces. Each of your planetary entities began the first cycle when theenergy nexus was able in that environment to support such mind/body experiences.Thus, each of your planetary entities is on a different cyclical schedule, asyou might call it. The timing of these cycles is a measurement equal to aportion of intelligent energy. This intelligent energy offers a type of clock.The cycles move as precisely as a clock strikes your hour. Thus, the gatewayfrom intelligent energy to intelligent infinity opens, regardless ofcircumstance, on the striking of the hour.659 [part0034.html#chapter021fn659]According to the Law of One series, as we move through this transitional point,we pass through “the gateway to intelligent infinity.” For that moment, howeverbrief it may appear to be in physical terms, we shift back to the primordialessence of mind that created the universe before there was physical matter.While I was on sabbatical in Canada, another quote jumped out at me—clearlysuggesting that this process is not an instantaneous “cosmic light switch.”14.16 Questioner: There was no harvest [50,000 years ago on earth]? What about25,000 years ago? Was there a harvest then?Ra:…A harvesting began taking place in the latter portion, as you measuretime/space, of the second cycle, with individuals finding the gateway tointelligent infinity.660 [part0034.html#chapter0021fn660]Here, the source said that a “harvesting began taking place in the latterportion…of the second cycle.” This clearly implies something that does nothappen all in one moment. Notice it also said that “individuals [were] findingthe gateway to intelligent infinity.” This means not everyone finds the gatewayat the same time. Perhaps now that we’ve passed December 21, 2012, if you do thework, you will be able to get results. These results are apparently the same aswhat happened in the 160,000 cases of Rainbow Body documented in Tibet andChina.THE TRANSITION WILL BE GRADUALThe Law of One series is so complex that it can take years to work through it.In September 2012, I started re-reading it for the first time in several years.I didn’t work my way up to session 63 until I was finishing this book in March2013. I then found a quote that had eluded me up until that moment—but whichadded significant new insights into what exactly is expected to happen, andwhen. This new discovery cleared up quite a bit for me, and it suggested that wewill go through a transition that is significantly more gradual than I hadoriginally envisioned.63.25 Questioner: Then at some time in the future the fourth-density sphere willbe fully activated. What is the difference between full activation and partialactivation for this sphere?Ra:…At this time the cosmic influxes are conducive to true-color green coreparticles being formed and material of this nature thus being formed. However,there is a mixture of the yellow-ray and green-ray environments at this timenecessitating the birthing of transitional mind/body/spirit complex types ofenergy distortions. At full activation of the true-color green density of lovethe planetary sphere will be solid and inhabitable upon its own and the birthingthat takes place will have been transformed through the process of time, shallwe say, to the appropriate type of vehicle to appreciate in full thefourth-density planetary environment. At this nexus the green-ray environmentexists to a far greater extent in time/space than in space/time.661[part0034.html#chapter021fn661]63.27 Questioner: I will make this statement and have you correct me. What wehave is, as our planet is spiraled by the spiraling action of the entire majorgalaxy and our planetary system spirals into the new position, thefourth-density vibrations becoming more and more pronounced. These atomic corevibrations begin to create, more and more completely, the fourth-density sphereand the fourth-density bodily complexes for inhabitation of that sphere. Is thiscorrect?Ra: I am Ra. This is partially correct. To be corrected is the concept of thecreation of green-ray density bodily complexes. This creation will be gradualand will take place beginning with your third-density type of physical vehicleand, through the means of bisexual reproduction, become by evolutionaryprocesses, the fourth-density body complexes.662 [part0034.html#chapter021fn662]63.28 Questioner: Then are these entities of whom we have spoken, thethird-density harvestable who have been transferred, the ones who then will, bybisexual reproduction, create the fourth-density complexes that are necessary?Ra:…The influxes of true-color green energy complexes will more and more createthe conditions in which the atomic structure of cells of bodily complexes isthat of the density of love. The mind/body/spirit complexes inhabiting thesephysical vehicles will be, and to some extent, are, those of whom you spoke and,as harvest is completed, the harvested entities of this planetary influence.As we go back a bit further, we have a quote that clearly indicates we will liveour lives, die natural deaths at whatever time is appropriate, and thenreincarnate in fourth density. However, the real magic lies in the fact that ifyou can become “double bodied,” you can start doing fourth-density magic trickswhile you’re still in your physical body.63.12 Questioner: Approximately how many are here now who have come here fromother planets who are third-density harvestable for fourth-density experience?Ra:…This is a recent, shall we say, phenomenon and the number is not yet inexcess of 35,000 entities.63.13 Questioner: Now these entities incarnate into a third-density vibratorybody. I am trying to understand how this transition takes place from third tofourth-density. I will take the example of one of these entities of which we arespeaking who is now in a third-density body. He will grow older and then will itbe necessary that he die from the third-density physical body and reincarnate ina fourth-density body for that transition?Ra:…These entities are those incarnating with what you may call a double body inactivation. It will be noted that the entities birthing these fourth-densityentities experience a great feeling of, shall we say, the connection and the useof spiritual energies during pregnancy. This is due to the necessity formanifesting the double body. This transitional body is one which will be, shallwe say, able to appreciate fourth-density vibratory complexes as the instreamingincreases without the accompanying disruption of the third-density body. If athird-density entity were, shall we say, electrically aware of fourth-density infull, the third-density electrical fields would fail due to incompatibility. Toanswer your query about death, these entities will die according tothird-density necessities.63.14 Questioner: You are saying, then, that for the transition from third tofourth-density for one of the entities with doubly activated bodies, in order tomake the transition the third-density body will go through the process of whatwe call death. Is this correct?Ra:…The third and fourth, combination, density’s body will die according to thenecessity of third-density mind/body/spirit complex distortions. We may respondto the heart of your questioning by noting that the purpose of such combinedactivation of mind/body/spirit complexes is that such entities, to some extent,consciously are aware of those fourth-density understandings which third densityis unable to remember due to the forgetting. Thus fourth-density experience maybe begun with the added attraction, to an entity oriented towards service toothers, of dwelling in a troubled third-density environment and offering itslove and compassion.63.15 Questioner: Would the purpose in transitioning to Earth prior to thecomplete changeover then be for the experience to be gained here before theharvesting process?Ra:…This is correct. These entities are not Wanderers in the sense that thisplanetary sphere is their fourth-density home planet. However, the experience ofthis service is earned only by those harvested third-density entities which havedemonstrated a great deal of orientation towards service to others. It is aprivilege to be allowed this early an incarnation as there is much experientialcatalyst in service to other-selves at this harvesting.663[part0034.html#chapter021fn663]SPECIFIC QUOTES ON THE QUANTUM LEAPHere is the first quote that specifically mentions a quantum leap or a quantumjump that is expected to occur. This will create enough of a transition fromthird to fourth density that people may begin having the capacity to become“double bodied” in much greater numbers after this timeframe.40.10 Questioner: I am assuming that this vibratory increase [into fourthdensity] began about twenty to thirty years ago [as of January 1981]. Is thiscorrect?Ra:…The first harbingers of this were approximately forty-five of your years ago[1936], the energies vibrating more intensely through the forty-year periodpreceding the final movement of vibratory matter, shall we say, through thequantum leap, as you would call it.40.11 Questioner: Starting then, forty-five years ago, and taking the entireincrease of vibration that we will experience in this density change,approximately what percentage through this increase in vibrational change are weright now?Ra:…The vibratory nature of your environment is true color, green. This is atthis time heavily over-woven with the orange ray of planetary consciousness.However, the nature of quanta is such that the movement over the boundary isthat of discrete placement of vibratory level.664[part0034.html#chapter021fn664]In case you didn’t catch it, the Law of One clearly predicts a “final movementof vibratory matter…through [a] quantum leap,” in our own present time. Its alsosays that “the movement over the boundary is that of discrete placement ofvibratory level.” The dictionary definition of “discrete” is “apart or detachedfrom others; separate; distinct.”665 [part0034.html#chapter021fn665] Therefore,this new vibratory level is a “separate and distinct” realm that is “apart ordetached from [the] others”—including third density. We do see in session 40that the basic nature of matter, energy, and consciousness goes through aquantum shift when this “harvest” event finally happens:40.5 Questioner: Thank you. Taking as an example the transition between secondand third-density, when this transition takes place, does the frequency ofvibration which forms the photon (the core of all the particles of the density)increase? [Does the vibration change] from a frequency corresponding to seconddensity, or the color orange, to the frequency that we measure as the coloryellow? What I am getting at is, do all the vibrations that form the density,the basic vibrations of the photon, increase in a quantum fashion over arelatively short period of time?Ra:…This is correct.666 [part0034.html#chapter021fn666]FOURTH-DENSITY QUANTUM DIFFERENCESIn Law of One terms, the “fourth density” state of existence has key, quantumdifferences from our own, in the most basic nature of our existence. This isexpressed in session 16:16.50 Questioner: Is it possible for you to give a small description of theconditions [in] fourth density?Ra:…We ask you to consider as we speak that there are no words for positivelydescribing fourth density. We can only explain what is not and approximate whatis. Beyond fourth density our ability grows more limited still—until we becomewithout words. That which fourth density is not: it is not of words, unlesschosen. It is not of heavy chemical vehicles for body complex activities. It isnot of disharmony within self. It is not of disharmony within peoples. It is notwithin limits of possibility to cause disharmony in any way.667[part0034.html#chapter021fn667]“It is not of words, unless chosen.” We will have telepathic powers that are sostrong, and so fast, that speaking with our mouths is ridiculously slow. In mostcases, it would also be pointless to speak this way, like going back to dial-upInternet access in the modern era of broadband. “It is not of heavy chemicalvehicles for body complex activities.” We now have achieved the RainbowBody—just as we saw in over 160,000 documented cases in Tibet and China. Once wefully reincarnate into fourth density, we no longer have a flesh-and-bloodbody—in other words, a “heavy chemical vehicle for [the] body complex.” “It isnot within limits of possibility to cause disharmony in any way.” Think aboutwhat this means. It is literally impossible to create anger, stress, pressure,frustration, disappointment, or humiliation—for yourself or anyone else. It isimpossible to lie, cheat, steal, disrespect, badger, bully, annoy, or dishonoranyone. Everyone knows everything you are thinking—at all times.In session 20, we get an exact estimate of how much more enjoyable it is to livein fourth density than in our current third-density level. The sourcespecifically states that fourth density is “one hundred times more harmonious,”as we see here.20.24 The mind/body/spirit complex of third density has perhaps one hundredtimes as intensive a program of catalytic action from which to distilldistortions and learn/teachings than any other of the densities.668[part0034.html#chapter021fn668]“Catalytic action” means events that cause us to grow spiritually. In Law of Oneterms, catalysts often appear in our lives as very difficult experiences. Manypeople who study spirituality would refer to this process as “burning offkarma”—and it’s essentially the same idea here. This means that even in fourthdensity—never mind fifth or sixth—life is one hundred times happier, easier,more pleasurable, and fulfilling than life in third density.There are additional quotes in session 16 that tell us what fourth-density lifeis like. Now we will pick up at the exact point where we left off before:16.50 Approximations of positive statements [for life in fourth density]: It isa plane of a type of bipedal vehicle [in other words, a two-legged body] whichis much denser and more full of life; it is a plane wherein one is aware of thethoughts of other-selves; it is a plane where one is aware of the vibrations ofother-selves; it is a plane of compassion and understanding of the sorrows ofthird density; it is a plane striving towards wisdom or light; it is a planewherein individual differences are pronounced, although automatically harmonizedby group consensus.669 [part0034.html#chapter021fn669]We are still well within an acceptable window where this “quantum jump” couldhappen, but now there is no absolute date for us to obsess on. The closest wehave to a timeline is the statement we read earlier, indicating that it would be“approximately 30 years” after 1981.However, the source did not say “thirty-five years”—it said “approximately”thirty years. Therefore, anything much past thirty-three years from 1981 wouldprobably have caused the source to lean toward a figure of thirty-five yearsinstead of thirty. In some ways I am relieved that we have now passed a hurdlewhere there is no absolute date for us to argue over. I do believe some verysignificant and wonderful events are set to occur between now and whenever thisshift finally happens.IT IS DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO PINPOINT AN EXACT TIMEThe source also said it was very difficult to pin down exact times for certainevents with precision. There are factors that influence the outcome and that aregoverned to a certain degree by random acts of free will. Here are some quoteswhere the source describes this:89.8 Our intervening space/time has been experienced in a manner quite unlikeyour third-density experience of space/time.670 [part0034.html#chapter021fn670]14.4…We are not totally able to process your space/time continuum measurementsystem.671 [part0034.html#chapter021fn671]65.9 The value of prophecy must be realized to be only that of expressingpossibilities. Moreover, it must be, in our humble opinion, carefully taken intoconsideration that any time/space viewing, whether by one of your time/space orby one such as we, who view the time/space from a dimension, shall we say,exterior to it, will have a quite difficult time expressing time measurementvalues. Thus, prophecy given in specific terms is more interesting for thecontent or type of possibility predicted than for the space/time nexus of itssupposed occurrence.672 [part0034.html#chapter021fn672]17.29 Questioner: Am I to understand that the harvest will occur in the year2011, or will it be spread?Ra:…This is an approximation. We have stated we have difficulty with yourtime/space. This is an appropriate probable/possible time/space nexus forharvest. Those who are not in incarnation at this time will be included in theharvest.673 [part0034.html#chapter021fn673]STILL WELL WITHIN THE WINDOWAt the time of this writing in April 2013, we are still well within the windowof “approximately 30 years.” The gradual transition into the “double-bodied”state, where we have a fourth-density body available to us while still in ourthird-density form, does now appear to be under way. If this prophecy is true,then we can expect to see ever-increasingly powerful capabilities appearing inordinary people. This may very well correspond with the final vanquishing of thenemesis on the global stage—and the access to the Elixir of Immortality that ithas been guarding all along. This includes advanced technology that can heal ourplanet, as well as the absolute knowledge that we are not alone. Reconnectingwith our human relatives may be a very important part of this transitionalprocess.THE HARVESTThe Law of One series specifically indicated that this marvelous event wascalled “harvest.” Only recently did I realize that they were directly quotingfrom the book of Matthew. This describes a moment in time where the wicked areliterally pulled into an alternate timeline—a different reality—from everyoneelse. Jesus used symbolism to explain this. Humans on earth, in the spiritualsense, were compared to a field of wheat that has been planted. The seeds arethe spiritual teachings that are given to us by Jesus and other great masters.These spiritual teachings, if from the positive path, invariably tell us to bemore loving, accepting, and forgiving of others—to realize that we are all one.Humility, patience, kindness, charity, being a good listener, and believing inand supporting the innate goodness of others—regardless of who they may be—areall key aspects of these teachings. Very few people in our modern world seem torealize that the further you go in this direction, the more likely you are toascend and literally transform into the next level of human evolution.However, we also have “the adversary,” who plants weeds, or “tares,” in thecrop. These are also teachings that are made available to everyone. Our societyis bursting with them. These teachings center on pursuing material things—money,power, fame, and prestige. They create, foster, and encourage narcissism,entitlement, rudeness, dominant behavior, and self-aggrandizement. Everything isbuilt around a hierarchy. Power must not be questioned. The will of the few isimposed upon the many. We are all taught to fear “Big Brother.” We know, deepinside, that seriously corrupt forces exist. We are also taught to believe theyare indestructible, and our best bet is to ignore them and accept theirunchanging reality in our lives. Until the rise of Internet streaming video,most people’s lives were utterly dominated by corporate propaganda from watchingtelevision. We were bombarded by advertisements and taught that we had to sufferthis propaganda in order to enjoy our lives. Now, all of that is changing. Eachof us has the choice to focus on positive, loving material and avoid re-creatingthe cycles of torture and pain that have plagued us for so long.WHAT ABOUT THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST?Obviously, scholars of the Bible will see huge parallels with everything I’msaying here and the concept of the Second Coming of Christ. This was directlyexplained in the Law of One series, as follows:17.22 Questioner: In our culture there is a great saying that he [Jesus] willreturn. Can you tell me if this is planned?Ra:…I will attempt to sort out this question. It is difficult. This entitybecame aware that it was not an entity of itself but operated as a messenger ofthe One Creator—whom this entity saw as love. This entity was aware that thiscycle was in its last portion—and spoke to the effect that those of itsconsciousness would return at the harvest. The particular mind/body/spiritcomplex you call Jesus is, as what you would call an entity, not toreturn—except as a member of the Confederation occasionally speaking through achannel. However, there are others of the identical congruency of consciousnessthat will welcome those to the fourth density. This is the meaning of thereturning.674 [part0034.html#chapter021fn674]This clearly implies that part of our transitional process into becoming“double-bodied,” with a fourth-density activation while still in a human form,does involve disclosure, when we fully realize we are not alone. Although therehave been many efforts to make the public afraid of extraterrestrial life, oncewe realize these people are human—and that they have been helping us allalong—this could be a powerful influence to enable a much greater awakening totake place. Once we find out that the world we were taught to believe in by themedia was fake, it will be an unprecedented transformation. History will changeso much that it is almost impossible to predict what it will look like until weactually get there. Hardly any of the pioneers in the Truth Movement have delvedinto the scientific knowledge that has been suppressed as I did in The SourceField Investigations. Until we defeat financial tyranny—or at the very leaststrike a truce where the Cabal allows the truth to be exposed—this informationwill probably never be able to reach a widespread level. The patriotic elementsof the US military cannot step forward and reveal that they have had ongoingdiplomatic relationships with a wide variety of extraterrestrials, as well asstar gates and antigravity spacecraft.FOURTH-DENSITY LIFEOur ultimate destination in this process appears to be that we are reborn intoan entirely new plane of existence. Highly advanced souls are able tospontaneously transform themselves into this state without having to undergophysical death and reincarnation. In Christian terms, this is calledascension—and I often use that same word to describe it, though I do notassociate the term with any religion. There are more than 160,000 documentedcases of this happening in Tibet and China alone, in which advanced mastersachieved the state they called the Rainbow Body. This legend appears in manytraditional cultures, as this next quote from William Henry and Mark Grayreveals:In Sufism it is called “the most sacred body” and the “supracelestial body.”Taoists call it “the diamond body,” and those who have attained it are called“the immortals” and “the cloudwalkers.” Yogic schools and Tantrics call it “thedivine body.” In Kriya yoga it is called “the body of bliss.” In Vedanta it iscalled “the superconductive body.” The ancient Egyptians called it “the luminousbody or being” (akh) or the karast. This conception evolved into Gnosticism,where it is called “the radiant body.” In the Mithraic liturgy it was called“the perfect body.”…In the Hermetic Corpus, it is called “the immortal body.” Inthe alchemical tradition, the Emerald Tablet calls it “the golden body.”675[part0034.html#chapter021fn675]DE-FANGING THE VAMPIREGovernments often rise and fall as a result of how well they can manipulate ourdeep-seated fears that God has abandoned us and trick us into believing we arein a grand struggle against a fearsome nemesis. They may even secretly own andcontrol that same nemesis to ensure that they win—regardless of the outcome. Theelected leaders, even at the highest levels, may at times be completely unawarethat this is happening. The people may end up being terrified that their “side”is not winning, rather than realizing that there is no side. We are all childrenof an infinite intelligence that created the entire universe and all life withinit—and loves us more than we could ever possibly imagine. My own spiritualjourney led me to the direct knowing that this is true…and you can reach a placeof stillness in yourself when it becomes obvious.When those around us are suffering, we are suffering—and when those around usare in a state of love and peace, we feel love and peace. When the seventhousand people who meditated and made worldwide terrorist activity go down by72 percent were creating positive energy, the energy they created didn’t say,“Wait a minute. That person is a liberal. That person is a Muslim. That personis gay. That person is black. Don’t go over there. Just skip that one!” Not atall. The reality is that everyone gets better. Nearly three out of fourpotential terrorists in the world decided not to pick up that gun, detonate thatbomb, or kill that child.THE QUR’AN HAS VERY SIMILAR PASSAGESWesterners in the Judeo-Christian tradition have been barraged with mediapropaganda suggesting that the Qur’an, the sacred scripture of Islam, is ahandbook for evil and a hotbed breeding-ground for terrorism. While I do notagree with everything in the Qur’an, just as is the case with all otherreligious scriptures, there are some very interesting passages in it thatheavily support everything we’ve been talking about. These excerpts are from LexHixon’s English translations in The Heart of the Qur’an, which was firstpublished in 1988. While they are not strictly literal, word-for-wordtranslations, Hixon does his best to convey the core of the teachings. I wasquite surprised when a reader sent me this book with certain passageshighlighted, as these and other passages were essentially saying many of thesame things we see in the Law of One series. The Qur’an strongly suggests thatsome form of worldwide energetic event will occur as we go through thistransitional process. This only adds to the adventure—and reminds me that weprobably will never know exactly what will happen until it actually does.There exists only one Supreme Source, one inexhaustible Power…the profoundlyliving One, the Life beyond time that never diminishes. The One Reality neversleeps, nor even for a moment rests Its embracing Awareness. To the One alonebelongs the emanation of planetary existence and the seven higher planes ofBeing, as spreading rays of sunlight belong to a single sun. There is no beingwho can turn toward the Ever-Present Source in prayer or contemplation exceptthrough the Power and love that flow from the Source Itself. Since the UltimateSource abides beyond time, It always remains perfectly aware of what causesprecede and what results follow from each event.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an2:255676 [part0034.html#chapter021fn676]You must come to know with absolute certitude that from above your consciousbeing, as stars above the earth, there gaze angelic protectors…. Upon pages oflight in the invisible book of your life, which will become visible on the Dayof Truth, these heavenly beings record all your actions and reactions. Even themost secret motivations they perceive and transcribe with perfectclarity.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 82:10–12677 [part0034.html#chapter021fn677]When time suddenly disappears, in the eternal moment of illumination thebrightness of the heavenly orbs will be split open and dissolved intotransparent light…. Those who fail to live in constant expectation of the mysticDay, regarding this teaching as myth or imagination, will be severelydisappointed when the Last Day actually arrives and they are not spirituallyprepared.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 77:8, 15678 [part0034.html#chapter021fn678]Upon the mysterious Day when time ends, all manifest Being will tremble at thefirst thundering blast of Divine Resonance that will utterly stop the world….This momentary terror will disappear when each soul realizes its spiritual bodyto be perfect, limitless and holy.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 79:6, 13679[part0034.html#chapter021fn679]When the Day of Enlightenment dawns, the soul, expressed as a luminous body, theface of its being suffused with calm joy, awakens into the supernal garden ofDivine Presence, overwhelmed to comprehend at last the full significance of itsown spiritual commitment.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 88:1–5680[part0034.html#chapter021fn680]On that timeless and transcendent Day, human beings will experience resurrectionin bodies composed of light, and will be shown clearly all the thoughts andactions of their lifetimes.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 99:4681[part0034.html#chapter021fn681]How few human beings understand the intensity and magnitude of the swiftlyapproaching Day of Clarification. Those who do not really comprehend the natureof the Last Day are impatient and would like to speed its arrival, whereas thosewho know the immense power of the Living Truth stand in trembling awe before thedawning of this infinite Day.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 42:7682[part0034.html#chapter021fn682]This note comes from the editor of the book—and emphasizes the positive aspectsof these teachings that are so often misunderstood or overlooked in the Westernworld.The Qur’an repeatedly emphasizes living a life of modesty, gratitude, honesty,justice, compassion, and love. More than any outward signs of piety, it seesthese qualities as identifying…the person surrendered to the One Reality….Ultimately, the “Lovers of Love” described by the Qur’an are those who becometheir own miracles of compassion and peace, whether they come to publicattention in the world or not.—Editor683 [part0034.html#chapter021fn683]Lastly, this message in the Qur’an is surprisingly open and honest, in showingthat ultimately all of us have the choice to follow whatever spiritual teachingswe prefer…and there are many ways back to the One.If each spiritual nation practices faithfully the path revealed through its ownHoly Prophets, then all humanity will return together to the Source ofLove.—Meditation on Holy Qur’an 5:51684 [part0034.html#chapter021fn684]LOOKING TO THE FUTUREIt is a great honor and privilege to have re-discovered this ancient science—anda huge relief to have finally put it all together into a full-length book. Iknew a great deal of “homework” would be involved in creating a definitive,up-to-date work on the cycles of history, and there certainly was. It took meabout three and a half years of research, meditation, lecturing and writingabout these concepts to get here. This work is obviously controversial, andplenty of people have attacked and criticized my efforts in the past. I continueto do the best I can, knowing in advance that nothing is perfect, and there willalways be critics out there. I can listen to a marvelous jazz ensembleperforming a piece that I feel to be dazzlingly technical and beautiful, only tohave others tell me they “absolutely hate jazz” and refuse to listen to it.Similarly, I have detailed exactly what I’m seeing in this book, and how I feelall these pieces fit together. I genuinely enjoyed the process, and have createdsomething that I now feel very proud of. Undoubtedly, some people will feel thatit is very inspiring and meaningful, while others will attack it withastonishing savagery and mockery.I do feel that our investigation of the cycles of history is still in itsinfancy. There are many, many more avenues to explore. I could easily writeanother full-length book that explains all the technical details of how thesecycles may actually be working, including the evidence that we live in a binarysolar system. There is much more to be said about how the geometry may behelping to push the cycles along. I did have a dream in January 2013 suggestingthat I think of this as a trilogy, and not to attempt to answer every technicalquestion in this volume. The Source Field Investigations has many of the piecesthat are needed to construct this grand model, but the real art lies in how weweave them together.This is certainly not a book for everyone. Some people will have encountered somuch psychological resistance in reading it that they probably never made itvery far. Volumes of scientific evidence are only useful when we are willing tolook at them. At the time of this writing, much of this information would stillbe considered “fringe” and “pseudoscience.” Synchronicity is ultimately apersonal experience—and it can be quite elusive for those who refuse to believeit is possible. Very interesting personal and global events are often dismissedby skeptics as being utterly irrelevant. The voice of the collective, asexpressed in mainstream media, can be extremely compelling for many people.Shame can be a very powerful deterrent from the quest for deeper meaning andtruth. There are tools available, such as hypnotic regression, that can helpawaken you to the greater reality I have outlined in this book—but without thatinitial desire to seek the truth, these keys will probably never be used orappreciated.Our transition into a Golden Age may continue to be a gradual process, but atsome point we may very well step back and marvel at how much has happened insuch a short time. Even though history may very well be repeating itself, westill have choices to make. We are not on a fixed timeline. We are not destinedto experience a single outcome. We can change the story. The universe may verywell be a living being—encouraging us to grow and evolve into our truestidentity. Synchronicity is the key that unlocks the greatest mystery of alltime."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI would like to thank the living universe, and its emissaries, for the gift oflife and consciousness, and the guidance to help us remember who we really are.I would like to thank my mother, Marta Waterman; my father, Don Wilcock; and mybrother, Michael Wilcock, for giving me a stable and loving family environmentthat helped me develop into who I am today.
