[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" PROLOGUE: THE MYSTERY IS REVEALED! PROLOGUE: THE MYSTERY IS REVEALED! On September 11, 2001, the Earth was rocked by a meticulously planned strike at the financial and military heart of the world’s last superpower, as ordinary passenger airliners turned into weapons of mass destruction, reducing the twin towers of the World Trade Center to a pile of rubble and exploding one wing of the Pentagon. Prior to this event it was quite common for the general public to proclaim that everything was “normal” and ignore many obvious signposts that humanity, the Earth and solar system at large were all undergoing tremendous, unprecedented change, which includes the following ever-increasing trends: • A 410-percent increase in the overall number of natural catastrophes on Earth between 1963 and 1993 (Dmitriev 1997) • A 400-percent increase in the number of quakes on Earth (over 2.5 on the Richter scale) since 1973 (Mandeville 1998) • A 500-percent increase in Earth’s volcanic activity between 1875 and 1993 (Mandeville 2000) • 9 out of the 21 most severe earthquakes from 856-1999 AD occurred in the 20th century (Russian National Earthquake Information Center, 1999) • A 230-percent increase in the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field since 1901 (Lockwood, 1998) • A 300-percent increase in the amount of “severe” solar activity than what was formally predicted for the year 1997 alone (NASA 1998) • 400-percent or higher increases in the speed that solar particle emissions are capable of traveling through the energy of interplanetary space (NASA 1997-2001) • Recent magnetic pole shifts of Uranus and Neptune, as Voyager 2 observed their magnetic axes being significantly offset from their rotational axes (Dmitriev 1997) • Visible brightness increases now being detected on Saturn (Dmitriev 1997) • 200-percent increase in the intensity of Jupiter’s magnetic field from 1992 -97 (Dmitriev 1997) • 200-percent increase in the known density of Mars’ atmosphere encountered by the Mars Surveyor satellite in 1997 (NASA 1997) • Significant melting of Martian polar icecaps in just one year, clearly seen in satellite photography (NASA 2001) • Significant physical, chemical and optical changes on Venus, including a sharp decrease in sulfur-containing gases in its atmosphere and increasing brightness (Dmitriev 1997) If we remember that the Sun contains fully 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System, then we can easily see that it wields the strongest thermal, gravitational and electromagnetic influence. In this book we will identify a clear physical mechanism that is causing our Sun to experience remarkable changes. These significant energetic changes in the Sun are then radiated outwardly via the “Solar Wind,” dramatically increasing the charge and permeability of interplanetary space, causing charged particles to travel more quickly much as a droplet of water dashes around on a sizzling hot pan. The electromagnetic fields of the planets then absorb this increased energy flux, producing anomalous changes including internal heating, increases in earthquakes, volcanism and other natural catastrophes, increases in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"brightness and even magnetic pole shift. Though Western science is not yet equipped to explain how such changes as earthquakes could be caused by an “outside” energetic influence, the full mystery is known amongst Russian scientific circles, and is easily explained by correcting certain fundamental errors in our prevailing concepts. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media gives almost zero coverage of even the most basic of the changes we have listed. Even in the Internet-dominated Western alternative / metaphysical media, one only hears about the changes in solar activity and increases in Earth’s cataclysmic activity on occasion. Thus, a basic media-induced blindness of the workings of our own Earth and Solar System allowed most people to say that everything was “normal,” prior to 9-11-01. And yet, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, it is undeniable to almost everyone that certain ancient prophecies, such as those of the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Hopi, the Maya, the Hindu, the Buddhist and the aboriginal, appear to be taking place almost line by line. Increasing wars, diseases, earthquakes, volcanoes, droughts and other natural cataclysms, which eventually lead up to a “pole shift,” all follow the pattern of “tribulations” that have been predicted by literally almost every source of religion or prophecy that has been recorded. That such tribulations are upon us now is evident, and easily proven scientifically. What most adherents to these various teachings do not realize is that these phenomena are being caused by a fundamental energetic change taking place throughout the entire Solar System. When most people think of “Biblical prophecy,” their mind immediately conjures up images of chaos, apocalypse and destruction, often believing on some level that the Earth is to be annihilated and there is little if anything to be done about it. A certain, noticeably smaller cluster of groups, associated with the now-distasteful label of “religious fundamentalists,” are essentially standing by and waiting for Jesus to return and lift their own sect of “chosen” followers up to heaven in a “rapture” event, to the exclusion of all other sects. They also believe that the Earth will have “a thousand years of peace” after this event, and that after being “taken up,” they will return to Earth in some newly transformed condition. Conventional science has no provision whatsoever for such a notion to even be discussed, much less proven, and thus it is tossed to the side without a second thought. Furthermore, the exclusivist nature of such denominational groups is extremely distasteful to all those who refuse to accept the dogma. Enter our next subculture of discussion, the ever-increasing majority of the population who are actively interested in alternative spirituality, ancient cultures, prophecy, secret mystery schools, indigenous teachings, sacred geometry, extraterrestrial / angelic visitations, exotic physics and the like. Although there are an enormous number of books available on these topics, the Internet has brought these concepts home to a far wider audience in a way that was never before imagined. It is from this increasing subculture that a new paradigm has been struggling to emerge; a paradigm that offers unforeseen insights into the nature of reality and our place within that reality. It is a paradigm of “initiation,” where one ceases to adhere to reductionist scientific ideals and instead becomes aware that a higher spiritual reality underlies all of physical existence as we know it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In this book, we hope to direct the reader through a dramatic initiation process, delineating an entirely new view of the universe that will explain exactly what is happening to the Solar System at this time, why it is happening and what we can expect that it will “do.” The key difference between this book and most other sources of literature on such topics is that each step of our argument will be rooted in clear, unambiguous scientific research. This illumination and initiation for the mind will in turn bear noble fruits, building one’s sense of character, purpose and destiny and providing strong incentive to aspire to higher physical, mental and spiritual growth. We will learn that our entire understanding of the nature of physical matter is radically under-developed, and that the energy increases that we see in the Solar System will indeed culminate in what may be thought of as a “dimensional shift.” It is our choice as to whether or not we will be willing to accept the attitude of loving-kindness that is required for participation in this event, and the Golden Age of human civilization that shall follow it. Here is our first source of conflict. Many readers are bringing in a mindset and belief structure that such changes and events are simply not possible. They may quickly stop reading upon realizing that such an initiation does require a great deal of work before the vision of the authors can be truly integrated. Many books of this type have been attempted where a few precious nuggets of valuable data are hidden within endless paragraphs of wasted, repetitious verbiage, which few have the time or patience to read. However, this book contains nothing but those nuggets, enough to spawn an entire legion of books, in a clear and compressed format. The words must be savored and studied with care, and cannot be “skimmed” through as one would normally glance at page after page of email or newspaper articles. Comprehension is dramatically enhanced by printing a hard copy of the book and writing in liner notes as one goes along. The mind must be kept extremely open in order to see facts as facts and not be blinded by the misunderstandings that continue to be perpetuated under the guise of authority from the scientific mainstream. Rare are those individuals who choose to investigate such matters for themselves instead of continuing to believe the “conventional wisdom” without question. Let us furthermore consider the reader who already “knows” that our conclusion cannot be valid. For such a person, is there any point in proceeding further? Most likely, this event is not expected to occur until at least months or possibly even years after the time that the book is read, and some will refuse to believe that it will ever occur at all. If so, then on the simple, day-to-day level of understanding, why would one benefit from such an initiation into the knowledge of the hidden nature of the Universe? Is this event something for which we should just “sit and wait,” or is there a more immediately valid reason to begin studying this material today? In deep meditation, we discover that the single root cause of all our suffering is the subconscious belief that God has abandoned us. We refer to this belief as the “Original Wound.” Our parents, teachers, brothers, sisters, friends, lovers, employers, governments and institutions, as well as our relationships with money, education and with the health and condition of our physical bodies, all present us with opportunities to feel disgraced, humiliated, alienated and abandoned at various times, when our search for love, friendship and belongingness is shot down. What most of us never will realize"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"is that these situations are triggering a tremendous subconscious charge of anger and resentment at God. The conscious mind has concluded that God is all knowing and all loving, but the subconscious mind often feels cut off, depressed and isolated in despair. Diseases of addiction to food, sex, shopping, television, the Internet, coffee, alcohol, drugs, victimhood, blame, rage and all other forms of materialism are our way of seeking “instant gratification” for the part of ourselves that feels abandoned. However, it is an established spiritual fact that all such distractions must eventually collapse under their own weight, leading once more to the search for God. Once we deeply establish the scientific reality of an Ultimate Being, and of the Universe functioning according to a perfect Grand Plan, the blind from our eyes is removed. We learn to build a temple or vessel within ourselves where Divine Love may reside, by emulating the everlasting laws of harmony, balance and proportion in thought and in action. Once this process has been fully accomplished, it is impossible for us to blame anyone for our own problems or feel any sense of negative emotions over others’ opinions and actions towards us. There is no need to try to distract and entertain ourselves with the material world, as we become aware that it is nothing but an illusion, fashioned by the limitations imposed by our sensory organs, which are not normally capable of detecting the unseen worlds of energy that surround us, and the advanced intelligent entities that populate them. We are never alone in the Divine Cosmos. * * * * * There is nothing new to the spiritual science of preparation, illumination and initiation into the mysteries contained within this book. For those who are actively engaged in studying the evidence, it is becoming more and more certain that the Earth was once host to an ancient, advanced civilization that had complete understanding of the physics and the timing behind the event that we are now experiencing in the Earth and Solar System. This civilization took great pains to preserve their legacy so that we could re-discover these everlasting truths. The most obvious footprints that have been left behind by this lost, ancient civilization are the many surviving structures around the world that are composed of multi-ton blocks of stone or “megaliths,” far too large and intricate in construction to be built by any known methods now available to humanity. In our 2000 book The Shift of the Ages, we go into detail about such monuments, including their distinct energetic functions and their worldwide interconnected nature, provable by straightforward mathematical analysis. Off the coast of the Japanese island of Yonaguni, a pyramid-like, obviously artificial megalithic structure has been found submerged under the sea in an area that could not have been above water for at least 12,000 years. And in 2001, Paulina Zelinsky and Paul Weinzweig of Advanced Digital Communications announced that they had discovered vast submerged city of pyramids, buildings, roads and other structures off the western tip of Cuba, about a half-mile under the sea, as seen from side-scan sonar readings. This story actually broke into the Western mainstream media, which shows how surprisingly close they are to admitting that such a civilization did indeed"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"exist. Though there has been ongoing interest in the search for ancient undersea ruins, Zelinsky’s team was the first to elicit cooperation with the Communist regime of Cuba so that such advanced measurements could be taken in their national waters. The research of Linda Moulton Howe and others has revealed that National Geographic has already signed a contract to have exclusive rights to release this new material to humanity, and that a comprehensive multimedia disclosure is being planned. More recent updates in November 2001 revealed that interconnecting circles of rock similar to Stonehenge have now been photographed at the site by a robotic undersea probe, along with a series of stone inscriptions including crosses, sketches of Mesoamerican-style pyramids, and an unusual written language. The team hopes to photograph and survey the area much more thoroughly as time proceeds. The original source of information for the Western world regarding this lost ancient civilization came from the works of Greek philosopher Plato, who first referred to it in the Timaeus as the island continent “Atlantis.” It is widely held that the technological sophistication of Atlantis actually superceded our own, including anti-gravity capability that was used both for devices capable of interstellar travel as well as the levitation of tremendous blocks to build the pyramids and sacred structures seen worldwide. Also available to the Atlanteans was a form of technology where extremely high amounts of energy to power all sorts of different devices could be drawn from the very essence of empty space itself – a non-physical energy source that the Greeks referred to as “aether,” which was their word for “shine.” The Greek word “pyramid” actually comes from the word roots “Pyre” and “Amid,” meaning “fire in the middle.” This suggests that a harnessing of energy is occurring within such structures. In addition to technology, the Atlanteans were much more aware of the spiritual, intuitive and symbolic side of life, something that modern civilization has become much more divorced from. Many different sources indicate that Plato had received the information regarding Atlantis secretly from the existing priesthoods of Egypt, and that he created a great controversy amongst their ranks by actually publicizing it. This one small data point, published in the philosophy texts of the day, could be seen as the first clue in unraveling a very substantial mystery. According to such sources, the Egyptian priesthood was one of several splinter groups entrusted with preserving what they referred to as “the sacred fire of antiquity,” a coded term for the overall cosmology, physics and spiritual knowledge of Atlantis, which was also referred to as “The Tradition” or “The Mysteries.” Rigorous oaths of secrecy were taken to uphold the secrets of such initiatory knowledge on pain of death. Offshoots of these societies are well known to still exist today through such organizations as Freemasonry, a group that was intimately connected to the foundation of the United States and still has widespread influence among the most elite power circles. Solid information regarding such “secret societies” and their initiated teachings has been publicly available throughout the 19th and 20th century. In 1928, 33rd-degree Freemason scholar Manly Palmer Hall published a book that does a remarkable job of assembling the puzzle pieces into one single, vast composite, and its name is “The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Quabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy, Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages.” This text is by far the most popular of its kind, and without such a book in existence, it would arguably be much more difficult to reconstruct an accurate picture of what exactly was known in the ancient world and how it was preserved throughout time. The general picture of the time of Atlantis that Hall and other sources paint is of a world quite different than we know it today. Atlantis was one of two main advanced civilizations that co-existed on the Earth at that time, the other being the Rama Empire, which was centered in India. [If the Pacific Ocean- based civilization of “Lemuria” had indeed existed, it appears to have been from an even earlier period and was long-gone by the time of Atlantis and Rama.] Documents from the Rama empire still exist today for the public to study, which the Hindus call the Vedas, and in these texts there are many references to highly advanced technology, including elaborate flying machines known as “Vimana” and nuclear weaponry. According to David Hatcher Childress in the book Vimana Aircraft of Ancient India and Atlantis, The India of 15,000 years ago is sometimes known as the Rama Empire, a land that was contemporary with Atlantis. A huge wealth of texts still extant in India testify to the extremely advanced civilization that is said by these texts to go back over 26,000 years. Terrible wars and subsequent earth changes destroyed these civilizations, leaving only isolated pockets of civilization. It is not surprising for those aware of such research that vast undersea city ruins have now been discovered off the coast of India near Gujarat, which could not have been above water for at least 9000 years. Some twelve thousand years ago, most of the Earth’s population was nowhere near at the level of sophistication possessed by the Atlanteans or the Ramas, and like the “clashes of civilizations” of our own era, these two giants ended up going into war with each other. Atlantis had just begun a program of indoctrinating lesser-developed cultures with their knowledge when their island continent was destroyed by a combination of warfare and geological cataclysms, which completely submerged their land circa 9600 BC. Just prior to this time, some who were aware of this impending cataclysm left the island and went into hiding amongst other lesser-advanced populations of humanity. Some of these indigenous groups were in North and South America while others were in Europe, Africa and Asia. As Hall writes in Secret Teachings , From the Atlanteans the world has received not only the heritage of arts and crafts, philosophies and sciences, ethics and religions, but also the heritage of hate, strife, and perversion. The Atlanteans instigated the first war; and it has been said that all subsequent wars were fought in a fruitless effort to justify the first one and right the wrong which it caused. Before Atlantis sank, its spiritually illumined Initiates, who realized that their land was doomed because it had departed from the Path of Light, withdrew from the ill-fated continent. Carrying with them the sacred and secret doctrine, these Atlanteans established themselves in Egypt, where they became its first \"divine\" rulers. Nearly all the great cosmologic myths forming the foundation of the various sacred books of the world are based upon the Atlantean Mystery rituals. In the Western Hemisphere, this “Atlantean” influence is arguably behind the Mayan Calendar and many other indigenous spiritual traditions of various Native American groups. In the Eastern Hemisphere, this same Atlantean /"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Raman influence links the Egyptians, Sumerians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Celtics, Druids, Tibetans and Greeks, as well as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. A variety of “secret societies” or “mystery schools” arose as well, including the following partial list that could easily be continued: Atlantean, Hindu / Vedic / Raman, Hermetic, Pyramidic, Zodiacal, Egyptian, Celtic / Druidic, Mithraic, Serapean, Odinic / Gothic, Eleusinian, Orphic, Bacchic, Dionysiac, Cabiric, Pythagorean, Essenic, Platonic, Solomonic, Quabbalistic, Hebraic, Gnostic, Christian, Scandinavian, Arthurian, Alchemical, the Knights Templar, the Order of the Assassins, the Order of the Quest, Rosicrucian, Baconian / Masonic (Freemasonry,) Builders of the Adytum (BOTA), Ordo Templi Orientalis (OTO), the JASON society, the Skull and Bones society, the Islamic mysteries, the Mayan sacred teachings and the vast Native American / Shaman heritage. It is important to remember that within each of the above names is an entire corpus of material to assimilate and digest, upon which a multiplicity of books could be written – knowledge which likely remains concealed to this day, at least in part. Secrecy was very much a part of the picture, as this next passage from Hall’s book points out: \"He who would fathom the depths of philosophic thought must familiarize himself with the teachings of those initiated priests designated as the first custodians of divine revelation. The Mysteries claimed to be the guardians of a transcendental knowledge so profound as to be incomprehensible save to the most exalted intellect and so potent as to be revealed with safety only to those in whom personal ambition was dead and who had consecrated their lives to the unselfish service of humanity. Both the dignity of these sacred institutions and the validity of their claim to possession of Universal Wisdom are attested by the most illustrious philosophers of antiquity, who were themselves initiated into the profundities of the secret doctrine and who bore witness to its efficacy. The question may legitimately be propounded: If these ancient mystical institutions were of such \"great pith and moment,\" why is so little information now available concerning them and the arcana they claimed to possess? The answer is simple enough: The Mysteries were secret societies, binding their initiates to inviolable secrecy, and avenging with death the betrayal of their sacred trusts. Although these schools were the true inspiration of the various doctrines promulgated by the ancient philosophers, the fountainhead of those doctrines was never revealed to the profane. Furthermore, in the lapse of time the teachings came so inextricably linked with the names of disseminators that the actual but recondite source - the Mysteries - came to be wholly ignored.\" In the next paragraph, Hall explains how much of this secret ancient knowledge was preserved through the use of symbolism. This enabled valuable information to be stored in plain sight, such as in physical structures, mythological accounts and sacred texts, and yet concealed in an encoded form, which would only be decipherable to those who had already grasped the knowledge of the ancient Mysteries to some degree: \"Symbolism is the language of the Mysteries; in it is the language not only of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"mysticism and philosophy but of all Nature, for every law and power active in universal procedure is manifested to the limited sense perceptions of man through the medium of symbol. Every form existing in the diversified sphere of being is symbolic of the divine activity by which it is produced. By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each other those thoughts which transcend the limitations of language. Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate and unworthy to perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a far more ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental knowledge. In a single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal, for to the wise the subject of the symbol is obvious, while to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable. He who seeks to unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity must search for that doctrine not upon the open pages of books which might fall into the hands of the unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed. Far-sighted were the initiates of antiquity. They realized that nations come and go, that empires fall, and that the golden ages of art, science, and idealism are succeeded by the dark ages of superstition. With the needs of posterity foremost in mind, the sages of old went to inconceivable extremes to make certain that their knowledge should be preserved. They engraved it upon the face of mountains and concealed it with the measurements of colossal images, each of which was a geometric marvel. Their knowledge of chemistry and mathematics they hid within mythologies which the ignorant would perpetuate, or in the spans and arches of their temples which time has not entirely obliterated. They wrote in characters that neither the vandalism of men nor the ruthlessness of the elements could completely efface. Today men gaze with awe and reverence upon the mighty Memnons (Pyramids) standing alone on the sands of Egypt, or upon the strange terraced pyramids of Palanque. Mute testimonies these are of the lost arts and sciences of antiquity; and concealed this wisdom must remain until this race has learned to read the universal language - SYMBOLISM. The book to which this is the introduction is dedicated to the proposition that concealed within the emblematic figures, allegories and rituals of the ancients is a secret doctrine concerning the inner mysteries of life; which doctrine has been preserved in toto among a small band of initiated minds since the beginning of the world. Departing, these illumined philosophers left their formulae that others, too, might attain to understanding. But, lest these secret processes fall into uncultured hands and be perverted, the Great Arcanum was always concealed in symbol or allegory; and those who can today discover its lost keys may open with them a treasure house of philosophic, scientific, and religious truths.\" So as we can see from the above passage, the sacred knowledge from Atlantis concerned a cosmology of the “inner mysteries of life,” a viewpoint of reality that was markedly different than that espoused by the “profane” masses who were not initiates into the ancient traditions. Hall does make the explicit point at the end of this passage that those who can discover the lost keys of ancient wisdom “may open with them a treasure house of philosophic, scientific and religious truths.” Within this book that you are now reading is an exhaustive reconstruction of the scientific knowledge of the Ancients, upgrading this information with the most modern cutting-edge discoveries in physics, and thus returning the “lost keys” to the hands of modern-day seekers. With these ancient keys we can indeed reveal an incredible"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"storehouse of spiritual wisdom that has thus far almost completely eluded the Western scientific establishment, at least overtly. WHAT DO WE HAVE IN THIS BOOK? What we have in this book is ultimately a cosmology – a new way of understanding the Universe of physical and nonphysical matter and how it functions. We will learn that conventional science has made a series of “wrong turns” in the last 100 years or so that have led to a model that is highly flawed and incomplete at best. Once we repair the damage that was done, we will have a clear and understandable new view of the Cosmos that explains how anti-gravity and limitless, “free” energy technologies are possible. Presenting these concepts in a simple and understandable manner helps to insure that such breakthrough technologies will no longer be suppressed by the existing power structures, since they can now be easily explained to others. We have been taught to believe that such technologies are foolish and impossible due to the “laws” of physics, but once we step past that point, we will realize how incredibly our civilization will be transformed once we again begin creating them. Additionally, in this book we will discover many remarkable new energetic properties of the solar system, the galaxy and the universe that few could have previously anticipated. We will learn that “empty space is not empty,” but rather is filled with an energy source that is indeed the true source of life and consciousness as we know it. We will see that the quality of our emotions and thoughts are not at all isolated, but are constantly being affected by outside cosmic forces that can take our moods on a roller-coaster ride, producing inspiration at times and desperation at others. And thus, we are all connected to the Cosmos in this very fundamental way. This functional knowledge goes way beyond the popular concepts of astrology to include many other unforeseen elements, such as precisely repeating cycles of historical events over long periods of time and advanced predictions of how the financial markets will move. When we realize that our thoughts and feelings are not simply our own, but are part of a synchronized web of life, we can never again see ourselves as being separate from others. Humanity as a whole will be seen as a form of organism that surrounds the surface of the Earth, interacting with the planets, asteroids, comets, the Sun and the galaxy itself in a reciprocal relationship. Strange questions will arise as to where our free will begins and where it ends, since there can be forces of will much vaster than our own that are moving us along a previously designed curriculum that we have all agreed upon in a higher sense – a curriculum that has now reached a major turning point. All the major mysteries associated with the prophecies surrounding this “Ascension” event are eliminated in this new model. Many who have read our books in the past have come away being surprised at how little they knew, or at how much there was to know that they had never even conceived of. One major area of importance is in forming a working “multidimensional” model of the Universe. Our scientists are now beginning to agree that there must be several different planes of existence or “dimensions” in the Universe, and in this new cosmology, that will also become a very simple concept to grasp. We will scientifically demonstrate a unified spiritual and scientific concept of how the Universe is all based on a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"“master plan” that incorporates simple principles of vibration such as light, sound and geometry. We will also see that just like the principle of a fractal or a hologram, within the infinity of the Many is always the signature of the All. THE AUTHOR AND THE WORK Obviously, these are advanced concepts, and just as the Ancients knew, scientific exploration must be combined with mystical consciousness in order to fully develop and understand the concepts before they can be accurately presented to others. To that end, since age five or earlier, the author has had extensive experience with mystical states of consciousness such as dreams, deep meditative trances and out of body or “astral” traveling. Since 1992, he has recorded almost every dream from every morning of his life in writing, and has actively tried to follow its guidance, rendered in the ancient language of symbolism and metaphor. Since 1994, he has been very focused on maintaining a rigidly pure vegetarian / vegan diet and exercise program in order to refine and expand his consciousness, and since 1996 he has experienced telepathic contact with forms of higher intelligence. The combined total of written dreams and “psychic readings” now amounts to well over 5000 pages. Much of this book could not have been put together without actually “going out there and doing it yourself,” since there are innumerable mistakes that can be made with straightforward trial-and-error reasoning that can lead to years of false grasping, only to be shattered by some unforeseen new piece of data later on. (Most Western scientists already see this happening to a number of their cherished models but are usually unwilling to concede to the newer truths, thus cleverly avoiding discussing the numerous problems. Any scientific model that throws away that which it does not understand, such as the phenomenon of psychic ability, is flawed.) In our research method, to solve a particularly difficult problem, of which there have literally been hundreds, one would begin with the scientific observations at hand, and then travel into higher realms of being through dreams and trance states to see how those observations are actually working. One example of this would be in the study of gravity – instead of thinking of it as a source that “sucks down” from the center of the Earth, it can also be modeled as a source of outside energy that is streaming into the Earth from all directions. So, in the next phase you would go out and see if that is how the gravitational flow actually behaves. Once the solutions are obtained from that place of knowing, new doorways often emerge that lead to amazing, unforeseen breakthroughs. A simple study in gravity turns out to be a lesson in how the Earth is actually “breathing” the energy of life from around itself – literally inhaling “new” energy, transforming it into the matter of its atoms and molecules and then exhaling it, releasing it back out into space. This can then also open the door to solving the puzzles of quantum physics, with an understanding of how every atom and molecule is drawing off of this same energy supply in the same way. Such knowledge has emerged from a directly spiritual source for people such as John Keely, Edward Leedskalnin, Dr. Walter Russell and Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev, each of which led to impressive accomplishments that most would consider to be impossible. One of the author’s most fascinating observations early along came when he"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"tried to fly away from the Earth and go into “outer space” while in an out-of- body experience. From this, he eventually realized that the Earth had an onion-like structure of spherical “planes” surrounding itself. (This is considered common knowledge to initiates of the Mysteries, and has been prominently confirmed by the out-of-body research conducted by Robert Monroe.) After a certain distance of traveling upwards from the Earth in an out-of-body state, Wilcock would pop through a “layer” of energy and a new surface would appear beneath him. In the first few cases the new layers also appeared to be inhabited by common human civilization in some form, and were apparently realms of the afterlife. The higher he went, the less that these areas looked like conventional Earth civilization. He soon arrived in a highly picturesque and sacred place of mostly undisturbed green forest and meadows, complete with giant standing stones in geometric arrangements and charged with a sense of love and intelligence far superior to the current state of humanity. The people of this mystical place were literally glowing with radiant energy and wore headbands, robes and sandals on their feet, and everyone smiled happily and greeted each other – including this new traveler – as they passed. Punching through an even higher level, he suddenly found himself literally standing inside of what appeared to be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The room was gigantic and quiet as a library, with 30-foot high ceilings and glistening black marble floors and walls that had a tinge of blueness that seemed to give off light. A sphere was floating over a cubical platform in the center of the room, probably more of a symbol than anything else, and lining the rectangularly-spaced walls were giant open cubicles. Each cubicle was about six feet wide, with a human-appearing uniformed person in a chair seated before a flat, desk-like surface and a gigantic hi-resolution screen that was easily five feet high. The screens could bring up images of planetary systems, routes of travel, navigation systems, energetic diagrams, different lifeforms in all levels of anatomy, et cetera in brilliant, full color, three- dimensional detail. On several different occasions, your author was seated at one of the cubicles and instructed on how to use a new form of control device for manipulating the images on the screen. It simply consisted of a three-inch wide circular hole that had bright, smooth light coming up from itself to a visible height of perhaps four inches. By holding the four fingers together over this light, palm down, and tilting and moving the hand in a number of different patterns, a variety of tasks could be performed on-screen. Spreading the fingers apart was the one thing that the machine couldn’t handle, and certain video game- type activities were used to train the student not to make that mistake once it really mattered, such as in navigation. The pronoun “we” is used in many cases in this book, since the author is not only in contact with the bright genius of many exceptional human beings through their work and communications, but has personally experienced direct meetings with beings of higher intelligence in these mystical states as well. Obviously in earlier stages this was thought to simply be imagination, but through such things as telekinesis – a small but definite movement of objects in the physical – it became more and more obvious that the contacts were indeed real. This discovery took months and months to adjust to, but it was extremely fascinating the entire time. Though we are not “channeling” when writing the words of this book, the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"author has trained himself to be able to communicate consciously with these entities and bring forth their messages, which often emerge in a cryptic form far different than human speech, especially in the deeper trance states. One good “truth test” for such communications is whether they can produce information that the individual does not or could not consciously know beforehand. And indeed, since 1996 we have documented extensive examples of very clear, unambiguous prophecies of future events, and this source has been of inestimable value in leading the author and his fellow readers towards a more balanced, self-integrated and spiritually aware lifestyle. Most people in the scientific community discount mystical consciousness and psychic ability for the penultimate reason that they have rarely experienced it themselves. If we survey the original wisdom of the initiates in the Atlantean / Raman cultures through their splinter groups, we find a universal emphasis placed upon meditation. As we shall see, the conscious mind is not and cannot simply be a function of the brain – certain hydrocephalics have mostly water in their brain case and yet are able to think and reason and remember as ordinary people. And yet, for most people the vagaries of the day, with guilt over the past and fear over the future, rule their minds. These obsessive, looping thoughts rob the person of ever being able to focus on the present, on how they feel right in that moment and what is happening in their mind when they stop the chattering. Overcoming this mental chatter is the main goal of all Oriental philosophy. Many people have had some level of psychic success by simply clearing out the mind through meditation, focusing on a specific question and then documenting whatever thoughts came up, whether spoken, visual or otherwise. Mystical adepts such as the Tibetans, another group with Atlantean / Raman inheritances, took this to such an extreme that they would literally “channel” entire sacred scriptures that they had never before seen, and would later grade themselves on whether their product was 100% identical to the original or not by traveling to other areas where the ancient scriptures were stored and comparing the documents. The finest psychic achievements of modern Western initiates seem to pale in comparison to such feats. The knowledge of the Mysteries is also of inestimable value in dealing with others. The Ancients used their knowledge of the musical principles of vibration, harmony and balance as tools to learn how to live better lives for themselves, and how to create “ideal” societies where there is fairness, peace and equality. Since the Universe is truly an image of perfection, such beauty can be aspired to in the layout and construction of buildings, cities, governments and social institutions, as was often written in the works of Plato. When a society again becomes familiar with the timeless principles of the Universe as a whole, it will invariably take on a richness and vibrancy that was never before conceived of, which the Ancients referred to as a “Golden Age.” There can be no thought of crime or of hurting others once the pain of separation is eliminated in the knowledge of our collective Oneness. Another point for the critics who say that this information has “no spiritual value” is this. If your goal is to move towards a true knowing of the “I” that is within you that created the Universe, then there is no substitute for the knowledge of exactly what “You” originally created and how it functions and behaves.

Were we to learn that the center of the Earth is a source of brilliant plasma energy like what we see on the Sun, and that it is continually absorbing energy, creating new matter and gradually expanding the earth in its physical size, then that knowledge can become a part of us that stays with us every time we take a walk or sit and meditate. Our consciousness automatically expands into higher levels of inspiration and understanding as we re-learn these timeless principles for the first time in our physical lives, and there is a very definite ecstasy that this produces, which many people are now hungrily scouring the Internet and the bookstores to try to experience. This is all part of the illumination process, the gathering of information in preparation for an intensely personal experience of initiation that can never come from any outside source. The author of this book had to discover its elements piecemeal over the course of many years, and gradually, laboriously work over these concepts in his mind again and again to find the most suitable way to present them to the public. Many of these findings were quite exhilarating the first time they were encountered, and became an intimate part of everyday life; a lens through which all other experiences in life, even the most mundane, could be perceived. It is now the joy of the reader to find all of these gathered pieces synthesized together into one grand symposium, so that tireless years of research do not need to be redone and an accurate composite of “The Big Picture” can be viewed."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 01: THE BREAKTHROUGHS OF DR. N.A. KOZYREV CHAPTER 01: THE BREAKTHROUGHS OF DR. N.A. KOZYREV Dramatic scientific evidence that all of physical matter is formed by an “aether” of invisible, conscious energy has existed since at least the 1950s. Renowned Russian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev (1908-1983, pronounced Ko-zir-ev,) proved beyond any doubt that such an energy source had to exist, and as a result he became one of the most controversial figures in the history of the Russian scientific community. The awesome implications of his work, and of all those who followed him, were almost entirely concealed by the former Soviet Union, but with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the advent of the Internet we are finally gaining access to “Russia’s Best-Kept Secret.” Two generations of remarkable research by thousands of Ph.D. level specialists have emerged from Kozyrev’s seed findings, which completely change our understanding of the Universe. With our prominent mention of him in this book, we hope to permanently establish his historical importance and impact to our colleagues and readers. Figure 1.1 – Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev 1.1 THE AETHER The word “aether” means “shine” in Greek, and the fundamental reality of such an unseen, fluidlike source of universal energy has long been a hallmark of the world’s secret mystery schools. The works of Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Plato discussed it at great length, as did the Vedic scriptures of ancient India, referring to it by several names such as “prana” and “Akasha.” In the Orient, it is often known as “chi” or “ki,” and special emphasis is placed on its interactions with the human body, such as in the science of acupuncture. Masters and adepts who inherited the secret traditions could eventually learn to manipulate this energy to create miraculous results, such as levitation, teleportation, manifestation, instant healing, telepathy and the like. Such results have been repeatedly documented in the 20th century and studied in the laboratory, as we wrote in Convergence III. The aether’s existence was widely accepted without question in scientific circles until the early 20th century, when the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 was co-opted to “prove” that no such hidden energy source existed. However, more recent breakthroughs involving “dark matter,” “dark energy”, “virtual particles”, “vaccum flux” and “zero-point energy,” to name a few, have brought reluctant Western scientists to acknowledge that there must indeed be an unseen energy medium throughout the Universe. As long as you use a benign term like the “quantum medium” and not the forbidden word"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"‘aether,’ you can talk about it in the mainstream press without much fear of ridicule. The mainstream scientific establishment is very heavily polarized against anyone who gets too close to an ‘aether’ theory, as they “know” that such a theory must be false and will therefore fight vigorously against it. However, such suppression only increases the desire and commitment that many others have put into solving the puzzle. One early example of proof for the existence of the aether comes from Dr. Hal Puthoff, a respected scientist from Cambridge University. Puthoff frequently mentions experiments from the early 20th century that were designed to see if there was any energy in “empty space,” conducted before quantum mechanics theory ever existed. In order to test this idea in the laboratory, it was necessary to create an area that was completely free of air (a vacuum,) and lead-shielded from all known electromagnetic radiation fields by using what is known as a Faraday cage. This airless vacuum space was then cooled down to absolute zero or -273° C,the temperature where all matter should stop vibrating and thus produce no heat. These experiments proved that instead of an absence of energy in the vacuum, there was a tremendous amount of it, from a completely non- electromagnetic source! Dr. Puthoff has often called this a \"seething cauldron\" of energy in very high magnitudes. Since this energy could still be found at absolute zero, this force was dubbed \"zero point energy\" or ZPE, whereas the Russian scientists usually call it the “physical vacuum” or PV. Recently, established mainstream physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman have calculated that: The amount of zero-point energy in the space volume of a single light bulb is powerful enough to bring all the world's oceans to the boiling point! Clearly, we are not dealing with some weak, unseen force, but rather a source of almost impossibly grand power, which would have more than enough strength to sustain the existence of all of physical matter. In the new view of science that is emerging from aether theory, all four of the basic force fields, whether gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear or strong nuclear force, are all simply different forms of the aether/ZPE. To get another idea of how much “free” energy really exists all around us, Professor M.T. Daniels found that the density of the gravitational energy near the surface of the earth is equal to 5.74 x 10^10 (t/m^3). [Let us not forget that gravity would simply be another form of aether in this new model.] Prof. Daniels’ finding means that drawing a sizable 100 kilowatts of this “free energy” power from the gravitational field dips into an extremely tiny 0.001% of the natural energy that is being produced in that area. (New Energy News, June 1994, p.4) Research conducted by Nikola Tesla led to his statement in 1891 that the aether “behaves as a fluid to solid bodies, and as a solid to light and heat,” and that under “sufficiently high voltage and frequency,” it could be accessed – which was his hint that free energy and anti-gravity technologies were possible. Let us pay special attention, again, to Tesla’s statement that the aether has a fluidlike effect when we are dealing with solid objects, as this ties in directly with the work of Dr. N.A. Kozyrev. 1.2 ANALOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING KOZYREV’S FINDINGS"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"In Chapters 3 and 4, we will explode the myths of quantum physics and show that the oft-cited “particle” model of the atom is seriously flawed. Just as Einstein’s theory of relativity suggested, all of physical matter is ultimately made of pure energy, and there are no “hard particles” to be found in the quantum realm. More and more, the scientific community is being forced to accept that atoms and molecules are akin to candle flames, where the energy that they release (such as the heat and light of the flame) must be balanced by energy that they absorb (such as the wax of the candle and the oxygen in the air.) This “candle analogy” is a hallmark of Dr. Hal Puthoff’s model, which he uses to explain why the hypothetical electron does not radiate away all of its energy and crash into the nucleus. This seemingly “perpetual motion” within the atom is simply explained away as “the magic of quantum mechanics” in the mainstream view. In order to truly be able to get a grasp on Kozyrev’s work and related findings, certain new analogies for physical matter are required. Rigorously, Kozyrev’s work forces us to visualize all physical objects of matter in the Universe as if they were sponges that are submerged in water. In all of these analogies, we should consider the sponges as having remained in water for a long enough period of time that they are completely saturated. Bearing this in mind, there are two things we can do with such sponges underwater: we can decrease the volume of water that they contain or increase it, by very simple mechanical procedures. 1 Decrease: If a submerged, saturated sponge is squeezed, cooled or rotated, then some of the water inside of it will be released into its surroundings, decreasing its mass. Once the sponge is no longer disturbed, the pressure on the millions of tiny pores is relieved, causing it to again absorb water and expand back to its normal resting mass. 2 Increase: We can also pump more water pressure into the sponge in its rest state, such as by heating (vibrating) it, thus causing some of the pores to expand with more water than they can comfortably hold. In this case, once we relieve the added pressure, the sponge will naturally release its excess water and shrink back down to its normal resting mass. Though it would seem impossible to most people, Kozyrev showed that by shaking, spinning, heating, cooling, vibrating or breaking physical objects, their weight can be increased or decreased by subtle but definite amounts. And this is but one aspect of his amazing work. 1.3 BACKGROUND OF DR. N.A. KOZYREV Since the Western world is largely uneducated about Kozyrev, some biographical and research information is in order. This will establish that he was far from a “crank” or “crackpot” scientist, but was in fact considered as one of the pre-eminent Russian thinkers of the 20th century. Kozyrev’s first scientific paper was published at the tender age of seventeen, and other scientists were amazed by the depth and clarity of his logic. His main work was in astrophysics, where he studied the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars, the phenomenon of solar eclipses and radiation equilibrium. By age twenty he had already graduated from the University of Leningrad with a degree in physics and mathematics, and by age twenty-eight Dr. Kozyrev was widely known as a distinguished astronomer who had taught at several colleges."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Kozyrev’s abundant life took a most unfortunate and difficult turn in 1936, when he was arrested under the repressive laws of Josef Stalin, and in 1937 he began eleven torturous years enduring all the known horrors of a concentration camp. Although he did not have access to scientific equipment during this time, he was given the most brutal of initiation experiences into hidden knowledge. To an already enlightened mind, such bone-jarring hardship can effectively burn off all desire for gratification from the material world, removing the resistance to higher consciousness so that a state of illumination is produced where universal truth can be immediately recognized and assimilated. From this state, he mused deeply upon the mysteries of the Universe, paying attention to all the patterns that existed in life, wherein so many different organisms show signs of asymmetry and / or spiraling growth. He knew that in the mid-1800s, Louis Pasteur discovered that the building block of life known as “protoplasm” is inherently not symmetrical, and that colonies of microbes grow in a spiral structure. These expanding proportions also underlie the structure of plants, insects, animals and people, as so many inheritors of the ancient tradition of the Atlantean Mysteries have written, when discussing “sacred geometry” such as the spiraling form known as Fibonacci, Golden Mean and / or “phi” spiral. Figure 1.2 – The “Phi” Spiral in the nautilus shell (L) and with geometrically inscribed triangles (R). From his illuminated observations in the prison camp, Kozyrev considered that all lifeforms might be drawing off of an unseen, spiraling source of energy, in addition to their normal properties of gaining energy through eating, drinking, breathing and photosynthesis. Later in this book we will see how comprehensive the data is on this point. Kozyrev theorized that things such as the direction of a shell’s spiraling growth and which side of the human body will contain the heart are determined by the direction of this flow. Should there be an area somewhere in space-time where the energy flow was spiraling in the opposite direction, then he would expect shells to grow in the opposite direction and the heart to be in the opposite side of the body cavity. This concept of a spiraling energy in biology may seem unrealistic, but it has long been known in the mystery schools. The next image shows us how all the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ratios of “phi” emerge naturally in the structure of the human arm, and this is but one example of a process that repeats all throughout the bodies of human beings as well as all other plants, animals and insects. Those few who acknowledge these relationships at all will typically state that they emerge simply because “phi” represents the natural, most efficient pattern in which growth can occur. Kozyrev suggested that life couldn’t form any other way, because it is actively drawing off of this spiraling energy to sustain itself, and must therefore follow its proportions every step of the way. In this sense we can think of the skeletal system as an “antenna” for this energy. Figure 1.3 – The “Phi” proportions in the human arm. When Kozyrev was finally rehabilitated from the prison camp in 1948 and could return to his field of expertise, he made many advance predictions about the Moon, Venus and Mars, which were validated by Soviet space probes more than a decade later. This then earned him the distinction of being a major pioneer in the Soviet space race. Then, in 1958, Dr. Kozyrev again aroused worldwide controversy by proclaiming that the Moon exhibited volcanic activity in the Alphonsus crater. Should this notion have been true, which most astronomers and scientists flatly refused to believe, then it meant that the Moon possessed huge natural resources and sources of power that would make it an excellent stop-over point to propel humanity into the stars. U.S. Nobel Prize winner Dr. Harold Urey was among the narrow group who believed that Dr. Kozyrev’s theory of volcanic activity on the moon was correct, and he urged NASA to conduct an investigation. As a direct result, NASA launched the enormous “Moon Blink” project, which later confirmed Dr. Kozyrev’s assertions by finding significant gas emissions on the moon. However, not all of Kozyrev’s work was quite so readily assimilated into the mainstream world of NASA. In the winter of 1951-1952, just three years after escaping the brutal initiation of the prison camp, Dr. Kozyrev began his foray into the world of exotic physics, with the first of what became an exhaustive series of 33 years’ worth of very intriguing and controversial experiments. His obvious desire in pursuing such research was to find validation for the spiritual truths that he had already experienced through the mystical process of preparation, illumination and initiation (as referred to in Rudolf Steiner’s classic Knowledge of Higher Worlds and Its Attainment) under the most extremely challenging of circumstances. When he began publishing the results of these breakthrough studies, many Russian scientists and a scarce few in the West were prepared to listen, based on his past successes."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"As we said, the spiraling energy patterns in nature unveiled themselves to the initiated eyes of Dr. Kozyrev while in the concentration camp. His “direct knowledge” informed him that this spiraling energy was in fact the true nature and manifestation of “time.” Obviously, he felt that “time” as we now know it is much more than just a simple function for counting duration. Kozyrev urges us to try to think of a cause for time, something tangible and identifiable in the Universe that we can associate with time. After pondering this for a while, we see that time is ultimately nothing but pure spiraling movement. We know that we are tracing a complex spiraling pattern through space thanks to the orbital patterns of the Earth and solar system. And now, the study of “temporology,” or the science of time, is under continual, active investigation by Moscow State University and the Russian Humanitarian Foundation, inspired by Dr. Kozyrev’s pioneering work. On their website, they state that: In our understanding, the “nature” of time is the mechanism [that brings about] appearing changes and occurring newness in the World. To understand the “nature” of time is to point to... a process, a phenomenon, a “carrier” in the material world whose properties could be identified or corresponded with those of time. This may seem strange at first glance, since a tree falling in your yard could be seen as a product of a strong wind, not the “flow of time.” However, you must then ask yourself what caused the wind to blow? Ultimately, the motion of the Earth on its axis is most responsible. Hence, all changes are caused by some form of movement, and without movement there can be no time. Several of the scholars whose papers are published through the Russian Institute of Temporology agree that if Kozyrev had changed his terminology and use of the word “time” to more common scientific terms such as “the physical vacuum” or “the aether,” then many more people would have been able to understand his work sooner in the ensuing years. It is not necessary at this point for the reader to fully grasp the philosophy of spiraling energy as a manifestation of time, as this will become far clearer as we proceed. One of very few media breaks that Kozyrev ever received in the West regarding his concepts was a chapter in Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder’s groundbreaking 1970 book, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, which has gained worldwide acclaim and is still being reprinted to this day with the shortened title Psychic Discoveries. Most of the above background biographical information on Kozyrev’s early career experience has come from this source. In Chapter 13, entitled “Time – A New Frontier of the Mind,” the authors explain that even in his sixties, Kozyrev was tanned and athletic looking and gave off “an impression of great calm, an almost spiritual quality.” They also state that: In reputation and in work achieved, he is the most important scientist we met. He is attempting to elucidate a new world view, a new cosmogony. Under Kozyrev’s new conception, psychic happenings would fall into place. They would no longer be, as they are in the current view of science, something outside the system, something that must be denied to protect the system. The connection of psychic phenomena to physics is well known and frequently discussed in the Russian literature that is now becoming increasingly available, and Kozyrev’s work undoubtedly paved the way for it. One of the few Western researchers to notice Dr. Kozyrev’s work was Dr. Albert Wilson of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the Douglas Research Laboratories in California, who said, I feel that something very much like what Kozyrev has hypothesized will be established in physical theory within the next decade or two. Its implications will be revolutionary. It could take a generation of work before the leap he has taken can be incorporated into the body of scientific knowledge. Dr. Wilson’s timing was about one decade too short, as now at the dawn of the 21st century we can finally put all the pieces together. In order to keep our terms consistent, we will use the common scientific terms “torsion fields” and / or “torsion waves” to describe the spiraling flow of “time energy” that Kozyrev discovered. [The word “torsion” essentially means “spinning” or “twisting.”] Many Western scientists who have explored these topics, most notably Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, call them “scalar waves”, but we feel that “torsion waves” is ultimately an easier term to use, since it continually reminds us of their spiraling nature. The reader should be aware that in all cases, what we are dealing with is simply an impulse of momentum that travels through the medium of the aether / ZPE / physical vacuum, and does not possess electromagnetic qualities. Before Kozyrev ever began conducting his experiments, a good, solid theoretical foundation was already in place to begin explaining his results. We will begin with a preliminary discussion of Einstein’s theory of relativity, followed by Dr. Eli Cartan’s additions to the model, which first established the existence of torsion fields in theory. 1.4 EINSTEIN’S GEOMETRIC MODEL OF GRAVITY On May 29, 1919, Albert Einstein supposedly proved “...that we live in a curved four-dimensional space-time” where space and time are somehow fused together into a “fabric.” He believed that an object such as the Earth spinning in space “...would drag space and time along with it...”, and that this space-time fabric curves inward around a planetary body. Thus, he said, Gravity is no longer a mysterious force acting at a distance, but [rather is] the result of an object trying to travel in a straight line through space [that is] curved by the presence of material bodies. Space that is curved? “Wait...isn’t space supposed to be empty?” you ask. How can you curve something that is empty? As we can see, the significant problem in visualizing Einstein’s gravity model is with the word “curve”, as this is something that a flat, elastic sheet would do. Indeed, most attempts to visualize Einstein’s results picture planets as if they were weights that were depressing an imaginary flat rubber sheet that is stretched out in space as the “fabric” of space-time. An object such as a comet or asteroid simply follows the geometry of the sheet as it moves towards the Earth. The problem with this model is that any curvature of space-time would need to be moving in towards a spherical object from all directions, not just a flat plane. And furthermore, one still requires a force of gravity to pull a weight down into a flat rubber sheet. In a weightless space, the ball and the sheet would simply float around together. In reality, the word “flowing” is far more precise than “curving,” since in Convergence III we have demonstrated that gravity is actually a form of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"aetheric energy that is constantly flowing into an object.The equations for gravity do not specify which direction it must flow in, simply that it exists as a force that is responsible for objects not flying away from the Earth’s surface. Such ideas can be traced to John Keely, Dr. Walter Russell and more recently Walter Wright with his well-established “Push Gravity” theory. Once we establish that all force fields such as gravity and electromagnetism are simply different forms of aether/ZPE in motion, then we have an active source for gravity and a straightforward reason for why it would exist. We see that every molecule in the entire body of a planet must be sustained by an ongoing in-flow of aetheric energy. The same energy that is creating the Earth is also creating and flowing into us. We are then caught up in the gigantic current of the river of energy that streams into the Earth, much as mosquitoes get stuck to a screen window while the air blows right through the screen. Our bodies cannot travel through solid matter, but the current of aetheric energy certainly can – and this is one of the many things that Keely, Tesla, Kozyrev and others demonstrated. A star or planet must continually draw energy from its environment in order to “stay alive.” Kozyrev had made very similar conclusions about our Sun back in the 1950s, concluding that stars acted as “machines that convert the flow of time into heat and light.” Almost all Western scientists believe that Einstein’s general and special relativity theories eliminate the need for an aether – and indeed, Einstein advocated the rejection of an aether in 1910, which is where mainstream science still believes his thoughts ended on the issue. However, in 1920, Einstein actually stated that “the hypothesis of the existence of the ether does not contradict the special theory of relativity.” And in 1924, he wrote, ...in theoretical physics, we cannot get along without the ether, i.e., a continuum assigned physical properties, because the general theory of relativity... excludes direct long-range action; and each theory of short-range action assumes the presence of continuous fields and, consequently, the existence of the ‘ether.’ [emphasis added] 1.5 TORSION PHYSICS In 1913, Dr. Eli Cartan was the first to clearly demonstrate that the “fabric” (flow) of space and time in Einstein’s general theory of relativity not only “curved”, but it also possessed a spinning or spiraling movement within itself known as “torsion.” This area of physics is typically referred to as Einstein- Cartan Theory, or ECT. Cartan’s theory wasn’t taken too seriously at the time, as it came out before the days of quantum physics, when elementary “particles” such as electrons were believed to rotate or “spin” as they orbited the nucleus. Most people are unaware that it is now generally accepted that the space surrounding the Earth and perhaps the entire Galaxy has “right- handed spin,” meaning that energy will be influenced to spin clockwise as it travels through the physical vacuum. In 1996, Russian Drs. Akimov and Shipov wrote that: To date, world periodicals reference to torsion fields amount to the order of 10,000 articles, belonging to about a hundred authors. Over one half of those theorists work in Russia alone. As we shall easily see, Dr. Kozyrev’s work was the main influence for the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"more than 5,000 Russian papers on this subject as of 1996. In classical physics models, torsion fields were never considered to be a universal force on the level of gravity or electromagnetic energy, largely because they only existed theoretically. Cartan’s original 1913 theory speculated that torsion fields would be some 30 orders of magnitude weaker than gravitation, and gravity is already known to be 40 orders of magnitude weaker than electromagnetic energy! With such a miniscule level of influence, so said the theories, the naturally-spinning “torsion fields” were basically an irrelevant footnote that would not make any noticeable contributions to the phenomena that we can observe in the universe. For those scientists who had maintained an open mind, the works of Trautman, Kopczyynski, F. Hehl, T. Kibble, D. Sciama and others in the early 1970’s triggered a wave of interest in torsion fields. Hard scientific facts exploded Cartan’s 60-year-old theory-based myth that such fields were weak, tiny and unable to move through space. The myth of the Einstein-Cartan theory was that the spiraling torsion fields could not move, (i.e. they would remain static,) and could only exist within a space far smaller than the atom. Sciama et al. demonstrated that these basic torsion fields expected in ECT did exist, and they were referred to as “static torsion fields.” The difference was that “dynamic torsion fields” were demonstrated as well, with properties far more remarkable than Einstein and Cartan had assumed. According to Sciama et al., static torsion fields are created from spinning sources that do not radiate any energy. However, once you have a spinning source that releases energy in any form, such as the Sun or the center of the Galaxy, and / or a spinning source that has more than one form of movement occurring at the same time, such as a planet that is rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun at the same time, then dynamic torsion is automatically produced.This phenomenon allows torsion waves to propagate through spaceinstead of simply staying in a single “static” spot. Thus, torsion fields, like gravity or electromagnetism, are capable of moving from one place to another in the Universe. Furthermore, as we shall discover in later chapters, Kozyrev proved decades ago that these fields travel at “superluminal” speeds, meaning that they far exceed the speed of light. If you can have an impulse that moves directly through the “fabric of space-time”, travels at super-luminal velocities and is separate from gravity or electromagnetism, you have a significant breakthrough in physics – one that demands that a “physical vacuum”, “zero-point energy” or “aether” must really exist. 1.6 MASTER LIST OF PHENOMENA THAT CREATE KOZYREV’S EFFECTS Kozyrev’s experiments began in the 1950s and were conducted since the 1970s with the ongoing assistance of Dr. V.V. Nasonov, who helped to standardize the laboratory methods and the statistical analysis of the results. It is important to remember that these experiments were conducted under the strictest conditions, repeated in hundreds or in many cases thousands of trials, and were written about in extensive mathematical detail. They have been rigorously peer-reviewed, and Lavrentyev and others have replicated the results independently. (We have omitted the mathematical / analytical analyses of Kozyrev’s results in this book to enhance its readability.) Certain specially-made detectors using rotation and vibration were designed that would react in the presence of torsion fields, which Kozyrev called the “flow of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"time.” If we go back to our earlier analogy, we said that matter behaved somewhat like a sponge in water. If we do something to disturb the structure of the sponge, such as to squeeze it, spin it or vibrate it, then it will release some of its water back into its environment. Over the years, all of the following processes were discovered to create a “time flow” of torsion waves in the laboratory, due to their disruption of matter in some form: • the deforming of a physical object • the encounter of an air jet with an obstacle • the operation of an hourglass filled with sand • the absorption of light • friction • burning • the actions of an observer, such as a movement of the head • the heating or cooling of an object • phase transitions in substances (frozen to liquid, liquid to vapor, etc.) • dissolving and mixing substances • the fading death of plants • non-light radiation from astronomical objects • sudden changes in human consciousness Other than the perplexing final item related to consciousness, we can readily see how each process is disturbing matter in some way, thus causing it to absorb or release minute amounts of its aetheric “water,” which fits perfectly with our sponge analogy. Even more importantly, the fact that strong emotional energy could also cause a measurable at-a-distance reaction has been repeatedly documented, not just by Dr. Kozyrev but many others, and this is where our concepts of psychic phenomena and consciousness come into the picture. Such concepts became even bigger news after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, when Dean Radin and his team at the Institute of Noetic Sciences were able to measure a tremendous change in the behavior of computerized random-number generators surrounding the time immediately before and after the attack:"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Figure 1.4 – Data from Radin / INS measuring a change in mass consciousness on Sept. 11, 2001 The graph shows that somehow, a change in the mass consciousness of humanity affected the behavior of electromagnetic energy in computer circuits around the world, especially those computers nearest to North America. Later we shall see that this is just the beginning of a whole new world of “consciousness science.” We will suggest that torsion waves and consciousness are essentially identical manifestations of intelligent energy. Returning to the more ‘comfortable’ arena of physical matter, Kozyrev’s work showed that torsion fields can be absorbed, shielded or sometimes reflected. For example, sugar can absorb, polyethylene film and aluminum can shield, and other forms of aluminum or mirrors can reflect. Kozyrev found that in the presence of this energy flow, objects that are rigid and inelastic will show weight changes, whereas flexible, elastic objects will show changes in their elasticity and / or viscosity. Kozyrev also showed that the weight of a spinning top will change if it is vibrated, heated or cooled or if it has an electric current passed through it. As we can see, all of the above behaviors fit in quite nicely with our analogy of the “sponge” of matter absorbing or releasing small amounts of energetic “water”. 1.7 BUILDING A MECHANICAL DETECTOR FOR THE “TIME FLOW” Obviously, the biggest unanswered challenge at this point would be how such energy could be mechanically detected. After all, it has completely eluded the mainstream for well over a century. Here, it is important to remember that though the forces of torsion waves on matter are relatively small, they do exert a steady push. Research of Shipov, Terletskiy and other Russian theorists have directly associated the energy of torsion fields with the energy of gravity, thus leading to the term “gravispin energy” and the science of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"“gravispinorics.” In these new theories, gravity and spin are coupled in the same basic manner as electrostatics and magnetism join to form the electromagnetic wave. Though torsion waves can travel in any direction, they are most typically absorbed into the downward flow of the gravitational field. So, the strongest effects of the pressure of torsion waves would be a slight spiraling movement that is joined with gravity. Since it is a very subtle pressure, we do not typically notice any such movement in ourselves or in falling objects. Many of Kozyrev’s mechanical detectors of torsion waves involved objects in motion, such as a rotating gyroscope or an asymmetrical swinging pendulum. A simple analogy helps us to begin to understand how such objects in motion were able to capture this gentle pressure. If you have a ship at sea and do not align your sails with the direction of the wind’s flow, then your ship will not move. Your sails must align with the direction of the wind, and if the wind’s current changes, then you must also move the sail to capture the new direction. Detecting torsion waves is a more difficult process than sailing, as the torsion waves are continually changing their direction in the form of a three-dimensional spiral. Somehow, you must create vibrations in the detecting object that will allow it to continually harness a three-dimensional, moving spiral of energy force. Kozyrev was able to capture the subtle pressure of the torsion waves by combining two different forms of vibration or movement at a time. We will discuss exactly how this was done in the following paragraphs. Under these special laboratory conditions, gyroscopes or pendulums could be used to interact with the “time flow” energy, as Kozyrev called it. In these cases, such detectors will exhibit weight variations or sudden angular movements in response to the energy. One of the most basic detectors of “time flow” energy that Kozyrev used was the “torsion balance,” meaning that it was a balance beam that could spin freely as it was suspended from a thread. As described in Kozyrev’s first paper for the year 1971, the torsion balance did not have an equal distribution of weight on either side, as one end of the beam weighed ten grams and the other end was only one gram. Kozyrev suspended this beam with a string (filament) of capron that was 30 micrometers in diameter and 5-10 centimeters long. The string was attached much closer to the heavier end of the beam than the lighter end, so that the beam would remain in a perfect horizontal position under the effects of gravity. This positioning also created greater stress within the beam itself, making it move very easily. The lighter end of the beam was fashioned into a pointer, so that Kozyrev could measure on a protractor how many degrees the beam had moved at any time. In order to avoid being influenced by the atmosphere, the entire system was sealed under a glass cap so that all of the air inside could be vacuumed out. Furthermore, Kozyrev surrounded the cap with a metal net (similar to a Faraday cage) so that all known electromagnetic influences would be shielded. Most importantly, the top of the filament, where the beam balance was hanging from, was mechanically vibrated by an electromagnetic device. The experiments were not considered valid unless the beam would remain perfectly still even in the presence of the extra vibrations at the top of the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"string. However, these extra vibrations jiggling the top of the string created a greater sensitivity to outside vibration that would reverberate throughout the entire object. We already have an uneven set of weights that are carefully suspended on a thin string so that they remain horizontal, giving us a system that is under a lot of stress and will move very easily with the slightest touch. This is similar to the power of the lever to allow a person to lift up their entire car with the simple cranking up of the jack. Then, when you also add the stress of the vibrations moving up and down the string and into the balance itself, you have all the necessary ingredients to make the detector so extremely sensitive that the whisper-soft pressure of torsion waves can show a measurable effect. This is one of several clever ways to capture and detect these forces. (As another example, a gyroscope may be set in motion and then hung from a string that is vibrated.) In some senses this extra sensitivity works in the same way as an air hockey table, where you have a flat, rectangular surface with many tiny holes that shoot air straight upwards. The game is played with a light, flat puck that is knocked back and forth by two players. If the air is running on the table, (similar to the asymmetry of the balance and the extra vibrations on the filament in Kozyrev’s experiments,) then in this case, the gravity on the puck is counteracted by an upwards force, creating a more delicate balance between the two. The puck may remain perfectly still when left alone, but if you introduce new energy into the system by hitting the puck while the air is on, it moves extremely fast and with very little effort. When the air is off, the puck moves much more slowly and requires a greater force to set it in motion. The same is true with Kozyrev’s detectors. If the extra vibrational energy isn’t included, then you’d be lucky to ever see a reaction, because the “push” of the torsion waves are not normally strong enough to move a stationary object. Many scientists who have tried to replicate Kozyrev’s experiments have often not succeeded, because they do not see the extra vibrations as being important. Naturally, you will not detect torsion waves with a pendulum if it is not asymmetrical and / or if you do not introduce vibrations into it at the top of the string. Another way to visualize this effect is our analogy from the prologue, regarding the difference between a drop of water that is placed onto cold metal as opposed to that which is placed on a hot skillet. The vibrations of the metal in the skillet will cause the water to zip around the pan, becoming very sensitive to the slightest change in pressure from any direction. For our spiritually-inclined readers, it is interesting to note that the teachings of the Initiates have referred to the need to “raise your vibrations” for thousands of years if you want to be capable of perceiving the unseen energy of the universe. As we have proven in some of our workshops, within a relatively short span of time, a human being can be trained to respond to the gentle pressure of torsion waves in the human “aura” by touch. With greater training such as is described in the works of Rudolph Steiner or Carlos Castenada, the human energy field can eventually be visually seen. In Part Two we will discuss the voluminous evidence to prove that the human energy field does indeed exist, as the torsion-wave component to our physical bodies. 1.8 SIMPLE MOVEMENT CREATES TORSION WAVES Some of Kozyrev’s experiments seemed almost deceptively simple,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"considering the effects that he was able to achieve. For example, the simple raising and lowering of a 10-kg weight would exert torsional pressure on a pendulum at a distance of 2-3 meters, an effect which would even travel through walls. The pendulum that was used as a detector was shielded in glass under a vacuum, so this effect could not have been caused by the air. Again, the key component to the experiment was that the top of the string needed to be vibrated in order to introduce the extra tension and movement that would allow the pressure of the torsion waves to be picked up by the pendulum. This is another experiment that shows how the sheer mass of the 10-kilogram weight behaves like a sponge in water, creating “ripples” in the surrounding “water” when it is moved up and down. Again, this is a basic property of matter. 1.9 WEIGHT INCREASE AND DECREASE CAUSED BY SIMPLE MOVEMENT In another similar experiment, Kozyrev had a typical beam balance that is used for weight measurements, where the right side had a fixed weight and the left side had a hook for suspending various objects. In this case, the objects Kozyrev hung from the left side were also just simple weights, only they were attached to rubber strips that allowed them to be easily mounted on the balance. Normally, with the weights on either side in a stable position, the beam would stay balanced at a certain weight that could be measured on its scale. Kozyrev would then stabilize the arm of the beam balance either with his hand or a clamp so it wouldn’t move, and remove the object on the left from its hook. Then, he would shake the object up and down on the piece of rubber for about one minute. That’s all! After doing this, when he would place the object back on the balance arm with perfect stillness, he would again measure its weight, which would be slightly higher than before. Then, the scales would show the measured weight of the object gradually decreasing, as it released the extra energy that it had taken in. He noted that it was important that his hand didn’t heat the balance arm while holding it, so he would typically use a metal clamp to hold the bar instead. Interestingly, on certain days this test would work quite easily, whereas on other days it would work only with great difficulty or not at all. The same is true for the above experiment where a 10-kg weight was raised and lowered repeatedly. This is known as a “time-variable” phenomenon and will be discussed below. 1.10 KOZYREV’S RESULTS HAVE BEEN REPLICATED, NEVER DISPROVEN Many readers have expected that Kozyrev’s effects are simply due to errors in his recording. Here, it is important to remember that no concrete disproof of N.A. Kozyrev and V.V. Nasonov’s experimental results exists (Levich, 1996). In addition, independent groups of researchers have now reproduced and confirmed some of Kozyrev’s experiments. These include A.I. Veinik from the 1960s-1980s, Lavrentyev, Yeganova et al. in 1990, Lavrentyev, Gusev et al. in 1990, and Lavrentyev et al. in 1991 and 1992. American researcher Don Savage has also replicated much of Kozyrev’s work and published it in Speculations in Science and Tech. Furthermore, without any knowledge of Kozyrev’s work, in 1989 G. Hayasaka and S. Tekeyuchi discovered similar weight-loss effects with rotating 150- gram gyroscopes, and more recently obtained success by dropping the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"gyroscopes between two precision laser beam detectors. (Remember that a gyroscope that is being weighed in a rotating and non-rotating state will not show any measurable weight changes unless an additional process is introduced such as vibration, movement, (in this case dropping,) heat conduction or electric current transition.) The results of Hayasaka et al.’s study, conducted on behalf of the Mitsubishi corporation, actually did make it into the mainstream media, surprisingly enough. Furthermore, they did indeed attribute their results to the effects of torsion fields. Many other researchers such as Dr. S.M. Polyakov, Dr. Bruce DePalma and Sandy Kidd have independently discovered gravitational changes with gyroscopes, but it appears that most of them have not fully understood the fluidlike nature of the aether, which always travels in the spiraling movement of torsion waves. 1.11 ANTI-GRAVITY EFFECTS CAUSED BY THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION Many of Kozyrev’s experiments showed that the direction of the detector’s movement was very important in creating measurable weight changes. He determined that a gyroscope that was vibrating, heating or conducting electricity would substantially decrease its weight when it was rotated in a counter-clockwise motion, whereas it would remain unchanged if it were rotated in a clockwise motion. Kozyrev concluded that this was caused by the “Coriolis effect,” where an object will indeed show a rotational movement as it is dropped towards the surface of the Earth. Ultimately, this is due to the subtle spiraling pressure of torsion that is imparted to the flow of aether (gravity) as it rushes into the earth, upholding the existence of all its atoms and molecules. In 1680 Newton and Hook confirmed that the Coriolis effect was real by dropping objects down long mine shafts, and the experiment was repeated many times thereafter. The Coriolis effect causes counter-clockwise movement in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise movement in the Southern Hemisphere, and is considered the major force behind the movement of weather systems. It also has to be factored in when firing long- range cannons at a specific target, which was a very confusing military problem before the Coriolis effect was discovered. It is another little-known fact of science that most people are unaware of. We remember that Kozyrev would first vibrate, heat or electrify his gyroscope in order to see his anomalous effects. Under these conditions, he would then move the gyroscope in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. If the vibrating gyroscope is moved in a counter-clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere, then it is moving in unison with the counter-clockwise current of the Coriolis effect. This causes the object to absorb some of the energy that would normally be pushing it down, and a small but definite decrease in its weight is then measured. The work of G. Hayasaka and S. Tekeyuchi, which we mentioned above, independently confirmed the same anomalous result. When their gyroscope was rotated counter-clockwise it would fall slower than expected, whereas if it were rotating clockwise they could detect no changes, thus verifying Kozyrev’s findings. Naturally, Japan is also in the Northern Hemisphere. Kozyrev also found that additional torsion would be introduced in these experiments if his gyroscope was not kept 100% horizontal, which suggested to him that gravity, which moves straight down, is somehow joined with torsion waves, as later theorists confirmed. Without the existence of an aether and the phenomenon of dynamic torsion, none of these results would even be"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"remotely possible. 1.12 DEPALMA’S SPINNING BALL EXPERIMENT Figure 1.5 – Data of Dr. Bruce DePalma’s Spinning Ball Experiment from Hoagland’s 1992 UN Briefing A perfect example of harnessing torsion waves by rotation was discovered completely independently by Dr. Bruce DePalma, frequently cited by R.C. Hoagland et al. on the Enterprise Mission website. Within a complete vacuum, DePalma took two steel balls and catapulted them into the air at equal angles, with an equal amount of force. The only difference was that one ball was rotating 27,000 times per minute and the other was stationary. The rotating ball traveled higher into the air and then descended faster than its counterpart, which violated all known laws of physics. The only explanation for this effect is that both balls are drawing energy into themselves from an unseen source, and the rotating ball is thus “soaking up” more of this energy than its counterpart – energy that would normally exist as gravity, moving down into the earth. With the addition of torsion-field research we can see that the spinning ball was able to harness naturally spiraling torsion waves in its environment, which gave it an additional supply of energy. 1.13 TIME-VARIABLE EFFECTS Kozyrev found that a time-variable effect is produced within his experiments. He discovered that these experiments worked best in late autumn and the first half of winter, but were next to impossible to perform in the summer. Kozyrev believed that the heating of the atmosphere in the summer was creating a disturbance that would interrupt the flow of the torsion waves. The extra heat would cause the air molecules to jiggle more vigorously, and this in turn would disrupt the subtle spiraling pressures as the torsion-waves traveled. As he himself explained it, “the heating by solar rays creates an atmospheric loader, interfering with the [experimental] effects.” Earlier in his career he thought that this time-variable effect was caused by the naturally-occurring growth of vegetation in warmer months, since he had already noticed that the simple presence of growing plants could interfere with his experimental results, as they would draw energy into themselves that would normally flow to the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"detectors. Clearly, the combination of the plants absorbing the energy for their sustenance in the summer and the increased chaos of vibrations in the warmer atmosphere could both be responsible for the difficulty in making such measurements during the warmer seasons. This seasonal experimental effect could also prevent American scientists who might be living in an area like Southern California from ever being able to replicate his results, as they never experience the late autumn and winter conditions that were most favorable for the experiments to be done. 1.14 LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION Another overall implication of Kozyrev’s work is that the geographical location of the experiment also makes a significant difference. His best results were obtained when he carried out measurements near the North Pole, the most adventurous being conducted on chunks of drifting ice with a maximum latitude of 84° 15’, the North Pole being at 90°. This is a very important point, as it shows us that the greatest amount of torsion-wave energy is flowing into the Earth at the polar regions, growing weaker as we move towards the equator. Certainly, most readers will wonder why there would be any effects associated with the poles of the earth. The answer is found in a study of magnetism. In 1991-92, A.I. Veinik determined that the typical “permanent” iron ferrite magnets do not only have a collective magnetic field, but a collective torsion field as well, with a right-handed spin at the north pole and a left-handed spin at the south. Dr. G. I. Shipov demonstrated that all electromagnetic fields generate torsion waves. So, since we all know that the Earth’s magnetic field is most concentrated at the poles, then we can see that the greatest strength of torsion-waves would be in the polar regions as well. In his books and website, Richard Pasichnyk has demonstrated that earthquake impulses travel faster from north to south than from east to west. Thus, the added pressure of the torsion waves, instreaming and outflowing in the polar regions, affects far more than just the typical north-south polarity of the magnetic field that can be measured with a compass. Kozyrev also determined that the torsional energy flows differently in the southern hemisphere of the earth as opposed to the northern, and this again is due to the Coriolis effect. He also discovered that the speed of gravitational acceleration changes slightly between the northern and southern hemisphere by a subtle factor of 3.10^-5. This appears to be caused by the little-known fact that the spherical shape of the Earth is actually flatter in the northern hemisphere as opposed to the southern! This has also been observed and measured in other planets such as Jupiter and Saturn. Kozyrev believed that since the surface of the southern hemisphere was slightly farther away from the Earth’s center of gravity than the northern hemisphere, this was responsible for the subtle change in the speed of gravity’s acceleration. 1.15 LATENT FORCES EXISTING AFTER ENERGY STOPS BEING GENERATED The word “latent” means “left over,” and Kozyrev observed certain effects that continued for a time after he had stopped creating any torsion waves and / or disturbance to the measured objects. We remember that Kozyrev demonstrated how the simple shaking of a weight on a rubber strip would"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"cause its weight to increase, and that it would slowly drop back down to its normal rest mass once it was placed back on the balance beam. The time that the object takes to return to its normal weight is how we measure the “latent force” that it is capable of holding. Certain objects will gain and lose weight faster than others in Kozyrev’s experiments. Kozyrev concluded that the rate at which an object gains or loses weight is actually based on its density, or thickness, not on its overall weight. He showed that the loss of weight occurs at an exponential rate, and the denser the material is, the quicker the residual forces will disappear. Here are some examples: • Lead, at a density of 11, will lose its latent forces in 14 seconds, • Aluminum, at a density of 2.7, loses its latent forces in 28 seconds, and • Wood, at a density of 0.5, loses its latent forces in 70 seconds. If this seems hard to understand, we could think of the fact that a denser, thicker sponge such as the foam used in a mattress or seat cushion has much more of a “spring” to it than a lighter, thinner one, such as a tired old kitchen sponge. The more of a “spring” the material has, the quicker it can absorb and release energy. Kozyrev also tested these effects on copper, brass, quartz, glass, air, water, coal, graphite, table salt and others, and indicated that “the largest effects, with maximum preservation times, were observed on porous materials like brick or volcano tuff” (Nasonov 1985a, p.15). This should interest us, since the sponge in our analogy is also a porous material, meaning that it is filled with many pores or holes inside of itself. 1.15.1 THE ASPDEN EFFECT Another example of latent forces existing in a system is found in the Aspden effect, discovered by Dr. Harold Aspden of Cambridge University. This experiment involved a gyroscope whose central wheel was fashioned from a powerful magnet. The normal amount of energy that would be required to rotate the gyroscope to a certain maximum speed was 1000 joules. Like a glass of water being stirred up with a spoon, the rotation of the gyroscope would cause the aetheric energy inside its central wheel to begin spiraling, and this churning movement would continue inside the object even once Dr. Aspden brought the gyroscope to a stop. Surprisingly, for up to 60 seconds after Aspden’s gyroscope stopped rotating, it would take ten times less energy to return it to the same velocity as it had attained the first time – only 100 joules. This is another reproducible effect that has simply been ignored by the mainstream, because it “violates the laws of physics.” However, with Kozyrev’s work as a background, we can hear the chuckles of Russian scientists as they read of Dr. Aspden’s troubles in getting anyone in the West to acknowledge this effect. Now if you’ve been paying attention, you might notice that Kozyrev showed that lead (Pb) maintained its latent forces for 14 seconds and aluminum for 28, and yet Dr. Aspden’s gyroscopes would retain their forces for a full 60 seconds. This is due to the fact that extra aetheric / torsional energy is harnessed by the powerful permanent magnet making up the center of the gyroscope – and in Convergence III we demonstrated how this basic property of rotating magnets has been used to create many different “free energy” devices."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"1.16 MASTER LIST OF NON-MECHANICAL DETECTORS Although we have discussed gyroscopes, pendulums and torsion beam balances so far, Kozyrev also discovered non-mechanical detectors that could pick up the energy of the “time flow.” What we mean by “non-mechanical” is that torsion waves could be detected without the moving parts normally required, which involved two different forms of mechanical vibration or motion, such as in the gyroscope, torsion balance and pendulum. Some of these non-mechanical detectors can demonstrate quite substantial changes in the presence of torsion fields, and in the case of tungsten and quartz, the effects of torsion fields on the material can be irreversible. All of the following will show changes in the presence of torsion-wave energy: • the conductiveness of electronic resistors, especially those made from tungsten metal • the mercury level in thermometers • the vibrational frequencies of quartz crystal oscillators • the electric potentials of thermocouples • the viscosity of water • the amount of electronic work that can be performed in a photoelectric cell • the reaction rates of chemical compounds (such as the Belousov- Zhabotinsky effect) • the growth parameters of bacteria and plants A highly-detailed summary of Kozyrev’s work, including the exact graphs, detailed statistics, analyses and descriptions of all the above detectors, can be found in “A Substantial Interpretation of N.A. Kozyrev’s Conception of Time,” by A.P. Levich, 1996. 1.17 CHERNETSKY’S REPLICATION Some of these non-mechanical torsion-wave detectors were reproduced by the team of A.V. Chernetsky, Y.A. Galkin and S.N. Kolokoltzev, who also created a device that generated and stored this aetheric energy much like a capacitor, which is an electronic component that stores an electric charge. They referred to their invention as a “self-generating discharge device.” Like Kozyrev, Chernetsky et al. found that the level of resistance in an electronic circuit would change if a part of it was placed between the two capacitor plates of the device while it was in operation. Also, the vibrational frequency of a quartz oscillator could become 1000 or more times faster than it was before it was placed in between the plates. This should raise an eyebrow, as the reliability of quartz crystals to maintain a steady pulsating rhythm while having electricity pass through them is used to keep accurate time in the vast majority of digital watches and clocks in existence. 1.18 LATENT FORCES IN THE VACUUM AND IN MATTER Chernetsky et al. also discovered that their “self-generating discharge device” could create a “static” or non-moving torsion field within the very structure of space-time itself. A flowing “current” can be created in the fluidlike aether even if no matter existed in the area. Chernetsky et al. could still measure the same torsion-field effects in the area that had been between the two plates of the machine, after the machine was turned off and far removed from the area! The latent effects would still be measurable with tungsten metal or"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"quartz oscillators. Another similar effect was discovered by Donald Roth, which he called “Magnetic Memory,” and documented by the Institute for New Energy. Roth discovered that he could bring a magnet close enough to a beam balance that it would attract the balance to itself, and after about five days the magnet could be moved much farther away from the balance and still attract it the same way. The Russians refer to this concept as “vacuum structuring,” and it again shows us that there is “something there” in supposedly empty space – something that the inheritors of the Atlantean Mysteries knew as the “aether.” Kozyrev also discovered that a physical substance can become “structured” in the same way. As he wrote on page 217 of his 1977 paper, ... A body placed for a certain time near a process [that generates torsion waves] and then brought to a torsion balance [would] produce the same effect on [the torsion balance] as [the original torsion-generating] process [produced by] itself. [The] memorizing [of] the action of processes is a feature of [all] different substances, except aluminum. In 1984, Dankachov showed that the “memory” or “structuring” effect could occur with water as well, and this is one experiment that does find its way into Western alternative scientific thinking from time to time. The “memory of water” experiments begin by utilizing one of the basic torsion-wave creating processes to cause the measured viscosity or thickness of water to decrease. Then, the treated water is placed next to another container of water, and the new water’s viscosity will then decrease just like the original treated water. Other experiments, such as those of Jacques Beneviste, show that this “memory of water” effect is able to carry over into chemical effects as well, where torsion-wave generators are used to excite water with a certain chemical compound in it. Then, that compound can be energetically transferred to a sealed container of pure water, and the sealed water will acquire the same chemical characteristics as the original. 1.19 SOLAR ECLIPSE ENERGY SHIELDING EFFECT As we already suggested in the prologue, the Sun is our obvious choice for being the primary source of torsion waves in our heliosphere, due to it having 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. In 1970, Saxel and Allen showed that during a solar eclipse, the presence of the moon shields the Sun’s radiant torsion fields, and this causes an increase in the period of oscillation for a torsion balance. Meteorologists V.S. Kazachok, O.V. Khavroshkin and V.V. Tsyplakov were able to repeat this experiment during the 1976 solar eclipse and produce the same effect, which they then published in 1977. Others have obtained the same results through observing the simple deviations of a pendulum at the time of a solar eclipse. 1.20 MOLECULAR ALIGNMENTS AIDING OR SHIELDING TORSION EFFECTS As we already mentioned, the Einstein-Cartan theory first established a theoretical basis for the existence of torsion fields in 1913. The theory predicts that there will either be right-handed or left-handed torsion in space, depending on the location. Subsequent discoveries in quantum physics related to the notion of “spin” confirmed that “electrons” will either have “right-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"handed” or “left-handed” spin, meaning that movement is detected that will either be clockwise or counterclockwise. All atoms and molecules maintain varying degrees of balance between right and left-handed spin. Kozyrev determined that strongly right-handed molecules such as sugar can shield torsion effects, whereas strongly left-handed molecules such as turpentine will strengthen them. Subsequent Russian investigations also determined that common polyethylene film acted as an excellent shield for torsion waves, and were used in many different experiments such as those discussed by Dr. Alexander Frolov. 1.21 “QUANTIZED” CHANGES IN WEIGHT We discussed Kozyrev’s experiments where an object would be disturbed in various ways, and its changes in weight would then slowly return to balance over time. There is one important factor that emerged in these experiments that does not easily fit in with our convenient analogy of the sponge in water, and that is known as “effect quantization.” (We shall explain what causes it later.) When something is quantized, that means that it does not move or count smoothly, but only stepwise, in certain specific intervals. Simply put, the weight of an object would not increase or decrease steadily in the “latent force” experiments, but rather in sudden bursts. This is certainly a highly anomalous property for matter to have. As Kozyrev said, In the vibration experiments on a balance the weight reduction... occurs stepwise, beginning with a certain vibration power. As vibration frequency is further increased, the weight reduction... at first remains the same and then again grows stepwise by the same value... So far a realistic explanation of this phenomenon has not been found... Afterwards it turned out that effect quantization takes place in almost all the experiments. (Kozyrev 1971, p. 126) As a case in point, Kozyrev studied these effects on a 620-gram weight, which he would subject to vibrations, measured in hertz or cycles per second. We remember that cooling an object contracts it, whereas heating an object expands it. Both heating and cooling are functions of vibration, so depending on how we vibrate an object, we can either cause its weight to increase or decrease. In this experiment, the mass of the 620-gram weight would be slightly increased by subjecting it to high-speed vibrations. In order to give the experiments nice, clean numbers, Kozyrev and Nasonov later applied a straightforward mathematical function to “renormalize” the results from the 620-gram weight to the higher and simpler value of 1 kilogram. The numbers given in the next paragraph are renormalized to the 1-kilogram level."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Figure 1.6 – Quantized increases in weight with growing vibrational frequency, measured by beam balance. So as we can see from this chart, as the vibrations of the object rose to the threshold area of 16-23 hertz, (or cycles per second,) the object would show a stable weight increase of 31 milligrams. At this level, Kozyrev could increase the vibrations between 16 and 23 cycles per second and detect no further weight gain. Then suddenly, as he increased the vibrations on the weight to 24 hertz, its overall weight increase would spontaneously double to 62 milligrams. As he increased the vibrations from 24 to 27 hertz, no change in weight was registered. Yet, when the vibrations increased to 28 hertz, the net weight increase would again suddenly jump up by another 31 hertz to 93 milligrams. Each time that a new threshold would be reached, the initial gain of 31 milligrams would be added to the overall amount. As Kozyrev discovered, We succeeded in obtaining fivefold and even tenfold effects. (!) Let us not forget that this “effect quantization” occurred in almost all of Kozyrev’s experiments, whether the overall weight of the object in question was either increasing or decreasing. In order for something like this to be taking place, the basic 31-milligram interval that was measured with the 1- kilogram object must be a function of its combined volume, density, weight and topology (shape), similar to the tone that you hear when striking a bell of a given size, shape and density. As Kozyrev rose the frequency of vibrations in the object, new intervals of weight increase were produced, but always in units of 31 milligrams. This “effect quantization” is actually a very important key to understanding the multidimensional nature of matter, illustrating that atoms and molecules maintain an onion-like structure of nested spherical waves. Our discussions in the next chapter will begin to show the context of this experiment and how it relates to new discoveries in quantum physics."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"1.22 DIFFICULTY IN COMBINING KOZYREV’S VIEWS WITH MAINSTREAM SCIENCE Kozyrev’s views are not quickly or easily assimilated by the mainstream scientific community, especially in the West, because the magnitudes of the effects he measured are quite small. For example, the additional forces that were introduced in his mechanical experiments changed the weight of the objects being studied by a mere factor of 10^-4 to 10^-5, such as the gyroscope that would only become 100 milligrams lighter when rotating and vibrating at the same time. In order to appreciate how small of a change this is, remember that a certain active ingredient that was added to a vitamin pill might have 100 milligrams of weight on the label. As Kozyrev himself puts it, “The experimental results show that the organizing property of time exerts a very small influence on systems [of matter such as stars,] compared with the usual, destructive course of their development. Therefore it is not surprising that this... entity has been missed in our system of scientific knowledge. However, being small, it is distributed everywhere in nature, and only the possibility of its being stored is needed” (Kozyrev 1982, p.71). REFERENCES: 1 Akimov, A.E. and Shipov, G.I.

Therefore, a new model of quantum mechanics is required to account for matter being able to subtly increase and decrease in its weight, based on its interaction with a non-electromagnetic, fluidlike energy source. The more esoteric questions related to how torsion fields connect with consciousness and spirituality shall be relegated to later chapters; at this point, our main concern is to establish a working system of physics that explains exactly what matter is. If nothing else, Kozyrev’s findings show us that we still do not have an adequate model to answer that question. Thankfully, many adept thinkers are tackling the problems with quantum physics and have come up with aether-based models that answer these nagging questions, which have been almost completely ignored in the Western mainstream scientific community. These pioneers would include Dr. Milo Wolff, Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg, Dr. Volodymyr Krasnoholovets, Charles Cagle, “Smart 1234,” Dr. John Nordberg, Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, Dr. Henry Myers, Dr. Harold Aspden, Dr. R.B. Duncan, Buckminster Fuller, Dr. Oliver Crane and many more. Each of these sources contain different pieces of “the puzzle”, however we feel that the work of Rod Johnson is needed for all remaining paradoxes to be completely accounted for – and it shall be introduced in Chapter Four. Although it is certainly possible for future authors to present a complete, unified model, we will just cover enough interesting highlights here to show that such a model can and does indeed exist. 2.2 GINZBURG’S NEW VIEW OF RELATIVITY Our first key concepts to explore come from Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg, who was born in Moscow, USSR and moved to the U.S. with his family in 1974. Having received his Ph.D. in technical sciences in 1968, he was certainly well positioned to have heard about the findings of Kozyrev, one of Russia’s top astrophysicists. However, as we said, there was a strong desire for secrecy in the Soviet regime on these matters, and Ginzburg never mentions Kozyrev’s name in his work. Nevertheless, Ginzburg discovered that a few simple changes could be made to the common equations for relativity theory that would not disagree with any known observations and that furthermore perfectly explain the weight-changing anomalies of matter that Kozyrev had noted. Relativity theory states that an object gradually increases in its mass once we begin accelerating it. In conventional scientific thought, no object can exceed the speed of light, because as it approaches this speed, the equations state that the object would become infinitely massive. Yet, in very loose terms, Ginzburg found that you could completely reverse (invert) these equations without violating any known scientific observations. This means that instead of growing more massive, an object will actually shed energy back into the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"aether as it is moved, thus causing it to gradually lose all of its core characteristics of gravitational mass, inertial mass and electric charge as it approaches the speed of light. Ginzburg introduces these new concepts in the next quote: [We have added emphasis and deleted the letters for terms such as “velocity” in order to enhance readability:] The main two features of these new equations are: • Both the gravitational mass and inertial mass of a particle decrease as its velocity [speed] increases. • [The] electric charge of a particle [also] decreases as its velocity increases... As seen here, an object’s overall mass (weight) is represented by both gravitational and inertial masses, which are simply measurements of how gravity and inertia behave on the object. Curiously, both gravity and inertia have essentially identical effects on matter, which is known as Einstein’s “Principle of Equivalence”. This principle shows us that gravity and inertia are two forms of the same energy at equal strength – one moving downward (gravity) and one providing resistance as we move through space (inertia.) This is one of the easiest ways to see that there must indeed be an “aether” or “physical vacuum” that is behind both forces, and Kozyrev had also noted this connection in his own studies. So, once we start accelerating an object, (which we said is like a sponge submerged in water in this new model,) the added pressure will compress the atoms and molecules in the object and cause more and more of its aether to be released. Ginzburg then continues: You may not be prepared to abandon immediately the century-old relativistic equations. But once you are ready to do so, you will discover many amazing things: • Only when a particle is as rest may it be considered as “pure” matter. As soon as the particle begins to move, its gravitational mass and electrical charge will start to decrease in accordance with the new relativistic equations, so that a part of its matter will be converted into a field. When the particle’s velocity becomes equal to the ultimate spiral field velocity “C”, its gravitational mass and electric charge become equal to zero. At this point, matter will be completely converted into a “pure” field. The “ultimate spiral field velocity” of “C” that Ginzburg mentions is slightly higher than the normal speed of light, due to the spiraling path that he believes all energy must follow. This simple change to the basic relativity equations then leads to a new quantum physics of transmutation, with the concept that an object could completely disappear from our known physical reality. This raises a key question: “Disappear to where?” 2.3 MISHIN AND ASPDEN BOTH FIND DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AETHER DENSITY Ginzburg asserts that an object becomes “pure field” as it increases up to light speed. However, there is solid evidence that there are different vibratory levels of aether, and we therefore conclude that as an object is accelerated towards the speed of light, either by linear motion, internal vibration or related energetic action, the missing energy and mass is simply displaced into a higher vibratory level of aether. In this book we shall refer to these levels as densities. As one example, if you put pressure on a beach ball by slowly"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"pushing it into water, you can gradually move it from being surrounded by air to being surrounded by water, which is denser. When you release the pressure that you placed on the beach ball, the higher density of the water will cause it to pop back into the lower-density atmosphere once more. You will see that nothing in the basic form of the beach ball has changed. Though this is a rather crude analogy, it is by far the best one to explain many anomalies that we will discuss throughout this book. Certain scientists such as Dr. A.M. Mishin, Dr. Harold Aspden, Dr. Nikola Tesla and John Keely have all independently discovered that the aether is sub- divided into different levels of density. From these findings, we know that the qualities of matter and energy will be different in each density, leading to changes in the basic “laws” of physics within each level. We shall touch briefly upon their discoveries to put our discussion in the proper context. First of all, Dr. A.M. Mishin of St. Petersburg, Russia conducted extensive measurements over long periods of time in his laboratory, which showed that the aether simultaneously exists in different states, and the state that you will detect is dependent on what type of turbulent disturbance that you create. These findings were established through measurements taken by auto- oscillating electromechanical systems similar to some of Kozyrev’s designs, with an undisclosed “added component” that was more suited to detecting torsion waves from biological systems as opposed to inorganic systems. With these measurement devices and techniques, Mishin could detect: • the “temperature” of the aether, akin to the amount of vibratory disturbance in it, • the direction and polarization of the aether, and • the flowing movements or “fluxes” of the aether. Mishin numbered the different densities of aether that he discovered as follows: • Ether-1 behaved like a solid-state body; • Ether-2 behaved like a dense superfluid liquid; • Ether-3 behaved like a gaseous body, connected with molecular motion; • Ether-4 is the state we observe as stellar plasma energy; • Ether-5 corresponds to galactic processes. As we can see, it appears that each level of aether that Mishin discovered has a different level of density than the others, most specifically visible in the first three, which are obviously in decreasing order of density. We should remember that Dr. Mishin is not the only scientist to have discovered that the aether exists at different density levels. Since the 1950s, Dr. Harold Aspden has documented similar discoveries, and in his case they are backed up by extensive equations. Furthermore, all the major foundations of Aspden’s work had successfully passed peer-review processes and ended up being published in prestigious scientific journals, and this material shall be covered in later chapters. Also, the 19th century physicist John Keely classified seven different densities of aether, probably through a discovery process similar to Dr. Mishin’s. All of this research allows us to introduce the concept that these different levels of aetheric energy density actually correspond to different “dimensions” or planes of existence. Many ancient mystery-school teachings seem to agree that there is an Octave of seven major densities that correspond with the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"colors in the rainbow or the notes in the Diatonic musical scale, and this has been well covered in our previous volumes. Such a wonderful, elegant solution to the quirky mathematical problems of “higher dimensions” is exactly what we would expect to see in a Divine Cosmos. The purest, most harmonic vibrations of visible light and audible sound are both conveniently organized into an Octave framework, and it appears that the vibrations of the aether are no different. As we continue to present information throughout the rest of this book, the combined effect of Mishin and Aspden’s models of a multi-leveled “aether” will be very important to our arguments. Mishin gives us the direct observational evidence that such levels exist, and Aspden gives us a complete mathematical foundation to explain how and why they exist. Never before has there been a theory of quantum physics that can account for mysterious, documented effects related to objects appearing, disappearing and / or reappearing around us. These effects include the anomalies of the Bermuda Triangle and other such vortexes as well as the many surprising, scientifically documented accounts of telekinesis, such as those now emerging from China in Paul Dong’s book China’s Super Psychics, discussed later in this book. The material in this book sets forth such a theory that satisfies these requirements. Even more importantly, we will establish that these differing aetheric densities must also correspond to different levels of intelligence and consciousness. And for now, we must continue to focus on the basics. 2.4 GINZBURG AND THE “DYNOSPHERE” Dr. Ginzburg also suggests that his new relativity equations reveal the existence of spiraling waves of energy, and a “spiral field” that travels through a sphere-based, fluidlike aether that he calls the “dynosphere:” [The] dynosphere is an assembly of the field bubbles that fill the entire space in the universe. Obviously, Ginzburg’s theory is in exact harmony with Kozyrev’s findings. Ultimately, the “aether” must be visualized at the tiniest level as being composed of spherical bubbles of aetheric energy that exist throughout the entire Universe. Torsion waves move through this aether by causing adjacent “field bubbles” to bump into each other. No one bubble actually moves very far in its position, just as a set of floating objects can essentially remain in the same position as waves roll by in the water. Each time an impulse of momentum hits a field bubble, the bubble then collides into its neighbors, transferring the momentum. The impulse will continue to be transferred along even though all the bubbles end up in the same relative positions that they started in. Ginzburg’s new model also leads to the idea that atoms and molecules are simply vortex formations, akin to smoke rings or whirlpools, which have formed within this fluid-like aether that he calls the dynosphere. Though he and many other thinkers have provided great amounts of evidence to back up their claims, most mainstream scientists continue to shun these concepts. They stand on the well-worn edifices of thought that insist that atoms are made of particles. However, we will now demonstrate that the particle model is nothing more than a belief that has been built up from a series of assumptions."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"2.5 ASSUMPTIONS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS Niels Bohr was the first to promote the “magnetron” model of the atom, which involves particles that orbit each other like a tiny Solar System. Many people are not aware that this model cannot be true and is actually quite misleading, as a number of experiments confirm that the so-called “particles” behave as if they were waves. This leads to confusing problems such as the Schroedinger’s Cat paradox and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, both of which try to tell us that atoms are not actually “real” but are only “probabilities” at the quantum level. To have something that is not “real” as the foundation of matter seems quite absurd. Here, we must remember that the majority of our conclusions about the quantum realm are assumptions only, which have been built up from only two indirect sources: 1 Spectroscope Analysis 2 Vapor-Trail Analysis Beginning with the first on the list, spectroscope analysis is simpler than most would imagine. A particular element (group of atoms) is stored in a small, transparent container while it is in a changing state of energy, which causes it to release light (photons). Then, a special form of light is shone through the element, which pushes the released photons along so that they pass through a prism (lens) or grating (slot) that breaks them up into a rainbow color spectrum. The spectrum is then recorded on film and analyzed, and due to the unique quality of the light radiation that is shined through the changing element, (which is appropriately named as “black body” radiation,) the film will only capture a small series of vertical colored lines. These lines are created by untold numbers of photons, at certain exact color frequencies, which the chemical element is releasing. So all we know for certain is that the atoms are releasing certain color frequencies of light (photons), which are then being analyzed – anything else is an informed assumption. The second category of quantum measurement is “vapor-trail” or “bubble chamber” analysis. The medium that is used to detect the “particles” is typically a glass chamber that is filled with highly pressurized gas, such as water vapor. The pressure is so high that no further molecules can be forced in, and when a charged “particle” travels through the medium, it creates visible disturbances. Here is Dr. Milo Wolff’s explanation of this: The second means of measurement involves directing single charged particles to enter a medium which will record the particle’s path by abstracting part of its energy to create some sort of visible reaction in the medium. Photographic film and vapor-saturated air or liquids are common media. In the latter two cases the passage of the particle [through the medium] causes tiny fog particles or bubbles to appear; hence the method is called a cloud chamber or a bubble chamber. If a magnetic field is present, the particle path is curved [in a spiral] and measurement of the path permits calculation of mass, momentum and energy. As Dr. Wolff indicates, the vast majority of our “particle” beliefs come from"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"these two forms of measurement and the assumptions that have been inferred from them. One additional case of “proof” concerns the idea that atoms have a nucleus of particles. This came about from Rutherford’s experiment where he bombarded a piece of very thin gold foil with high- energy protons, and measured how many of the protons passed through the foil. A very small but measurable number of the protons did not pass through the foil. Since not all of the protons went through, Rutherford concluded that these protons had bounced off of a tiny “nucleus” in the center of the atom and that the rest of the area was largely “empty space.” So, we have Rutherford’s experiment, spectroscopy and bubble chamber analysis as the foundation upon which the vast majority of assumptions about quantum physics have been made. No atoms had even remotely been “seen” visually until 1985, when IBM Research Almaden Labs was the first to use an electron tunneling microscope to actually photograph the organization of molecules of germanium in an ink-blot. What we see from this experiment in Figure 2.1 are indistinct, fuzzy spherical objects that appear to have some non-spherical geometric qualities to their shape and are in an extremely geometric pattern of organization, which was definitely a surprise for conventional science. The image was artificially colored orange and green to allow the eye to discriminate between the two types of atom that were seen: Figure 2.1 – Actual photograph of atoms of germanium in an ink-blot. Furthermore, when quantum physicists have studied the “electrons” of the atom, they have observed that they are not actually “points” at all, but rather form smooth, teardrop-shaped “clouds” where the narrowest ends of the “drops” converge upon a very tiny point in the center (Figure 2.2). Here, we shall reprint excerpts from Dr. Milo Wolff’s book just to make the point absolutely clear, with emphasis added: p. 122 – There are no Electron Orbits! Whoever started the notion of electrons traveling around the nucleus like planets made a terrible blunder! If you have learned such an idea, discard it immediately. Instead, all calculations and all experiments show that no satellite-like orbital motion exists in the normal atom. Instead, there are standing wave patterns. For example, see the case of N=1 in Figure 9-1 [or in these diagrams, M=0 and L=0] where the standing wave pattern is entirely spherical. The center of the electron pattern is also the center of the proton pattern. This is the normal situation of the H atoms in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the universe; they have spherical symmetry, not orbits. Figure 2.2 – Electron clouds from top-down view (L) and from side view (R). [Courtesy Wolff, 1990] p. 133 – 1"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"All experiments to probe a central structure of the electron have been negative. 2 No QM theory exists that predicts a size for the electron, a mass, nor a charge. Further, there is no theory that quantifies the particle in a meaningful calculation. This implies that QM actually has no need of a particle concept because all the calculations are the same whether or not you believe in particles. 3 The substantiality of “mass” is doubtful because it can always be converted to electromagnetic energy, which has no particle properties. As Dr. Wolff suggests, the observed teardrop shapes of electron clouds are exactly what we would expect when seeing a “standing wave” of vibration. We remember that the hydrogen atom’s electron cloud was seen to have a spherical shape. This is also a direct indication that atoms are vortex formations, since the hydrogen atom is considered the “building block” of all the other elements, with one hypothetical “proton” in the nucleus and one hypothetical “electron” that is actually represented by the spherical cloud. 2.6 NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE: SIMPLE DIFFERENCES IN PRESSURE As every scientist knows, the electron clouds have a negative charge and the “protons” in the much-tinier nucleus area have a positive charge. This is known as “charge polarity,” since there are two charges that are polarized, or opposite. It has long been a mystery as to what this truly means, and why there is a “flow” of charge. This problem has boggled the mind of many a scientist, and Dr. Aspden admits it in the following quote: I admit that I cannot as yet solve the riddle of charge polarity. It lies in unexplored territory and apart from a few brief excursions into that territory, I see it as uncharted ground... [it is] a challenge and possibly the final frontier of our conquest of physics. It surprises me that the subject is not even mentioned by physicists as something warranting research investigation. It seems that it is easier to explore what happened in the first moments of the ‘Big Bang’ than to look into what is happening within us and all around us here and now on Earth. [emphasis added] In Dr. O. Crane’s new model and certain others, these opposing charges, or charge polarities of negative and positive are actually nothing more than differences in aetheric pressure. The negative electron clouds have a higher pressure, and the positive nucleus has a lower pressure. Put simply, the negative charges in the electron clouds are flowing into the positively charged area at the center of the atom. This suggests that a much easier unification between electromagnetism and gravity is possible, as both gravity and charge polarity represent the pressing- in of aetheric energy towards the center of the spherical field or object. (Esoteric science might say that these are both forms of “the striving of all matter and energy to again become One.”) The only real difference, then, between gravity and charge polarity is in the strength of aetheric pressure"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"that is measured, and the degree of symmetry with which the energy flow presses in across the sphere’s surface. Why do we say symmetry is important? Simply put, the gravitational forces on Earth are very consistent from one place to another, whereas in the atom you have areas between the electron clouds where there is no “flow” of energy towards the center. We will explain why there are these partitioned areas later in this chapter. Now, with Dr. Crane’s “aetheric pressure” concept for charge, the mystery of charge polarity is cleared. This concept is given undeniable factual support by what is known as the Biefield-Brown effect, first proposed by Prof. Paul Biefield, who had once been a fellow student of Albert Einstein in Zurich, Switzerland. Biefield proposed an “aetheric” concept of charge as a flow of aether, where the negative charge was an area of high pressure within a sea of aetheric energy, and this pressure would flow into low-pressure areas of what we call positive charge in this same sea. If this model were indeed true, Biefield proposed, then with a high enough level of electromagnetic intensity, it should be possible for an anti-gravitational propulsive force to be created. The first person to successfully test Biefield’s theoretical effect was Dr. Townsend T. Brown in 1923. His experiment involved a “plate condenser,” which is simply a positive electric plate (literally a disc shape, interestingly enough) and a negative plate that are sandwiched on top of each other with a non-conductive or dielectric material between them. Then, this plate condenser is charged with a high amount of electricity and suspended by a firm wire that would be able to rotate in a large circle on the horizontal plane if it were moved. When this object is charged up, it will move independently towards the positive plate of the condenser, sustaining a constant thrust and causing the whole wire / plate condenser assembly to spin around in circles by itself. Then, Dr. Crane continues: When the condenser was vertically fastened to a beam scale, a weight increase showed if the positive pole (low pressure) was pointing down. Correspondingly a weight loss occurred when the negative pole (high pressure) was pointing down. The intensity of the effect was determined by the size of the pole plate areas, the voltage level and the polarization capability of the dielectric. [emphasis added] The last statement regarding the “polarization capability of the dielectric” may be confusing. As we said, a dielectric is a non-conducting substance, which in this experiment is sandwiched between the two oppositely charged plates. The “polarization capability” refers to how well the dielectric material can keep the charges between the two plates separated, or polarized. So, what we can see here is a very core and essential finding for understanding the structure and function of the Universe. When a flow is established between the negative and positive pole, a river of energy is created in the surrounding aether, and the river of aetheric energy will forcefully move towards the positive. This effect is indeed strong enough to counteract gravity. Many reputable sources agree that Brown devised a means to create a self-contained unit which could defeat gravity and rise into the air on its own, and that his work was immediately classified thereafter. Since that time, at the Disclosure Project Executive Summary Briefing on May 10, 2001, which Wilcock attended along with a number of congressional aides and other invited guests, certain witnesses testified that various deep-black"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"programs have indeed mastered the use of this technology for propulsion. The system of concentric magnetic rings and rotating magnetic rollers, devised by Prof. John R. R. Searl and discussed in our previous volume, is another workable anti-gravity system, and was successfully duplicated and the results subsequently published in Russia by Roschin and Godin. Certain “feelers” are starting to be put out to the public’s attention that the Biefield-Brown effect could be used for propulsion. Jeff Cameron of Transdimensional Technologies filmed two versions of his “T3” device in action, a triangular metallic frame with thin wires that were attached to each corner. Over a non-conducting circular base, the triangular frame is seen to levitate and slightly wobble around in the air once the electric current is turned on. A loud and satisfying “SNAP” is heard as the flow is cut off and the device abruptly drops back down to the surface. Not surprisingly, as of Feb. 2002 the entire contents of the website were pulled except for the title page, with a vague promise to “keep checking.” Thankfully, in March 2002, Jim Ventura independently replicated the exact same experiment, which is based on the research of Jean-Louis Naudin, and three films of it now exist on Art Bell’s website for the general public to view. Interestingly, the object spins around constantly on its wires in the first two films, suggesting the spiraling pressure of torsion waves (gravi-spin energy) at work. In the atom, the high-pressure negative “source” pushes towards the lower- pressure positive “sink,” and this is responsible for the electron clouds flowing in to the nucleus. This leads us to the conclusion that atoms and the “empty space” of aether that surrounds them are both made of the same fluidlike energetic material; the only difference is that in an atom, the aether has begun swirling into a low-pressure central vortex, traveling through the electron clouds. Not surprisingly, one informant from the Disclosure Project revealed that the manmade ARV craft (Alien Reproduction Vehicles) are known to the insiders as “flux-liners.” This is an obvious play on the term “airliner,” and demonstrates their knowledge that the vehicles are riding on the aetheric energy flux or flow instead of air. 2.7 SPHERICAL SYMMETRY AND A CENTRAL AXIS For our next key point regarding the nature of the atom, we see that the “particle” experiments of quantum physics have shown that there is a tendency towards a spherical structure of these energy fields. However, these spherical structures also have been seen to spin. Various techniques have been used to make this discovery, such as by measuring the qualities of identical “particles” as they are released from an emitter at successively different angles before colliding with a detector. The validity of the discovery of “spin” is not in dispute in the mainstream quantum world. As Dr. Wolff states it in Chapter 10 of his book, entitled Particles and Electricity, p. 147 – A dilemma exists with respect to the rotational character of spin, as follows: Particles are spherically symmetrical in regard to charge, mass, and behavior. In spite of this, having a spin from a human realm view demands a spin axis, which would destroy the spherical symmetry! How can this be? Is there symmetry or isn’t there? There might be an escape from this dilemma because whenever spin is transferred in an interaction (i.e. spin is measured,) the spin axis is always found to be along the line of particle motion. [emphasis added]"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Thus, as “particles” move through the aether, their central axis of spin is aligned with the direction of their motion. This gives them the exact same “vortex” quality of movement as we would see with a smoke ring – this formation is automatically created by any straight-line movement through a fluid medium. Our next question is exactly what this spherical vortex will look like. Let us begin by visualizing what happens when we have a single fluid that rotates around a central area. Once the fluid begins rotating, it forms a whirlpool along its rotational axis. This can be demonstrated very simply by filling up a sink with water and then stirring up the water with our hand in a large circle. We will quickly form a whirlpool in the center of the circle. Now, we need to imagine that same fluid rotating inside of a spherical area, in this case the outside of the atom. What we will discover is that a whirlpool will again form along the rotational axis, between the north and south poles of the sphere. This whirlpool forms a complete hole through the center of the sphere. On one pole of the sphere, the water will flow in, with the vortex becoming progressively narrower as it approaches the center, and then the continuing momentum of the water will cause it to flow out through the opposite pole, the vortex becoming progressively wider as it reaches the outer edge. The water must flow in one side and out the other, since it has nowhere else to go. This is a basic property of “torus” formations and can be seen in the inwardly-curling movement of smoke rings, for example. Naturally, a picture is worth a thousand words, and Figure 5.3 from Charles Cagle shows the structure of the spherical torus at the quantum level, which he calls the “electromagnetotoroid”:"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Figure 2.3 – The “Electromagnetotoroid,” showing the spherical-torus formation at the quantum level. As we continue with our investigation into the phenomenon of spin, we find that others have adopted the spherical torus for the quantum realm as well. Dr. Harold Aspden’s theories in this regard are among the most comprehensive and well-substantiated mathematically, and have been published in some of the finest physics journals. Dr. Aspden also illustrates the concept that atoms are actually spherical torus formations, while not using the word “torus”: I interject here the comment that my onward research into this subject tracks evidence of the aether being able to exhibit rotational momentum, angular momentum, inasmuch as a sphere of something having a mass density can spin about a central axis and not disturb enveloping aether. Such is the vista that opens provided we keep faith with the aether belief and do not allow our minds to be usurped by Einstein doctrines. [emphasis added]"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"2.8 SPECIFIC ANOMALIES MUST BE SATISFIED Our job would be relatively simple if all we had to do was to consider spherical atoms with a central axis, forming as vortexes in a fluidlike aether. However, there are specific geometric anomalies that turn up in quantum observations which must be satisfied in order for this model to be complete. Here are two basic quantum problems that would need to be addressed for the model that we are presenting to be accurate: First of all, we would need to describe why “electron clouds” form in the atom with empty spaces between them, as opposed to simply spherical formations. Secondly, we would need to understand how and why these spherical-torus energy formations gather into crystal structures, such as sodium chloride or salt, which forms a cube. One of the interesting properties of such a crystal is that it will naturally fracture into miniature versions of itself, where the same angular relationship is preserved between its facets. Both questions may be solved when we begin to understand the importance of what are known as the Platonic solids, a set of five different geometric shapes that have a great deal of importance in ancient sacred science, and have been introduced in each of our previous volumes. In short, the “Platonic Solid” geometric forms will naturally appear in a spherical “vortex” of vibrating (pulsating) fluid. In the next chapter we will gain an understanding of the ancient and modern importance of Platonic Solids, and also see the weight of surprising and unexpected physical evidence to prove that this theory must be correct. Then, in Chapter Four we will bring in the theoretical data of Rod Johnson that completely rounds out our view of the quantum realm. REFERENCES: 1 Aspden, Harold.

It is highly likely that the entire cosmology that we are discussing was well known by both the Atlanteans and the Ramans during ancient times. Then, roughly 12,000 years ago, a worldwide cataclysm caused the destruction of both civilizations. As the years passed, those who inherited the scientific knowledge would have more and more difficulty seeing “the big picture.” Almost all sacred traditions, including those of the Vedas, insisted that there was a hidden order that unified all aspects of the Universe, and that with sufficient study and visualization of the underlying geometric forms of this order, the mind of the Initiate could be connected with the Oneness of the Universe, enabling great feats of consciousness and mind-over-matter capability to occur. Some of these visualizations took the form of studying mandalas, such as the Sri Yantra formation. Others preferred to engage in dances where the movements and music were in tune with these geometric patterns. Still others preferred to assemble, sculpt and / or draw these forms with a compass and straightedge, hence the importance of the main symbol of the Masonic fraternity, which has the letter “G”, symbolizing “God,” “Geometry” and the “Great Architect of the Universe,” surrounded by a compass above it and a straightedge below it. Pre-Masonic groups such as the Knight Templars chose to encode these geometric relationships into their sacred structures, such as the stained-glass windows in cathedrals. 3.2 SACRED GEOMETRY AND THE PLATONIC SOLIDS Hence, the cornerstone of knowledge for secret mystery schools regarding this hidden order in the Universe has always been sacred geometry. We have written extensively on this subject in both of our previous books, and the reader is encouraged to refer back to them for greater understanding. In short, sacred geometry is simply another form of vibration, or “crystallized music.” Consider the following example: First, we vibrate a guitar string. This creates “standing waves,” meaning waves that do not move back and forth across the string but remain stable in one place. We will see some areas where there is an extreme of vertical movement, representing the top and bottom of the wave, and other areas where there is no vertical movement, known as nodes. The nodes that are formed in any type of standing wave will always be spaced evenly apart from each other, and the speed of the vibration will determine how many nodes will appear. This means that the higher the vibration rises, the more nodes we will see. In two dimensions, we can either use an oscilloscope or vibrate a flat circular"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"“Chladni plate” and see nodes develop that will form common geometric forms such as the square, triangle and hexagon when connected together. This work has been repeated many times by Dr. Hans Jenny, Gerald Hawkins and others. • If the circle has three equally spaced nodes, then they can connect to form a triangle. • If the circle has four equally spaced nodes, it can form a square. • If it has five nodes, it forms a pentagon. • Six nodes form a hexagon, et cetera. Though this is a very simple concept in terms of wave mechanics, Gerald Hawkins was the first to establish mathematically that such geometries inscribed within circles were indeed musical relationships. We may be surprised to realize that he was led to this discovery by analyzing various geometric crop formations that would appear overnight in the fields of the British countryside. This has been covered in both of our previous volumes. The deepest, most revered forms of sacred geometry are three-dimensional, and are known as the Platonic solids. There are only five formations in existence that follow all the needed rules to qualify, and these are the eight- sided octahedron, four-sided tetrahedron, six-sided cube, twelve-sided dodecahedron and twenty-sided icosahedron. Here, the tetrahedron is shown as a “star tetrahedron” or interlaced tetrahedron, meaning that you have two tetrahedra that are joined together in perfect symmetry: OCTOHEDRON STAR TETRAHEDRON CUBE "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"DODECAHEDRON ISOCAHEDRON Figure 3.1 – The five Platonic Solids. Here are some of the main rules for these geometric solids: • Each formation will have the same shape on every side: ◦ equilateral triangle faces on the octahedron, tetrahedron and icosahedron, ◦ square faces on the cube, or ◦ pentagonal faces on the dodecahedron. • Every line on each of the formations will be exactly the same length. • Every internal angle on each of the formations will also be the same. And most importantly, • Each shape will fit perfectly inside of a sphere, all the points touching the edges of the sphere with no overlaps. Similar to the two-dimensional cases involving the triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon inside the circle, the Platonic Solids are simply representations of waveforms in three dimensions. This point cannot be stressed strongly enough. Each tip or vertex of the Platonic Solids touches the surface of a sphere in an area where the vibrations have canceled out to form a node. Thus, what we are seeing is a three-dimensional geometric image of vibration / pulsation. Both the students of Buckminster Fuller and his protégé Dr. Hans Jenny devised clever experiments that showed how the Platonic Solids would form within a vibrating / pulsating sphere. In the experiment conducted by Fuller’s students, a spherical balloon was dipped in dye and pulsed with “pure” sound frequencies, known as the “Diatonic” sound ratios. A small number of evenly- distanced nodes would form across the surface of the sphere, as well as thin lines that connected them to each other. If you have four evenly spaced nodes, you will see a tetrahedron. Six evenly spaced nodes form an octahedron. Eight evenly spaced nodes form a cube. Twenty evenly spaced nodes form the dodecahedron, and twelve evenly spaced nodes form the icosahedron. The straight lines that we see on these geometric objects simply represent the stresses that are created by the “closest distance between two points” for each of the nodes as they distribute themselves across the entire surface of the sphere."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Figure 3.2 – Dr. Hans Jenny’s Platonic Solid formation in spherical vibrating fluid. Dr. Hans Jenny conducted a similar experiment, a small part of which is pictured here in Figure 3.2, wherein a droplet of water contained a very fine suspension of light-colored particles, known as a “colloidal suspension.” When this roughly spherical droplet of particle-filled water was vibrated at various “Diatonic” musical frequencies, the Platonic Solids would appear inside, surrounded by elliptical curving lines that would connect their nodes together, as we see in the picture, where it is clear that there are two tetrahedrons in the central area. If the droplet were a perfect sphere instead of a flattened sphere, then the formations would be even more clearly visible. 3.3 PLATONIC SOLIDS AND “SYMMETRY” IN PHYSICS The mystery and significance of the Platonic Solids has not been completely lost to modern science, as these forms fit all the necessary criteria for creating “symmetry” in physics in many different ways. For this reason, they are often seen in theories that deal with multi-dimensionality, where many “planes” need to intersect in symmetrical ways so that they can be rotated in a number of ways and always remain in the same positions relative to each other. These multi-dimensional theories include “group theory,” also known as “gauge theory,” which consistently features various Platonic models for “infolded” hyperdimensional space. These same “modular functions” are considered to be the most advanced mathematical tools available for the study and understanding of “higher dimensions,” and the “Superstring” theory is entirely built off of them. In short, the Platonic Solids are already known to be the master key to unlock the world of “higher dimensions.” Remember that we have only briefly mentioned the above points, as they have been well-addressed in our previous volumes, and the key is symmetry. When we keep in mind the symmetrical quality of the Solids as we have indicated, Dr. Wolff’s words from"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 entitled On the Importance of Living in Three Dimensions should make good sense to us: Pg. 71 – As your advisor in exploration, I can tell you, “Whenever you see a situation of symmetry in a physical problem, stop and think! Because you will nearly always find an easier way to solve the problem by using the symmetry property.” This is one of the rewards of playing around with symmetry. The ideas are neat... In mathematics and geometry, there is a need to be precise; so there symmetry is defined to mean that a function or a geometric figure remains the same, despite: 1) a rotation of coordinates, 2) movement along an axis, or 3) an interchange of variables. In physical science, which is our main concern, the existence of a symmetry usually means that a law of Nature does not change, despite: 1) a rotation of coordinates in space, 2) movement along an axis through space, 3) changing the past into the future such that t becomes –t, 4) an interchange of two coordinates such as exchanging x with y, z with –z, etc. or, 5) the change of any given variable. [emphasis added] The Platonic Solids have the greatest geometric symmetry of any shapes in existence, though Dr. Wolff does not call them by name here. In the next excerpt from Dr. Aspden, he refers to the Platonic Solid forms in the aether as “fluid crystals,” and explains how they can have an effect similar to a solid, even while they are appearing in a fluidlike medium: ...19th century physicists were puzzled by the aether because it exhibits some properties telling us it is a fluid and some telling us it is a solid. That was the perception from a time when little if anything was known about ‘fluid crystals’. The displays in many pocket calculators use electrical signals and rely on the properties of a substance that, like the aether, exhibits properties characteristic of both the liquid state and the solid state as a function of electric field disturbances. [emphasis added] This gives us a “solid” explanation for why Tesla said that the aether “behaves as a liquid for matter, and as a solid for light and heat. The Platonic Solids actually do act as if they were structural frameworks within the aether, organizing the energy flows into specific patterns. Hence, the Platonic Solids are the simple geometric forms of “crystallized music” that will naturally form themselves in the aether when it pulsates. Another important point to remember is that as the hierarchy of Platonic Solids “grow” into each other, the movement will always occur along spiral pathways, predominantly rooted in the classic “phi” ratio. Torsion waves have been seen to follow the “phi” pattern as well, which shall be more fully explored when we discuss the under-appreciated “pyramid power” phenomenon and the “cavity structural effect” pioneered by Dr. Victor Grebennikov in Chapter Seven. 3.4 MICROCLUSTER PHYSICS Just as we were finishing up the first half of this book, a new associate alerted us to the burgeoning new field of “microcluster physics,” which changes our"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"entire view of the quantum world by presenting us with a whole new phase of matter that does not obey the conventionally accepted “rules.” Microclusters are tiny “particles” that present clear and straightforward evidence that atoms are vortexes in the aether that naturally assemble into Platonic Solid formations by their vibration / pulsation. Furthermore, these new discoveries pose quite a challenge for those who still believe that there must be single electrons orbiting a nucleus instead of standing-wave electron clouds of aetheric energy that assemble into geometric patterns. The story of “microclusters” first broke into the mainstream world in the December 1989 issue of Scientific American, in an article by Michael A. Duncan and Dennis H. Rouvray: Divide and subdivide a solid and the traits of its solidity fade away one by one, like the features of the Cheshire Cat, to be replaced by characteristics that are not those of liquids or gases. They belong instead to a new phase of matter, the micro cluster... They pose questions that lie at the heart of solid-state physics and chemistry, and the related field of material science. How small must an aggregate of particles become before the character of the substance they once formed is lost? How might the atoms reconfigure if freed from the influence of the matter that surrounds them? If the substance is a metal, how small must this cluster of atoms be to avoid the characteristic sharing of free electrons that underlies conductivity? [emphasis added] Less than two years after this story broke in the mainstream, the science of microcluster physics was realized in its own graduate-school textbook authored by Satoru Sugano and Hiroyasu Koizumi. Microcluster Physics was published by the respectable, mainstream Springer-Verlag corporation as volume 21 in a series of texts in the field of materials science.All of the quotes from this text that we shall use are from its revised second edition, which was released in 1998. In Sugano and Koizumi’s text, we are told that with the new discoveries of microclusters, we can now arrange groupings of atoms into four basic categories of size, each with different properties: • Molecules: 1-10 atoms. • Microclusters: 10-1000 atoms. • Fine Particles: 1000-100,000 atoms. • Bulk: 100,000+ atoms. When we study the above list, we would initially expect that microclusters would have traits in common with molecules and with fine particles both, but in fact they have properties that neither display, as Sugano et al. explain here: Microclusters consisting of 10 to 10^3 atoms exhibit neither the properties of the corresponding bulk nor those of the corresponding molecule of a few atoms. The microclusters may be considered to form a new phase of materials lying between macroscopic solids and microscopic particles such as atoms and molecules, showing both macroscopic and microscopic features. However, research into such a new phase has been left untouched until recent years by the development of the quantum theory of matter. [emphasis added] As we continue reading, we learn that microclusters do not form randomly from any group of 10-1000 atoms; only certain “magic numbers” of atoms will gather together to form microclusters. The next quote describes how this was first discovered, and when we read it we should remember that the “mass"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"spectrum” being mentioned describes spectroscope analysis, which we covered in the last chapter. When “cluster beams” are being discussed, this means that atoms (such as Na, or sodium) are being blasted through a tiny nozzle to form into a “beam” that is then analyzed. Most importantly, as the atoms blast out of the nozzle, some of them spontaneously gather into microclusters, which demonstrate anomalous properties: The microscopic features of microclusters were first revealed by observing anomalies of the mass spectrum of a Na [sodium] cluster beam at specific sizes, called magic numbers. Then it was experimentally confirmed that the magic numbers come from the shell structure of valence electrons. Being stimulated by these epoch-making findings in metal microclusters and aided by progress of the experimental techniques producing relatively dense, non- interacting microclusters of various sizes in the form of microcluster beams, the research field of microclusters has developed rapidly in these 5 to 7 years [since the first 1991 edition of the book.] The progress is also due to the improvement of computers and computational techniques... The field of microclusters is attracting the attention of many physicists and chemists (and even biologists!) working in both pure and applied research, as it is interesting not only from the fundamental point of view but also from the viewpoint of applications in electronics, catalysis, ion engineering, carbon- chemical engineering, photography and so on. At this stage of development, it is felt that an introductory book is required for beginners in this field, clarifying fundamental physical concepts important for the study of microclusters. This book is designed to satisfy such a requirement. It is based on series of lectures given to graduate students (mainly in physics) of the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo Institute of Technology and Kyushu University in the period of 1987-1990. [emphasis added] Our next quote comes from the first area in Sugano and Koizumi’s book where specific details are given regarding the highly anomalous physical properties of microclusters. Though they are only slightly smaller than fine particles in terms of the number of atoms, they are much more stable. Here, the greater stability refers to the fact that microclusters burn at a much higher temperature than molecules or fine particles of the same elements. According to David Hudson, (whom we shall discuss later,) Russian scientists were the first to discover that microclusters must be burned for more than 200 seconds to reveal a color spectrum to be analyzed, whereas all other known molecular compounds burn up in a maximum of about 70 seconds: When we arrive at the fragment called microcluster with a radius of the order of 10 angstroms by further dividing fine particles, we see that we have to use physics different from that for fine particles.The essential difference is derived from the theoretical postulate, partly supported by experiments, that microclusters of a given shape and size can, in principle, be extracted and their properties can be measured, even though this kind of measurement is impossible for fine particles. This postulate may be justified by considering the fact that clusters of a given regular shape are very stable as compared with those of the other shapes, the number of which is rather small. In contrast to this fact, fine particles of different shapes and a fixed size forming a big ensemble to allow a statistical treatment are nearly degenerate in energy. This makes impossible the extraction of fine particles of a given shape."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Clear-cut evidence has been obtained such that microclusters of alkali [1.8] and noble [1.9] metal elements in the form of a cluster beam have a nearly spherical shape at the size of the so-called magic numbers. A magic number means a specific size N [i.e. the number of atoms in the cluster] where anomalies of abundance in the mass spectra are found. This indicates that microclusters of those sizes are relatively stable as compared with those of neighboring sizes. [emphasis added] The “nearly spherical” shapes that are described above will be seen in later quotes as the Platonic Solids and related geometries. Our next passage is probably too technical for most readers and can be skipped over, but it is a clear-cut description of how the “cluster beams” are being made and analyzed and what specific “magic numbers” of atoms emerged. Furthermore, we should note that the clusters that are formed become electrically neutral, which is another anomalous and unexpected result: As an example, we show the mass spectrum of the Na cluster beam in Fig. 1.5. The beam is produced by the adiabatic expansion of a heated Na and Ar gas mixture through a nozzle. The Na clusters in the beam are photoionized, mass analyzed by a quadrupole mass analyzer, and finally detected by an ion-detection system. Detailed examinations of the experiment verify that the mass spectrum thus observed reflects that of [electrically] neutral clusters originally produced by the jet expansion. The anomalies of abundance of the size N, being 8, 20, 40, 58 and 93 (Fig. 1.5), are regarded as the magic numbers of neutral Na clusters. [emphasis added] Now pay very close attention to the next sentence, as its significance can easily be missed: In what follows, we shall show that these magic numbers are associated with the shell structure of valence electrons moving independently in a spherically symmetric effective potential... [emphasis added] What this is telling us is that the hypothetical “electrons” are no longer bound to their individual atoms in microclusters, but rather move independently throughout the entire cluster itself! Remember that in our new quantum model, there are no electrons, only clouds of aetheric energy that are flowing in towards the nucleus via the Biefield-Brown effect. In this case, the microcluster acts as one single atom, with the center of the cluster becoming akin to the positively-charged atomic nucleus where the negatively-charged energy is flowing in. Interestingly, in keeping with the fluidlike behaviors of the aether, the next passage suggests that the microclusters can have properties similar to a fluid as well as a solid: [The symmetry of] metal microclusters seems to reveal that microclusters belong to the microscopic world like atoms and molecules, whereas fine particles belong to the macroscopic world. This is true in some aspects, but not so in every aspect. In Chap. 2 we shall discuss that, at finite internal temperatures, microclusters may reveal the liquid phase as encountered in the macroscopic world... [emphasis added] The next excerpt comes from a completely different study by Besley et al., referenced at the end of this chapter, entitled Theoretical Study of the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Structures and Stabilities of Iron Clusters. Obviously, their work builds directly off of Sugano and Koizumi’s textbook and the findings that went into its production. Here, the key is that Besley et al.’s research points to anomalous electrical and magnetic properties possessed by microclusters that are not seen either in molecules or in condensed matter: Clusters are also of interest in their own right, since for small clusters there is the possibility of finite size effects leading to electronic, magnetic or other properties which are quite different from those of molecules or condensed matter. There has also been a considerable research effort into understanding the geometries, stabilities and reactivities of gas phase bare metal clusters from a theoretical viewpoint. [emphasis added] And now, as we skip ahead to page 11 of Sugano et al.’s microcluster physics textbook, we come to section 1.3.1 entitled Fundamental Polyhedra. This is where the connection between microclusters and the geometry of Johnson’s physics becomes readily apparent: Recently, it has been discussed [1.12] that stable shapes of microclusters are given by Plato’s five polyhedra; the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, pentagonal dodecahedron, icosahedron, [i.e., the Platonic Solids]; and Keplers’ two polyhedra of rhombic faces; the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron... It is very important to note that tetrahedra are not space-filling, as shown in Fig. 1.9, and icosahedra, trigonal decahedra and pentagonal dodecahedra with five-fold rotational symmetry are non-crystalline structures: they do not grow into the periodic structure of the bulk. If the polyhedron is a non-crystalline structure, then the microcluster has to undergo a phase transition to a crystalline structure on the way of growing into the bulk. [emphasis added] For one who has studied sacred geometry for many years, it is amazing to consider that at a level far too tiny for the naked eye, atoms are grouping together into perfect Platonic Solid formations. It is also interesting to consider that some of these microclusters also have fluidlike qualities, allowing them to flow from one type of geometric structure into another. In their text, Sugano and Koizumi have assumed that certain polyhedra such as the icosahedron and dodecahedron are non-crystalline, and must therefore undergo a phase change before they could become a larger crystallized object. However, later in this chapter we will present hard, irrefutable evidence that the entire model of crystallography is flawed, and that under certain circumstances, formations very similar to microclusters can be formed at larger levels of size, from two or more atomic elements grouped together. Importantly, as the reader thumbs through the rest of Sugano et al.’s textbook, scores of diagrams of atoms grouped into Platonic Solids are seen. We learn that the “magic number” groupings of atoms will, in every case, form into one of the geometric structures mentioned above. If we took a tetrahedron, for example, and constructed it out of a certain number of marbles that all had an equal width, then we would need an exact “magic” number of marbles to construct a tetrahedron of a given size. This is the same as Buckminster Fuller’s model of “close-packed spheres,” and in its simplest form is expressed by seeing that if you put three marbles together into a triangle and then place a fourth marble above it in the middle, you will see a"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"tetrahedron form. Even more interestingly, on page 18 of the Microcluster Physics textbook, Sugano et al. have a photograph of a gold cluster consisting of “about 460” atoms, where we can clearly see the close-packed sphere structure of the atoms inside, forming unmistakable geometry. These images are taken by a scanning electron microscope at very high magnification, and the structure of the cuboctahedron geometry [Fig. 3.3, L] is clearly visible in a series of different angles. Interestingly, the cluster is seen to undergo different geometric changes from the cuboctahedron to other forms in its structure from image to image, again suggesting a fluidlike quality, and unseen “stresses” in the aether at work. Figure 3.3 is an artist-rendered diagram of how the “magic number” of 459 spherical atoms will pack together to form a cuboctahedron-shaped cluster, whereas 561 atoms will cluster into the form of an icosahedron. Figure 3.3 - Cuboctahedral cluster of 459 atoms (L) and Icosahedral cluster of 561 atoms (R) Our next quote comes from section 3 of Besley et al.’s study, which discusses the “jellium” model and makes it very clear that the individual nature of the atoms in a microcluster is lost in favor of a group behavior. Again we will see the mentioning of magic numbers and of electrons moving through the entire structure instead of just through their parent atom; we also see the hypothesis that “geometric shells” of electrons are somehow formed in the microcluster. For small clusters of simple metals, such as the alkali metals, mass spectroscopic studies have indicated the presence of preferred nuclearities or “magic numbers” corresponding to particularly intense peaks. These experiments led to the development of the (spherical) jellium model, wherein the actual cluster geometry (i.e. the nuclear coordinates) are unknown and unimportant (perhaps because the clusters are molten or rapidly fluxional)"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"and the cluster valence electrons are assumed to move in a spherically average central potential. The jellium model therefore explains cluster magic numbers in terms of the filling of cluster electronic shells, which are analogous to the electronic shells in atoms. For somewhat larger nuclearities (N ~ 100 -1500 [total atoms in the cluster,]) there are periodic oscillations in mass spectral peak intensities which have been attributed to the bunching together of electronic shells into supershells. The observation of long period oscillations in the intensities of peaks in the mass spectra of very large metal clusters (with up to 10^5 atoms) has led to the conclusion that such clusters grow via the formation of 3-dimensional geometric shells of atoms and that for these nuclearities it is the filling of geometric rather than electronic shells that imparts extra cluster stability. Certainly, the idea of “supershells” of electrons suggests a fluidlike blending together of atoms in the quantum realm. Again, it appears that the entire idea of electrons is flawed, since the next passage from Besley et al., tells us that the “jellium” model where “particle” electrons fill up into “geometric shells” does not work for what are known as transition metals. Since there can be no individual electrons at this point, Besley et al. hypothesize the existence of “explicit angular-dependent many-body forces.” In short, a “fluid crystal” aetheric quantum model is essentially required to explain the forcesthat create microclusters: For transition metals there is no clear evidence that the jellium model holds, even for low nuclearities... we would hope that a model which introduces explicit angular-dependent many-body forces (as in the MM [Murrell-Mottram] model that we have adopted) will fare better at explaining cluster structure preferences. As we think through the results of these microcluster studies, we must not forget that the Platonic Solids are very easily formed by vibrating a spherical area of fluid. It is quite surprising that the microcluster researchers do not appear to have noticed this connection. The prevailing view of quantum mechanics as a particle phenomenon has such a strong hold on the minds of scientific researchers that elaborate explanations involving “geometric shells” of electrons must be invoked. The key question that must be addressed is how and why this geometry would form – and the idea of a vibrating, fluidlike quantum medium is by far the simplest answer. A microcluster is simply a larger “aetheric atom” in a perfect geometric form. 3.5 DAVID HUDSON AND “ORMUS ELEMENTS” KNOWN ORMUS ELEMENTS Element Atomic Number Cobalt 27 Nickel 28 Copper 29 Ruthenium 44 Rhodium"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"45 Palladium 46 Silver 47 Osmium 76 Iridium 77 Platinum 78 Gold 79 Mercury 80 Table 3.1 – Known Metallic Microclusters or “Ormus” Elements in David Hudson’s patent. Next, we introduce the work of David Hudson, who discovered a substance that turned out to contain microclusters in a goldmine on his property in the late 1970s. He spent several million dollars having these mysterious materials analyzed and tested in various ways, and in 1989 Hudson patented his microcluster discovery by naming them Orbitally Rearranged Monatomic Elements, or “ORMEs.” [The name is usually changed to “Ormus” or “M-state” elements when discussed online so as not to interfere with Hudson’s copyrights.] Hudson displays a broad knowledge of microcluster physics in his published lectures from the early 1990s, but his findings are more controversial than what we find in Sugano et al.’s textbook or other published mainstream sources. Hudson’s patent focuses on the microcluster structures he found in the following precious metal elements. (We should note here that Sugano and Koizumi have established that microclusters have been found in non-metallic elements as well.) Hudson found that all of the above microcluster metals exist plentifully in sea water. Even more surprisingly, Hudson discovered that these elements in the microcluster state may be up to 10,000 times more abundant on Earth than in their common metallic state. Hudson’s research demonstrated that these metallic microclusters are found throughout many different biological systems, including many different plants, and that they form up to 5% of the material in a calf’s brain by weight. Furthermore, they act as room-temperature superconductors, have superfluid qualities and levitate in the presence of magnetic fields, since no magnetic energy is able to penetrate through their outer shells. Their physical qualities match the descriptions of various materials in alchemical traditions from China, India, Persia and Europe. Various people have volunteered to ingest gold microclusters or “monatomic gold,” and have reported experiencing the same psychic effects as the kundalini changes noted in the Vedic scriptures of ancient India. Even more controversial are Hudson’s patented discoveries surrounding the heating of iridium microclusters. As the material is heated, its weight is seen to increase by 300 percent or more. Even more surprisingly, as microcluster iridium is heated to 850 degrees Celsius, the material disappears from physical view and loses all of its weight. However, when the temperature is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"again reduced, the microcluster iridium will reappear and regain most of its former weight. In Hudson’s patent, he has a chart that was generated by thermo-gravimetric analysis that shows this effect in action. The idea of a material gaining weight, then spontaneously losing weight and disappearing from all physical view is no longer out of place when we combine Kozyrev’s findings with Ginzburg’s changes to conventional relativity equations and Mishin and Aspden’s discoveries of multiple densities of aether. In the first chapter, Kozyrev showed how the heating or cooling of an object can affect its weight in subtle but measurable ways. We also saw that these weight increases and decreases occur in sudden “quantized” bursts, not in a smooth, flowing fashion. Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg suggested that an object’s mass is converted into pure field as it approaches the speed of light, and Mishin and Aspden’s data suggests that the mass is actually moving into a higher density of aetheric energy. Thus, Hudson’s observed and patented effects with microcluster iridium provide the first major proof in this volume for the idea that an object can be completely displaced into a higher density of aetheric energy. In the case of microcluster iridium, it would seem that the geometric structure of the microcluster allows for heat energy to be harnessed much more efficiently. This harnessing of the vibrations of heat then creates extreme resonance at a lower relative temperature, bringing the internal vibrations of the iridium past the speed of light. (These internal vibrations may already be relatively close to the speed of light before such added resonance is introduced, due to the speed at which aether flows through the atomic “vortex” of negative electron clouds and the positive nucleus.) Then, when the threshold point of light-speed is finally reached, the aetheric energy of the iridium is displaced into a higher density, thus causing it to disappear from measurable view. When the temperature is reduced, the iridium again displaces back down into our own density, since the pressure that was holding it in the higher density has now been eliminated. 3.6 ANOMALIES OF CRYSTAL FORMATION Now that we have covered the anomalous area of microclusters, we are ready to tackle the more conventionally understood problems of crystal formation. Common table salt is a perfect example of how two different elements, sodium and chloride, can bond together and form a Platonic Solid geometry, in this case the cube. Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom form together in the shape of a tetrahedron to create the water molecule, (which is not a crystal in the liquid state but has a tetrahedral molecule,) and fluorite crystals form the octahedron. Crystals that form with these properties will maintain the same orientation throughout themselves, and are symmetrical. A more technical description is that crystals are “solids which have flat surfaces (facets) that intersect at characteristic angles, and are ordered at a microscopic level.” Our key question to remember here would be, “Why do spherical energy vortexes end up joining together in these characteristic geometric angles and patterns?” The answer, of course, shall be found in our understanding of the Platonic Solids as “harmonic” energy structures in the aether. Glusker & Trueblood’s classical definition for how crystals are formed is that they are produced by:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"...a regularly repeating arrangement of atoms. Any crystal may be regarded as being built up by the continuing three-dimensional translational repetition of some basic structural pattern. [emphasis added] The term “translation” means that we rotate a specific object by an exact number of degrees, such as 180, which would form a “two-fold” crystal since there are two such translations in a 360-degree circle. Thus, “translational repetition” means that that the basic structural element (atom or molecular group of atoms) making up a crystal can be rotated again and again in the same way to form the repeated pattern. The technical term for such a regular arrangement of atoms is periodicity, which means that a crystal is made up of “some basic structural unit which repeats itself infinitely in all directions, filling up all of space” within itself. The same structure (atom or group of atoms) keeps repeating in the same, periodic way, hence the term periodicity. In this classical theory of “periodic” crystal formation, each atom retains its original size and shape and does not affect any of the other atoms except for those it is directly bonded to. It is important to realize that the model of periodicity worked very well in crystallography. Any type of crystal that had been discovered could be analyzed with this method, and the angles between all of the facets could be predicted based on simple geometric principles. Then in 1912, Max von Laue discovered a way to use X-rays to illuminate the inner structure of crystals, creating what is known as a “diffraction diagram.” The diagram appears as an arrangement of single points of light on a black background. This led to a whole science of X-ray crystallography that was formalized by William H. and William L. Bragg, where the points of light are analyzed geometrically in relation to each other in order to determine what the structure of the true crystal actually is. For seventy years after this technology was developed, every diffraction diagram that had ever been observed by mainstream scientists fit the periodicity model perfectly, which led to the inevitable and apparently quite simple conclusion that all crystals were an arrangement of single atoms as structural units. One of the periodicity model’s most straightforward mathematical rules is that a crystal can only have 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotations (translations.) In this model, if you have a crystal that is indeed made of single atoms or molecules in a repeating, periodic structure, the crystal cannot have a five-fold rotation or any rotation higher than 6. Atoms are “supposed” to retain their own individual point-like identities and not merge with other atoms into a larger whole. Nevertheless, in terms of pure geometry, the dodecahedron has 5-fold symmetry and the icosahedron has 5- and 10-fold symmetry. These Platonic Solids fit all the requirements for symmetry as outlined by Dr. Wolff earlier in this chapter, but you simply cannot pack single atoms together to make either of these shapes. So again, the dodecahedron and icosahedron have symmetry, but they do not have periodicity as crystal formations. Therefore, there was no provision in science to believe that either of these forms would appear as a molecular, crystalline structure – it was “impossible.” Or so they thought... Now enter the infamous Roswell crash. According to former Groom Lake / Area 51 employee Edgar Fouche, molecular structures were found on the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"recovered hardware that did not fit the conventional model of crystalline periodicity. These became known as “quasi-crystals,” short for “quasi-periodic crystals.” Both the icosahedron and dodecahedron have appeared in these unique alloys. Similar to microclusters but on a larger level of size, these quasi-crystals were discovered to have many strange properties, such as extreme strength, extreme resistance to heat and being non-conductive to electricity, even if the metals involved in their creation would normally act as conductors! (This will be explained as we progress.) Unlike microclusters, which only appear to be able to be formed individually from “cluster beams”, quasi-crystals can be grouped together into usable alloys. Fouche states the following on his website, with our added emphasis: I’ve held positions within the USAF that required me to have Top Secret and ‘Q’ Clearances and Top Secret-Crypto access clearances... In the mess hall at [the top-secret] Groom [Lake facility,] I heard words like Lorentz Forces, pulse detonation, cyclotron radiation, quantum flux transduction field generators, quasi-crystal energy lens and EPR quantum receivers. I was told that quasi-crystals were the key to a whole new field of propulsion and communication technologies. To this day I’d be hard pressed to explain to you the unique electrical, optical and physical properties of quasi-crystals and why so much of the research is classified... Fourteen years of quasi-crystal research has established the existence of a wealth of stable and meta-stable quasi-crystals with five-, eight-, ten- and twelve-fold symmetry, with strange structures [such as the dodecahedron and icosahedron] and interesting properties. New tools had to be developed for the study and description of these extraordinary materials. I’ve discovered that the classified research has shown that quasi-crystals are promising candidates for high energy storage materials, metal matrix components, thermal barriers, exotic coatings, infrared sensors, high power laser applications and electro-magnetics. Some high strength alloys and surgical tools are already on the market. [Note: Wilcock was personally told in 1993 that Teflon and Kevlar are both reverse-engineered.] One of the stories I was told more than once was that one of the crystal pairs used in the propulsion of the Roswell crash was a Hydrogen Crystal. Until recently, creating a Hydrogen crystal was beyond the reach of our scientific capabilities. That has now changed. In one Top Secret Black Program, under the DOE, a method to produce hydrogen crystals was discovered, [and] then manufacturing began in 1994. The lattice of hydrogen quasi-crystals, and another material not named, formed the basis for the plasma shield propulsion of the Roswell craft and was an integral part of the bio-chemically engineered vehicle. A myriad of advanced crystallography undreamed of by scientists were discovered by the scientists and engineers who evaluated, analyzed and attempted to reverse engineer the technology presented with the Roswell vehicle and eight more vehicles which have crashed since then. Arguably after 35 years of secret research on the Roswell hardware, those"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"who had recovered these technologies still had hundreds if not thousands of unanswered questions about what they had found, and it was deemed “safe” to quietly introduce “quasi-crystals” to the non-initiated scientific world. There are now literally thousands of different references to quasi-crystals on the Internet, completely separate from any mention of microclusters. (Not a single scientific study that we have been able to find online mentions both microclusters and quasi-crystals in the same document.) Many of the quasi- crystal references are from companies that are government contractors, and it is very easy to see that they are being studied with widespread intensity. However, they are almost never mentioned in the general media, even though they present such a unique challenge to our prevailing theories of quantum physics. The research goes on, but it is with a very subdued excitement. Dan Schechtman was given the honor / duty of having “discovered” (or being allowed to re-discover) quasi-crystals on April 8, 1982 with an Aluminum- Manganese alloy (Al6Mn) that began in a molten liquid state and was then cooled off very quickly. Crystals in the shape of an icosahedron were produced, as determined by the X-ray diffraction diagram that was seen, similar to the image below. Schechtman’s data was not even published until November 1984! In the image to the right of Figure 3.4, we can clearly see a number of pentagons, indicating the five-fold symmetry of the icosahedron: Figure 3.4 – The Icosahedron (L) and its X-ray diffraction diagram from a quasi-crystal formation (R). As we said, with the advent of quasi-crystals, both the dodecahedron and icosahedron appear, along with other unusual geometric forms, completing the appearance of all five of the Platonic Solids in the molecular realm in some way. Both the dodecahedron and icosahedron possess elements of five- fold symmetry with their pentagonal structures. Figure 3.5, from An Pang Tsai of NRIM in Tsukuba, Japan, shows an Aluminum-Copper-Iron quasi-crystal alloy in the shape of a dodecahedron and an Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt alloy in the shape of a decagonal (10-sided) prism:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Figure 3.5 – Dodecahedral (L) and decagonal prism (R) quasi-crystals created by An Pang Tsai of NRIM. The problem here is that you cannot create such crystals by using single atoms bound together, yet as we can see in the photographs, they are very real. The key problem for scientists, then, is how to explain and define the process by which these crystals are forming. According to A.L. Mackay, one of the ways to include five-fold symmetry in a crystallographic definition is “Abandonment of Atomicity:” Fractal structures with five-fold axes everywhere require that atoms of finite size be abandoned. This is not a rational assumption to the crystallographers of the world, but the mathematicians are free to explore it. [emphasis added] What this suggests is that similar to microclusters, quasi-crystals appear to not have individual atoms anymore, but rather that the atoms have merged into a unity throughout the entire crystal. While this may seem impossible for crystallographers to believe, it is actually among the simplest of A.L. Mackay’s four potential solutions to the problem, as it involves simple three-dimensional geometry and correlates with our microcluster observations. Again, since the crystals are very real, the only major hurdle to cross is our fixation on the belief that atoms are made of particles. Another related example is seen with the Bose-Einstein Condensate, which was first theorized in 1925 by Albert Einstein and Satyendranath Bose, and was first demonstrated in a gas in 1995. In short, a Bose-Einstein Condensate is a large group of atoms that behaves as if it were one single “particle,” with each constituent atom appearing to simultaneously occupy all of space and all of time throughout the entire structure. All the atoms are measured to vibrate at the exact same frequency and travel at the same speed, and all appear to be located in the same area of space. Rigorously, the various parts of the system act as a unified whole, losing all signs of individuality. It is this very property that is required for a “superconductor” to exist. (A superconductor is a substance that conducts electricity with no loss of current.) Typically, the Bose-Einstein condensate is only able to be formed at extremely low temperatures. However, we seem to be observing a similar process occurring in microclusters and quasi-crystals, where there is no longer a"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"sense of individual atomic identity. Interestingly, yet another similar process is at work with laser light, known as “coherent” light. In the case of the laser, the entire light beam behaves as if it were one single “photon” in space and time – there is no way to differentiate individual photons in the laser beam. It is interesting to note that lasers, superconductors and quasi-crystals were all found in recovered ET technologies since the 1940s. This obviously introduces a whole new world of quantum physics to the discussion table. In time, it appears that quasi-crystals and Bose-Einstein condensates will be much more widely used and understood as examples of how we had gone astray in our “particle”-based quantum thinking. Furthermore, British physicist Herbert Froehlich proposed in the late 1960’s that living systems frequently behave as Bose-Einstein condensates, suggesting a larger-scale order that is at work. We will discuss this in later chapters that will deal with aetheric biology."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Figure 3.6 – Dan Winter’s reprint of Sir William Crookes’ geometric Table of the Elements. Our next question concerns the “electron clouds” that have been seen in the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"atom. Both Rod Johnson and Dan Winter have noted that the teardrop-shaped “electron clouds” in the atom will all fit perfectly together with the faces of the Platonic Solids. Winter refers to the electron clouds as “vortex cones,” and Figure 3.6 is an unfortunately illegible copy of the Periodic Table of the Elements as originally devised by Sir William Crookes, a well-known and highly respected scientist from the early 20th century who later became an investigator into the field of parapsychology. At the bottom of the image, we see an illustration of how the “vortex cones” fit on each face of the Platonic Solids. (It appears that a more legible copy of Figure 3.5 may exist in one of Winter’s earlier books. Some of the element names can be made out when viewing the image at full size, and the others can be inferred by their position relative to the known Periodic Table of the Elements. The chart is obviously read from the top down, and the first element that is written out below the two circles in the center is Helium, and the line then moves to each successive element. The scale to the left is a series of degree measurements, beginning with 0 at the top line and counting by units of 10° for each line. The degree numbers written in on the scale are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400. This appears to indicate that Sir Crookes’ theory involved set angular rotations or translations of the elements in terms of their geometry as we move from one element to the next. We can see that the wave is mostly straight, but at times there are “dips” in the line that appear to correspond to larger angular rotations that must be made.) If we think back to what Dr. Aspden wrote about Platonic Solids in the aether, he stated that they act as “fluid crystals,” meaning that they can behave as a solid and as a liquid at the same time. Thus, once we understand that electron clouds are all being positioned by invisible Platonic Solids, it becomes much easier to see how crystals are being formed and even how quasi-crystals could be made. There are “nests” of Platonic Solids in the atom, one solid for each major sphere in the “nest”, just as there are “nests” of electron clouds at different levels of valence that all co-exist. The Platonic Solids form an energetic structure and framework that the aetheric energy must flow through as it rushes towards the low-pressure positive center of the atom. Thus, we see each face of the Solids acting as a funnel that the flowing energy must pass through, creating what Winter called “vortex cones.” With the necessary context in place, Johnson’s concepts of Platonic symmetry within the structure of atoms and molecules in the next chapter should not seem as strange to us now as they would to most people. Given what we have seen with the comprehensive research that has gone on, especially with quasi-crystal engineering, it appears that this information is already in use by humanity in certain circles.

The Biefield-Brown effect proves that the grand solution to the mystery of “charge polarity” is that aetheric energy is flowing through the electron clouds into the nucleus. Dr. Ginzburg made a few simple and acceptable adjustments to relativity equations and produced a model that perfectly explains the behaviors of matter observed by Kozyrev in the laboratory, wherein it sheds energy and mass as it is accelerated towards the speed of light. Through the conventional crystal molecule formations of the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron, and especially with the introduction of microclusters, icosahedral and dodecahedral quasi-crystals and the phenomenon of Bose- Einstein condensates, we now see the importance of Platonic Solids in the quantum realm. We can no longer deny that these forces exist, as we now have irrefutable physical evidence. These new findings also reveal that we no longer need to think of atoms as individual units, but rather as harmonic aether vortexes that can merge together into greater levels of unity and coherence, such as in quasi-crystals. And with this data in place, we now have a valid solution for all the “loose ends” of the puzzle by introducing the work of Rod Johnson. 4.1 BASICS OF JOHNSON’S “SEQUENTIAL PHYISCS” What we ultimately see in Johnson’s model is the following: • There are no “hard” particles, only groupings of energy. • Every quantum measurement can be explained geometrically, as a form of structured, intersecting energy fields. • Atoms are actually counter-rotating energy forms in the shape of the Platonic Solids, specifically rooted in the counter-rotation of the octahedron and tetrahedron, each vibrational / pulsational shape corresponding to a different major density of aether. • All levels of density or dimensions in the entire Universe are structured from these two primary levels of aether, which are continually interacting with each other. Significantly, an increasing number of advanced theorists have already been striving towards a “particle mesh” model of physics, based on the Superstring theory, where all matter in the Universe is somehow an element of an interconnected geometric matrix. However, since conventional scientists have not yet visualized Platonic Solids that are nested within each other, sharing a common axis and capable of counter-rotating, they have missed the picture for the quantum realm. Again, in this chapter we will try to keep things simple by presenting an overview of Johnson’s model for “what’s going on” in the quantum level first, and then discuss the scientific evidence to prove it afterwards. We begin our outline of the core principles of the model with a pencil-shaded illustration of the interlaced tetrahedron, which we created to show very clearly what it"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"looks like as a three-dimensional sculpture. It is important that we have a good visual image of this structure before we try to imagine an octahedron that fits inside of it. We can clearly see that there are two tetrahedrons in the image, one with the tip pointing upwards and another with the tip pointing downwards. Also remember that it fits perfectly inside a sphere: Figure 4.1 – The interlaced tetrahedron. With this structure in mind, consider the following points of the model: • The tetrahedron and octahedron are counter-rotating within each other at the quantum level. • Both have spherical symmetry around a shared center. • The tetrahedron and octahedron represent two primary levels of aether density that must exist in the Universe, which we shall refer to as A1 and A2. • The octahedral field fits perfectly in the center of the tetrahedral field, and is therefore smaller in diameter, as we can see in the next diagram:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Figure 4.2 – The octahedron (R) and its fit inside the interlaced tetrahedron (L). Figure 4.2 shows us the octahedron inside of the interlaced tetrahedron, which in turn is inside the cube. It is quite confusing at first to try to imagine the octahedron being a free agent that can counter-rotate inside the interlaced tetrahedron. Indeed, in this form, the two geometries are completely balanced and integrated. However, the most important part of Johnson’s physics is to see that the octahedron is “detached,” acting separately from the tetrahedral field, by rotating in the opposite direction. There are only eight possible “phase” positions that the two geometries can fit into before they again reach the harmony that we see above. In order to have a phase position, the two geometries must have some degree of direct contact with each other, such as line to line or point to point. This is graphically illustrated in the next “phase” diagram: Figure 4.3 – The eight “phase positions” created by the counter-rotating octahedron and tetrahedron. What we see in this diagram are two basic waves: the smaller wave that fits in each of the four main circles, representing the rotation of the octahedron, and the larger wave outside the main circle boundaries as the counter-rotation of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"the tetrahedron. This diagram is by far the easiest way to show how and where the tetrahedron and octahedron will connect, and it is based on the science of “phase physics,” which was first pioneered by Kenneth Geddes Wilson as a means of mapping out large-scale geometric relationships as wave motions. Each of the eight “phase positions” represents a different element, and this is shown in the next figure: Figure 4.4 – The eight “phase positions” as they relate to basic crystal structures formed by the elements. So, to continue: • The tetrahedron and octahedron are both under high pressure – the tetrahedron is pushing in towards the octahedron, much as the negative electron clouds press in towards the nucleus. • This pressure can only be released when either a node or line on one of the solids crosses a node or line on the other solid, opening up a gateway for the energy to flow. The easiest way to visualize such a “gateway” opening would be if you cut out a hole in a piece of cardboard, and then turned on a hair dryer and held the nozzle flat against the cardboard, then sliding it towards the hole. Until the nozzle actually reached the hole, the air has nowhere to go, and the engine will quickly run hard and overheat; but once the nozzle reaches the hole, the air has somewhere to go and the pressure is released, with the engine then relaxing. Inside the atom, via the Biefield-Brown effect, the pressure in the electron clouds is always trying to rush towards the nucleus, and unless the counter-rotating geometries connect, that pressure is blocked. In this sense, the lines and nodes in the geometric forms could be seen as the “holes” that are “popped” in the nested spherical fields, which will allow the in-streaming pressure to flow through. This solves one “pressure” problem, but we must also remember the pressure that is created by the counter-rotating forces of the tetrahedron and octahedron. (These are the geometries that form in the “field bubbles” of what we shall now call aether 1 (A1) and aether 2 (A2) respectively. Ancient traditions often referred to A1 and A2 as “positive and negative force.”) Until the greatest number of “holes” have lined up between both geometries at the octave point of geometric balance, the full amount of outside pressure cannot flow towards the center. So, when the two forms “lock” together in valence"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"periods that are not at the “octave” point, the counter-rotation of A1 and A2 is not fully balanced, causing additional pressure and lack of symmetry. A1 and A2 will then remain “stuck” in that unbalanced position if they are undisturbed by outside energy. Most of the elements on D. Mendeleyev’s Periodic Table of the Elements are “stuck” in this manner, and therefore unstable. In this case, all naturally- occurring, non-radioactive elements are organized from left to right on the table in groups of eight. They move from a position of instability and lack of symmetry on the left to a position greater crystalline symmetry and geometric balance on the right. In Johnson’s model, it is only when we move to the Octave or eighth phase position of counter-rotation that the geometries again regain their perfect balance. This can be visualized with the idea of sitting on a narrow stool. Obviously, the most comfortable sitting position is when your body is centered in the middle. Now simply picture trying to sit on the stool with eight different positions, starting out with only a small part of one of your legs contacting the stool. Each position will be uncomfortable, and you will not be truly in balance until you are sitting completely centered on the stool. Thus, atoms and molecules that are not in such a state of balance are considered as “unstable” and will easily bond with other unstable atoms and molecules that hold the missing energy, in order to create equilibrium. 4.2 ‘COVALENT’ BONDING The first form of bonding that can occur is known as covalent bonding. This name is used since the “valence bonds” of electron clouds are believed to be “shared” between the atoms in question. As we said, there are no true “electrons,” and it is the completion of geometric symmetry between A1 and A2, the nested tetrahedron and octahedron, that forms this bond. All elements are simply different proportional mixtures of A1 and A2, the nested tetrahedron and octahedron locked in different positions relative to each other, in Johnson’s model. The simplest example of this is that a single oxygen atom will naturally be attracted to two single hydrogen atoms to mutually blend into a water molecule, or H2O. Not surprisingly, the water molecule is shaped in the form of a tetrahedron. In later chapters on biology we will see the interesting possibilities that arise as a result of this unique structure. 4.3 ‘IONIC’ BONDING The other option for basic bonding in chemistry is known as “ionic bonding.” In this case, the bonding is created by a difference in charge polarity, where a negative attracts a positive. When an element has an unbalanced charge, it is known as an ion, hence the term ionic bonding. The simplest example would be with sodium chloride or salt, which can be written as Na+Cl-, and forms either a cube or octahedron. The pressure difference between the positive and negative ions is what attracts them together in this case. The chlorine atoms are 1.81 angstroms wide in the salt molecule, almost twice as large as the sodium atoms at 0.97 angstroms. Ionic bonding can also occur when individual atoms of a particular element are attracted to each other and bond together two-by-two, thus creating"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"symmetry. The most basic example of this is a molecule of oxygen gas, written as O2. The only way that early (al)chemists were able to find these core elements such as the single oxygen atom were by disrupting basic chemical compounds through processes such as burning, freezing, mixing with acids and bases, et cetera. 4.4 FREQUENCY EXPANSIONS AND CONTRACTIONS So, returning to the main point, we have eight basic positions or phases in which the tetrahedron and octahedron can be located. However, any astute reader will have already seen that eight basic geometric positions are clearly not enough to form the entire Periodic Table; there must be some additional properties at work in order to produce the complete set of natural elements. Figure 4.5 – Frequency contraction of tetrahedron (L) into octahedron (R). Here is the key: Both geometric forms are also capable of expanding and contracting from their centers. This is referred to as a change in their frequency. When they change frequency, they form different types of geometric solids. These solids are not just Platonics, but can be other forms as well, such as the Archimedean solids – and they are all interrelated by the “parent” tetrahedron and octahedron formations. As seen in Figure 4.5, contracting a geometric shape is as simple as bisecting each of its lines into two or more equal-sized lengths and then connecting the dots together. When we divide each line into two pieces, this is called a “second-frequency” division, whereas dividing each line into three pieces would be called a “third-frequency” division. Starting with the tetrahedron, Buckminster Fuller demonstrated that a total of ten different frequencies (geometric shapes) could be created by this process of frequency expansion or contraction – and this is a central aspect of Johnson’s findings. For"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"example, the “strong” force in the atomic nucleus is known to be exactly ten times more powerful than the “weak” force in the electron clouds! (This is usually written as the square root of 100, which is 10.) No other plausible explanation for this anomaly has ever been advanced. Here, the nucleus represents the point of the greatest “infolded” geometry at the highest frequency level of contraction. So, what we need to do is to combine the eight basic phases of counter- rotating geometry with the various frequencies of geometry that can emerge from expansion and contraction. With this in mind, the entire Periodic Table can be rendered – and ultimately you can predict whether the element will be a solid, liquid or gas, and what its freezing, melting and vaporization points will be. Johnson directs interested thinkers to the work of James Carter, who was able to render the entire Periodic Table through diagrams of spiraling motion that he called “circlons.” Most interestingly, Carter’s “circlons” are spherical torus formations! Carter didn’t appear to know what the spiraling, curly, cyclical “rotations within rotations” were that he was diagramming between the circlons to show the various elements, simply that they had to exist by “absolute motion.” For a more complete description we invite the reader to peruse our detailed interview article and / or his website. In order to keep our thoughts simple for the purpose of this book, we will now simply point out some of the most obvious signs from quantum physics that Platonic geometries are indeed at work. 4.5 PLANCK’S CONSTANT AND THE ‘QUANTIZED’ NATURE OF LIGHT Most of us already know that heat radiation and light are considered to be caused by the same thing – the passage of bursts of electromagnetic energy known as “photons.” However, before the year 1900, light and heat were not thought to move in discrete “photon” units, but rather in a smooth, flowing, unbroken fashion. Physicist Max Planck was the first to discover that light and heat would move in “pulses” or “packets” of energy at the tiniest level, calculated to be about 10^-32 centimeters. (An atomic nucleus is actually the size of a planet in comparison!) Interestingly, if you have a faster oscillation, you get bigger packets, and if you have a smaller oscillation you get smaller packets. Planck discovered that this relationship between the speed of oscillation and the size of the packet will always remain constant, regardless of how you measure it. This constant relationship between oscillation speed and packet size is known as Wein’s Displacement Law. Rigorously, Planck discovered a single number that expressed this relationship, which is now known as “Planck’s Constant.” A recent article by Caroline Hartmann in the December 2001 issue of 21st Century Science and Technology deals specifically with Max Planck’s findings, and reveals that the puzzle created by his discoveries remains unsolved: Today we are indebted to the continuing research of scientists like the Curies, Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn for a deeper insight into atomic structure. But the fundamental questions: what causes the motion of the electrons, is that motion constrained by certain geometrical laws,and why certain elements are more stable than others, are still not clear, and await new pioneering hypotheses and ideas. [emphasis added] We can already see the answer to Hartmann’s question emerging in this book."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"As we had said, Planck’s discoveries came about through the study of heat radiation. The introductory paragraph to Caroline Hartmann’s article is a perfect description of what he accomplished: One hundred years ago, on December 14, 1900, the physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) announced (in a speech before the Kaiser Wilhelm Society of Berlin) his discovery of a new formula for radiation, which could describe all the regularities observed when matter was heated and began to radiate heat of various colors. His new formula, however, rested on an important assumption: that the energy of this radiation is not continuous, but occurs only in packets of a certain size. The difficulty was in how to make the assumption behind this formula physically intelligible. For, what is meant by “energy packets,” which are not even constant, but vary proportionally with the frequency of oscillation (Wein’s Displacement Law)? Hartmann continues a bit later on: [Planck] knew that whenever you come upon an apparently insoluble problem in Nature, a higher, more complex lawfulness must lie behind it; or, in other words, there must be a different “geometry of the universe” than one had assumed before. Planck always insisted, for example, that the validity of Maxwell’s equations had to be re-established, because physics had reached a point where the so-called “physical” laws were not universally valid. [emphasis added] The core of Planck’s work can be stated in a simple equation, which describes how radiating matter releases energy in “packets” or bursts. The equation is E=hv, where E equals the energy that you end up measuring, v is the vibrating frequency of the radiation that releases the energy, and h is what is known as “Planck’s Constant,” which regulates the “flow” between v and E. Planck’s constant is listed as a value of 6.626. It is a dimensionless constant, meaning that it simply expresses a pure ratio between two values, and does not need to be assigned any specific measurement category other than that. Planck did not magically discover this constant, but rather painstakingly derived it by studying heat radiation of many different sorts. This is the first major mystery that Johnson clears up with his research. He reminds us that in order to measure Planck’s constant, the Cartesian system of coordinates is used. This system is named after its founder, Rene Descartes, and all it means is that cubes are used to measure three- dimensional space. This is so commonly done that most scientists don’t even consider it as anything unusual – just length, width and height in action. In experiments such as Planck’s, a small cube was used to measure the energy that moved through that area of space. This cube was naturally assigned a volume of “one” (1) in Planck’s measuring system, for the sake of simplicity. However, when Planck wrote his constant he didn’t want it to be a decimal number, so he shifted the volume of the cube to 10. This made the constant 6.626 instead of 0.6626. What was truly important was the relationship between whatever was inside of the cube (6.626) and the cube itself (10.) Ultimately it did not matter whether you assigned the cube a value of one, ten or any other number, as the ratio would stay the same. Planck only discerned the constant nature of this ratio through rigorous experimentation over many years of time, as we said."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Now remember that depending on the size of the packet that is released, you will need to measure it with a different-sized cube. Yet, whatever is inside that cube will always have a ratio of 6.626 units to the cube’s own volume of 10 units, regardless of the sizes involved.Right away we should notice something; the value of 6.626 is very close to 6.666, which is exactly 2/3rds of 10. So then we must ask, “What is so important about 2/3rds?” Figure 4.6 – Two tetrahedrons joined at a common face to form the “photon” measured by Planck’s constant. Based on simple, measurable geometric principles explained by Fuller and others, we know that when we fit a tetrahedron perfectly inside of a sphere, it will fill exactly one-third of its total volume. The photon is actually composed of two tetrahedrons that are joined together, as we see in figure 4.6, and they then pass together through a cube that is only big enough to measure one of them at a time. The total amount of volume (energy) that moved through the cube will be two thirds (6.666) of the cube’s total volume, to which Planck had assigned the number 10. Buckminster Fuller was the first to discover that the photon was indeed composed of two tetrahedrons joined in this way, and he announced it to the world at his Planet Planning address in 1969, after which time it was obviously forgotten. The slight 0.040 difference between the “pure” 6.666 or 2/3rds ratio and Planck’s constant of 6.626 is caused by the permittivity of vacuum space, which absorbs some of the energy involved. This “permittivity of the vacuum” can be precisely calculated by what is known as Coulomb’s equation. To put it in simpler terms, the aetheric energy of the “physical vacuum” will absorb a small amount of whatever energy passes through it. This means that it will “permit” slightly less energy to pass through it than what was originally released. So, once we factor in Coulomb’s equation, the numbers work perfectly. Furthermore, if we measure space using tetrahedral coordinates instead of cubical coordinates, then the need for Planck’s equation E=hv is removed, because the energy will now be measured to be the same on both sides of the equation – thus E (energy) will equal v (frequency) with no need for a “constant” between them. The “pulses” of energy that were demonstrated by Planck’s constant are known to quantum physicists as “photons.” We normally think of “photons” as carriers of light, but that is only one of their functions. More importantly, when atoms absorb or release energy, the energy is transmitted in the form of “photons.” Researchers such as Dr. Milo Wolff remind us that the only thing we"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"know for certain about the term “photon” is that it is an impulse that travels through the aether / zero-point energy field. Now, we can see that this information has a geometric component, which suggests that the atoms must have such geometry as well. 4.6 BELL’S THEOREM Another recently discovered anomaly that shows us that there is geometry at the quantum level is Bell’s Inequality Theorem. In this case, two photons are released in opposite directions. Each photon is emitted from a separate atomic state that has been excited. Both atomic states are composed of identical atoms, and both are also decaying at the same rate. This allows two “paired” photons with the same energy qualities to be released in opposite directions at the exact same time. Both photons are then passed through polarization filters such as mirrors, which should theoretically change their direction of travel. If you have one mirror at a 45-degree angle, then you would naturally expect the photon to make a different angular turn than another photon would make if it was reflected off of a mirror at a 30-degree angle. However, when this experiment is actually carried out, the photons will make the exact same angular turns at the same time, regardless of the differences in the angle of the mirrors! The degree of precision that has been brought to this experiment is staggering, as the next quote from pages 142 and 143 of Dr. Milo Wolff’s book illustrates: The most recent experiment by Aspect, Dalibard and Roger used acousto- optical switches at a frequency of 50 MHz which shifted the settings of the polarizers during the flight of the photons, to completely eliminate any possibility of local effects of one detector on the other... Bell’s Theorem and the experimental results imply that parts of the universe are connected in an intimate way (i.e. not obvious to us) and these connections are fundamental (quantum theory is fundamental.) How can we understand them? The problem has been analyzed in depth (Wheeler & Zurek 1983, d’Espagnat 1983, Herbert 1985, Stapp 1982, Bohm & Hiley 1984, Pagels 1982, and others) without resolution. Those authors tend to agree on the following description of the non-local connections: 1 They link events at separate locations without known fields or matter. 2 They do not diminish with distance; a million miles is the same as an inch. 3 They appear to act with speed greater than light. Clearly, within the framework of science, this is a perplexing phenomenon. What Bell’s Theorem is showing us is that the energetically-paired “photons” are actually joined together by a single geometric force, such as the tetrahedron, which continues expanding into a larger size as the photons move apart. The photons will continue to maintain the same angular phase position relative to each other as the geometry that is between them expands. 4.7 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE Our next point of investigation is the electromagnetic wave itself, since"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Einstein determined that matter is made from electromagnetic energy. As most of us are aware, the electromagnetic wave has two components – the electrostatic wave and the magnetic wave, which move together. Interestingly, the two waves are always perpendicular to each other. To visualize what is going on here, Johnson asks us to take two pencils of equal length and hold them perpendicularly to each other, also using the basic length of the pencil for the distance that separates them: Figure 4.7 – Two pencils at 90-degree angles from each other, held equidistantly apart. Now we can connect each tip of the top pencil to each tip on the bottom pencil. When we do this, we will form a four-sided object made of equilateral triangles between the two pencils – we will have a tetrahedron. We can work the same process with the electromagnetic wave, by having the total height of the electrostatic or magnetic wave (which both have the same height or amplitude) as our basic length, which was shown in figure 4.7 as pencils. Here in figure 4.8, we can see how the electromagnetic wave is actually tracing itself over a “hidden” (potential) tetrahedron when we connect the lines together using this same process: Figure 4.8 – The hidden tetrahedral relationship in the electromagnetic wave. It is important to mention here that this mystery has been continually discovered by various thinkers, only to be forgotten to science once more."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The work of Lt. Col. Tom Bearden has rigorously shown that James Clerk Maxwell knew it was there when he wrote his complex “quaternion” equations, but Oliver Heaviside later distorted the model down to four simple quaternions and ruined the hidden tetrahedral “potential” inside. This hidden tetrahedron was also seen by Walter Russell, and later by Buckminster Fuller. Johnson was not aware of any of these previous breakthroughs when he first discovered it himself. 4.7 GELL-MANN’S “EIGHTFOLD WAY” The next enigma comes to us when we study the subatomic “particles” known as quarks. When an atomic structure was suddenly shattered, brief tracks would emerge that would fly away from the normal spiraling “particle” path in a bubble chamber, and they were named “quarks.” These “quarks” would disappear very quickly after they were first released. The geometry of their movements was carefully analyzed, since the only thing you can truly detect in a vapor-trail analysis is different geometric forms of movement. Many different forms of “quarks” were discovered, each with different geometric properties, misleadingly called such things as “color,” “charm” and “strangeness.” Murray Gell-Mann was the first to discover a unified model that showed how all these different geometric properties were interrelated, and he called it the “Eightfold Way.” Remarkably, the unified geometric structure that we see is a tetrahedron: Figure 4.9 – The tetrahedron as seen in Gell-Mann’s “Eightfold Way”"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"organization of “quarks.” So what exactly are we seeing here? Each dot is obviously a different “quark.” Johnson tells us that “quarks” are released when the aetheric energy flow of the tetrahedron inside the atom is suddenly shattered. For a brief moment of time, the shattered energy fragments that are released will continue to flow with the same rotational / geometric properties as they had when they were bound in the atom, but they will very quickly dissolve back into the aether afterwards. One wouldn’t necessarily see all of the different “quarks” just by shattering one atom, since the angle at which the atom is shattered determines what part of its inner geometric Unity will be released. This is why the quarks had to be painstakingly studied separately. Even more interestingly, other “infolded” geometric frequencies such as the cuboctahedron are in Gell-Mann’s model as well; this tetrahedron is just one of three different hierarchies that he discovered. Again, the mainstream scientific world sees Gell-Mann’s Eightfold Way as nothing more than a convenient geometric organization, but with no further meaning than that. In this next excerpt, Dr. Milo Wolff alludes to the fact that the geometry might be the solution to understanding the structure of the “nuclear space resonances” in the quantum realm, from page 198 of his book: Another interesting problem with a valuable result is to see if a way can be found to match up nuclear space resonances with the group-theory explanation of the nuclear particle zoo. One of the names of that theory is the Eight-fold way discovered by Gell-mann and Ne’eman in 1960. It cleverly uses geometric groupings of the various particles to determine their parameters: spin, parity, isotope number and strangeness number. The group theory has not yet revealed a physical structure such as space resonances. If there is a relation it is logical to expect that the solutions of the SR wave equation would have orthogonal properties that match the Eight-fold way. It is an exciting prospect to attempt. Interestingly, just as we were finishing this portion of the book, we were contacted by Dr. R.B. Duncan, who has a quite detailed and meticulous work published online that explains the structure of the atom based on the geometry of group theory that Wolff was mentioning above. Duncan had worked on this problem for thirty years of his life before publishing a solution! 4.8 THE ENIGMAS OF “SPIN” AND TORSION EXPLAINED"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Figure 4.10 – 180-degree spin angles of “electrons” caused by impulses moving over octahedral energy forms. The next piece of evidence that we need to consider is spin. Physicists have known for many years now that energy particles “spin” as they travel. For example, “electrons” appear to be continually making sharp 180-degree turns or “half spins” as they move through the atom. “Quarks” are often seen to make “one thirds” and “two thirds” spins when they travel, which allowed Gell- Mann to organize their movements into the tetrahedron and other geometries. No one in the mainstream has provided a truly adequate explanation for why this is happening. Johnson’s model shows that the 180-degree “spin” of the electron clouds is being caused by the movement of the octahedron, as seen above in Figure 4.10. It is important that we realize that the 180 degree movement actually comes from two 90-degree turns for each octahedron. The octahedron must “flip over backwards,” i.e. 180 degrees, to remain in the same position in the matrix of geometry that surrounds it. The tetrahedron must make either 120- degree (1/3 spin) or 240-degree (2/3 spin) rotations in order to have the same position. This will be explained more simply in section 4.9 just below here. (Other aether theorists such as Wolff, Crane, Ginzburg and Krasnoholovets have their own fluid-flow-based explanations for the phenomenon of half-spin.) The enigma of the spiraling movement of torsion waves is also explained by this same process. No matter where you are in the Universe, even in “vacuum space,” the aether will always be pulsating in these geometric forms, forming a matrix. Therefore, any impulse of momentum that travels through that aether will have to trace a path across the faces of these geometric “fluid crystals” in the aether. Thus, the spiraling movement of the torsion wave is caused by the simple geometry that it must pass through as it travels. 4.9 THE FINE-STRUCTURE CONSTANT Though we have worked hard to make this section simple, the fine structure constant is a more difficult problem to visualize; so if this section becomes too difficult to read, you can just skip ahead to the summary in section 4.10 without losing any of the major “thread” of this book. We have included this section for those who wish to see just how far the “matrix” model goes. The fine structure constant is another aspect of quantum physics that few"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"mainstream people have ever even heard of, probably since it is a totally unexplained embarrassment to the scientific mainstream that clings to particle-based models. Picture now that an electron cloud is like a flexible rubber ball, and each time a “photon” of energy is absorbed or released, (known as coupling,) the cloud stretches and flexes as if it had bounced. The electron cloud will always be “bumped” in a fixed, exact proportional relationship to the size of the photon. This means that if you have larger photons you will get larger “bumps” on the electron cloud, and smaller photons create smaller “bumps” on the electron cloud. This relationship remains constant, regardless of size. The fine- structure constant is another “dimensionless” number like Planck’s constant, meaning that we will get the same proportion regardless of how we measure it. This constant has been continuously studied by spectroscope analysis, and the highly revered physicist Richard P. Feynman explained the mystery in his book The Strange Theory of Light and Matter. (We should again remember here that the word “coupling” simply means the joining together or separation of a photon and an electron:) There is a most profound and beautiful question associated with the observed coupling constant e – the amplitude for a real electron to emit or absorb a real photon. It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to 0.08542455. My physicist friends won't recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with an uncertainty of about two in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it. Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to pi or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms? Nobody knows, it is one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say that the \"hand of God\" wrote that number, and \"we don't know how He pushed His pencil.\" We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don't know what kind of a dance to do on a computer to make this number come out – without putting it in secretly. [emphasis added] In Johnson’s model, the problem of the fine-structure constant has a very simple, academic solution. As we said, the photon travels along as two tetrahedrons that are paired together, and the electrostatic force inside the atom is maintained by the octahedron. By simply comparing the volumes between the tetrahedron and octahedron when they collide, we get the fine structure constant.All we do is divide the tetrahedron’s volume when it is surrounded (circumscribed) by a sphere into the octahedron’s volume when it is surrounded by a sphere, and we will get the fine-structure constant as the difference between them. In order to show how this is done, some additional explanation is required. The phase-wave diagrams that we saw earlier in this chapter (figs. 4.3 and 4.4) showed us the angular relationships between the octahedron and"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"tetrahedron. Since a tetrahedron is entirely triangular no matter how it is rotated, the three tips on any of its faces will divide a circle up into three equal pieces of 120 degrees each. Therefore, you only need to rotate the tetrahedron by 120 degrees in order to bring it back into balance with the matrix of geometry that surrounds it, so that it is in the same position as it was before. This is easy to see if you visualize a car with triangular wheels, and you wanted to move it forward just enough that the wheels would look the same again. Each of the triangular wheels would have to turn 120 degrees to do this. Now in the case of the octahedron, it must always be turned “upside down” or 180 degrees in order to regain its balance. If you want to see this with the car analogy, then the wheels would need to be in the classic “diamond” shape that you see on a deck of cards. In order to get the diamond to look exactly the same as when you started, you have to flip it upside down, by 180 degrees. This next quote from Johnson explains the fine-structure constant based on this information: [When you] see the static electric field as the octahedron and the dynamic magnetic field as the tetrahedron, then the geometric relationship [between them] is 180 to 120. If you see them as spheres defined by radian volumes, then simply divide them into each other and you have the fine structure constant. A “radian volume” simply means that you calculate the volume of an object from its radius, which is half of the width of the object. (For those who wish to test the math out themselves, simply take the sine of 180 degrees and divide it by the sine of 120 degrees, then run that number through Coulomb’s equation to account for the slight loss of energy that happens when a pulsation is moving through the aether.) When this simple process of dividing the two “radian volumes” into each other is performed, the fine-structure constant will be the result. Interestingly, while Johnson has shown that the fine-structure constant can be seen as the relationship between the octahedron and tetrahedron as energy moves from one to the other, Jerry Iuliano discovered that it can also be seen in the “leftover” energy that is produced when we collapse a sphere into a cube, or expand a cube into a sphere! These expanding or collapsing changes between the two objects are known as “tiling,” and Iuliano’s calculations were not very difficult to perform; it was simply that no one had thought to try it before. In Iuliano’s calculations, the volume of the two objects does not change; both the cube and the sphere have a volume that he set at 8pi times pi squared. When we tile them into each other, the only difference between the cube and sphere is in the amount of surface area. The extra surface area between the two is precisely equal to the fine-structure constant. Immediately the reader should ask, “How can the fine structure constant be a relationship between the octahedron and tetrahedron and also be a relationship between the cube and the sphere at the same time?” This is another aspect of the magic of “symmetry” in action, where we see that different geometric forms can have similar properties, since they all nest inside of each other with perfect harmonic relationships. Both Johnson and Iuliano’s perspectives show us that we are dealing with a geometrically structured aetheric energy at work in the atom."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"It is also important to remember that what Iuliano’s finding shows us is the classic geometry of the “squared circle.” This has long been a central element in the esoteric traditions of “sacred geometry,” as it was believed to show the balance between the physical world, represented by the square or cube, and the spiritual world, represented by the circle or sphere. Now we can see that this was yet another example of “hidden knowledge” that was encoded in a metaphor, so that eventually people in our time would regain the true understanding of the secret science behind it. They knew that once we discovered the fine-structure constant, we probably would not understand what we had observed, so this ancient knowledge was left behind to show us the key. 4.10 A UNIFIED MODEL Now, with the data that we have seen from Johnson’s physics and its realization in the science of microclusters, quasi-crystals and Bose-Einstein condensates, we do indeed have a unified quantum model. Our presentation of Johnson’s physics has been designed to be as simplified and streamlined as possible, so anyone who would attempt to challenge the model scientifically would be required to read more about it in order to truly grasp its many nuances. Yet, for those who have an open mind, the data that we have presented here is more than enough to prove the point. The key is that sacred geometry has always existed in the quantum realm; it just remained undiscovered amongst the various anomalies of quantum physics that had remained unexplained until this time, as the mainstream continues to be shackled to outmoded “particle” models. In this new model, we no longer have to restrain atoms to a certain size; they are capable of expanding and maintaining the same properties. Once we fully understand what is going on in the quantum realm, we can design materials that are extremely hard and extremely light, since we are now aware of the exact geometric arrangements that will cause them to bond together most effectively. We remember that pieces of wreckage from the Roswell Crash were said to be unbelievably lightweight, yet they were so strong that they could not be cut, burned or damaged in any way. This is the type of material that we will be able to build once we fully understand the new quantum physics. We remember that quasi-crystals are very good at storing heat, and also that they often do not conduct electricity, even if the metals involved are normally good conductors. Similarly, microclusters do not allow magnetic fields to penetrate inside the clusters themselves. What Johnson’s physics tells us is that such a geometrically perfect structure has perfect bonding all the way through, and thus no thermal or electromagnetic energy can pass through it. The geometry is so compact and precise inside that there is literally no “room” for a current to move through the molecules. Now that we have a relatively complete aetheric model for quantum physics, we are ready to move forward and show how such geometric forces continue to have their influences on larger scales of size, namely in the formations known as the Global Grid. Much of this material is a review from previous volumes, but it is nevertheless important that we cover it once more. After we establish this crucial link between the geometry of the quantum and the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"geometry of the macro, effectively proving the existence and importance of these new theories, we will move on to delineate an entirely new model of the Cosmos that is based on all of the principles that we have discussed up until this point. Chapter Six will focus primarily on explaining this new cosmological model, whereas Chapter Seven will present more specific, observable information that shows the new model in action.

With Rod Johnson and others’ discoveries, we have a unified quantum model to explain the existence of these forces, tying together all the loose ends that are currently known to exist in quantum theory, such as the meaning of Planck’s constant. Our objective in this chapter will be to show that in a truly Unified aetheric model, these energy formations should continue to exhibit the same structure and behavior at all levels of size. We will begin our discussion by looking at the research by Dr. Massimo Teodorani and associates into the recurring phenomenon of “thermal plasma” formations in Hessdalen, Norway. We will then move into a review of information regarding the Earth’s geometric grid of torsion-wave energy upwellings, most of which was covered in chapter 11 of our previous volume. 5.1 EARTH PLASMA FORMATIONS On November 17, 2001, researcher and radio personality Linda Moulton Howe published an exclusive report on the research of Dr. Massimo Teodorani and associates regarding anomalous plasma formations that have been seen in the valley of Hessdalen, Norway. Howe writes that through the last decade, many eyewitnesses have observed and reported: ...flickering, pulsing lights that change shape. A couple of times in the 1990s, Norwegian engineers investigated the lights. But the research became more serious this past August of 2001 when Italian astrophysicists joined Norwegian engineers in a joint study with radar, photographs, videotape and spectroscopes. The results can be broken down into two groups: 95% are thermal plasmas and 5% are unidentified solid objects. The plasmas emit long wave radio frequencies and strangely, their temperatures do not vary with change in size or brightness. Howe then goes on to quote from the summary of Teodorani et al.’s research: 1 Most of the luminous phenomenon is a thermal plasma; 2 The light-balls are not single objects but are constituted of many small components which are vibrating around a common barycenter; 3 The light-balls are able to eject smaller light-balls; 4 The light-balls change shape all the time; 5 The luminosity increase of the light balls is due [only] to the increase of the radiating area. But the cause, and the physical mechanism with which radiation is emitted, is currently unknown. As we can see from the above list, we have a formation that has certain characteristics in common with the microcluster; namely that we have a series of “many small components” of spherical energy fields (such as the atoms in a microcluster) that are “vibrating around a common barycenter.” According to Dr. Erling Strand, these plasma formations could remain visible for up to two hours, which makes them decidedly different than the short-lived"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"phenomenon of ball lightning. As Dr. Teodorani reports, ... when we process the data we see that many small light balls vibrate around a common barycenter. So it is something like a center force that is ejecting balls or the mini-balls are going around the center body. It is quite complicated. The next quote establishes a fact not seen in Dmitriev et al.’s research on natural self-luminous formations, but which aligns precisely with the idea that these plasma formations can behave according to the same fundamental geometric principles as the microclusters, albeit on a larger level of size. We will quote Dr. Teodorani as “MT:” and Linda Moulton Howe as “LMH:” in this excerpt, with emphasis added: MT: And we also saw during the processing phase that these plasmas are able to assume several shapes. Sometimes, also geometric. LMH: Also geometric shapes? MT: Yes. Sometimes also geometric. We don’t know the reason about that yet, but we saw something that was like a rectangle. It suddenly changes from an amorphous plasma to a rectangle. It happened transiently and we saw it and it is in my paper, EMBLA 2001: The Optical Mission. LMH: So you were watching something round like a sphere of plasma and it suddenly transformed into a rectangle? MT: Absolutely. At first we thought it was a sort of instrumental effect due to the video camera. But after we compared the photo of this same phenomenon with the video of the same phenomenon, we saw that they were the same thing – that is, a plasma – in spite of that geometrical shape, because we can do certain analyses by studying the distribution of light, and also by taking the spectra. We see that one is a plasma. So, it is strange – a plasma phenomenon that we can describe, but not yet tell what is the main reason that is causing it. LMH: And is it fair to say that none of you or any other astrophysicists have ever documented this kind of plasma interaction and transformation before now? MT: No (we haven’t)... I know that some astrophysicists have seen the light phenomenon as amorphous light balls, but it is the first time that we saw that this year. LMH: And you have concluded in your scientific paper that these are thermal plasmas because why? MT: Because if I take a spectrum and I plot the spectrum in a flux wavelength, that spectrum resembles the typical Max Planck curve which is typical of a cocktail of ions and electrons. That speaks very clearly. And we can also measure the temperature and the temperature was in that case a little bit higher than the solar temperature; 6,500 Kelvin degrees. The picture of this formation is featured in Howe’s online article, and a clear"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"geometric shape is visible; remember that it was captured both on conventional film as well as videotape. From here on in the interview, Dr. Teodorani tells us that these plasmas could suddenly change in size without any change in their measured temperature, which is certainly an anomaly in the view of conventional physics. In our model, we see that as the size of the plasma decreases, the missing energy is displaced into a higher density of aetheric energy. It is for this reason that the temperature of the plasma does not change; some of the plasma has simply moved out of our own aetheric density of matter. It can still be detected by certain instruments such as radar, though, just not by our sensory organs. Furthermore, Teodorani’s associate Prof. Erling Strand has captured about 34 radio tracks of plasma phenomena that would alternate between visibility and invisibility. A radar would indicate the position and velocity of the plasma, but the naked eye could not detect its presence, and the switches between visibility and invisibility could be nearly instantaneous. This sudden change in visibility only adds to the evidence that the energy of the plasma is displacing into a higher density of aetheric energy when it becomes invisible. Preliminary evidence indicates that the plasma suddenly drops in temperature to 100 degrees Kelvin or less as it disappears, all of which can occur in less than one second. [6] Such rapid temperature changes obviously do not obey conventional rules of thermodynamics – the plasma is “there one minute and gone the next.” Figure 5.1 - An enlarged picture of the rectangular plasma formation after changing from a sphere, as"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"well as the corresponding 3-D Point Spread Function (PSF) that is used in order to simultaneously obtain the peak intensity and the apparent dimension, in pixels, of the target.

In her interview with Dr. Teodorani, Linda Moulton Howe adds further support to the connection between plasma spheres, invisibility and geometric structures, as she reports her own experience with a plasma formation in England that was only visible through an infrared scope: LMH: And that is so consistent with at least twelve years of eyewitness accounts in England, myself included, in which through an infrared scope I have been able to see what looked like an oval of light change into a square of light that was pulsing. I saw this along with other people and we could only see this in the infrared scope; we could not see it with our eyes. [emphasis added] As reported in Chapter 11 of Richard Pasichnyk’s book The Vital Vastness, Volume One, such plasma formations are almost always associated with some form of enhanced geophysical activity. One of the most anomalous single events of this type was reported on November 30, 1930 in Tango, Japan, and we have added a note after the first sentence: It was a clear, cloudless morning sky when a strange rainbow appeared, attracting attention. [Note: this rainbow appears to have been caused by a local distortion of the aetheric energy field in that area, thus causing visible light to break up into a spectrum.] Being out of season and unlike anything ever seen before, that unique occurrence wedged its way into the memories of many. As the next morning progressed, with it came the rumbling and quaking of the ground. In the eyes of awestruck faces one could see reflections of flashes of light, bluish flames and aurora-like afterglows that painted the heavens. Where the ground shook most, there came bewildering bright beams, fireballs, funnel-shaped lights and moving luminous columns. Toward Manpukuzi Temple, a straight row of radiant round masses revolving with considerable splendor could be seen. [emphasis added] Such events are not as uncommon as most people would believe; they simply are not collected and reported with the same degree of unbiased presentation that is typical of more conventional forms of scientific data. Both Pasichnyk and Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev cite studies that indicate definite increases in the numbers of reported “UFO” sightings during times of enhanced geophysical activity. Pasichnyk points out a 1977 book by M.A. Persinger and G.F. Lafreneiere that graphed a combination of earthquakes and UFO reports on maps of the US between the years 1820 and 1971, and both phenomena are seen to “coincide quite well” in the same areas at the same times. [9] Hence, clear evidence points to the fact that these energetic plasmas are emanating directly from the center of the Earth, such as in the case of an earthquake, and are therefore made of the same material that the Earth’s core is made out of. Thus, we stand with Pasichnyk in asserting that the center of the Earth is composed of the same form of energetic plasma that we see in the Sun – and this would explain why Teodorani et al.’s measurements showed that the plasma had the same temperature as the Sun’s surface."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"In the following two chapters, we will present evidence that the planets are actually ejected matter from the Sun, and therefore composed of the same basic substance as the Sun itself. Indeed, in a unified aetheric cosmology, all matter originates as a form of superconducting Bose-Einstein condensate plasma with geometric properties, as discussed in previous chapters, before cooling, separating and crystallizing into individual atoms and molecules. 5.2 PROOF FOR EARTH’S LUMINOUS PLASMA CORE Most of the case for the Earth’s plasma core was presented in our previous volume, but we shall repeat many of the key facts here again due to their importance. Most educated people are aware that the hottest area of the Earth is in the core, and that it gradually cools down through successive stages of the layer known as the mantle before finally arriving at the coolest area on the outside of the sphere, which is the hard crust or lithospheric stage. It is also important to remember that the Earth’s outer crust is so thin compared to the rest of the Earth’s mass that if the Earth were reduced to the size of a glass of water, the crust would only be as thick and as dense as the surface tension at the top of the water itself. This shows how little “solid” matter there actually is on the Earth. Conventional geologists believe that the Earth’s core is composed of iron and nickel. In the prevailing “dynamo” theory, this metallic core rotates inside the Earth and in turn creates the Earth’s magnetic field. Arguably, the strongest reason for the popularity of this theory is the belief that one requires a piece of metal such as iron in order to conduct a magnetic field. However, numerous researchers including Schappeller, Searl and Roschin & Godin have demonstrated in the laboratory that a magnetic field can be created as a standing-wave of glowing aetheric plasma energy, nothing more. Indeed, all our forms of “proof” for what lies in the center of the Earth are indirect, brought about primarily through research on the seismic impulses that are created during earthquakes. As explained in the previous volume, waves traveling side to side, known as S-waves or transverse waves, cannot pass through the Earth’s core, and this is what one would expect if the core were solid. Pasichnyk points out that S-waves also could not travel through the Earth’s core if it were made of compressed plasma energy. Such plasma models would normally be shot down immediately, as conventional science thinks of the Earth as an inert mass, and immediately rejects the idea of a plasma core because such an energy source would require a continual energy input. However, once we understand that both gravitation and torsion-waves are forms of aetheric energy continually instreaming into the Earth, we have a source of energy that can effortlessly pass through physical matter and replenish the plasma source in the Earth’s core. A majority of this torsion-wave energetic activity occurs at the poles of the Earth, in alignment with the magnetic field. We remember from Chapter One that Kozyrev found the greatest torsion-field effects near the North Pole, and Pasichnyk has also provided us with several other forms of proof. For example, Earthquake waves travel faster along the north-south axis of the Earth’s interior than they do on any east- west axis."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"As discussed in the previous volume, other observations also point to the fact that energetic activity is indeed accelerating into the Earth’s core from the polar regions: 1 Auroral activity associated with magnetism and solar activity. The aurora borealis, or “Northern Lights,” is a luminous energy formation usually seen over the poles. When the Sun’s activity increases, the aurora becomes brighter, and the aurora also varies in direct proportion with the Earth’s magnetic field. This aurora shows us the instreaming energy in action. 2 Curtain-shaped auroras at the poles. From studying the formations of the aurora, we also know that a helix-shaped vortex of energetic electrons and protons, like a super-elongated funnel, has been seen to spiral down into the polar regions of the Earth at a high level of intensity. 3 Earth’s core is too hot for metallic magnetism. Metals cannot maintain a magnetic field above a certain crucial temperature, known as the Curie point. However, contrary to the conventional models, the temperatures inside the Earth were found to rise very quickly as we drill down, and if we continue this smooth increase along by extrapolating it on a graph, then at only 100 kilometers or 62 miles, the temperatures in the Earth would be too high for metals to conduct a magnetic field. 4 Eclipse anomalies of magnetism and gravity. During an eclipse, the earth’s magnetic fields are weakened, and this effect is significant enough to confuse migrating birds. The gravitational field is also altered during an eclipse, as seen in various pendulum studies. Both of these observations show that the Earth is being continually ‘fed’ by the Sun’s torsion-field radiation and instreaming energetic ‘particles’. 5 Tilt of Earth’s magnetic field. If the Earth’s core were a spinning metallic dynamo, then we would expect that its magnetic field should be aligned with its axis of rotation. However, since the magnetic field is approximately eleven degrees offset from the rotational axis, the dynamo model is not adequate. 6 Changes of the length of the day with solar activity. The length of day (LOD) on the Earth is a measure of how fast the Earth is rotating. Clear correlations have been established to show a connection between the LOD and the level of solar activity. This shows a direct energetic interaction between the Sun and the Earth that the dynamo model cannot account for. 7 Changes in magnetism with solar activity. Solar activity also can change the direction and intensity of the Earth’s magnetic fields. It is highly unlikely that a gigantic dynamo inside the Earth would be affected by such outward changes. 8 Polar reversals, wanders and jerks. The Earth’s magnetic field has a series of movements that the dynamo model cannot account for. Circular patterns known as “Chandler’s Wobble” are continually traced at the poles, and the magnetic field can experience sudden “jerks” as well as complete reversals of polarity. A free-flowing energy source in the center of the Earth, responsive to the Sun’s changes, far more easily accounts for these anomalies than the idea that the Earth’s core is a solid chunk of metal. 9 Gravity’s role as a formative force. In our model, gravity is the movement of aetheric energy into the Earth that is creating matter and energy within it each moment. Once we go deeper than 2,700 kilometers or 1,678 miles, there is a greater degree of gravitational force directed away from the center than there is towards the center. This shows gravity’s role in the formation of the Earth’s core, similar to how the Biefield-Brown effect shows that the negative electron clouds rush towards the positively-charged nucleus. Once the instreaming energy converges at the center of the Earth,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"some of it pours back outwards, creating this gravitational anomaly. 10 Plasma wind coming up from the Earth. NASA’s Dynamics Explorer space probe determined that a plasma wind emanates away from the Earth’s poles in addition to the wind streaming into the poles. This demonstrates the quality of both energy entrance and exit that is occurring in these areas, which will be covered more deeply in ensuing chapters. 5.3 WILCOCK’S AETHERIC EARTHQUAKE MODEL Based on all of the above evidence, we can clearly see that there is a remarkable parallel between the aetheric model of the atom as a spherical torus and large-scale plasma formations such as the Earth’s core. As Pasichnyk and many others have documented, increases in Solar activity are strongly correlated with increases in the amount and intensity of earthquakes on the Earth. Once these earthquakes occur, anomalous plasma formations are often observed as well. Further support to this concept is seen in the phenomenon of “radar angels”, where radar operators would frequently pick up false signals over geophysically-active areas of the Earth. Most radars are now equipped to screen out these signals, which appear to be caused by mostly invisible plasma spheres that are continually ejecting from the Earth in seismically-active regions. So then, what exactly is an earthquake? We present the following as an informed supposition, based on the evidence presented throughout this book: • We begin with a sudden surge of energetic activity, such as could occur from solar flares or other sources that we will discuss later. • This surge abruptly increases the amount of energy streaming into the core of the Earth. • The total amount of luminous plasma in the core then increases. • However, there is no decrease in the pressure from the Earth surrounding and containing the plasma, so the extra energy has nowhere to go except to be compressed under a higher amount of pressure. • Based on simple aetheric physics, if the energy surge is high enough, then this sudden pressure increase forces some of the plasma to displace into a higher density of aetheric energy. • Once the plasma reaches a higher density, it can easily pass through the lower-density physical matter making up the form of the Earth that we now know and measure. • At this point, the plasma is no longer contained by the massive compressing forces in the center of the Earth, but is free to move away from the Earth’s center via centrifugal force. • Now, in this higher-density state, the plasma bubbles up towards the surface of the Earth, much as oil will bubble up to the top of water. • Since pressure always flows from high to low, the plasma will naturally move towards the area of lowest aetheric energy density near the surface of the Earth. • “Empty” vacuum space is much less dense than solid matter, and therefore has a much lower density of aetheric energy. • Therefore, a relatively vacuum-sealed crack in the Earth’s crust has less aetheric energy density than the surrounding solid matter. • The displaced plasma is naturally attracted into such cracks. • Once the plasma reaches this space, pressure is relieved, and some of it"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"displaces back down into its original plasma state that it held in the Earth’s core. • However, since the temperature is now much lower, some of the plasma suddenly cools off. • As the plasma suddenly cools, it crystallizes into new physical matter. • This new matter forms quite suddenly along the edges of the crack. • Remember that when water crystallizes into ice, it expands in size. Similarly, the volume of the plasma increases as it cools down (phase shifts) into physical matter. • Great explosive force can be released as this new matter is created, since it pushes apart the surrounding landmass at the site of the crack. • An earthquake is created as this occurs if the amount of new matter is large enough to cause a slippage along the fault line. • In many cases, some of the plasma remains in a higher density state, and continues to pass out through the surface of the Earth. • As this energy passes through the atmosphere, it may or may not shift down into a low enough density to become visible. • If the plasma remains at a higher density, invisible “radar angels” are formed. • If the plasma shifts back to its original density, “plasma formations” may be detected. • If the plasma is in a reverberating, “wobbling” state, it may lapse between visibility and invisibility, moving in and out of two adjacent levels of aetheric density, as Prof. Ehrling Strand observed and filmed in Norway. Certainly, the more conventional models of earthquake formation and the pressure of surface movements should still factor in as well; this is just a factor that can create more sudden changes. This new model also helps to explain the phenomenon of “kimberlite pipes,” mentioned both by Dr. Dmitriev and Dr. V.L. Dyatlov. This phenomenon is considered in Russia to be “the great mystery of modern geology,” and it has been primarily observed in Alaska. First, seismologists detect a sudden explosion and heat surge near the Earth’s surface. If the area where the explosion occurred is close enough to the surface, it can be drilled into and examined. [In some cases, the Eskimo people have been able to hand-dig their way down to the site itself.] An elongated hollow tube is discovered in the crust at the site of the explosion. Even more interestingly, and profitably, the inside of the tube is completely lined with diamonds! Normally it is believed that diamonds and other such crystals take untold thousands of years to be created, yet in these cases they appear to have formed instantaneously. This will make even more sense to us in Chapter 10 when we study the work of Dr. Krasnoholovets and others, who found that torsion fields naturally create greater hardness and crystallization in any matter that they are exposed to. Metals that are exposed to torsion-wave- generating devices will become significantly harder and more crystallized in their form, and torsion fields can also create microcluster formations in water and other compounds. Hence, a plasma formation contains a very high intensity of torsion fields, ready to compress into geometric crystals at a moment’s notice. The astute reader should realize that there is another consequence to this earthquake model. In this model, when there is a sudden surge of energy increase in the Earth, the plasma is forced into a higher density and escapes"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"from the core. This in turn creates an earthquake, wherein new matter is created. However, it is also possible that if the energy increases in the core occur more slowly and regularly, then the entire size of the core itself could gradually expand without displacing into a higher density. This, in turn, would increase the overall size of the Earth itself. This certainly fits with the quantum model that we have proposed in the preceding chapters, since we have seen with microclusters, quasicrystals and Bose-Einstein condensates that atoms can group together into larger clusters that retain a singular identity. The key here is that when enough energy is added to these structures, they will continue to expand in size. Microclusters start out as individual atoms that then “melt” together into larger, crystalline formations. Quasi-crystals can be grown just like any other crystals over time, and yet they continue to maintain their uniquely holographic and Unified structure, which cannot occur if the atoms are maintaining an individual identity. A Bose-Einstein condensate (superconductor) can also be expanded in size by the addition of new energy, though it will continue to behave as if it were a single atom. In our model, all basic structures at all levels of size in the Universe behave according to these same energetic principles, and are capable of expanding as greater amounts of energy stream in. So therefore, the Earth should be capable of continually growing in size as the core is continually replenished by new aetheric energy, much as would occur in the growth of an organism. This prediction is realized in the science of “Global Expansion Tectonics.” 5.4 GLOBAL EXPANSION TECTONICS In 1933, Christopher Otto Hilgenberg was the first to show that if we shrink the Earth down to 55-60 percent of its current size, then all the continents would fit together just like a jigsaw puzzle, as seen in Figure 5.2. He made the bold suggestion that this was caused by the Earth expanding in size; at one time in the past, it really was 55 to 60 percent of its current size. The most rigorous article that we have found on this topic is by James Maxlow [7], and shall be quoted as we proceed. This new model is certainly not in today’s college textbooks, but it has been quietly gaining in popularity over the years. An Expanding Earth Symposium was held in Sydney, Australia in 1981, and the Smithsonian Institution hosted a discussion meeting in 1989 where these concepts and others relating to global tectonic models were discussed. As Maxlow writes, These arguments [at the Smithsonian meeting] indicated that there seems to be something questionable with the plate tectonic theory as it is currently presented (Kremp, 1992,) and that present concepts of plate tectonics / continental drift / polar wandering may need to be re-evaluated, revised or rejected (Smiley, 1992.) "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Figure 5.2 – Hilgenberg’s “terrella” models of the expanding earth. Smallest globe is 60% of current radius. (From Vogel, 1983) The “plate tectonics” or “continental drift” model is currently in vogue among mainstream scientists. In this model, the Earth has maintained a constant size throughout its entire lifespan, and the continents all originated as one giant mass known as “Pangaea”. Eventually, this continent cracked into several pieces, and the cracks were sites of volcanic activity. As the new lava was ejected along these volcanic ridges and subsequently cooled by the oceans, the different pieces of the original continent were slowly pushed away from each other into their current positions. However, in order for this “drift” to occur on an Earth of unchanging size, “what goes up must come down.” In more scientific terms, if there are areas of “orogenic uplift” where new crust is continually being formed, then there must also be “subduction zones” where the Earth’s crust is sinking back down into the mantle and again melting into a molten state. As Maxlow indicates, this model has a major, major flaw: No definitive evidence for “subduction zones” has ever been found on Earth. Furthermore, The areas where subduction zones even might exist are far fewer than the Plate Tectonics model requires. Or, to put it more simply, We can easily demonstrate the Earth’s expansion with the observed data, but we have no means of proving that the alleged subduction is occurring at the same time."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Maxlow continues by mentioning that the conclusions of the “plate tectonics” model were based on an incomplete set of data: In presenting Global Expansion Tectonics it must be realized that the global, geological and geophysical database has only now [2001] reached the stage where any global tectonic hypotheses can be confidently quantified, challenged, and / or discarded. With the new data in hand, the “plate tectonics” model can now be discarded. However, according to Maxlow and other sources, there are two main reasons for why the mainstream scientific and geological community does not accept an Earth Expansion Theory: 1 Matter is not “supposed to” be able to expand in our current understandings of quantum physics. 2 The evidence needed to create a mathematical model that can accurately reproduce an Earth expansion process over time does not appear to exist. The first point is effectively eliminated by the quantum models that we have discussed in this book, and Maxlow has provided the supportive evidence required for the second point. As more and more information about the geophysics of the Earth is acquired, the Earth Expansion theory is only further enhanced in its credibility. New maps of the patterns, speeds and directions of the spreading of the seafloor areas shows that the earth is “undergoing an exponential expansion from the Archean [period] to the present...”, according to Maxlow, and the maps and images to support these conclusions are presented in his paper. Based on Maxlow’s mathematical models, the Earth should be expanding in size at a rate of approximately 21 millimeters per year. And indeed, 1 Carey in 1986 used satellite laser ranging measurements to calculate that the Earth’s radius was expanding by 24 millimeters per year, plus or minus eight millimeters. 2 Robaudo and Harrison in 1993 used VLBI and SLR geodetic measurements to conclude that the Earth was expanding at 18 millimeters per year. The conventional explanation for this observed expansion of the Earth is that it is caused by the continual influx of dust and meteorites, but it also fits perfectly with Maxlow’s calculations based on straightforward data-gathering from ocean seafloor spreading. Other scientists in Russia have concluded that the Earth makes sudden increases in its size at certain times in our geological history, and this could account for why Robaudo and Harrison only observed an 18-millimeter-per-year expansion instead of Maxlow’s calculated value of 21 millimeters. The next obvious problem that this model raises is this: if all the continents were once part of a single outer surface of the Earth, then where do we put the oceans? Maxlow suggests that in these early days, there was less overall water on the surface of the Earth, and “shallow epi-continental seas” had formed across various areas of what are now the continents. The original crust on the Earth had reached a certain level of thickness, (probably as a result of cooling down from a molten state as it drifted away from the Sun,) but then as the Earth continued expanding, the newly forming crust was much thinner, and thus lower in height. As the continents began breaking apart, these epi-continental seas emptied out into the lower-elevation cracks,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"forming early versions of our oceans. This raises another question: “Where did all the water in our oceans come from if it wasn’t all originally there?” The Earth “grows” in size by the continual increases in the aetheric energy it is receiving from the Sun and other sources. The same energetic processes that increase the size of the Earth are also continuously creating new molecules such as hydrogen and oxygen in our atmosphere, thus thickening it in density. Hydrogen and oxygen then bond together to form greater quantities of water, which rain down from the skies into the oceans, mixing with the salts in the Earth’s crust. Interestingly, as we documented in the previous volume, the gas planets all have been observed to have Earth-sized rocky cores, so it seems plausible that the Earth will also eventually become a gas planet as it drifts farther away from the Sun. In Chapter Eight we shall survey evidence from Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev that demonstrates that this creation of new atmosphere is an ongoing process, as new changes are being discovered in the atmospheres of the Earth and other planets such as Mars. 5.5 RADIAL, GEOMETRIC EXPANSION OF THE CONTINENTS If the activity of the Earth is to share a common bond with the activity at the quantum level, then we should expect to see Platonic Solid geometry involved during the process of expansion, just as we see in the formation of a microcluster or quasi-crystal. We have already seen Dr. Teodorani et al’s observations of plasma formations in Norway adopting spontaneous geometric configurations, and this suggests that the plasma in the Earth’s core must also have the same properties. Furthermore, thanks to Pasichnyk’s detective work, we know that W.R. Corliss, A.M. Dziewonski and J.H. Woodhouse have confirmed that the Earth’s core displays “hexagonal symmetry,” meaning that it is in the form of a three-dimensional geometric solid which has six sides when seen from certain angles. In his 1996 videotaped presentation, Gregg Braden indicates that this symmetry data suggests that the Earth’s core is shaped as a perfect dodecahedron, one of the five main Platonic Solids with twelve pentagonal faces. Thus, the “microcluster” phenomenon of geometry continues to hold true at much larger levels of size than just the quantum realm. (An icosahedron also has very repetitive hexagonal symmetry.) Let us not forget that geometry is the simple byproduct of vibration / pulsation in a fluidlike medium; Dr. Hans Jenny’s studies revealed that as the level of vibration / pulsation is increased in a fluid, the geometric forms that we see inside the fluid become more complex. So, if the rate of vibration / pulsation in the Earth’s luminous core is continually increasing, then we should expect to see increasingly complex forms of geometry at work. Bearing this in mind, in 1993, Vogel et al. came up with the following conclusions regarding the Earth Expansion Hypothesis, based on their extensive modeling of the Earth’s surface. If you reduce the Earth’s radius to 55 to 60 percent of its present size, then: 1 The continental outlines can be fitted together to form a closed crust; 2 The positions of the different continents with respect to each other remain generally constant, with their separation caused by a “radial expansion of the Earth” and; 3 The cause of the movements of continents resulted from an accelerating increase in radius with time, in accordance with sea-floor spreading..."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"An accordance of these three phenomena cannot be accidental, [but are due to] processes operating from within the interior of the Earth, resulting in Earth expansion. The key that we need to see here is in point number 2, where Vogel et al. state that the separation of the continents occurs in a “radial” or spiraling movement. Part of this model can be seen in Figure 5.3, based on Perry’s computer reconstruction of the Earth’s radial expansion. When we study the hierarchical structure of the Platonic Solids once “nested” inside of each other, we see that there is always a spiraling movement as a less-complex form expands into one of greater complexity. This has been well covered in our previous volumes. Figure 5.3 – Perry’s computer reconstruction of the radial expansion of the earth. (From Carey, 1986) Dr. Athelstan Spilhaus, an established scientist working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association or NOAA, provided us with the proof that the Earth is indeed expanding into greater and greater forms of geometric harmony. According to our communications with Dr. Bethe Hagens, Dr. Spilhaus’ findings in this area were featured in Scientific American magazine in the 1980s, and we are hoping to obtain a copy of the remaining images from that issue. In Spilhaus’ model, the Earth is not expanding in size, but the underlying geometric formations that he discovered can still be directly applied to an expanding earth model, as all of his data is based on straight lines with consistent angular relationships. Much like an expanding microcluster, the hierarchy of forms that the Earth has experienced are as follows: 1 Tetrahedron: When the “continent” of Pangaea first broke up, each major ‘crack’ was almost exactly the same length, or ‘equidistant’ to every other"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"crack. These equidistant lines form the outline of a tetrahedron as the continents then radiate away from their original center. As we discussed in both previous volumes, this form continues to exert an energetic ‘signature’ on the Earth, and the work of Richard Hoagland and The Enterprise Mission has clearly demonstrated tetrahedral energy formations on other planets. 2 Cube-octahedron: As the continents continue to separate, their geometry expands into a greater complexity of equidistant lines, forming the combined shape of the cube and octahedron. As we wrote in The Shift of the Ages, Bruce Cathie has clearly demonstrated that this grid is also still active on the Earth. From these precise Grid measurements, Cathie made many breakthroughs in this new field of “harmonic aether physics” that are very useful, some of which have been given in Shift of the Ages. 3 Icosa-dodecahedron: The Earth’s continents have now expanded into the form of a combined icosahedron and dodecahedron of equidistant lines. Once more, the process of expansion into this stage occurs along spiraling, radial pathways. In Figure 5.4, courtesy of the original NOAA paper, we can see Dr. Spilhaus’ final stage of Earth’s geometric expansion as it now stands today. The main pentagon-shaped face that we see would be from the dodecahedron, and the triangular faces would be from the icosahedron. Obviously the dotted lines represent undersea ridges and/or mountain ranges. It is not surprising to see this formation, considering that the Earth’s core appears to now be in the shape of a dodecahedron:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Figure 5.4 – Dr. Spilhaus’ final geometric expansion of Earth’s continents, courtesy his NOAA paper. Though Spilhaus’ data is quite satisfactory, there is a great deal of additional information to support the idea that such geometric forms now encircle the Earth. The Russian team of Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov independently determined that the Earth had the form of an icosa-dodeca grid, [Fig. 5.5] based on the positions of the continents and undersea volcanic ridges. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge runs precisely along with the zig-zagging vertical line in the Atlantic, as seen in the diagram. Both the pentagons of the dodecahedron and the triangles of the icosahedron can be seen in this image:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" Figure 5.5 – Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov’s icosa-dodeca grid. Interestingly, Goncharov et al. surveyed the locations of over 4000 different ancient sacred sites on the Earth, such as standing stones, pyramids, monoliths, menhirs, obelisks, temples, pagodas, stone cellars, stone circles, ziggurats, earth mounds and the like, and without exception, every single ancient site they surveyed was situated somewhere on this icosa-dodeca grid. We will learn why the ancients would have used such a technology in Chapter 9; it is related to the ability of a formation such as a pyramid to harness torsion waves for use in balancing the Earth. We will see Russian and Ukranian research from esteemed sources that has proven that pyramids can decrease the severity of earthquakes, severe weather and radioactive emissions, while increasing the purity of water, underground oil and minerals. Pyramids can also be used for healing, growth stimulation and consciousness expansion related to spiritual growth. All of the above results on physical matter are created by the action of torsion waves, whose gentle pressure can create significant effects on matter when in a sufficiently concentrated form, and it is important to remember that these “grid lines” are primarily torsion-wave formations. Torsion-field detectors will pick up a much stronger amount of torsion radiation along these lines than they will in other areas, and the node points where the lines cross are especially active. Thus, we may very well want to rebuild such a pyramid system across the Earth once again in order to offset the current damages that civilization is now producing. In the event of a limited nuclear exchange and / or further environmental destruction, such a project will become eminently necessary, as it was after the fall of the lost ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Rama. 5.6 COUNTER-ROTATING ENERGY FIELDS AND GRID DYNAMICS We remember that in Johnson’s quantum model, the atom is actually composed of counter-rotating energy fields. In order for an atom or molecule to become stable, the geometry must mesh together into a balanced formation. Similarly, we can see in the final two stages of Dr. Spilhaus’ model of the Earth’s expansion that there are always two geometries involved; we have the combination cube and octahedron and the combination icosahedron and dodecahedron. Even the original stage of the Earth’s expansion, which"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"involved the tetrahedron, may have actually incorporated the octahedron as well, since the octahedron is directly infolded within the tetrahedron, as we saw in the last chapter. Based on Johnson’s model, it appears that the icosahedron and dodecahedron seen in the Grid are indeed opposing energetic fields that have reached a state of bonded harmony, in the exact same fashion as a molecular compound is created in the quantum realm. We believe that the stress created by these counter-rotating energy forces is the real cause for the Earth’s counter- clockwise rotation on its axis. In this case, while the two geometric forms are bonded together, the geometry rotating counter-clockwise has a slightly stronger rotational force than the geometry rotating clockwise, and this causes the Earth to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. So, the available evidence suggests that the Earth indeed has a global energetic grid that was well understood and utilized by ancient civilizations. The key fact that we will explore in the rest of this section involves the phenomena that occur along the lines and nodes of this grid. Though this information is not popularly known, it is nevertheless very real, and extensively documented in our previous volumes and several other sources. For starters, we shall focus on the twelve equidistant points (vertices) of the icosahedron as now seen on the Earth’s surface, and bring in a list of anomalous properties compiled from the work of Richard Pasichnyk. Again, this material was featured in the previous volume, but it is worthy of repetition at this point. We should remember here that Pasichnyk refers to these twelve areas as “the Fields”: 1 Terrestrial electricity spirals, strange sounds, and magnetic and gravity anomalies occur in each [area.] 2 The deepest parts of the ocean floor [are at these points.] 3 [The] ocean current patterns [flow around these points.] [Note: The data of Ivan P. Sanderson reveals that these current patterns show counter- rotational movement.] 4 Strong storms deep on the ocean floor [are seen at these points.] 5 Some of the highest values of ocean surface salinity [are seen at these points.] 6 The most plentiful locations for bursting bubbles, producing stronger atmospheric charge and other associations [are seen at these points.] 7 These same areas are high and low pressure systems in weather and storm centers. 8 Spiraling gaseous nebulae have been observed from space centering in each Field. 9 The Earth’s surface layer (lithosphere) and the physical aspects of plate tectonics (subduction zones, plate boundaries, rises, rifts, stress patterns, earthquake-wave anomalies, etc.) are related to the Fields’ locations (further discussion is in section 3.4). 10 Lighted displays (ionized particles) and dark masses (neutrons) have been observed repeatedly [in these areas.] 11 Patterns and changes in the upper atmosphere, radiation belts, and the magnetosphere show relationships to the Fields. 12"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Eels, iron-precipitating bacteria, and electric fishes are geographically located in these areas. 13 More than 70 percent of all life on Earth is situated in relation to the Fields (between the 40-degree latitudes), which is ideal for the generation of electrical energy by life. Indeed, a great portion of Pasichnyk’s Vital Vastness trilogy of books centers around the study of these “Fields” as they occur on Earth and other planets. In Chapter 12 of our previous volume, we summarized a majority of convincing information from Pasichnyk that shows that these Fields are at work on each planet throughout our solar system. As we can see, all of the above effects could be caused by the power that strong torsion fields can exert on physical matter, as torsion fields do create tangible pressure. It is this pressure that appears to be responsible for forming the currents we measure in the oceans and atmosphere, which Pasichnyk’s research shows are all associated with the Earth’s Grid. As we have already indicated, areas of higher torsion-field intensity are also areas where matter is capable of shifting into a higher level of aetheric density. The key here is to realize that matter and energy can indeed be displaced into a higher level of aetheric density at these twelve nodes on the Global Grid, due to the high degree of torsion radiation in these areas, and this has already been documented and observed in the 20th century through the work of Ivan P. Sanderson, among others. In 1972, Ivan Sanderson published an article entitled “The Twelve Devil’s Graveyards Around the World” in Saga magazine. These “Devil’s Graveyard” areas are the same as the “Fields” discussed by Pasichnyk, and they represent the points of the icosahedron on the Earth’s grid, as seen in Figure 5.6. Just as a review, we know that each face of the icosahedron is a perfect equilateral triangle where every internal angle is 60 degrees. Within a sphere such as the Earth, the points of the icosahedron are located between 30 and 40 degrees latitude above and below the equator. Each point is spaced at 72- degree intervals from the neighboring points, and except for the two at the poles, their exact geometric center is at 36 degrees North or South latitude. All together, there are five points in the Northern Hemisphere, five in the Southern Hemisphere and two at the poles."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" Figure 5.6 – The icosahedron (L) and its grid positioning on the Earth (R). (Courtesy Nick Nelson) Sanderson discovered these points by doing a massive meta-analysis of all available data on losses of aircraft and sailing vessels. From this data, he determined that such disappearances were far more likely to occur at these twelve points than in any other areas. In Charles Berlitz’ book The Bermuda Triangle, we are given a greater description of the properties of these areas, both in terms of Earth’s physical processes as well as the electromagnetic time-warp anomalies: These areas... represent the nodal points where the surface ocean currents turn one way and the subsurface currents turn in another direction. [Note: Again, we see counter-rotating energy forces.] The great subsurface tidal currents sweeping tangentially, and influenced by different temperatures, set up magnetic vortices, affecting radio communication, magnetism – perhaps even gravity – and eventually, in special conditions, causing air and surface craft to vanish – sailing or flying off into a different point in time and space. An interesting sidelight on the erratic behavior of these areas is underlined by Sanderson in describing the astonishing “early arrivals” of carefully clocked-in air flights where planes have arrived so far ahead of schedule that the only possible explanation would be that they had a tidal wind behind them blowing, for example, at 500 miles per hour. [Note: Let’s remember that this kind of wind speed is usually only seen in the worst hurricanes.] Such incidents may be the result of unrecorded winds but they seem to occur most frequently within the Bermuda Triangle and other vortex areas, as if these particular planes had encountered the anomaly but had skirted or been propelled safely through the “hole in the sky” that had cost so many travelers their lives. The vanishings in areas such as the Bermuda Triangle or the Devil’s Triangle off the coast of Japan (which we have heavily documented in Chapter 10 of the previous volume) are produced when the ships or aircraft are displaced into a higher density of aetheric energy and do not return. The anomalies related to time are given additional support by Drs. William Becker and Bethe Hagens in their article “The Planetary Grid: A New Synthesis”, which was reprinted in the book Anti-Gravity and the World Grid. In this article, they reported on a time-based anomaly occurring at the node point near Hawaii: A pilot flying with passengers near the Hawaii zone [of the icosahedron of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"energy points on the Earth] suddenly found himself in a “dead zone” without [the use of his electromagnetic] instruments and unable to communicate beyond the cockpit. After flying some 350 miles, [which most likely took an hour or more,] the “phenomenon” lifted and the pilot found that tower officials could find no measurable time that had elapsed between the beginning of his “dead zone” experience and its end. [emphasis added] These changes in the rate of time’s passage fit clearly with Kozyrev’s theories that the flow of time is a function of torsion radiation, which is in turn a function of aetheric energy density. If you move into an area of higher aetheric density, time may well slow down for you, as it did for the above pilot. In such cases as this, the ship does return from the higher-density area to our own level of aetheric energy density, and the survivors live to tell the tale. Admittedly, this does appear to be an exception to the rule, but it appears that ancient cultures had a better understanding of how to not get “lost” in such vortex-based aetheric displacements, and were able to use them constructively, such as for physical travel across the Earth. In the previous volume we discussed the case histories of firsthand witnesses who flew into such areas of higher aetheric density and returned alive. The ultimate example is the case of Charles Wakeley. Briefly, as Wakeley passed into an area of higher density in the Bermuda Triangle vortex, his electromagnetic instruments displayed very anomalous behavior, and a bluish-green glow began growing on the tips of his wings, eventually turning white and spreading into the cockpit. At the peak of this event, he was surrounded by blinding white light that seemed to come “from everywhere at once,” and the effect then dissipated at the same speed that it had begun with, allowing him to regain control of the aircraft. As we said in our previous volume, It is very likely that the tremendous light that he saw around himself would not have been visible to those on the ground; it was a visual consequence of his own body moving into a more energetic area. To an outside observer there would be no change, as his body moves into an area of higher- vibrational energy that is outside of the time and space that the ground-based observer would see. If he did not return, his plane would simply disappear from view, and if he did return then nothing would appear to have happened to an outside observer; they would only see his plane as a seamless continuity. 5.7 THE BECKER-HAGENS GRID AND NEW DISCOVERIES OF “GREAT CIRCLES” An even more complete model of the Earth’s grid has been worked out by Drs. William Becker and Bethe Hagens, known as the Becker-Hagens grid. We have covered this information in both of our previous volumes. This grid was produced by taking two icosahedrons and rotating one of them slightly out of phase with the other, a concept originated by Buckminster Fuller in his Synergetic Geometry magnum opus. A 120-sided polyhedron is formed by this process which describes all the Platonic Solids. The next figure shows the basic structure of this model of the Grid, though each triangle has many sub- lines within it as well. Let us now continue with another excerpt from our previous volume that helps us to understand what we are seeing:"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"From this grid design, we can see that the current structure of continents, island chains, mountain ranges, oceanic ridges and much more all follow this pattern. By slowly and carefully studying this map, as we have documented in The Shift of the Ages, we can see that it looks as if the Earth itself is a flexible balloon that is surrounded by this grid. If the grid is akin to a set of wires, and the wires are exerting force on the balloon, then we can see how they are pushing the landmasses into their current formation. Figure 5.7 – The Becker-Hagens Grid, inspired by the work of Chris Bird. By studying the map carefully, it becomes easy to see how the continents are pushed and pulled by this Grid. We have diligently covered all the most important points in both of our previous volumes. For just a few examples, note how South America is perfectly surrounded by lines, and how the bottom of that landmass is pushed to the right by node 58, while node 49 pushes in on its eastern coast near Rio de Janiero in Brazil. Also note how Australia is perfectly stretched out between nodes 43 and 45, with the top of the continent forming a nearly circular bay area around node 27, also incorporating the smaller landmass of New Guinea directly above it. In order to make certain formations more visible, in the next figure we"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"digitally altered the map so that it can be seen exclusively from the area of the Pacific Ocean. If we think back to Dr. Jenny’s models of Platonic Solids in vibrating fluid, we remember that spiraling curves could be seen between the various nodes, forming a smooth contrast to the straightness of the lines on the geometries themselves. We would expect to see similar formations on the Earth if this aetheric model is indeed correct. Through the study of island chains and mountain ranges, we can indeed see large-scale circular structures just like those that surrounded the formations in Dr. Jenny’s experiments. Figure 5.8 – Wilcock’s “Great Circle” Discoveries in Asia / Pacific Ocean area of Earth’s Grid For starters, when we look at a world map that shows mountain ranges, we will discover that almost the entire western edge of Asia is bordered by a smoothly curving set of mountains that has no single name. In the map, we have crudely drawn in this mountain range with a series of curling lines at the far left of the larger circle. The position of this mega-range corresponds with extreme precision to an ellipse that can be drawn between nodes 12, 4 and 5, passing up through Pakistan and Afghanistan, the western edge of China, the border of Russia and Mongolia and then the border of Russia and northeast China, continuing right until the ocean coastline. The elongated sea in Russia"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"just to the right of node point 4 (see previous figure) is almost perfectly aligned with this ellipse as well. We can now combine this data with other smaller-scale formations, such as the island chain of Taiwan, the Philippines, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, to show that there are indeed giant circular structures of energy upwellings to complement the sharp lines of the geometric grid. Importantly, both of these “Great Circles” neatly and symmetrically contact many nodes on the Earth’s grid, and both circles perfectly align with Russia and Alaska at their northern edge. Other formations can be seen on this map as well, such as the chain of islands formed by the bottom peninsula of Myanmar (Burma,) Thailand and Malaysia, and most specifically the primary island chain of Indonesia. This island chain forms an almost perfect semi- circle just to the left of the smaller circle that we have drawn into this map. It is also highly interesting to note that the smaller circle on this map looks very similar to the final stage of cell mitosis, with nodes 14 and 16 resembling cell nuclei and the vertical line between them resembling the dividing chromosomes. In the next figure, we show an energetic structure that is centered on node number four in Siberia, where many magnetic anomalies have been recorded and analyzed by Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev and others. If we take this point as our center, then we can see an expanding spiral that appears to have formed from it. This spiral has three major “arms”, formed by the Ural Mountains in Russia, seen on the left hand side of the outer circle, the Himalayan mountains that cross through Pakistan, Kashmir, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet, (which we have only shown with a very thin line to emphasize their curving, spiral formation,) and the Japanese island archipelago. Once you see this inward-curling spiral structure for yourself in a world atlas, looking at the actual mountain ranges, you will never fail to see it again. This clearly illustrates the leftover traces of the Earth’s stages of geometric expansion at work. Furthermore, the style of this map projection distorts the true shape of Russia’s upper coastline, and thus in reality this circle is far more directly aligned with the shape and position of the coast than we can see here: Figure 5.9 – Wilcock’s spiraling “vortex” formation incorporating Ural Mountains, Himalayas and Japan"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"5.8 SUMMARY So, with the information that we have uncovered in this chapter, we now have established a clear connection between the energetic behavior that has been observed at the quantum level with that of the planetary level. Just as “explicit angular-dependent many-body forces” must be invoked to explain the formation of microclusters, similar geometric forces are clearly at work in the plasma formations observed in Hessdalen, Norway and indeed in the Earth itself, which has a geometrically-structured plasma core and an evolving geometric complexity of the continental positions as it expands in its physical size. We also now have a new view of earthquake formation that explains why we see plasma formations during times of high seismic activity, and which also fits in with the concept that the Earth’s core is composed of luminous plasma. The anomalous disappearances of ships and aircraft at the node points of our Global Grid clearly point to the validity of a model involving multiple densities of aether, where matter can be displaced from one density to another if the torsion-wave pressure within the molecules rises high enough to cross the vibratory rate of the speed of light. From here, our next step is to expand this “holographic” model even further, by demonstrating that these same energetic principles are at work throughout the entire Universe, at every level of size, with simple but precise harmonic principles defining their relationships to each other. This will truly establish a unified model that has never before been seen in any modern scientific work, but which is most likely a return to ancient understandings of the Divine Cosmos. The following two chapters form the heart of the model that this book is presenting, and will draw upon all of the previous knowledge that we have covered in this book up until now.

This model has been hidden in the ancient textbooks, monuments and mythological legends of esoteric science, now hoary with age and waiting to be re-discovered. This newly rediscovered information also allows us to consider the origin and creation of our known Universe as a blossoming, conscious Ultimate Being, instead of as a sudden explosion of “nothing” that scattered lonely, slow-burning nuclear furnaces into the paralyzing darkness of space. We wish to thank Dr. Oliver Crane for developing many of the key concepts related to this model in his landmark 1993 paper, now ready to download online with a suggested donation of $1, entitled Central Oscillator and the Space-Time Quanta Medium. [1] What we have in this chapter is a blending of Crane’s central hypothesis with the knowledge that we have acquired from Johnson’s physics as well as the ancient Vedic scriptures, which we feel has given us a more complete and unified model that fits together with the observable data. 6.1 CLUES ABOUT THE UNIVERSE FROM ANCIENT MYSTERY SCHOOLS In almost all esoteric spiritual traditions, the Universe begins with the Oneness, which is shrouded in mystery. It is said to have the shape of a sphere, and we shall refer to this as the Universal Sphere. Or, from a mathematical perspective, we can think of this Sphere as a pure point, which has no “time” and “space” as we now think of it, thus both infinitely large and infinitely tiny, depending on your perspective from within it – and a point would indeed have spherical symmetry. Though we cannot truly speculate on its contents, its identity shows up in modern Russian physics as the “Absolute Physical Vacuum” or APV. It is quite mistakenly referred to by Terletskiy as “useless” since it has no movement within itself – and without movement, there can be no change, no time, no energy as we now think of it. The traditions then tell us that the Oneness then chose to divide itself. This point is expressed in esoteric science as “the One divided into the Two.” All of this occurs within the Sphere, which does not change its shape or form a double of itself like we would see in the division of a cell. This simple division of the energy within the Sphere created two main bodies of aether, which for simplicity’s sake we will refer to as aether 1 (A1) and aether 2 (A2). Ultimately, we propose that all of Kozyrev’s effects and all aetheric density levels or planes of space and time are caused by the dynamic interplay of these two basic forces in the creation of matter, as also seen in Rod Johnson’s model of quantum physics. The next excerpt from Physics News suggests that two different major densities of aether (i.e. “dark matter”) are at work in galaxies and superclusters. It is not necessary for the reader to understand this entire paragraph, simply the emphasized portion:"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"From Physics News: DARK MATTER, LIKE LUMINOUS MATTER, IS HIERARCHICAL. That is, it congregates at the galactic level and at the level of galaxy clusters. This view is based on new observations made with the orbiting Japanese x-ray telescope ASCA, which recorded x-ray emissions from gas in the Fornax galaxy cluster (Y. Ikebe et al., Nature, 1 February 1996). The density of dark matter at any location is deduced from the density of the hot (up to 10**8 K) gas, which is probably held in equilibrium by the gravitational influence of the unseen dark matter thereabouts. The ASCA scientists suggest that one explanation of their measurements is the presence of two different kinds of dark matter. This is in keeping with some hybrid cosmological models which propose that cold dark matter (e.g., axions) influences affairs at the galactic level and hot dark matter (e.g., massive neutrinos) at the cluster level. (Science News, 10 Feb. 1996.) [emphasis added] The above is just one of many pieces of the puzzle that suggest that two main forms of “aether” (dark matter) are at work in the Universe. Again, our key starting point here is that we have a Universal Sphere that has divided into A1 and A2 within itself. These aethers have slightly different vibrational speeds, expressed in the above excerpt as “hot” and “cold.” 6.2 A1 AND A2 COUNTER-ROTATE INSIDE OF EACH OTHER Next, and most importantly, we must see that the Universal bodies of aether 1 and aether 2 can counter-rotate relative to each other, or swirl in opposite directions, without causing much disturbance to each other: • A1 swirls clockwise while A2 swirls counterclockwise at the same time, and they will mostly pass right through each other in the Sphere as this movement continues. • Since A1 vibrates slightly faster than A2, A1 will also rotate slightly faster than A2 in the Sphere. This shall be seen as an important point later. The bodies of A1 and A2 are fluidlike, in that they have spherical “field bubbles” that have the ability to flow around. This is supported by the work of Kozyrev, Mishin and others, who showed fluidlike activity and “currents” in the aether. However, these “field bubbles” also have inner Platonic Solid geometry that causes them to remain bonded in a relatively stable matrix formation with their neighbors. A1 bonds to itself as one spherical entity, and A2 bonds to itself as a separate spherical entity. Hence, this fluid-crystal geometric quality of A1 and A2 keeps them from blending into each other (homogenizing) all at once and losing their counter-rotating momentum. And, as they counter-rotate, their “field bubbles” can slip past each other like a superfluid, even though they are under very high compression. In a sense, this is similar to how people can pass through each other on busy city streets while walking in two opposite directions. 6.3 A1 AND A2 CONDUCT VIBRATIONS LIKE A SINGLE FLUID Again, the fluid-crystal matrix qualities of A1 and A2 cause them to preserve their own inner geometric order, much like an elaborate Vedic mandala pattern, while they counter-rotate. This could be thought of as a form of inner magnetic attraction. However, if we start actually sending ripples (pulsations) through this Universal Sphere, the field bubbles of A1 and A2 will be bumping"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"into each other, conducting the vibrations (pulsations) as a single, unified fluid. These pulsations are the actual, true definition of torsion waves. This concept of A1 and A2 as a unified fluid is extremely important in understanding how the Universe actually functions, as it explains that all levels of aether, regardless of their density, are comprised of both A1 and A2. Thus, A1 and A2 could be thought of as the precursors to the Octave of aetheric energy densities that we discuss. This will become clearer as we progress. 6.4 A1 AND A2 COLLIDE TO FORM ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY (MATTER) Most of the time, A1 and A2 slip around each other as they pass. However, if their geometries are properly aligned, they can and will blend together. Electromagnetic energy is formed when the field bubbles of A1 and A2 merge together. Of course, we know that electromagnetic energy is the building block of all physical matter, according to Einstein and others. Such merging is obviously not allowed in conventional “particle” models. So, let us now take this foundation and advance the next series of concepts, which operate on a fluid-dynamic model: • The two fluidlike aethers are indeed counter-rotating inside of a spherical space, continually and easily flowing past each other with qualities of a “superfluid,” meaning that unless their particles collide, there is literally zero resistance to their movement. • As the two fluidlike aethers pass each other, some of their field bubbles will directly collide. • When their geometric frequencies are properly aligned, the two different forms of energy of A1 and A2 merge together. • Once A1 and A2 merge together, they are immediately compressed by the material that surrounds them on all sides. • Similar to how a spherical bubble of air forms in water, the compression of the merged energies of A1 and A2 forms a miniature sphere. • This creates a tiny replica of the Universal Sphere,a perfect microcosm of the macrocosm. • Within this tiny sphere, the aetheric energies of A1 and A2 will continue to counter-rotate and swirl around each other just like they do in the Universal Sphere. • This forms a vortex, which takes on a form of “gravity” by attracting A1 and A2 into itself via the Biefield-Brown effect, as explained in Chapter Two. • As these tiny spheres continue to attract more and more field bubbles from A1 and A2, they will gradually grow in size. This is not much different than adding new droplets to a spherical bubble of water and watching it expand in size. • The “units” that are formed in this process form matter as we now think of it, via Johnson’s model. Without A1 and A2 blending together, there is no observable matter. With all that is written above, we have now set up the most important basic properties in this “aether” model of the Cosmos. Our next step is to map out exactly what structures would appear inside this Universal Sphere, meaning where the greatest number of tiny spherical “units” would form. Part of the answer can be found when we ask, “Exactly what will happen when we have a sphere-shaped body of liquid that rotates?” Then the rest of the answer is found when we ask, “Where will the greatest number of collisions between “field bubbles” be?”"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"6.5 VORTEXES COLLIDE IN THE CENTER, FORMING A SMALLER SPHERE We have already explained in previous chapters how the spherical torus is a natural “whirlpool”-type formation that appears in a fluid, caused by rotational movement. In the rotating sphere of fluid, you see a whirlpool on both the north and south poles; on one pole the whirlpool will be spiraling “in” towards the center and on the other pole it will be spiraling back “out” from the center. Remember that both A1 and A2 exist in the same sphere, but they counter- rotate in opposite directions. This means that they will both create spherical torus formations that will share the same axis in the same sphere. So now let us assume the following: • The first aether (A1) spins in a clockwise motion, and this causes a whirlpool to flow in through the north pole of the Sphere and out through the south pole of the Sphere. • The second aether (A2) spins in a counter-clockwise motion, and this causes a whirlpool to flow in through the south pole of the Sphere and out through the north pole of the Sphere. If we consider the image of a ship that is caught in a whirlpool, we will remember that it spins around and around in giant circles, and continues to move faster and faster as it gets closer to the center of the vortex, where it is eventually crushed and submerged by the incredible pressures that are created there. So, when we take this whirlpool analogy and use it with our sphere, this means that the central vortex-axis of the sphere will have the greatest speed of movement, and also the greatest pressure. A1 pushes towards the center from the North and A2 pushes towards the center from the South. They both collide in the exact center of the Universal Sphere with the greatest speed of movement and the greatest pressure. After A1 and A2 have formed and their counter-rotational movement begins, the moment when this vortex collision first takes place in the center is what mainstream scientists would call the “Big Bang.” The south-moving pressure of A1 collides with the north-moving pressure of A2, and much more of the field bubbles of A1 and A2 begin to merge together in this area than in any other. They form into the shape of a sphere in the center,since there is pressure pushing in on them from all sides. Electromagnetic energy is created, according to Johnson’s model of physics, forming visible light and matter. This sphere of energy begins to grow at first, as it absorbs more and more of the fluidlike energy “particles” of A1 and A2 into itself. We could also think of this event as the birth of the first star in the Universe. Luminous plasma is the original, basic form that is produced as the two aethers blend together. The next image that we see below comes from the work of Dan Winter, showing the whirlpool to the left, the torus formations in their opposing rotation in the middle and then a diagram from Dr. Walter Russell to the far right that shows how they come together and form a sphere. (From the image, we can see that Winter makes the simple mistake of not seeing that the two tori are both contained in the same spherical space and are able to swirl inside of each other, since he has visualized them as more akin to two donuts that are sitting on top of each other.)"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Figure 6.1 – Dan Winter and Walter Russell’s image of counter-rotating vortex formations. Dr. Walter Russell had a 39-day period of mystical illumination where he was capable of seeing much of how the Universe was structured and functioned, developing many of the key points of this new cosmology. From his diagram to the far right, we can get a good visual image of exactly how this Central Sphere is created by the two intersecting “whirlpools” of energy from either direction. Other illustrations by Russell, not pictured here, have a clearly visible circle in the diamond-shaped central area between the two spirals to show the sphere more easily. 6.6 ESOTERIC UNDERSTANDING OF “GREAT CENTRAL SUN” Since we are indeed dealing with a sphere that is a luminous plasma, many esoteric schools of thought refer to this Central Sphere as the “Great Central Sun.” Furthermore, this is also the basis for the mystical importance of the number three. If A1 is seen as “male” and A2 as “female,” then in their “sexual” union they form an offspring that is a small image of the One, made from the material of both of its “parents.” We see Trinity concepts emerge in many spiritual traditions, including the Vedic faith, the Egyptian faith and the Christian faith. The core archetype, as expressed by renowned scholar Joseph Campbell, is of a father and mother that form an androgynous son that is both male and female. This can be seen, for example, in the Egyptian myth of Osiris the father, Isis the mother and Horus the androgynous son. This is one example of how “exoteric” or non-metaphysical trinity doctrines could be shared amongst the uninitiated, while the stories cleverly concealed the deep, esoteric scientific facts with symbolism. 6.7 CENTRAL SPHERE BEGINS OSCILLATING (VIBRATING) So, we now have the birth and growth of the Great Central Sun. Next, we discover that a pulsating rhythm is established in this central sphere, as follows: • Once the luminous plasma that is forming within the central sphere reaches a certain size, the incredible surrounding pressure of the whirlpool vortex movements of A1 and A2 causes the sphere to collapse in on itself and implode. • This implosion jams the luminous plasma together ultra-tightly."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"• However, the plasma resists being compressed beyond a certain maximum level of density. • So, just like an elastic ball would do under compression, the entire plasma sphere collectively bounces back against the surrounding pressure,causing it to explode back to its original size. • As soon as the plasma sphere reaches its original size, the tremendous surrounding pressures cause it to implode once again. • Since the sphere still cannot handle being compressed that tightly, it again explodes, and so the cycle continues, the sphere continually growing slightly larger each time due to the steady increase of the amount of energy streaming into it. • This sphere is now what Dr. Crane calls a “central oscillator.” In this model, the main energy fields of A1 and A2 in the Universal Sphere will maintain constant, steady speeds of rotation relative to each other, with A1 slightly faster than A2. This also means that the implosion-explosion cycle of the central sphere will pulsate with a steady, unchanging rhythm, breathing in and out, in and out. For this reason, esoteric traditions refer to it as the “Breath of the Divine” or the “Universal Heartbeat.” 6.8 OSCILLATIONS OF CENTRAL SPHERE HARMONIZE WITH THE “SECOND” Clear evidence also points to the fact that each major pulsation of the Great Central Sun is in perfect harmony with the unit of time that we call the second. This probably seems absurd at first, but we shall see in the next chapter that it is exactly where we are led by the data; and it also traces back to the ancient past, both in the Sumerian and Mayan civilizations, as readers of our previous volumes already will know. Let us also remember that the second is not the only time interval that we need to look at, as when we are dealing with vibration we will have many different wavelengths all moving together, just as we have many different overtones that ring when we pluck a musical string. Dr. O. Crane believes that there is a different “nested” sphere within a central oscillator for each major pulsating frequency that it produces; and thus he feels that any star will be found to have a multi-layered structure like an onion. As a hypothetical example, the outer sphere may pulsate once per second, the next inner sphere may pulsate two times per second, the next three times per second, the next five, the next eight and so on, following the “phi” ratio. Other ratios, such as the square roots of 2, 3 and 5 as well as “e” and pi, are likely to factor in as well. So again, based on this assertion, we will see various harmonics of pulsation that are much smaller and much larger than the second, but they will always be related to it in exact intervals. 6.9 SONOLUMINESCENCE: PROOF OF CENTRAL OSCILLATOR THEORY As we indicated in Convergence III, it is interesting to point out here that a nearly exact duplicate of this “central oscillator” phenomenon has been demonstrated in the laboratory by the little-understood phenomenon of “Sonoluminescence,” first observed in 1934 by H. Frenzel and H. Schultes and brought to the modern eye by D.F. Gaitan in 1988 and S. Putterman et al. in 1995.The overall nature of this experiment rather closely mimics the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"conditions of the Universal Sphere and the central oscillator of luminous plasma that is then formed. In this experiment, a spherical glass flask is filled with water, and vibrated on either side with high-intensity sound waves that are directed towards the center of the sphere. Then, a single tiny air bubble is introduced by a thin glass straw into the central area. The bubble is able to be suspended in the exact center of the jar by the colliding pressures of the sound waves, which in and of itself is an interesting fact of harmonics. Then, the bubble begins an even rhythm of collapsing and expanding. Each time that the bubble collapses, it gives off visible light, forming a luminous plasma, and the pulsation is so rapid that the light appears to be constant. Surprisingly, Putterman et al. determined that the internal bubble compresses to 1/100,000th of its original size each time, and vibrates with extreme regularity every 100 millionths of a second, giving off a trillion times more energy than any single atom in the tiny bubble could have gained from the sound waves. Dr. W.A. Steer later determined that even a one-millimeter deviation in the flask from being a true sphere will cause the effect to dramatically weaken. Figure 6.2 shows the basic experimental setup for a Sonoluminescence experiment. It was taken from Dr. W.A. Steer’s web page, which is no longer available online at this time. Figure 6.2 – Dr. W.A. Steer’s basic Sonoluminescence experimental setup. Sonoluminescence remains an unexplained mystery for mainstream science. First of all, we should notice that the pulsation of the bubble is in exact intervals of 100 millionths of a second, showing its precise harmonic connection to the second as a unit of time. Secondly, no one has been able to figure out why the simple compression of an air bubble would create visible light at such high energetic intensity – there is nowhere near enough energy for any fusion process that we now know of to occur. In our new model, we would say that the forced combination of A1 and A2 inside the air bubble produces the visible light that is seen as the bubble collapses each time. Thus, a miniature “matter generator” is formed by duplicating the same conditions as existed at the formation of our Universe. Even more interestingly, recent research has shown that more than one rate of pulsation for the central oscillating sphere can be produced in the laboratory:"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"From Physics News: SONOLUMINESCENCE CAN BE CHAOTIC. Previously, researchers have observed sonoluminescence to be remarkably stable: when applying sound waves to a liquid and thereby creating light flashes from collapsing bubbles, they observed that the time between successive flashes remained constant. However, new experiments, performed by R. Glynn Holt of JPL (818-393 -6946) show that slight adjustments in experimental parameters (such as sound wave frequency and intensity) away from these stable conditions can lead to variations in the time between successive flashes. Taken as a sequence, the variations in successive flashes exhibit chaotic or other non- periodic characteristics. For example, the experimenters observed quasi- periodic behavior in which the timing between flashes could be broken down into two frequencies... (R. Glynn Holt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett, 28 February 1994.) [emphasis added] So, in the humble sonoluminescence experiment, we have a central oscillator of luminous plasma that is formed, which is giving off light and can be made to pulsate at two different frequencies. This gives more scientific support to the concept that simple pulsation can cause electromagnetic plasma energy to form in the center of a spherical fluidlike area of volume. While on this topic, it is also interesting to point out that there are very high-energy luminous objects in the Universe that are seen to pulsate rapidly, known as “pulsars.” Much of their observed behavior still remains a mystery to mainstream science, but such objects are perfectly accounted for in this new model. 6.10 PULSATIONS OF “GREAT CENTRAL SUN” REVERED IN ANCIENT TRADITIONS As we had stated previously, in the next chapter we will establish the second as a key harmonic time period for the pulsations of the Great Central Sun. Native Americans, (who appear to have inherited this knowledge from an ancient advanced civilization,) symbolize this Universal Heartbeat by the drum, which is beat at a steady, unchanging rhythm. The pulse is typically very close to being four beats per second, with a stress on the first of each four beats. This suggests, again, that all human beings have a deep, inner awareness of the importance of the second. Drummers know that a majority of pop songs are 120 beats per minute, which gives two beats per second just like a heartbeat, perfectly in tune with the Great Central Sun. Slower songs have a relaxing effect and faster songs have an exciting effect. The human heart is known to have an average pulse of 60 beats per minute. Let us not forget that these rhythmic pulsations of the Great Central Sun can also be likened to that of a breathing movement. In the Vedic scriptures it is said that “the science of breath is the single deepest secret of all esoteric traditions.” Meditation is used as a means of emulating this energy process. By imagining the slow, rhythmic breathing movements of your own body in meditation as being the Universal Heartbeat, and / or the counter-rotating movement of the arms and legs while walking, you can experience higher states of consciousness, feeling that you have merged your own being with the Ultimate Being. Hindu traditions also teach the Initiates to match their breaths with certain numbers of beats in their heart rate, thus creating two steady rhythmic frequencies between the heart and the movement of the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"diaphragm and lungs. 6.11 CENTRAL OSCILLATOR CREATES NESTED SPHERES OF ENERGY DENSITY The next point that we need to address is that wave-based structures in the aether are created as the central oscillator pulsates. Again, both A1 and A2 behave as fluids that are continually swirling through each other in counter- rotational movement, and that they can act as one unified fluid when vibrational pulses pass through them. Therefore, • The continual pulsations of the central oscillator produce spherical wave- pulses or ripples (torsion waves) which will move out through the collective body of aether formed by A1 and A2. • These torsion-wave-pulses then reach the extreme outer boundary of the Universal Sphere. • Once the pulses reach this boundary, they bounce off of it. • They are then reflected directly back towards the exact center of the Universal Sphere. The next point that we need to see is that: • The Great Central Sun obviously pulsates faster than the time it takes for the spherical pulses to travel to the outer boundary of the Universal Sphere and then be reflected back. • Multiple pulses travel throughout the collective medium of A1 and A2 in even sequences of time, since the Great Central Sun pulsates at a steady rhythmic frequency. • The out-going spherical pulses collide with the in-flowing spherical pulses in various layered areas of the Sphere as they continue their steady patterns of movement. • These colliding wave-pulses form perfectly spherical “standing waves” that remain still, in the same place, existing in a state of balance. • Multiple “standing waves” then nest around the Great Central Sun, giving a layered, onionlike appearance to the vibrational energy structure of the Universe. The Great Central Sun will be in the middle, and the spherical standing-wave layers will extend all the way out to the very edge of the Universe. 6.12 ANCIENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AGAIN PRESERVED IN SYMBOLIC FORM This universal structure of ‘nested spheres’ is a key feature of esoteric science, as Manly Palmer Hall explained in Secret Teachings: The homely onion was revered by the Egyptians as a symbol of the universe because its rings and layers represented the concentric planes into which creation was divided according to the Hermetic Mysteries (from the visions and teachings of Hermes.) Indeed, the concept of a set of “nested spheres” that all share a common axis has been secretly encoded worldwide in ancient mythology by referring to it as the “Cosmic Tree” or “World Tree.” In our previous volume we demonstrated how the World Tree is the single most prevalent ancient teaching throughout mythology worldwide, literally emerging in almost every ancient culture that has ever been studied, from the Maya to the Chinese to the Siberians to the Egyptians to the Scandinavians to the Celtics. Consider"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Figure 6.3, which is an image of the Shinto goddess Quan Yin:"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Figure 6.3 (L) – The Shinto goddess Quan Yin, showing hidden symbolism of the spherical torus and nested spheres. Figure 6.4 (R) – Manly Palmer Hall’s rendition of the Yggdrasil, showing clear evidence of spherical-torus structure. As we study this image of Quan Yin, we can clearly see that her body was intended to illustrate the axis of a spherical torus, and that multiple layers of “nested spheres” surround her. Furthermore, her elaborate headdress shows the energy vortex of A2 reaching up into a smaller cone, while the wider cone of A1 is seen behind it, moving in the opposite direction. Figure 6.4 is Manly Palmer Hall’s rendition of the Scandinavian world tree legend known as the “Yggdrasil.” Though his drawing does not adequately illustrate every concept, namely that of the “branches of the tree” actually being spheres nested inside of each other, we can clearly see the hidden spherical torus that the legend is describing."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Yggdrasil legend is particularly remarkable because of the serpent that is said to be coiling around the base of the tree. This is an obvious illustration of the whirlpool-style action of the vortex movement of A2 as it accelerates into the center of the Sphere. As we go along in this chapter, we will see that this image reveals other secrets as well. In our previous volume we speculated that the worldwide prevalence of this myth is due to the attempts of human seers to visually explain the spherical-torus energetic structures of the Universe that they witnessed when traveling out-of-body. 6.13 EACH SPHERE IN THE “NEST” HAS A DIFFERENT AETHERIC DENSITY LEVEL Thus, layer after layer of spherical energy fields will form between the ‘central oscillator’ and the outer boundary of the known sphere of the Universe. These “standing waves” will be nested together much like the layers of an onion, and the interactions of A1 and A2 at their boundary surfaces will form small amounts of luminous plasma, generally too weak to be visibly detectable. More importantly, due to the wave-interference patterns being different for each sphere, each of these nested spheres will have a different aetheric density. Obviously, there is more energetic power and strength when a pulsation is first excited away from the central oscillator than when a pulsation has traveled all the way out to the edge of the sphere and back. As the impulse continually causes field-bubbles to collide with each other, a greater amount of the momentum is lost. Therefore, the areas of highest aetheric density will be towards the center of the sphere, since these areas will have the strongest, most energetic out-pressing force with the weakest, least energetic in- pressing force to counterbalance it. Consequently, the spherical areas closest to the far edge of the sphere will be lowest in density, since the push-pull of the spherical waves will be just about equal, thus reducing the amount of compression and pressure. So, the spheres that are closest to the central oscillator will have the highest density and pressure, and they will continually decrease in density as we move towards the outermost edge. 6.14 THEORETICALLY INFINITE NUMBER OF DENSITY LEVELS The next key is to understand that there are theoretically an infinite number of different spheres all nested inside of each other, similar to a fractal formation. However, they are well organized into layers, so that their infinite structure is not immediately apparent. If we have seven major densities, forming seven major spheres, then within each of those densities are seven layers of sub-densities, and within each sub-density there are seven layers of sub-sub densities, and so on. Thus, there is a smooth transformation from the highest density at the center of the sphere to the lowest density at the outer edge, since there are infinitely gradual changes as you move through all the nested harmonic levels. The recent discoveries related to fractal formations have shown us that “infinite recursiveness” is one of the most fundamental properties in the Universe. As you go smaller and smaller in size and scope, you continue to see the same structures emerging. The more sophisticated your instrumentation is, the subtler your measurements can become. This can"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"also be done with the study of sound or color as well. Despite the infinity of sub-levels within each major density, as we move into the Octave level there is again Oneness and singularity. Therefore, it is important to remember that there is a ceiling for how high these vibratory levels can go. They are infinite within the parameters of the Octave, but you cannot move outside of those main parameters. The Octave is a basic law of harmonics and vibration, seen in the study of music. This has been covered more deeply in previous volumes. 6.15 QUANTIZED WEIGHT CHANGES EXPLAINED We now have the information that we need to explain one of Kozyrev’s most anomalous observations, namely that the rising or falling of an object’s weight always occurs in certain quantized intervals. From a perspective where all levels of aetheric density are visible, a displacement of energy from one density to another might only appear similar to a change in geometry, color or sound. However, to our third-density sensory organs and instruments, when an object displaces into a higher density it seems to disappear, much as David Hudson’s monatomic iridium did once it reached 850° Celsius. Now let’s return to Kozyrev’s model. In the case of molecules, when their weight increases we are having higher-density energy flow in to become matter, and when their weight decreases, some of their matter-energy is being displaced into a higher density. Most of this action is occurring in the nucleus (central oscillator) of the atom, since that is where the greatest amount of “mass” resides. Therefore, what appears to us as a fluidlike increase or decrease in an object’s weight will always involve discrete spherical energy levels either displacing into a higher density or flowing back down from a higher density into our own. In all cases, as the energy composition of the individual spheres changes, they will either appear or disappear spontaneously from our density. This is why we see “quantized” weight increases or decreases in Kozyrev’s experiments. 6.16 GRADUAL INCREASE IN DENSITY LEVELS AS SPHERE EVOLVES Another interesting factor that we should consider is that up to a certain maximum expansion point, the central oscillator will continually take on greater amounts of A1 and A2, forming more luminous plasma and thus increasing its physical size. As the size of the central oscillator gradually increases, the areas of higher density will spread farther and farther away from the center, like slowly expanding ripples on the surface of a pond. If we hypothesize that the outermost edge of the Sphere is under constant pressure and cannot be increased in size, then we can imagine the entire inside area of the sphere taking on a higher and higher level of aetheric density and compression over time. Indeed, eventually all of the available energy of A1 and A2 within the Sphere would be consumed, at which time maximum aetheric density has been attained, and gravitation-style forces will take over. Then, the aetheric energy at all density levels will quickly begin to collapse back into the center. This is the shift into Oneness that esoteric traditions insist is shrouded in mystery, similar to the concepts relating to a black hole where there is no space and no time. It is believed that eventually the entire Universe must collapse back into"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"this point of singularity, and this would represent the conclusion of the path of evolution for this Ultimate Being. 6.17 STAR EVOLUTION This process of expansion and contraction can be seen in the evolution of stars, where they start out as small Sun-like objects and continually increase in size. This is typically explained as the stars consuming greater amounts of their nuclear fuel, thus expanding as their pressure reduces, but it fits perfectly in the new model. As stars grow larger, their color shifts from yellow to orange to red, and they eventually become “red giants.” Once our Sun becomes a red giant, it will have engulfed all of the planets in their current positions. Once the red giant reaches its maximum size, it collapses, and this sudden rush of imploding energy soon forms a brilliant flash of white light, known as a supernova. After the supernova has occurred, a highly compressed and very small area of matter remains, known as a white dwarf, which eventually cools further into a brown dwarf. In conventional models, it is calculated that one teaspoon of the matter in a white dwarf would weigh more than the entire Earth. It is also interesting to think about the fact that our Solar System is positioned right near the outer edge of the Milky Way Galaxy. Could it be that an expanding sphere of higher-density energy is now moving into our own area, closer to the edge of the Galaxy? In Chapter Eight we will survey the hard, scientific data, gleaned from observational evidence, which shows that these “nested spheres” of energy density do exist at the galactic level, and in Chapter Nine we will discuss how such an apparent change in the density of the local interstellar medium (LISM) is affecting our Solar System now. 6.18 THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS ROTATING The next major point in this chapter is to see that the entire Universe must be rotating. This is based on our simple premise that A1 rotates faster than A2. As matter is created in the Universe, it is all being simultaneously affected by the extra momentum of A1. We already know that rotational motion exists at the quantum, interplanetary and galactic level, so based on the fractal principle we should also see this in the Universe. In the next chapter we will survey the scientific evidence to back up this argument. 6.19 A FLAT DISC AREA OF EJECTED MATTER FORMS IN THE SPHERE Our next point explains why matter will take on a “flat” disc shape in the Universe, such as in galaxies. This is extremely important for the reader to understand at this point: The greatest amount of pressure in the entire Universal Sphere will be the inflowing of A1 and A2 along the north-south axis. This also means that from a perspective of pure geometry, the least amount of pressure will be along the ecliptic plane, which is the flat area that spreads out along the Equator of the Universal Sphere, perfectly horizontally. Physicist Dr. O.E. Wagner, who also has developed an aetheric cosmological model, refers to this low-pressure area as a “zone of cancellation.” The regions of greater pressure that are above and below this ecliptic plane"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"will push in on it from the top and bottom, creating a zone of compression not unlike the flat line that forms between oil and water when they are at a state of rest. Dr. O.E. Wagner refers to this as “destructive interference.” This low-pressure area is ultimately filled with matter that is thrown off from the Great Central Sun. The throwing-off process in the Great Central Sun is also caused by the fact that there is more pressure at its north and south poles than there is along its equator: The imploding vortex-energy of A1 and A2 causes a higher pressure to form on the top and bottom of the Great Central Sun than the pressure that is formed along its equator. We remember that the entire combined structure of A1 and A2 in the Universal Sphere is in a state of rotation, with A1 moving slightly faster than A2. This means that all matter-energy that is formed will rotate as well. Thus, since the entire Universal Sphere is rotating and a low-pressure zone exists along the ecliptic plane, an out-spraying centrifugal force is created, similar to how water droplets will shoot off of a dog’s body when it shakes itself dry. • The Great Central Sun continues its breath-like pulsations, while rotating and being compressed more strongly from the top and bottom than along the equatorial region. • As a result of this system, some of its combined A1-A2 matter-energy is released in bursts from the equatorial region. • These bursts of matter-energy then spray out along the low-pressure zone of the ecliptic, radiating out in spiral form, similar in structure to the arms of a galaxy. • If the entire Universal Sphere were not rotating, then we might expect to see straight-lined spokes along the ecliptic plane as energy pathways. However, the “drag” that is created by the rotation of the entire Universal Sphere causes these rays to curve into a spiral structure, just as the arms of a spiral galaxy appear. • Geometric forces, such as the four nodes that comprise the middle of the octahedron, can cause the bursts to be released in two ways: ◦ Across the entire equator of the Great Central Sun at the same time. This forms rotating rings that will balance out at certain orbital position. Or, ◦ From single areas along the equator. If a burst is released from one node in the geometric energy structure, such as one of the four nodes at the equator of the octahedron, then smaller spheres of matter are formed that will soon duplicate the behavior of the Great Central Sun. Once new spheres have been ejected out into the ecliptic plane, the standard “rules” then apply: • The counter-rotating energies of A1 and A2 in the smaller ejected spheres are then compressed by the surrounding pressure. • This causes them to rhythmically implode and explode in the same way as the Great Central Sun, so that they too form central oscillators. • From there, each of the smaller spheres then precisely duplicates the pattern of the entire Universe within itself, with all the same basic behaviors as listed above. • These new forms will appear as stars, but they are actually proto-galaxies at this stage. Now, if we turn back to Figure 6.4, Hall’s illustration of the Yggdrasil “tree,” we"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"see that this legend also captured the importance of the ecliptic plane, showing both rings and solid bodies. Many, many other legends describe this ecliptic plane as well, which we covered in Chapter 15 of the previous volume. 6.20 THE FRACTAL STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE Thus, as the Great Central Sun releases more and more of its matter-energy pressure along the ecliptic plane, untold numbers of new “primordial stars” spurt out along spiraling pathways, forming the arms of a gigantic Super- Galaxy that is our Universe. • Each of these primordial stars will then eventually repeat the same pattern, forming galaxies from their own central oscillators. • Within each of these galaxies are eventually formed billions of stars by the same process. • Each of these stars operate according to the same pattern, and gradually eject new planets along their ecliptic planes. • The newly-created planets eventually follow the same pattern, ejecting moons and rings along their ecliptic planes. • Meanwhile, in smaller and smaller harmonic subdivisions of energy, the quantum world is churning along according to the same principles, as seen in Johnson’s physics and related aetheric models. • Thus, ultimately every atom is a perfect hologram of the Universal Sphere, showing us that the Universe is structured on a complete fractal principle. It is seen that each atom, each corpuscle, has within same the whole form of the universe - within its OWN structure. (Edgar Cayce Reading 281-024, 6 / 29 / 35) One obvious consequence of this line of thinking is that planets have been born from the Sun rather than having condensed from a planetary nebula of gas and dust. Skeptics will quickly argue that this model of planetary formation contradicts many prevailing scientific viewpoints. Yet, this Sun- centered model of planetary formation solves many paradoxes in the current model, such as the fact that at least two nearby supernova explosions are required for the model to work, but there is no evidence of any such explosions having occurred nearby (Grandpierre, 2000.) This model is presented by Dr. Walter Russell’s cosmology, that of the Vedas, many Russian scholars and others yet unseen by this author. It also dates back to a famous 18th century thesis of Immanuel Kant that was further expanded upon by Pierre Simon de Laplace. Conventional science discounted this concept of planetary formation when James Clerk Maxwell later proved that gravity was far too feeble to lump rings ejected from the Sun into planets. However, here we must remember that we are dealing with forces well beyond those of gravity, and that the geometry involved can cause bursts of energy to emerge in certain discrete areas of the star’s equator. Here, we shall briefly note that the work of Geoffrey Hardy entitled Genesis Continuous presents quite a strong case that the existing models of planetary formation are incorrect, and that planets must actually be ejected from the parent star. As one example, the gaseous planets simply do not have enough time to gather their atmospheres in the conventional models of planetary formation. The work of Richard Pasichnyk makes a case for the planets being birthed from the Sun as well. The weight of evidence cannot be ignored, though we leave it to the reader’s discretion to survey these"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"materials. This model of planetary evolution will prove to be very important in later chapters when we discuss species evolution on Earth. 6.21 THE UNIVERSE IS A SELF-REPLICATING ORGANISM It shouldn’t be too difficult for us to see at this point that the Universe itself is an Ultimate, Living Being, and that it creates offspring that are formed in its own image. Though this model is somewhat complex, the behavior of the spherical energy fields of the Universe shows us all the basic qualities of a self-replicating organism. So, the next question is, “Where do we see these energy fields at work?” If this model is true, then there should be ample evidence to prove it. In the next chapter, we shall look at the overview of cosmological evidence that shows this model at work. On each level of size we will see the Sphere, the counter-rotating energy fields, the central axis of the sphere, the Central Oscillator, the “nested spheres” of varying energy density and ejected matter along the disc-shaped ecliptic plane. We will discuss each of these size levels separately, in order to best organize the information and to allow us to glimpse a complete Unified view of the Divine Cosmos.

Tesla was the first to discover that magnetic fields are continually rotating, though no adequate explanation for this has ever been given until now. It is also not known why good magnets will continue to last for well over 1000 years without decreasing in strength. In our new model, a bar of iron ferrite or a metallic planetary core is not required for a magnetic field to form; the field is created when aether 1 (A1) and aether 2 (A2) flow together in the basic spherical-torus form. The north-south orientation of the molecules in the magnet simply allows this energy current to be harnessed. “Ball lightning” is one of many examples of a stand-alone magnetic field that have been observed, and as we published in our previous volume and here in Chapter Five,such luminous plasma spheres have indeed been produced in the laboratory through the work of Schappeller, Searl, Roschin & Godin’s replication of the Searl Effect and others. In the previous volume we also covered the phenomena of “Vacuum Domains,” which are spherical energy formations of different sizes that can possess the following, very anomalous effects: 1 [Vacuum Domains] are capable of penetrating through matter at will; 2 They can emit or absorb light and other electromagnetic radiation in the wide frequency range; 3 They can cause electronic devices to stop functioning because of the strong electric field that they produce both inside and outside of themselves; 4 They will exhibit a measurable magnetic field; 5 They can distort gravitational fields, causing objects to levitate or to become heavier; 6 They can cause air and dust to rotate inside of themselves, since they are in a constant state of rotation; 7 They can have explosions that do not necessarily change their form and size; 8 They possess a definite geometric form such as a sphere or “ellipsoid,” which is basically a stretched-out sphere; and lastly, 9 They will be seen and reported far more frequently in the years when the Sun’s activity has reached its peak. Most importantly, the advanced physics of Dr. V.L. Dyatlov have clearly demonstrated that these formations can only emerge when two forms of aether are blended together, known from Terletskiy’s model as “physical vaccum of matter” or PVM and “physical vacuum of antimatter” or PVA. (Of course, here we have called them A1 and A2, as we feel that the matter / antimatter classification is too limiting of a definition since both are required to produce matter.) The key here is that “Vacuum Domains” represent what happens when A1 and A2 blend together without being able to stabilize fully enough to create lasting matter/energy. They very actively draw from the surrounding gravity and torsion-wave energy to try to stabilize themselves, and thus create anomalous effects. We can also visualize them as a “bubble” of one aether that has been introduced into the other, similar to what would happen if we suddenly release oil into water. In that case, we would see spheres of oil appear, but they would only last for brief moments. Briefly, we will bring back an excerpt from our previous volume that shows the different forms that these domains can take, as seen from the work of Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev and Dr. V.L. Dyatlov: 7.2 ANOMALOUS “VACUUM DOMAIN” PHENOMENA 1 Ball lightning. According to the authors, this is the most well known and studied anomalous phenomenon, and it displays all nine VD properties. Most scientific papers do not mention any effects of levitation occurring with ball lightning, but this is simply because the ball lightning is so small that it would be hard to see. The typical formation of ball lightning will be between 10 and 30 centimeters in diameter. Some have reported seeing dust particles rotating inside of ball lightning. 2 Natural self-luminous objects or “plasmoids.” Here we have objects that may be seen with the naked eye as bright balls of light, and may show up even better on film if they are photographed. They usually appear near the areas of the Earth where there is the most energetic activity, in the form of earthquake-producing faults in the crust. They have similar properties as ball lightning, and in this case the large-scale effect of levitation is more likely to be seen. The authors refer us to a case in Russia known as the “Sasovo explosions,” described by A. Yu. Olhovatov, where these formations were witnessed as being capable of levitating objects as well as producing the explosive effects mentioned in property number 7 in the above list. The images in the study show these clearly. 3 Poltergeists. While some cases of “haunting” may involve real entities in a nonphysical form, others appear to be cases where a VD penetrates through the walls of a person’s home. In these cases, a ball-like, slightly glowing energy is seen that can levitate objects, create electric and magnetic fields, spin the water inside drinking glasses and fishbowls and also cause damage to people. If the phenomenon is seen to occur repeatedly, it might be because the house is built over an area of the Earth that is more energetically active and thereby capable of producing these formations. Certain people, especially disgruntled teenagers, are able to direct the movement of these formations, since they are inherently created from intelligent energy. 4 Tornadoes. All of us are familiar with the violent funnel-like cloud formation of a tornado, which can create immense damage and levitate objects essentially intact. The study of tornadoes is so important that Dr. Dmitriev actually tackles it in an entirely separate paper entitled “Electrogravidynamic Concept of Tornadoes,” also on the Millennium Group website at www.millenngroup.com. Most of the nine properties on the list are associated directly with tornadoes, including the appearance of visible forms of light. In the “Tornadoes” paper, Dmitriev refers to the following case: In 1951 in Texas a funnel passed over an observer at a height of 6 meters, the interior having a diameter of about 130 meters with walls of 3 meters’ width. Inside the hollow there was a [pulsating] brilliant cloud, [or central oscillator.] There was no vacuum inside, because it was easy to breathe. In other cases, “swarms of ball lightning” and other luminous phenomena including “continuous glowing light” and “continuous lightning” are seen in and around tornadoes. Other anomalous phenomena involving gravity and the interpenetration of matter [were discussed in the previous volume as well, since aetheric energy displacements to higher densities frequently occur in tornadoes.] The idea of an “air suction” to explain the anti-gravity effects inside a tornado is not sufficient, especially if a person can breathe inside. 5 “Angels.” This term refers to a special kind of radar interference that all systems must contend with. In the early days of radar, there were cases where blips appeared on the screen that appeared to be airplanes or missiles. The engineers realized that these were not actually physical objects and referred to them as “angels,” and now radars are built so that they will not mistakenly detect these formations. The authors suggest that “angels” are the same as “natural self-luminous formations,” as they both occur directly over tectonic faults. In the case of NSLFs, they are detected just above the faults, whereas “angels” are typically detected some kilometers above the faults. 6 “Small Comets” or “Atmospheric Holes.” These were seen on ultraviolet images of the Earth taken at high altitudes. About 20 times a minute, large black holes are seen to form in the upper ionosphere, each of which is approximately 30 miles wide. The conventional hypothesis, put forth by those who discovered this, is that these holes are being produced by “small comets” of snow and ice. However, if this many comets were constantly hitting the Earth, they should be also colliding with the Moon as well, but there are no tremors on the Moon’s surface to correspond with such events. Therefore, the authors consider that these may be caused by vacuum domains as well. 7 Ionospheric and atmospheric explosions. In this case, the name is self-explanatory. Many people have heard spontaneous loud explosions with no apparent source, and without any signs of inclement weather. These explosions are associated with luminescent forms of spherical geometry that have also been seen to penetrate matter. 8 Lithospheric pipe explosions. These are phenomena that occur within the Earth’s lithosphere or crust, which can conduct electromagnetic fields and can have an elastic, pliable quality. Geologists have observed sudden pulses or explosions of heat within the lithosphere, where an elongated elliptical tube known as a “kimberlite pipe” is formed immediately thereafter. [Often, the inside of these pipes will be lined with diamonds, and they are well known to the Eskimo people, as we stated in Chapter Five.] They are self-luminescent explosions that produce electromagnetic emissions, and, at least in Russia, they are considered “the great mystery of modern geology.” 9 “Sprites”, elves and jets. These anomalies have only been recently discovered, and conventional explanations for them are still fairly weak. Above thunderstorm clouds, brief and very large flashes of light can appear up to 100 kilometers in height. They often appear blue or red depending on their height. Most importantly for Dmitriev et al., these formations are often associated with the most intense groupings of lightning strikes that are moving from the clouds to the ground. This suggests that the lightning is somehow combining with energy from the Earth to cause these luminous flashes to form. 10 Luminescences associated with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. According to Dmitriev et al., almost all earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are accompanied by the sighting of luminous formations. They may be seen before, after or during the events themselves, and therefore are very closely timed with the events. In our previous volume, the above ten points were then followed by another observation that Dmitriev and Dyatlov had missed – the enigma of “NASA UFOs,” which are spherical energy forms that have been detected on many different pieces of NASA footage. These appear to be originating from within the Sun. Another candidate for “Vacuum Domains” is the “Rods” phenomenon, where helical tubes of faint, luminous spiraling energy are seen to be zipping around at high speeds on certain videotapes. It is possible that these documented “Rod” sightings are of vacuum domains whose spiraling central axis is more visible than the surrounding sphere. These formations certainly have their place in a Unified cosmology, and they help to show us the reality of the existence of A1 and A2, since Dyatlov has rigorously demonstrated that we must have two different “aethers” that blend together in order to solve the puzzle of their formation. However, in this chapter we are more concerned with the stable, commonly observed structures in our Cosmos that demonstrate the unified model that we set forth in"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"the previous chapter. 7.3 THE PLANETS On his Living Cosmos website, Richard Pasichnyk revealed that almost all the planets have been observed to either have a visible ring or a current of energy that emanates out along the flat plane of the Equator, which is known as the ecliptic. Saturn simply has the most visible ring out of all the planets, but the majority of the others have been found to have them as well. No solid conventional explanation exists for this. Furthermore, most of the planets are orbited by several spherical moons that also trace a perfect path through the ecliptic. Richard Pasichnyk’s research demonstrates the principle of the counter-rotating energy fields of A1 and A2 in action by observing the behavior of the gas planets. Counter-rotating bands of gas have been observed on all of the gas planets, where you will have continually alternating bands of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. The clockwise areas are known as “belts” and the counter-clockwise areas are known as “zones.” In addition, certain planetary atmospheres such as that of Venus have been seen to actually physically rise and lower in height, revealing a planet-wide “breath” just like the central oscillator. The ionosphere of Venus can change from a height of only 200 kilometers to several thousand kilometers within a 24-hour period, and the height of the cloud deck (atmosphere) moves up and down by as much as one kilometer, or 0.62 miles, across the entire planet’s surface simultaneously. This is known as the “steady breath” of Venus and occurs over a four-day cyclical period. Pasichnyk also developed the concept that the center of a planet is not actually metallic, but a form of glowing plasma-energy similar to that of our Sun. This evidence is presented in detail in our previous volume,and shows us another level of how a planet is a microcosm of the Macrocosm. We will have more to say on this when we begin discussing evolution. 7.4 THE SUN Our Sun has a magnetic field known as the heliosphere, which is also in the form of a spherical torus. The planets all orbit within the plane of the Sun’s equator or ecliptic. The surface of the Sun has been discovered to indeed pulsate in and out, which is covered in detail later in this chapter. [The star Alpha Centauri A is known to pulsate as well.] Our Sun also has a lesser-known magnetic field that travels out along the plane of the ecliptic called the Parker Spiral, which has a three-dimensional structure that looks exactly like the spiraling arms of a galaxy: Figure 7.1 – The Parker Spiral, an interplanetary magnetic formation This suggests a greater mystery underlying the structure of the Solar System that science has not yet understood; if continuous creation is somehow occurring, then perhaps a solar system could eventually grow into a full galaxy, and the Parker Spiral field would eventually fill with stars, thus creating the galactic arms. As we go on, such a notion will seem less and less preposterous. 7.5 THE GALAXIES Everyone knows that a galaxy is a disk of stars, planets and gas that forms along a flat, ecliptic plane. Most people are unaware of recent discoveries that a galaxy is also surrounded by a sphere of “dark matter” and / or “dark energy” known as the Galactic Halo, which we have mentioned in both of our previous books, labeled here at the top left of the image: Figure 7.2 – The Structure of a Galaxy, including spherical Galactic Halo This spherical halo is known to account for the majority of gravitational force exerted upon the galaxy, causing it to rotate as if it were one unified spherical object. This is definitely not how our Solar System behaves, where Mercury orbits the Sun more quickly than Pluto. (If our Solar System were a galaxy, then Mercury and Pluto would both orbit the Sun in the same amount of time.) So, once again in a galaxy we have a sphere of energy, with matter forming within the zone of the ecliptic plane. NASA has also observed “axial jets” emanating from the north and south of the centers of galaxies, and these jets show us the central north-south axis of the spherical torus energy formation: Figure 7.3 – NASA artist rendition of “axial jets” emanating from within a galactic core. One example of this axial phenomenon comes from a quote in Science News Online [2], from the research of C.D. Dermer, J.D. Kurfess and W.R. Purcell, among others, discussing these jets of antimatter and hot gas:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"\"We have no good idea how this radiation is being produced,\" says Purcell. The GRO map indicates, however, that the high-altitude radiation connects with the radiation at the galactic center. Although its resolution is limited, the map suggests that the emission is part of a stream of matter and antimatter rising from the center. Radio images hint at a similar pathway. Some sort of activity \"is building up and breaking open a hole in the plane of our galaxy and pouring gas into the galactic halo,\" Dermer asserts. Although the source of the annihilation radiation is debatable, there is no dearth of candidates in the crowded environs of the galactic center. One likely suspect is the black hole, estimated at about 1 million times the mass of the sun, thought to reside at the core of the Milky Way. Black holes are believed to produce jets of matter and radiation that could generate the gamma-ray emission observed by GRO. [emphasis added] Furthermore, Ikehata et al. have proven that the shape of a galaxy could be formed in the laboratory on a stable, ongoing basis by a counter-rotating fluid-dynamics process, creating an approximate duplication of our model of the intersecting behaviors of A1 and A2 in the Universe: From Physics News: MILKY WAY IN THE LABORATORY? A plasma with a spiral-shaped pattern of particle density, similar to that of the Milky Way galaxy, has been created stably in the laboratory, supporting the possibility that fluid dynamics effects rather than gravitational ones may be responsible for our home galaxy's structure. Injecting a hot argon plasma (rotating at supersonic speeds) into a cold, stationary argon gas, researchers in Japan (Takashi Ikehata, Ibariki University, ikehata@ee.ibaraki.ac.jp ) observed a spiral-armed structure (with low-density halos of charged particles) that persisted for as long as they kept rotating the plasma. The vortices that typically appear in such hot plasmas became spirals because of the outward \"centrifugal\" forces introduced by the rotation. Curiously, the spiral structure was not observed to form in the absence of the stationary gas, suggesting that the fluid dynamics interactions between the gas and plasma are central to the spiral formation process... (Ikehata et al., Physical Review Letters, 31 August 1998.) [emphasis added] In Ikehata et al.’s experiment, the hot argon plasma was rotating at a very high speed and the cold argon gas remained stationary. This creates a very similar condition to one of counter-rotating fields, since the stationary gas provides resistance to the rotating plasma much as the counter-clockwise movement of A2 resists the clockwise movement of A1. And, as Dr. Paul Wesson indicates in section 2.17 of his paper, “Both of the standard theories of galaxy formation clearly contain ad-hoc elements, as do theories of the origin of larger-scale structure.” Then, in section 2.18, he says, “The spins of galaxies, while problematical in origin, provide a good data set for testing fundamental physics.” And what about the black hole problem, since this model says that they do not exist? A recent article on the CNN website actually presented an “aetheric” solution for the mainstream world: (CNN) -- Arguing that black holes are riddled with contradictions, astronomers have devised what they consider a more plausible destiny for imploding stars. Taking into account quantum physics, two U.S. scientists suggest that giant dying stars transform themselves into what they call gravastars, shells of extremely dense matter with exotic space inside... The first black hole proponents were ignorant of quantum fluctuations in the universe that affect everything from light particles to gravity, Mottola and Mazur observed. “We are usually not aware of the quantum medium [i.e. aether] we are immersed in,” Mottola writes in New Scientist, “like a fish in a calm pond who is not aware of all the incessant jiggling of water molecules.” Before a black hole could form (in a collapsing star,) quantum effects would change space-time around an imploding giant, kicking off a radical phase transition akin to when liquid water becomes ice. The shift to a new state would lead to the formation of an exotic new object, the gravastar, a condensed bubble enveloped by a thin spherical shell of gravitational energy. In a paper submitted to Physical Review Letters, Mottola and Mazur argue that gravastars are consistent with classical laws of physics but do not have embarrassing inconsistencies as do black holes. Moreover, from Earth they would appear much the same as classical black holes. Therefore, those chaotic dense hot spots throughout the universe that astronomers consider indirect proof of black holes could just as well support the existence of gravastars, they say. Mottola and Mazur hope the gravastar will shed light on even the deepest mysteries of the universe. The weighty object could explain intense gamma ray bursts from the distant universe. More boldly, they suggest the entire cosmos could itself be trapped inside a giant gravastar... Astronomers call the work of Mottola and Mazur everything from “astoundingly brilliant” to “unlikely.” Perhaps it will take decades or longer for anyone to know really. [emphasis added] And the shape of the “astoundingly brilliant” gravastar? You guessed it – a spherical torus with ejected “rings” emanating along the ecliptic plane. Thus, the mainstream really isn’t as “lost” as many still assume, since here we have an article that is openly discussing the “aether,” simply calling it the “quantum medium” and ascribing fluidlike properties to it with the analogy of the fish in water. 7.6 THE SUPERCLUSTERS Groups of galaxies are known to be gathered into sphere-shaped superclusters, again suggesting that a larger-scale pattern of spherical energy fields is at work. (It is actually more accurate to say that galaxies are formed from the energy fields that become superclusters.) The breakthrough research of Dr. Halton Arp has revealed that our current method of calculating stellar distances known as “redshift” is inaccurate, and that once we correct the distortions that were introduced, we find that the majority of superclusters are truly spherical in shape, with the largest concentration of galaxies in their center. We know that this is the case with our own local supercluster, which has a massive sphere of galaxies known as the “Virgo cluster” in the center. Arp’s work also concludes that the high-intensity bodies known as quasars are actually the seed-forms for new galaxies, ejected from older, maturing galaxies and connected to them by visible filaments. This will be covered in much more detail in later chapters. 7.7 THE UNIVERSAL SUPER-GALAXY AND SURROUNDING SPHERE Lastly, we bring in the data from S.N. Kimball’s Symmetric Theory. Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation of the Universe have confirmed that all visible matter in the Universe is “flat,” effectively forming another disk like a giant super-galaxy. (A NASA scientist published a theory in the mainstream media in fall of 2001 that this giant universal disk could be caused by two fluidlike energy bodies that are counter- rotating, again bringing in a fluid-dynamic model.) The Broadhurst et. al. pencil-beam laser surveys of 1990, as well as other studies, have revealed that there are walls of galaxies in the Universe that are separated by vast tracts of empty space, 128 megaparsecs in length. These walls extended for the full distance that the survey was capable of observing, exceeding a 2.5 gigaparsec range, which is a quarter of the way across the entire hypothetical Big-Bang size of the Universe! The following article from Physics News mentions this body of data: From Physics News: IS THE UNIVERSE CRYSTALLINE? As astronomers measure redshifts for additional galaxy superclusters, the three-dimensional architecture of the universe becomes more evident. New redshift surveys, reaching ever further into space, are benefiting from fiber optics and increasing automation. A fresh analysis of current redshift catalogs offers some evidence for a periodic arrangement of superclusters, separated by voids, on a scale of 120 megaparsecs (about 390 million light years). Great walls of galaxies on this scale have been discerned before but the apparent periodicity is new. The researchers suggest that a new theory might be needed to explain the sort of immense 3D- chessboard structure they seem to be finding in the data. (J. Einasto et al., Nature 9 January 1997.) [emphasis added] The “chessboard” vision fails to see that the “walls” that were found by a pencil-beam laser survey will likely extend around 360 degrees to form spiraling arms, forming a Super-Galaxy via the fractal principle. And there’s still more: in 1994, Lauer & Postman discovered that the walls of the Super- Galaxy have a steady velocity, and are all moving in the same direction – they are rotating. [To put it more specifically, Lauer & Postman conducted a full-sky peculiar velocity survey and found that all Abell cluster galaxies within 150 megaparsecs are moving at a unified speed of nearly 700 kilometers per second as compared to the absolute frame that is provided by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.] Lauer & Postman’s data was then analyzed statistically in 1995 by Strauss et al., who concluded with a confidence level higher than 95% that these observations of large-scale rotational velocity were accurate, thus ruling out all popular Big-Bang models in the process, which cannot account for such large-scale structuring."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Figure 7.4 – Nodland and Ralson’s discovery of a “Universal Axis”, or anisotropy cone. So if we indeed see that the Universe is a Super-Galaxy formation, then our next question is if it also has a Universal Sphere with a central axis. Borge Nodland and John Ralston’s Anisotropic Universe theory indeed reveals just that. They found that the torsion fields that exist throughout the Universe, naturally causing rotation of particles as they travel, are not evenly distributed, but rather form a Universal Axis. (The word “anisotropic” means “not equal in all directions.”) Nodland and Ralston. found that the closer a particle in space is to this Universal Axis, the more torsional spiraling movement that it will experience as it travels along; it is a subtle but quite measurable effect. As written by P.F. Schewe and B. Stein in Physics News Update, Now two researchers, Borge Nodland at the University of Rochester ( bnod@lle.rochester.edu ; 716-275-5772) and John Ralston at the University of Kansas ( ; 913-864-4020), have studied polarization rotation data for 160 galaxies and have perceived that in addition to the Faraday effect, there seems to be an extra mysterious angular dependency at work. Indeed, the rotation varies consistently with the angle across the sky, as if the universe had an axis... One possible explanation might be the existence of \"domain walls\" between different realms of the cosmos, as prescribed in certain particle physics theories. This article not only supports the idea of a Universal Axis, but of structured “domain walls”, as we just discussed, as well. So, Nodland and Ralston have effectively demonstrated that the flat disk of the entire Universe must also be surrounded by an energy field in the shape of the spherical torus – a sphere with a central north-south axis. The vortex flow of A1 and A2 causes the axis to have the greatest amount of energy spiraling through it, thus exerting the greatest degree of torsional spin on all matter in the vicinity. Nodland’s team does not see this as a complete spherical torus, but they do have the “double cone” structure that we observe in the central area of such a torus in their illustrations. As seen in Figure 7.4, one pole of the axis is in the direction of the constellation Sextans, and the other in the direction of the constellation Aquila. Nodland and Ralston point out an interesting synchronicity surrounding the names of these constellations: In a curious way, the anisotropy direction reveals itself as that orientation of the needle of a cosmic compass around which the polarization plane of electromagnetic radiation twists the most as the radiation journeys through the fabric of space. It is interesting to note that the constellation Sextans stands for the sextant, the ancient navigational instrument by which seafarers would orient themselves. Aquila, by the way, is the messenger from Heaven – the mythological Eagle leading souls to immortality. [emphasis added] Though Nodland and Ralston obviously see this as just a coincidence, it is certainly possible that these constellations were named by the inheritors of the ancient mysteries, who were well aware of the positioning of the Universal Axis. As we indicated in Chapter 15 of our previous volume, the central axis of the spherical torus in the Solar System is often associated with leading souls to a higher plane outside of the sphere of human development, much as the legend of Aquila the eagle would “lead souls to immortality.” The Scandinavian world-tree known as the “Yggdrasil” has an eagle poised at the north pole of the sphere. Along similar lines, Dr. Paul LaViolette shows how the constellations of the Zodiac that surround our own Galactic Center are designed to point directly at that spot, again suggesting an ancient knowledge of the physics. So, we are indeed presenting a model of an inflating Universe instead of a Big-Bang, where everything suddenly appears all at once. This is not as far from conventional scientific thought as some may think. Consider the words of Dr. Paul S. Wesson: ...Photons we see now in the microwave background with the same temperature should have been outside of each other’s horizons and so out of causal (direct) contact in the early universe. The appropriate modification is to have a phase of rapid, perhaps exponential, expansion at early times. This idea – inflation – now has a big literature. But the energy source has not been identified. [emphasis added] Put simply, this means that all the matter-energy believed to be spontaneously created in the Big Bang could not have been crammed together all in one area. The unidentified energy source is the counter-rotational movement of A1 and A2. 7.8 THE UNITY OF THE HARMONIC RATIO OF 34560 Every data point that we have gathered so far creates a compelling case. And in addition to the above facts, we must remember that we are dealing with a unified system of spherical vibrations (pulsations) that behave according to simple musical (harmonic) principles. Now, if we wanted to prove that such a model was indeed accurate, then we would need to find a harmonic unification that persisted throughout the Universe. If every object of matter-energy is being formed of fluidlike “aether” from a Great Central Oscillator, then there should be a single musical ratio that forms a “master link” for the entire known Universe, on all levels of size. Controversial physicist Ray Tomes has given us a vital new model that indeed unifies this entire puzzle with the science of harmonics, or musical vibrations. The Great Central Sun continues its rhythmic movement, and intersecting wave-pulses are created which follow the laws of music and vibration, as we said. Spherical-torus energy formations are produced of all different sizes in the Universe, such as moons, planets, the Sun, the galaxy and the Universe itself. Miraculously, Tomes discovered that the average distances between all of these spherical energy formations at each size level in the Universe are precisely interconnected by a single musical ratio – 34560. • If we take the average distance between moons and multiply it by a factor of 34560, we get the average distance between planets. • Take the average distance between planets, multiply it by a factor of 34560 and we get the average distance between stars. • Multiply the average distance between stars by a factor of 34560 and we get the average distance between galaxies. • Take the average distance between galaxies, multiply it by a factor of 34560 and we get the size of the known Universe. This suggests that there is a “fractal” organization to the Cosmos, meaning that we have what is referred to as “self-similarity on all levels.” The geometric formations created by fractal mathematics can be magnified exponentially, and no matter how deeply you “zoom in” to the formation, you still see the same geometric structures. Many “Chaos” theorists have already discerned that the Universe itself appears to work according to such logic in many different and mysterious ways. Surprisingly, as we can see from the next chart, this same exact harmonic ratio of 34560 for the Cosmos can be compressed as well as expanded: • Compress the average distance between moons by two factors of 34560, and we get the average distance between cells, either plant or animal. • Compress the average distance between cells by 34560 and we get the average distance between atoms. • Compress the average distance between atoms by 34560 and we get the average distance between nucleons, which are the smallest natural “particles” in the Universe. This next chart shows the master summary of all of these connections, strongly demonstrating that the entire Universe is interconnected according to one vast, unified plan:"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Figure 7.5 – Ray Tomes’ discovery of the unified ratio of 34560 in the Universe. It is literally quite impossible that such a simple system could work so well from the quantum to the living cell to the super-galactic level, without requiring any elaborate fixes, shortcuts or math-a-magical hocus-pocus. (For an example of such a “fix,” before Copernicus placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System, the geo-centric mainstream scientists had created elaborate “epicycles” to mathematically explain why the planets would occasionally appear to travel backwards (i.e. “retrograde”) as they moved along their ecliptic plane in the night sky.) Each of the averaged distance figures cited by Tomes have emerged from mainstream scientific studies, so there is no validity to the argument of skeptics that Tomes had “cooked the books” in any way. Tomes was simply the first person to discover that each of these different classes of spherical energy forms were partitioned and interrelated by a single, master harmonic ratio. Once we integrate our new quantum physics findings, we can indeed see the completeness of the model as it now stands. Furthermore, the utility of the 34560 ratio does not end with the remarkable facts that we have just stated. Other forms of aether vibrations, such as difference between the speed of light and other basic speeds of vibration / pulsation, shows this master harmonic of 34560 as well. This evidence comes from the work of Dan Winter, who went further into exploring the connections discovered by Tomes. As one harmonic example from Winter’s work, the speed of light in water is almost exactly ¾ of the speed of light in a vacuum, and ¾ is a standard musical relationship between two vibratory frequencies. Even more interestingly, • Compress the speed of light by a factor of 34560 and we get the speed of sound. • Compress the speed of sound by a factor of 34560 and we get the speed of heat. This, of course, is our next exposure to a very simple concept: the speed of light is by no means the highest speed in the Universe – as we have already said, it simply represents the highest speed that energy can travel through the aether in our own area of density. Other areas of higher density would allow a greater speed of light to occur, as Kozyrev observed with his torsion-wave fields. In The Shift of the Ages we detailed evidence from Bruce Cathie that the speed of light is a perfect harmonic value. First, Cathie used what he called the “grid second” for time, a unit that is smaller than the second but closely related, built up from a system of 9 instead of a system of 8 (i.e. 8x3=24 hours, 9x3=27 “grid” hours.) Cathie showed how the Earth’s harmonic measurements, such as the nautical mile of one minute of one degree at the Equator, represent a perfect harmonic yardstick for understanding and measuring universal energy. (Remember that the Earth must form according to harmonic principles, so this is no accident.) And, when Cathie calculated the speed of light by the number of nautical miles that it would pass through per grid second in a vacuum, he came up with exactly 144,000! 144 is the square of twelve and an essential number in the science of musical vibrations. Furthermore, the work of Lambert Dolphin and Barry Setterfield proves conclusively that the measured speed of light has been steadily decreasing by a small amount since it was first calculated. This finding came from a meta-analysis of literally every study on the speed of light that had occurred in history prior to 1980. We believe that this measurable drop in light-speed is due to an energetic boundary strength that we are now encountering as we prepare to move into an area of higher aetheric density in the galaxy, which is the central thesis of this book. For now, we should simply remember that the speed of light is directly related to that of sound and heat by the same universal harmonic ratio of 34560. If we want to explore the possibility of finding the 34560 ratio when we are discussing the density of matter, then we would need to look at cubical harmonics, i.e., harmonics of 34560 to the power of 3, since we are dealing with three-dimensional structures instead of two-dimensional distances between structures. When we consider the densities of the matter in the Universe with this in mind, the following interesting relationships emerge: • Compress the density of ordinary matter by a factor of 34560^3, and we find the density of a neutron star, considered the densest object in the Universe. • Relax the density of ordinary matter by a factor of (34560^3)^2, and we arrive at the density of the known Universe, which is predominantly what is now called “empty” space. All of these observations from Tomes and Winter only reinforce the idea that a central oscillator is creating pulsations throughout all the aether in the Universal Sphere. All of these pulsations are precise harmonic multiples of the time interval of one second, either in larger or smaller time intervals, and their primary harmonic wavelengths are all factors of the ratio of 34560. Tomes demonstrated that other harmonic ratios besides 34560 can determine the spacings between the stars and planets, but the 34560 ratio is certainly the most predominant one. His studies include a complete determination that all of our nearby stars are in precise harmonic relationships to each other in terms of their relative distances. The central oscillator concept also gives us an explanation for why we observe aetheric waves as spiraling, such as in Kozyrev’s experiments. No matter where we are in the sphere of the Universe, the aetheric energy is constantly undergoing more than one type of movement: the out-going and in-flowing pulsations of the central oscillator and the rotation of the sphere itself. These movements are duplicated at all different size levels throughout the Universe. Thus, any time that you create a wave that passes through the aetheric medium, the wave will always travel in a spiral, according to the geometry of how the varying movements intersect. 7.9 COMPLETE EVIDENCE FOR THE CENTRAL OSCILLATOR SYSTEM The next question, of course, is whether or not these basic notions are provable. Is it possible to observe a truly complete and unified example of the entire complex of “Central Oscillator” concepts that we have suggested in the last chapter? Our first choice for this task might be a galaxy. Most people still believe that the center of a Galaxy is a black hole, even though we have never photographed one in our own Galaxy or anywhere else, merely inferred its existence theoretically. The black hole concept is an artifact of using mathematics instead of physical concepts to try to understand the Universe, and is no longer needed when we do away with the Big Bang. What we actually do see in the photographic evidence from our own galaxy is simply a compressed, bright cluster in Sagittarius A, as expected, and most astrophysicists say that a black hole is “hiding just behind that bright spot in the center.” As seen above in Section 7.5, mainstream scientists are now admitting that the black hole theory must be discarded, and Dr. Paul La Violette, Dr. Halton Arp and others have long falsified the black hole theory. We have not yet made detailed enough observations of the central formation in our own galaxy to determine if it is, in fact, exhibiting a pulsating motion. However, with our own Solar System we have an excellent opportunity to study this “Central Oscillator” system in completeness. The full mechanism was inferred by Oliver Crane in his work, but is only truly solidified when we bring in the work of Ray Tomes and especially that of J.B. Stoneking in his “Stoneking Resonance Theory.” Our first glimpse at the mystery comes from a discovery of J.D. Titius in 1766, published by J.E. Bode in 1772 and known as “Bode’s Law.” This finding revealed that the planetary positions are indeed spaced according to regular musical intervals. Although this theory was widely accepted for more than a century, showing over 95% accuracy out to Uranus, it was eventually discarded after the discovery of Neptune, which completely broke the simple pattern that Bode had set forth – and Percival Lowell’s discovery of Pluto only made it worse. However, both Tomes and J.B. Stoneking found longer harmonic wavelengths that corrected the mistake and showed that Neptune and Pluto were indeed in their proper “musical” places, as seen in figures 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8. Even more surprisingly, we now know that the Sun is indeed a central oscillator! In 1962, R. Leighton et al. found that the Sun’s surface pulsates regularly. In the early 1970’s, several groups from the U.S., Russia and Great Britain confirmed that the Sun did indeed oscillate in steady pulses, its"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"surface rising and falling by about 3 kilometers (1.86 miles.) This pulsation occurs in various harmonic intervals of a basic unit of time that was exactly five minutes, no more and no less, rising to a maximum value of 160 minutes. (The fact that the sun has an exact five-minute heartbeat shows that the Central Oscillator in the Universe is pulsating in perfect multiples of one second. It is for this reason that we refer to the second as the “Universal Time Quantum.”) All doubts about this effect were eliminated when a team of French, Soviet and U.S. scientists gathered in Antarctica to carefully observe and measure the Sun for five straight days at the South Pole. Late in the month of December, the South Pole is aimed at the sun for continuous 24-hour days; in this environment, it never “sets.” With generally good weather and round-the-clock shifts, they observed the 160-minute oscillation period as well as the three-kilometer pulsation amplitude. The next diagrams are from Stoneking’s work, showing the waves that are created by the Sun’s pulsation and how these waves in turn position the planets: Figures 7.6 and 7.7 – Stoneking Resonance affecting inner and middle planetary positions. In his 1998 paper, J.B. Stoneking calculated the wavelengths that were produced by each of the different harmonic intervals that the Sun produces, such as a five-minute pulse, ten-minute pulse, 80-minute pulse, 160-minute pulse, et cetera. These wavelengths would be measured as existing at a certain distance away from the Sun. Calculating the wavelengths is a simple mathematical problem that involves the distance that the Sun’s surface moves in each pulse, (2-3 km,) the time that it takes to move in each pulse (intervals of five minutes,) and the speed that the wave travels, which is the speed of light (186,000 miles per second.) When Stoneking ran these calculations, which are published in his paper, he found that there was a planet at the edge of each wavelength that he discovered, as we can see in the images. These “nodes” in the wavelength were the zones of least pressure, where all vibrations canceled out and allowed the planets to form.Furthermore, the entire heliosphere, formed by the Sun’s magnetic field, is exactly five 160-minute pulses deep. Figure 7.8 – Stoneking Resonance in the Outer Solar System. Furthermore, Stoneking discovered that each planet was positioned at a certain exact number of solar diameters away from the Sun. Each planetary orbit will fall perfectly in line with one of the “ripples” formed by the Sun’s pulsation through the aether as it resonates like a giant drum. The above diagram makes it appear that only the outer planets fit in with the Sun’s diameter, but the diagram is not to scale – and the diameter of the Sun is actually much smaller than the 160-minute pulse. This harmonic connection of the planetary positions gives the hard scientific data that Oliver Crane inferred in his “Central Oscillator” paper. Let us again think back to our original discussion of the Great Central Sun and how it formed an “onion-like” formation of nested spherical energy vibrations, caused by the spherical “ripples” of its pulsation interfering with each other as they move out and are then reflected back towards the center. Within our own Solar System, we must realize that these invisible energetic spheres are holding the planets in their positions. Normally we visualize planetary orbits by simply drawing an elliptical line in the direction of travel, but now we should equally see that they are held in place by invisible spherical waveforms, and driven to rotate along the ecliptic plane by the overall rotation of A1 and A2 as it forms the Sun and heliosphere. Some of the spheres are more “flattened out” than others, forming elliptical instead of circular orbits, and this is mainly due to the fact that the Solar System is also traversing and being affected by the forces in the Galaxy."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"[See the page of Robert Grace at http://hometown.aol.com/MetPhys/97planetmusic.html for more information on the harmonics of the Solar System. Many have independently stumbled across these connections. The most complete harmonic analysis of the Solar System that we have found is in the work of Dr. Sergey Smelyakov entitled “The Auric Time Scale and the Mayan Calendar,” which we will feature prominently in later chapters.] Thus, when we view the true energetic structure of our Solar System, we see a series of nested spherical energy forms that are created by the Sun as it pulsates. Remember now, these are spheres that exist in three dimensions, not just along the ecliptic plane – they completely surround the Sun in wider and wider layers. Normally, they are completely invisible to us, though in our previous volume we have documented extensive examples where they were seen by initiates and mystics in out-of-body states. This dates all the way back to the ancient vision of Thothermes Trismestigus, who was visited by a dragon named Poimandres that symbolized Universal Mind in a similar fashion as Oriental cultures equate the dragon with wisdom. Two more revealing key points are made by Stoneking in his paper that are worthy of verbatim repetition: A report, published in the journal Science (March 27, 1998, pg. 2089) by seismologist Mr. Naoki Suda et al, stated that he and his team had found evidence that had showed Earth to be in a constant state of oscillation. He reported that the frequencies involved were between 2-7 mhz. (.002 - .007 Hz.) If you convert this 2 mhz to a wavelength, it equals 93,141,000 miles, which by coincidence is also close to the mean orbital radius of planet Earth [i.e. Earth’s distance from the Sun.] This spectrum of frequencies also covers 2 of the Sun’s resonant pulse wavelengths. (Solar Dia. x 2^5 = 27,680,000 miles, 6.7 mhz and Solar Dia x 2^6 = 55,360,000 miles, 3.3 mhz.) The same two frequencies are involved in the spacing of Earth from Venus (.3 AU) and Earth from Mars (.6 AU.) [emphasis added] Let’s take a leap here and suppose that one of a planet’s resonant frequencies is equal to its mean orbital radius and that it radiates this reflection wave into the interplanetary plasma. Could other evidence be found that could support this idea? If we look towards the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter, and its orbit around the Sun, we see that it affects two groups of asteroids known as the Trojans. [These groups] are 60 degrees in front and [60 degrees] behind [the orbital position of] Jupiter. (If you draw a straight line from the Sun to Jupiter and go at a 60-degree angle from the Sun to the point where it intersects with Jupiter’s orbit, [you find the Trojans on either end.]) As we know, a triangle’s internal angles must equal 180 degrees. If you draw a straight line from the Sun to [either of] the Trojans, then to Jupiter and back to the Sun, it forms a perfect equilateral triangle with 3 internal angles of 60 degrees. This all means that the Trojans are as far from Jupiter as Jupiter is from the Sun: 483.3 million miles. [emphasis added] The first point above shows us that the behavior of the Earth, in terms of its own rate of harmonic pulsation, is intimately connected with its distance from the Sun. This can only be possible with a “quantum medium” that exists between them in space. Then, the “triangle formation” that Stoneking mentioned between Jupiter, the Sun and the Trojan asteroids suggests that geometric forces are at work in the energy fields we are discussing, which falls in line holographically with what we have observed at the quantum level, as seen in previous chapters. 7.10 CONNECTION BETWEEN SOLAR SYSTEM AND NEW QUANTUM PHYSICS Another key discovery that connects the Solar System to our quantum model has been published by Richard Hoagland and The Enterprise Mission, inspired by the pioneering work of Lt. Col. Tom Bearden. In Chapter 12 of the previous volume, we went over the anomalies of the planets, and covered some examples where the planets are seen to have a significantly greater degree of heat energy in the infrared spectrum than they are capable of receiving from the Sun. Several different models have been proposed in the mainstream for where this heat is coming from, and Bearden, Hoagland et al. have presented evidence that rules out these models. In the next figure, we see Bearden, Hoagland et al’s solution to the puzzle – namely that the amount of heat energy that each planet radiates out into space is directly related to how much movement is occurring in and around it. Figure 7.9 – Solar System-wide relationships between heat emissions and angular momentum. This model has confused many participants who discuss it on The Enterprise Mission’s discussion board. The key is in the fact that the amount of angular momentum that is calculated involves the body plus the satellites. The Earth rotates on its own axis, revolves around the Sun and also has the Moon in orbit. So, the figure of slightly more than 10^16 for the Earth on the bottom axis of the graph is the combined total of all the momentum in this system. Uranus, Neptune, Saturn and Jupiter’s specific angular momentum is also a function of the total amount of movement occurring within the planet itself and within all of its moons. It is clear from the graph that there is a very smooth relationship between the amount of momentum surrounding an object and its total heat emissions. Furthermore, it is clear that with the data we now have, the Sun appears not to fit into place along the same line. This discrepancy suggests that there must be at least one more planet in the Solar System that we have not yet found. Once all orbiting objects in our Solar System are known and accounted for, it is predicted that the Sun will also fit perfectly on this line. So how does this relate to quantum physics? It is actually rather simple. The more aetheric energy streams into an object or group of objects, the more angular momentum will go into the system. This energy relationship can be directly measured by the amount of light energy (luminosity) that the object is giving off, either in the visible or infrared spectrum. Such a relationship would be impossible if the planets were indeed separated from each other by “empty” space. However, in this model, known as Schuster’s Hypothesis, the more a planet or star moves through the aether, the more aether it gathers into itself. In our quantum model, we have the Biefield-Brown effect showing how negative charge in the electron clouds flows into the positively-charged nucleus. On a very tiny level, this atomic nucleus is actually a form of luminous plasma, just as we see in the sonoluminescence experiment, in thermal plasmas emanating from the Earth or in the Sun itself. The amount of luminous energy in the atomic nucleus is a direct function of how much aether is moving into it – and we can measure the amount of aether going into the nucleus as a function of angular momentum. So, this relationship between the Sun and planets shows that the Sun’s total energy output is directly related to the amount of movement in the surrounding planets, moons, comets and other matter. This movement represents how much of A1 and A2, the primary bodies of aetheric energy, is streaming into the object. 7.11 INDEPENDENT PROOF OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"If this aetheric model of the Solar System is indeed true, especially when looking at the precise phenomenon of Stoneking Resonance, then a very similar configuration would have to exist in all other planetary systems in order to be valid. As we reported in The Shift of the Ages, the very first extra- planetary system that humanity found with more than two planets was seen to have exactly the same characteristics as our own Solar System. Israeli astrophysicists T. Mazeh and I. Goldman have observed that the pulsar B1257+12 has at least three planets orbiting around it which have the same relative size ratios to each other as do Mercury, Venus and Earth. They also have the same relative distances from each other as do Mercury, Venus and Earth. This story was very quickly forgotten, but not before being reported by John Gribbin in The Guardian out of London, England: PLANET SYSTEM DISCOVERY REVEALS STRIKING SIMILARITIES By John Gribbin LONDON, from THE GUARDIAN -- The discovery of three planets orbiting a pulsar known as PSR B1257+12 has revealed a system with properties that almost exactly match those of the Inner Solar System, made up of Mercury, Venus and Earth. The similarities are so striking that it seems there may be a law of nature which ensures that planets always form in certain orbits and always have certain sizes; and it leads credence to the significance of a mathematical relationship [Bode’s Law] that relates the orbits of the planets in our Solar System, which many astronomers have dismissed as mere numerology. PSR B1257+12 is a rapidly spinning neutron star, containing slightly more matter than our Sun, packed into a sphere only about 10 kilometers across. As the star spins, it flicks a beam of radio noise around, like the beam of a lighthouse, producing regularly spaced pulses of radio noise detectable on Earth ... The three planets cannot be seen directly, but are revealed by the way in which they change the period of the pulsar’s pulses as they orbit around it. There is enough information revealed in the changing pulses to show that the three planets have masses roughly equal to 2.98 times the mass of the Earth, 3.4 times the mass of the Earth and 1.5 per cent of the mass of the Earth. And they are spaced, respectively, at distances from the pulsar equivalent to 47 per cent the distance from the Earth to the Sun, 36 per cent of the Sun-Earth distance, and 19 per cent of the Sun-Earth distance. The ratio of these distances [between the three observed planets, 1:0.77:0.4, is extremely close to the ratio of distances of the Earth, Venus and Mercury, which is 1:0.72:0.39. And the masses of the three inner planets of the Solar System are one Earth mass, 82 per cent of the mass of the Earth, and 5.5 percent of the mass of the Earth. In each case, two outer planets with roughly the same mass have an inner companion with a much smaller mass... The indications are that there is a universal mechanism for the formation of planets around stars. If it works for systems as diverse as a pulsar and our Sun, the chances are that it works for all stars and that “Solar” Systems very much like our own may be the rule, rather than the exception, among the stars of the Milky Way. Reprinted from Astro Net. Thus, as Gribbin said, it is easy to predict that all other multi-planetary systems that are discovered will also be ultimately found to have similar characteristics, since this is what was observed in B1257+12 on our very first try. The underlying mechanisms of planetary formation will be the same, regardless of where we look. Let us also not forget that since B1257+12 is a neutron star, it is exactly 34560 to the third power more dense than the average density of the Universe. 7.12 RHYTHMIC OSCILLATIONS OF ALPHA CENTAURI A AND R SCUTI We remember from earlier in this chapter that the Sun was determined to have a pulsation of exactly five minutes in duration. Another interesting fact is that Alpha Centauri A, the nearest bright star to our own Solar System, has been measured as having a surface pulsation that is exactly seven minutes in duration. This was discovered by F. Bouchy and F. Carrier at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), using the Coralie spectrograph. This is the first time that we have been able to detect such pulsations on a neighboring star, and again perfectly in line with the harmonic second. As the July 2001 article from BBC News indicated, It amounts to the star, 875,000 kilometres (544,000 miles) in radius, “breathing” in and out by only 40 metres (131 feet). To have the first extra-solar pulsation also be an even number of minutes in length is very compelling. The “Central Oscillator” model also suggests that multiple modes of vibration / pulsation will occur in certain stars simultaneously. This was seen in the Sun with the various harmonic pulses from 5 to 160 minutes in length, and has now been noted not just in Alpha Centauri A, but with the brightness variations of the star R Scuti as well. This next excerpt from Physics News says that R Scuti shows “chaotic,” or fractal patterns of oscillation, suggesting two or more different vibrational modes that are occurring at the same time. Here, we should remember that the term “chaos” is synonymous with “hidden order” in the language of Chaos theory: From Physics News: CHAOTIC PULSATING STAR: Detailed observations of the star R Scuti show that its fluctuating light emissions conform to the mathematical definition of chaos (J. Robert Buchler et al., Physical Review Letters, 6 February 1995). According to Zoltan Kollath of the University of Florida, this is the first strong evidence for chaotic emissions from a star. He and his colleagues assembled data taken over 15 years by numerous astronomers. They deduce from the star's light curve (emission as a function of time) the notion that the complex pulsation variability might result from the overlap of as few as two different vibrational modes in the star. (Science News, 18 February 1995.) It appears very likely that further observations of this nature will continue to reveal the importance of the second as a unit of time for pulsation again and again. 7.13 PROOF FOR THE SECOND AS A UNIVERSAL TIME QUANTUM And now, with the proper additional information in place, we return to the proof for our argument that the unit of time we call the second is indeed a universal standard of vibration. First of all, we know that our 24-hour day / 60-minute hour / 60-second minute system for measuring time came from the Sumerians. The work of Zecharia Sitchin, Lloyd Pye and others has brought widespread awareness to the extra-terrestrial aid that was given to the ancient Sumerian culture by the Annunaki or Nefilim, who are known as “Those who from Heaven to Earth Came.” In both of our previous works we have seen that as a unit of time, the second “just so happens” to unify all movements in the Cosmos. The three key points are: The Constant of Nineveh was found on the Sumerian clay tablets and decoded by NASA astrophysicist Maurice Chatelain, who dealt with gigantic orbital calculations for the Apollo missions. The Constant of Nineveh shows that all planetary orbits are perfect sub-divisions of one master cycle. This cycle is expressed as a value of seconds that is exactly 70 multiplied seven times by 60, or (70*60)^7. Every known body in our Solar System has a perfect number of orbital cycles within this master number, right down to the second! A simple analogy for each planet would be how twelve eggs fit exactly into an egg carton; a certain number of each of the planetary orbital cycles will fit perfectly into the Nineveh Constant, with not even one second remaining. For example, Pluto has 25,000 cycles in the Nineveh constant and Halley’s Comet has 81,000 cycles. The Nineveh Constant is very roughly around 6.2 million years in length. The Nineveh Constant is also a sub-harmonic of even longer numbers recorded in the Mayan codices. The Wilcock Constant harmonically interconnects all the orbits of every object in the entire Galaxy in precisely the same way that the Nineveh Constant unifies the Solar System. This number is exactly 0.7 multiplied nine times by 60, or (.7*60)^9. This number forms an exact figure, in seconds, for the true time that it takes the Galaxy to spin once on its axis, coming in just slightly under the commonly-cited value of 225 million years at very roughly 223.5 million years. Furthermore, the Wilcock Constant is exactly 36 times larger than the Constant of Nineveh. It is highly likely that further discoveries will confirm that this Galactic Constant is the master cycle for all planetary systems; these discoveries will be made by super-light speed space-travel technology that is already available, and whose theoretical basis is given in the previous volume. The Universal Constant was first seen in the work of Dr. Henry B. Myers, whose detailed mathematical analyses suggest that the entire Universal Sphere only makes one complete rotation during its entire life cycle. Myers’ calculations, integrating scientific knowledge with that of the ancient Hindu Vedas, show us that the true theoretical age cycle of the Universe is extremely close to being exactly 120 Wilcock Constants in length, or very roughly 26 billion, 820 million years. Myers estimates that we are only about halfway through this cycle at the present time. Myers’ work also demonstrates that the ancient Vedic astronomers were aware of this cycle as well. There is absolutely no possibility that any of these constants could be ‘accidental’, given their known precision; they are directly a function of the perfect vibrations of the second from the “heartbeat” of the Great Central Sun. We should never lose sight of the fact that all of these master constants are merely harmonic functions of 7 and 6 (i.e. 70 or 0.7 and 60) vibrating against each other, using the second as their basic interval of time. We will see the importance of the second when we study the vibrations of music as well, which will be explored later. Dr. O. Crane has concluded that the fastest speed for the Universal central oscillator is 10^23 cycles per second, in order to account for our observations of the quantum realm. As Crane says, The frequency of 10^23 Hz yields the elementary length of 10^-13 cm, and likewise we have the elementary time period of 10^-23 seconds."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"What Crane apparently did not see is that the pulsations must indeed be an exact harmonic subdivision of the second. 7.14 PROOF OF “LOCAL” CHANGES One of the predictions that can be made from this model is that when a higher density of energy is fed into a spherical-vortex system, such as our Solar System in this case, we would expect that system to absorb this energy and undergo some very fundamental changes. We briefly alluded to some of the changes in our Solar System that have been observed in the introduction, but in the next chapter we will cover them in specific detail, along with more layers of proof to suggest that these changes must be caused by our movement into an area of higher energetic density in the galaxy.

The phenomenon of “synchronicity” has again occurred just two nights before we post the entire Part One of this book online for the public, on Tuesday, June 04, 2002. As posted on the Drudge Report [46], then later in the mainstream press [45], suddenly it’s official: the US government says “global warming” is real. In a stunning U-turn for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report to the United Nations detailing “specific and far-reaching effects” that it says “global warming will inflict” on the American environment... Also for the first time – the White House places “most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions – mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” the NEW YORK TIMES is planning to report on Monday Page Ones, according to publishing sources... [emphasis added] The United States will be substantially changed in the next few decades, claims the Bush report. The United States will “very likely” be seeing the “disruption of snow-fed water supplies, more stifling heat waves and the permanent disappearance of Rocky Mountain meadows and coastal marshes... The new report’s predictions present a sharp contrast to the administration’s previous statements on climate change, in which President Bush always spoke in generalities and stressed the need for much more research to resolve scientific questions.” Despite these often-discussed changes, only a very small number of people, mostly Russian scientists, are aware that the entire Solar System(heliosphere) is experiencing these changes. [15] “Global warming” from CFCs and fossil fuel usage is actually only a minor player in the changes that are now occurring. This chapter of our book will present the case for the energetic transformation of the Solar System in a form never before seen worldwide, prior to the exact day that the US government came clean. As with the rest of this book, we ask that we be credited for compiling this data as it now stands, and linked to DivineCosmos . The burning desire for an answer has produced many conflicting ideas about what is causing these ever-increasing changes. Outside of government admissions of “global warming,” the theories that have propagated in the Internet metaphysical subculture do not require much scientific substantiation, simply a general feeling of impending doom coupled with a great degree of faith. As one popular example, a relatively uncommon planetary alignment on May 5, 2000 was heavily hyped up as being the trigger-point for Earth crustal displacement / pole shift, “the ultimate disaster.” Asteroids are said to be"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"about to strike the Earth. And more recently, legitimate research by Zecharia Sitchin has been combined with intuitively “channeled” speculation that the missing planet Nibiru is about to make a close pass to Earth in 2003. This mythical scenario has been used as a catch-all to explain away the changes we now experience. Dr. Sitchin himself has calculated that the planet Nibiru shall not return until some time after 2160 AD. [47] One would expect that such a massive object enjoying an established 3,600-year orbit would now be glaringly visible, with less than a year before it screams into our lives, larger than the Moon in the night sky. Yet, no observational evidence exists, only shadowy rumors of conspiracy and “leaks” from nameless “informants” in the astrophysics community. Furthermore, a naturally-orbiting planet would certainly not be capable of causing such massive energetic surges throughout the entire heliosphere, which is the combined entity of the Sun’s massive magnetic field and all orbiting bodies within it. Indeed, an outside source of energy is required to explain the anomalies that we are now witnessing. However, most people who already believe in Nibiru 2003 will probably not be open to alternative perspectives until some time after the popping of champagne corks and a collective sigh of relief on Jan. 1, 2004. In this chapter, we will make the strongest single case ever that our Solar System (heliosphere) is moving into an area of higher aetheric energy density within the local interstellar medium, or LISM. [15] NASA would loosely define the LISM as “the space medium (i.e. aetheric energy in this model) between the stars in our local area of the galaxy.” In our model, this could be roughly thought of as a “Dimensional Shift” that is already underway, though the term “matter-energy density shift” is preferable. As we move into this new field of energy in the galaxy, tremendous changes occur in the Sun, the planets and the Sun’s gigantic magnetic field which surrounds the entire system – and human pollution-induced “Global Warming” has very little influence on this process. [This new model has major differences from the channeled “Photon Belt” theory as well, and should not be seen as supporting most aspects of it, such as the “Manasic Ring.”] 8.2 THE BREAKTHROUGHS OF DR. ALESKEY DMITRIEV A good portion of the material in this chapter was gleaned from the work by Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev entitled Planetophysical State of the Earth and Life, which was originally authored in 1997 and updated and translated into English in 1998. [15] Dr. Dmitriev is a professor of geology and mineralogy and the chief scientific member of the United Institute of Geology, Geophysics and Mineralogy within the Siberian department of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Dmitriev is an expert on global ecology and fast-processing Earth events, and a series of his articles have been translated into English and posted at www.tmgnow.com. Much of the material in this chapter is also similar in its sequence and factual content to our Friday night science presentation in the Time of Global Shift National Seminar Tour. [44] Dmitriev’s study begins by pointing out that the now government- acknowledged changes in the basic physics and behaviors of the Earth are becoming irreversible. Strong evidence suggests that these changes are caused by our movement into what Dmitriev calls “a highly charged material and energetic non-uniformity”, or what we would refer to as a higher density"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"of aetheric energy, in nearby (local) interstellar space (the LISM). This previously unforeseen, highly charged energetic material is now being absorbed into the interplanetary area of our Solar System, creating “hybrid processes and excited energy states in all planets, as well as the Sun.” The observable effects of this transformation on Earth include an acceleration in our magnetic pole shift, a change in the vertical and horizontal content and distribution of ozone in the atmosphere and an ever-increasing magnitude and frequency of major catastrophic events. [15] One important point that Dmitriev stresses is that this is not just his own hypothesis: A greater number of specialists in climatology, geophysics, planetophysics and heliophysics are tending towards a cosmic causative sequence version for what is happening. Indeed, events of the last decade give strong evidence of unusually significant heliospheric and planetophysical transformations. [emphasis added] Furthermore, Dmitriev acknowledges that the changes we have observed are forcing a completely different and more highly integrated view of the Cosmos to the discussion table. In this new model, The climatic and biosphere processes here on Earth (through a tightly connected feedback system) are directly impacted by, and linked back to, the general overall transformational processes taking place in our Solar System. We must begin to organize our attention and thinking to understand that climatic changes on Earth are only one part, or link, in a whole chain of events taking place in the Heliosphere. [emphasis added] The case for such an energetic interconnectedness has already been well established in our previous chapters. Another important quote says that “these tendencies [of rapid catastrophic changes on Earth] may be traced in the direction of a growth in planetary energy capacity (capacitance), which leads to a highly excited or charged state in some of Earth’s systems.” In the aetheric cosmology that we have presented so far in this book, any spherical vortex of aether, such as the Earth’s luminous plasma core, is capable of absorbing and discharging energy much like a capacitor would do in an electronic circuit. As established in previous chapters, luminous plasma has strong electromagnetic as well as torsion-field (gravispin) radiation. Dmitriev concludes that “the most intense transformations [in the Solar System] are taking place in the planetary gas-plasma envelopes,” and that these transformations are directly associated with how life on Earth (the biosphere) is able to function. A “gas-plasma envelope” is the combined entity of the layers of our atmosphere, our ionosphere of “charged particles”, and the planet’s magnetic field composition, such as the Van Allen belts. This “excess energy run-off” is becoming increasingly visible in the following ways: • In the ionosphere by plasma generation. • In the magnetosphere by magnetic storms. • In the atmosphere by cyclones. All of these high-energy atmospheric phenomena are “now becoming more frequent, intense and changed in [their] nature. The material composition of the gas-plasma envelope is also being transformed.” All of these points will be"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"touched upon again later in the chapter. One of Dmitriev’s key concerns in this study is the effect that these changes will have on all lifeforms on the Earth. Using very carefully crafted language, Dmitriev ultimately shows an appreciation for the fact that these changes could lead to a spontaneous mass evolution of humanity as we now know it, creating “new and deeper qualities of life” with “new organismic possibilities of perfection”: The adaptive responses of the biosphere, and humanity, to these new conditions may lead to a total global revision of the range of species and life on Earth. New and deeper qualities of life itself may come forth, bringing the new physical state of the Earth into an equilibrium with the new organismic possibilities of development, reproduction and perfection... The current period of transformation is transient, and the transition of life’s representatives to the future may take place only after a deep evaluation of what it will take to comply with these new Earthly biospheric conditions ... Therefore, it is not only the climate that is becoming new, but we as human beings are experiencing a global change in the vital processes of living organisms, or life itself; which is yet another link in the total process. We cannot treat such things separately or individually. [emphasis added] Part Two of this book will deal specifically with the connection between aetheric energy, consciousness and biology, which will help us understand the truth behind Dmitriev’s words. We will establish that the changes we are now witnessing are identical to previous phases of mass evolution of conscious lifeforms on Earth, as per Steven Jay Gould’s theory of “punctuated equilibrium.” These energetic changes do directly affect the structure of the DNA molecule. 8.3 CHANGES IN THE LOCAL INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM (LISM) A variety of Russian scientists have concluded that we are moving into a higher area of aetheric density in the LISM, which is the single most important factor that is responsible for the observed Solar System changes in this model. As seen from the Earth, our Heliosphere is traveling in the direction of the Solar Apex in the constellation Hercules. According to Dmitriev in 1997, Dmitriev & Mahatmas in 1995 and Kruzhevskii, Petrov & Shestopalov in 1993, since the 1960’s the Heliosphere has drifted into an area of the LISM that contains: ...[new] non-homogeneities [i.e. higher concentrations] of matter and energy containing ions [charged particles] of Hydrogen, Helium and Hydroxyl in addition to other elements and combinations. This kind of interstellar space dispersed plasma is presented by magnetized strip structures and striations. [emphasis added] Western scientists may innately distrust the idea that there could be “magnetized strip structures and striations” in the LISM that would contain such charged particles. However, in this aetheric model we expect to see the same structures appearing on all levels of size. Figure 7.1 showed the Parker Spiral formation as it appears in our Solar System, and by the fractal principle there must be a similar formation in the galaxy. Figure 8.1 shows an overhead view of the Parker Spiral in the Solar System, with concentric circles indicating"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"the positions of the planetary orbits: Figure 8.2 – Overhead view of Parker Spiral energetic structure in Solar System. (Courtesy NASA) Each curving arm of the Parker Spiral that we see in Figure 8.2 does indeed represent a “magnetized strip” or “striation”, where there is a detectable increase in magnetic energy and charged plasma as our planet moves through it. Dmitriev’s evidence, as well as our own, clearly indicates that this structure must also exist at the galactic level, by virtue of the fractal, harmonic interconnectedness of the Cosmos. From here, Dmitriev’s quote continues: The Heliosphere [solar system] transition through this structure has led to an increase of the shock wave in front of the Solar System from 3 to 4 AU, to 40 AU or more [1000% increase.] The “shock wave” that Dmitriev is referring to here is what is known as the “termination shock,” and we can see it illustrated in Figure 8.3:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Figure 8.3 – Energetic activity of the Heliosphere, showing 70-100 AU termination shock. One can assume from Dmitriev’s wording that this termination shock of luminous plasma was measured at 4AU [i.e. four times the distance from the Sun to the Earth] by Russian astrophysicists in the early 1960s, and once the hydrogen, helium, hydroxyl and other charged particle combinations became more prevalent later in the 1960s, the size and brightness of the termination shock also increased, now by a factor of over 1000 percent. Similar research did not begin in the United States until 1978, according to Prof. D.E. Shemansky, [35] so Russian scientists had this information well in advance of NASA. Obviously, this extra brightness at the leading edge of the heliosphere is created much in the same way that the bottom of the Space Shuttle or a meteorite will become red-hot as it drifts from the low-density vacuum of space into the higher-density atmosphere of the Earth. In more technical terms, Dmitriev goes on to explain what this 1000-percent or higher increase in the excitation of this magnetic boundary really means: This shock wave thickening has caused the formation of a collusive plasma in a parietal layer, which has led to a plasma overdraft around the Solar System, and then to its breakthrough into interplanetary domains [5,6]. This"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"breakthrough constitutes a kind of matter and energy donation made by interplanetary space to our Solar System. What this passage is essentially telling us is that a new layer of luminous plasma has been formed that surrounds the Solar System and is now flowing into the Sun, planets and interplanetary space, raising the overall levels of energetic activity that we have observed. Subsequent sections of this chapter will detail the specifics of this energetic change. However, before we begin surveying the surrounding evidence, it is interesting to research the big question on many Western readers’ minds: “If this is really happening, then why hasn’t NASA ever talked about it?” As we shall see, according to one distinguished Ph.D., [35] NASA seems to have a “persistent, pernicious bias” against any discussion of this heliospheric change, and will automatically assume, without question, that the LISM must maintain a “uniform density.” Other, more esoteric-sounding explanations are proposed for the observed luminosity and energetic increases, such as “re- accelerated solar wind,” that do not have the simplicity and elegance of Dmitriev et al’s model. One rare exception to the rule of “unchanging LISM density” that we found was in a 1999 interview with Gary P. Zank at the University of Delaware. [42] In this interview, Dr. Zank proposes that if the LISM density were to change, then catastrophe might result, and we “may not know when it was coming:” “We’re surrounded by hot gas,” he said. “As our sun moves through extremely ‘empty’ or low-density interstellar space, the solar wind produces a protective bubble – the heliosphere around our solar system, which allows life to flourish on Earth. Unfortunately, we could bump into a small cloud at any time, and we probably won’t see it coming. Without the heliosphere, neutral hydrogen would interact with our atmosphere, possibly producing catastrophic climate changes, while our exposure to deadly cosmic radiation in the form of very high-energy cosmic rays would increase.” Zank used the SDSC CRAY T90 in a study of the heliosphere, the envelope of solar wind that surrounds the solar system. Two effects included in the simulation ensure that the interaction of the solar wind with the local interstellar medium (LISM) is not stationary. The solar wind ram pressure varies on an 11-year time scale, and strong shocks are present during all phases of the solar cycle (although their frequency can vary)... Zank’s calculations suggest that existing instruments might not detect an increase in the LISM sufficient to compress or collapse the heliosphere before the actual interaction had begun. [emphasis added] Dr. Zank believes that we may encounter a random cloud of higher energy density in the LISM, whereas the galactic Parker Spiral model seems more plausible, since the same energetic structure has already been proven to exist in the Solar System. One key confession that we can glean from Dr. Zank’s advanced research is that our existing instruments are not sensitive enough to detect a significant increase in the LISM density before we actually enter it. Therefore, it seems rather foolish for most Western heliophysicists to assume that the LISM must maintain a uniform density, if our instruments are not sophisticated enough to prove it. More evidence to support this point comes"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"forth from the European Southern Observatory (ESO): ...unfortunately there are no direct ways to measure the local interstellar electron (or proton) density, nor the local interstellar magnetic field, while these two parameters govern the structure and size of our heliosphere. Therefore, there is a need for indirect observationswhich can bring stringent constraints on the plasma density and the shape and size of the interface to allow for the choice of an adequate theoretical model. [emphasis added] [16] Despite the ESO’s stated need for “indirect observations” of the density of the LISM, such as those reported by Dmitriev, it is almost always assumed that the LISM must have an unchanging density for any “adequate theoretical model.” [16] Another example of “LISM density increase denial” would be in a paper by R.A Mewaldt from Caltech. [23] In the following quote, it is clearly acknowledged that Voyager 1 and 2 have detected anomalous “enhancements in the low- energy spectra” of the heliosphere. However, an increase in the density of the LISM is never mentioned as even a possible “seed population” for these energetic enhancements: Suggested seed populations include solar energetic particles (RSEPs), re- accelerated solar wind (RSW), and ions energized by co-rotating interaction regions. These re-accelerated components provide a possible explanation for enhancements in the low-energy spectra of Mg, Si, S and other elements observed by Voyager 1 & 2 beyond 60 AU (Stone and Cummings 1997; Cummings and Stone 1999). There are also unexpected and unexplained increases in the low-energy spectra of several elements reported at 1 AU (e.g., Takashima et al. 1997; Klecker et al. 1998; Reames 1999). [emphasis added] So, from this study it is very clear to see that Western heliophysicists have indeed discovered “anomalous, unexpected and unexplained increases” in the energetic activity at the termination shock of the heliosphere, as we have expected from Dmitriev’s model. Yet, instead of admitting that the LISM density might have changed, they simply “consider new estimates of the neutral populations of elements in the ISM”, among other complex and problematic explanations that are only possible, not proven. No matter what models for “re-accelerating” solar energy are proposed, the fact is that energy must be conserved. The simplest explanation for the increase in the heliosphere’s energetic charge is that it is being added by an outside source. One professor, Dr. D.E. Shemansky of the University of Southern California, has dared to make a particularly bold statement about this problem, suggesting that there is a deliberate effort in place by NASA to avoid any discussion of his “first evidence” for a “large increase” in the energetic density of the LISM [35]: Research on the properties of the Local Interstellar medium have been carried out in scattered periods beginning in 1978. The NASA Space Physics Division has shown a persistent pernicious bias against work on the effects of the neutral gas in the LISM in the United States, from the time of the formation of the Division... The most important contributions to research in this program are papers (48), which presents a calibration independent method of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"determining absolute LISM density, and (89), which presents the first evidence for a large increase in the LISM neutral atomic hydrogen density from Voyager measurements of the 50 AU region... [emphasis added] It is certainly interesting that Dr. Shemansky would say that NASA has displayed a “persistent, pernicious bias” against this work. The Microsoft Word 2000 thesaurus indicates that the word “pernicious” is synonymous with “destructive, harmful, deadly, evil” and “insidious.” So, the question must be asked: Why would there be a “deadly” and “insidious” interest on the part of NASA in not asking these crucial questions about an LISM density increase? The answer might well be found in the studies from Russia such as those of Dr. Dmitriev, where it is well-established that this LISM density increase is underway, and that it is causing massive energetic changes throughout our entire heliosphere. These changes fit perfectly with worldwide ancient prophecies, including those of the Judeo-Christian Bible, describing events that would transpire in “end times,” or what other cultures referred to as “the dawning of the Golden Age.” It is undeniable that the media ridicules and ignores the UFO question, evidence of sunken ancient cities, Martian monuments and the like. [39] The door has now opened a crack with the admission of “Global Warming,” but the massive changes in the Sun and planets are discarded footnotes. Another clear area of suppression is in the real meaning of “redshift,” which holds the key to giving us a complete model to prove that changes in LISM density can and must exist: 8.4 “REDSHIFT” ENERGY VALUES AND AETHERIC DENSITY LEVELS"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Figure 8.4 – Dr. William Tifft’s “quantized” changes in “redshift” microwave data. Indeed, a complete mathematical model already exists that can be combined with direct observational evidence to prove that galaxies must have regular, organized changes in their LISM density levels. In the book Seeing Red, the respected and controversial astrophysicist Dr. Halton Arp has shown rigorous, voluminous evidence to prove that “redshift” has nothing to do with the distance of a celestial object, as is currently believed. [30, 31, 37, 38] Simply put, redshift is a measurement of how much of the microwave spectrum of reflected starlight shines near the ‘red’ end of the ‘rainbow.’ Sir Edwin Hubble proposed a theory that seemed plausible at the time, since it appeared that the farther an object was from the Earth, the higher its redshift. Arousing similar controversy, Dr. William Tifft has proven that redshift is “quantized,” meaning that it only occurs in certain regular harmonic intervals, as seen in Figure 8.4. [1] Another proof for Tifft’s discovery can be seen in the graph of quasar data in Figure 8.5 [38]:"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" Figure 8.5 – Quantized values for ‘redshift’ in nearby quasars. Clearly, if the wavelengths in Figure 8.5 were an indication of distance, and all redshift values only fall into certain exact intervals with nothing whatsoever in between, then it would imply that the Earth was the center of the Universe. All quasars in the Universe would naturally have to fall into discrete “shells” of distance away from the Earth, as seen in Figure 8.6. [38] This places us right back into the medieval “geocentric” models of the Universe! Figure 8.6 – The Earth- centered Universe as seen from the mainstream redshift theory. (Courtesy J Talbot)"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Simple common-sense knowledge of our position in the Galaxy would tell us that the Earth is not the center of the Universe; the major problem that we then face is that redshift is the primary method that astrophysicists use to calculate the distances of celestial objects. What we are faced with, instead, is a very strange anomaly that screams of “harmonics”, the basic vibratory patterns of sound in any given medium, which we would expect to see in aetheric models of the Cosmos. [39] For our next key point, let us not forget that the luminous plasma formations observed by Dr. Erling Strand in Norway, (discussed in Chapter Five,) would spontaneously appear and disappear from view, with a temperature as hot as the Sun one second and no measurable temperature the next. Yet, throughout this entire time, the plasma formations could still be tracked on radar and / or in the infrared spectrum. We have concluded that these plasma formations are oscillating between two major levels of aetheric density, namely our own level and the level directly above our own. (Most thinkers would erroneously call these density levels “dimensions.”) [39] When the plasma moves (displaces) into the higher density, its visibility and immense heat disappears, but it still emits higher-spectrum wavelengths such as infrared and very probably microwave as well. Therefore, when we see even, quantized harmonic values for all the microwave radiation that we observe from distant celestial objects, it is certainly plausible that this could be a sign of changing levels of aetheric energy density. The final proof comes from Dr. Harold Aspden of Cambridge University, who has indeed mathematically proven that the aether has varying levels of density, creating what he calls “space domains.” [1] He describes each different level of interstellar medium (ISM) density as follows, and we have paraphrased in brackets to ease comprehension: One can say that... each [aetheric density level] corresponds to the number of electrons and positrons that can be created as a group [after] an aether particle [is annihilated] and the aether space thereby vacated [is then filled up by the electrons and positrons]... there are many such different domain regions in the whole expanse of the universe.[emphasis added] So, an “aether particle” is the same as what Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg has called a “field bubble” in Chapter Two. According to Aspden’s theory, the denser the LISM will be, the smaller the “aether particles” will be in that area, since they are under greater pressure. If an “aether particle” is then annihilated, a sudden empty space is formed, and electrons (photons) and positrons will rush into the empty space. The electrons (photons) and positrons do not change in size, so less of them would fit into a smaller space than would fit into a larger space. Dr. Aspden’s data shows that only a certain exact number of positrons and electrons can fit in such an empty space, once it has been created. For each density, the number of particles that will fit in the empty “field bubble” of space is known as “N,” and it has a maximum value of 1843, which is the number for our own density. The density above our own has an N of 1842, the next has an N of 1841, and so on, since the field bubbles in each new density are smaller than the previous density. As can be studied in more detail on Aspden’s site, the mathematics behind this statement are quite involved, but"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"his data provides a perfect means to calculate formerly unsolved mystery numbers in the quantum realm, such as the fine-structure constant, (see Ch. 2-3 of this book,) at the “part-per-million level of precision.” Furthermore, this work was deemed worthy of being published in the prestigious Physics Letters A in 1972. [2] Here’s the simplified punch line: when Dr. Aspden first saw Tifft’s quantized redshift values, he realized that they were identical ( ! ) to the values that corresponded to aetheric density levels in his model. [1] Yet, when Aspden tried to publish a follow-up to his original 1972 paper in Physics Letters A, complete with the direct observational evidence from Dr. Tifft to prove that these areas of higher density exist now in the Universe,the paper was anonymously rejected as “numerological” and all further appeals failed – even though his new paper only added direct, visible evidence to what had already been accepted and published in the same journal in 1972. The falsely rejected paper can still be read on Aspden’s website in Tutorial 10, complete with his rebuttals to their criticism. In conclusion, Aspden makes the following interesting speculations: As can be verified, the 72.5 km/s steps reported from astronomical observation are in precise accordance with the theory under discussion... Such domains [of aetheric energy density] have bearing on geological events such as geomagnetic field reversals, [which occur] as the solar system transits through boundaries separating adjacent space domains. [emphasis added] Naturally, this connection between aetheric density and geological events is exactly the same as the conclusions being made by Dmitriev et al, with Aspden providing a solid, mathematical model that dramatically strengthens the case. Even more significantly, on page 764 of The Vital Vastness – Volume Two by Richard Pasichnyk, we read the following: High redshift is usually connected with features pointing to the youth of a galaxy. Redshift is also a function of the positions in the systems, which indicates strong intergalactic fields that influence redshifts. Likewise, individual galaxies display redshift gradients from their inner to far limits. [emphasis added] [31] Since we were obviously quite interested in this data point, Pasichnyk communicated to us that this “galactic redshift gradient” discovery was actually published by astrophysics graduate students, since the mainstream would never allow such work to get through. Nonetheless, further observational research will undoubtedly only serve to confirm this data ever more concretely than before. This effectively proves the existence of a Parker Spiral-type formation of changing aetheric energy levels in the Galaxy, as can be visualized in Figure 8.2. Pasichnyk then continues by saying that the amount of redshift that is emanating from the core of our own Milky Way Galaxy is of an almost unimaginably massive strength, compared to any conventional explanations: A redshift field is also found in the plane of the Milky Way with what conventional theory would call an “expansion” (Hubble constant) that is ten"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"times higher than the Universe as a whole. [emphasis added] With the Arp / Tifft / Asdpen model in place, this proves that the Galactic Center is by far the greatest source of aetheric / torsion-field energy in the Galaxy, as we have already proposed in our own model, laid out in the previous chapters. Now that we know that these aetheric energy levels can and must exist in the interstellar medium of our galaxy, and that there appears to be an ongoing, quite deliberate effort to suppress this information by NASA, Physics Letters A and other mainstream Western sources, we are ready to continue examining the direct physical proof of the changes that this event is producing. Though much of this material comes from Dr. Dmitriev, we have also added additional research data to strengthen the case even more. The Earth, the Sun, the planets and the space between the planets are all showing major signs of energetic change as the higher-density energy of the LISM continues to stream into the heliosphere in greater and greater concentrations. 8.5 ENERGETIC CHANGES OF THE EARTH Figure 8.7 – Earthquake Activity over 2.5 on the Richter scale, 1973-1998 (Courtesy Michael Mandeville) As the Bush administration now acknowledges publicly, it is evident that “specific, far-reaching effects” are underway on Earth that will “substantially change the United States in the next few decades.” Going well beyond the “global warming” content of the Bush administration’s report, we know that"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"our weather patterns have become increasingly chaotic, damaging and unpredictable. We have hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, mudslides, floods, droughts, and other catastrophes occurring on an ever-increasing basis. As one example, the awesome mid-1990’s Hurricane Andrew was almost as large as the entire state of Texas. One could argue that the unchained force of nature is a far wider threat to Americans than terrorism. Dr. Alexey Dmitriev’s calculations suggest that: The dynamic growth of significant catastrophes shows a major increase in the rate of production since 1973. And in general, the number of catastrophes has grown by 410 percent between 1963 and 1993. [emphasis added] [15] Based on the surge in activity that has been seen since this study was made, we can assume that a more updated statistic may now be as high as 600 percent. And again, this exhaustively-researched figure includes all forms of catastrophe, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, et cetera. Yet, no mainstream source would appear to be willing to make such a bold statement at this point, since “global warming” is ruled out. Along the same lines, a researcher named Michael Mandeville has clearly shown that worldwide, the number of earthquakes over 2.5 on the Richter scale have increased by as much as 400 percent since 1973, as seen in Figure 8.7. [22] Furthermore,Figure 8.8 shows that volcanic activity has also seen an almost 500-percent increase between 1875 and 1993. [22] Figure"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"8.8 – Worldwide volcanic activity increases 1875-1993. (Courtesy Michael Mandeville) These statistics can also be examined farther back in time as well. Before we had modern seismic equipment, the severity of an earthquake was measured by the number of people who were killed. Based on this measurement scale, in 1999 the National Earthquake Information Center of Russia published a list of the 21 most severe earthquakes in the world since 856 AD. Fully nine out of the 21 biggest quakes since 856 AD were in the 20th century. [36] This study was mentioned by Dr. Sergey Smelyakov and will become a key aspect of discussions in Part Two. Now we must keep in mind how unusual all of these changes are, from a conventional scientific standpoint, as they represent “action-at-a-distance.” As we established in Chapter Five, we believe that the primary cause for earthquake activity is energetic increases in the core. When these increases occur very rapidly, due to a sudden Solar emission, some of the luminous plasma in the core is compressed into a higher aetheric energy density level by the intense surrounding pressures. Such a density shift allows the plasma to move freely through third-density matter. This hyper-compressed plasma then bubbles up through the Earth’s mantle, and once the pressure is relieved, it displaces back down into the density of “physical matter.” A great explosive force is created as this intense heat is then released in a much cooler area, and this would certainly have an impact on geophysical activity, both for earthquakes and volcanoes. We remember from the beginning of this chapter that Dr. Dmitriev reports that there are also changes occurring in our “planetary gas-plasma envelopes” that are not being caused by human pollution. [15] New plasma is being generated in the ionosphere, greater magnetic storms are appearing in the magnetosphere, and cyclones are increasing in the atmosphere. Dmitriev also indicated that “the material composition of the gas-plasma envelopes” of the planets is also changing. More specifically, on Earth we have seen a significant new growth of HO2 (hydroperoxyl) gas at an altitude of 11 miles, which is completely inexplicable by any known source or mechanism, including ozone depletion or human pollution via “global warming.” [15] A separate Russian study confirmed that the total amount of cloud cover across the globe has significantly increased just in the last century. Additionally, ESO reported in 1994 that two new, unexpected populations of cosmic particles have been discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts that surround the earth [4]: 1 A new sheaf of electrons, greater than 50MeV in density, is now being injected into the Earth’s inner magnetosphere during times of abrupt solar magnetic storms known as Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs. 2 A new belt is emerging in the Van Allen radiation bands around the Earth. This new belt contains ionic elements that were traditionally found only in the composition of stars. According to Dmitriev, these anomalies are directly being caused by a newly changed quality of interplanetary space, which he feels is acting as a transmission mechanism to allow the planets to interact with the Sun and heliosphere to greater degrees than ever before. [In our model, based on Kozyrev, Mishin, Shnoll [39] and other researchers’ discoveries, torsion"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"radiation will automatically provide such functions.] Even more importantly, This newly changed quality of interplanetary space... exerts stimulating and programming action upon the Solar activity, both in its maximal and minimal phases. What Dmitriev is trying to tell us here is that this highly-charged energy in the space between the planets has formed a two-way “circuit” that allows events on Earth to affect the Sun, not just the other way around. Returning to the Earth itself, another curious anomaly that we observe is the phenomenon of La Nina or El Nino. On many weather satellite photographs, such as in Figure 8.9, there is clear infrared data to show that a massive sub- surface heating of the Earth’s oceans is now occurring: Figure 8.9 – Massive sub-surface temperature anomalies in the Earth’s oceans. (Courtesy NOAA) Solar radiation is by no means strong enough to cause this heating, as these temperature anomalies emerge deep beneath the surface of the oceans. This suggests that the oceans are being heated from within the earth itself. [3] Furthermore, Dr. Dmitriev has shown that the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field rises up and down in direct synchronization with these temperature changes in the ocean. Furthermore, there is a 0.22 degrees C change in worldwide temperatures over the course of 30 days that correlates precisely with changes in the middle frequency of Earth’s magnetic field. [15] Hence, the Earth’s core of luminous, magnetized plasma is directly responsible for these changes. As the pressure of the plasma suddenly increases, there is a surge in the strength of its magnetic field and a rise in its thermal level, rising the ocean temperatures. Similarly, the Novosibirsk Klyuchi Observatory in Russia has reported that the height of the magnetic field is growing by up to 30 nanoteslas per year, again showing changes in the core. This increasing heat energy of the Earth’s core can also be seen in the rapid"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"melting of our polar icecaps. The Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica, which is as large as the state of Rhode Island, fully broke off and dropped into the ocean in the year 2000, as have several others in the last decade. This process has greatly accelerated in speed throughout 2002, with three gigantic chunks breaking away from the continent in only a few months of time, the two most recent being named C-18 and C-19. This news is becoming so prevalent that even the Bush Administration finally had to come forward and admit that “something is happening.” The magnetic poles have been rapidly shifting their positions as well, leading up to what many authorities believe will be a complete shift in their north- south orientation. As frequently reported on the Art Bell international radio program, our own Magnetic North is drifting away from its normal position at an ever-increasing speed. This is occurring so fast that airports all over the world are having to repaint their runways to follow the Earth’s changing magnetic field, since airplanes must use compasses to land. It has been suggested that this can also be seen in significant changes to the navigational patterns drawn into airline flight maps over just a ten-year period from 1990 to 2000, though we have not seen this personally. This magnetic change is also affecting the animal kingdom. Massive numbers of marine animals have been anomalously beaching themselves, and many other migratory animals, birds and fish are becoming confused and breaking their normal migration patterns. Dramatic cases of mass bird deaths have also been reported in the last few years, with no concrete explanations offered. As one example of avian migratory confusion, in 1999, radio talk show host Art Bell and collaborator Linda Moulton Howe reported on two different homing pigeon races that were conducted on the East Coast, where a completely unprecedented number of the pigeons became hopelessly lost while traveling along a well-known route, and never returned. Furthermore, in Coming Earth Changes: The Evidence, Dr. William Hutton reveals that Earth’s inner core not only rotates faster than the outer core, but it actually rotates at a different angle than the outside of the Earth. [17] This certainly suggests that a shift in orientation has already occurred on the inside of the Earth and will soon complete itself on the outside as well. Dr. Dmitriev and others remind us that as the Earth’s magnetic poles continue to drift, they are traveling through a “magnetic pole shift corridor,” which is a narrow strip that they have always followed in the past prior to a complete magnetic pole reversal. Such reversals are not unusual, as we know that the magnetic poles have continually flipped from north to south in various lengths of time throughout history. In Figure 8.9 we can see the patterns, which were determined by analyzing the orientation of magnetized iron molecules released in the lava from the undersea ridges. As each new layer of lava cools along these ridges, the iron molecules orient themselves to the position of the Earth’s magnetic poles at that particular time. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Figure 8.10 – Earth’s Magnetic Pole Shift Corridors for past three major shifts. (Courtesy Maurice Chatelain) Furthermore, geologist Gregg Braden shows that all the ingredients for a magnetic polar reversal are now occurring again. [6] The first ingredient is that the strength of our gravitational field is extremely weak, in terms of Earth’s overall history. With a grade of 10 being the strongest, we are now very close to 1, at the bottom of the scale. Secondly, the strength of the magnetic field is approximately 38% lower than it was 2,000 years ago, and it is now measured to be decreasing at an average rate of about 6% per 100 years, according to Swedish scientist N.A. Morner in 1988. Thirdly, the earth’s electromagnetic energy vibrations, known as the Schumann resonance, appear to be rapidly increasing above the standard 7.8 cycles per second to reported values of 8.6 or higher in certain areas. Every time that these three ingredients have combined in Earth’s past history, says Braden, a magnetic pole shift has occurred. So based on this idea, many researchers have concluded that it will cause a tremendous cataclysm that will extinguish human civilization as we know it. When our magnetic protection shield goes down, we will get a massive burst of solar radiation that has historically been linked with mass extinctions. It is important for us to state here that most people do not understand the metaphysical implications of this burst of new energy; in Part Two of this book we will prove that it is directly associated with a spontaneous transformation of matter, energy and consciousness. 8.6 SOLAR CHANGES Figure 8.11 – Solar Activity at 1996 minimum (L) and 1999"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"maximum (R). (Courtesy NASA) When we turn our focus towards the Sun, we find similar anomalous increases in overall energetic activity. A team at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Oxford, led by Dr. Mike Lockwood, has discovered that in the last century, the overall strength of the Sun’s magnetic field has more than doubled, becoming 230 percent stronger than it was in 1901. [20] Even more interestingly, this rate of magnetic field growth is continually increasing in speed. Dr. Alexey Dmitriev reports that: As a whole, all of the reporting and observation facilities give evidence to a growth in the velocity, quality, quantity and energetic power of our Solar System’s heliospheric properties. [emphasis added] And let’s remember that the heliosphere is the magnetic field that emanates from the Sun, surrounding our Solar System and beyond. Every 11 years there is a major increase in the amount of Solar activity, and we have again hit this solar maximum in the period of 2000-2002. In Figure 8.11, which is tinted green for contrast, the difference between the solar minimum of 1996 and the maximum of 1999 is quite obvious. Furthermore, this current solar maximum has defeated all predictions for when it would end; it continues to show high levels of activity in summer of 2002, though it was originally expected to peak in 2000 and rapidly decline. During the previous solar maximum in 1989, a very powerful X-ray flare on March 5th led to the Sun emitting a stream of high-energy protons, which flowed to the Earth continuously until March 13th. As reported by Chatelain and Gilbert in The Mayan Prophecies, this event caused the Earth’s magnetic poles to deviate by a whopping eight degrees in only a few hours, which was the most substantial sudden change in Earth’s magnetic field since 1952. This event also caused serious disruption of communications systems, created intense aurora borealis phenomena and completely collapsed the Canadian power grid, with more than a million people losing their electricity for several days. Furthermore, Dr. Aleskey Dmitriev has correlated intense solar emissions with Earth phenomena including severe weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes, earthquake activity and volcanic activity on Earth. This same information has been rigorously documented by Richard Pasichnyk in The Vital Vastness book series and his Living Cosmos website. [31] Again, this “action-at-a-distance” is caused by torsion radiation, whose effects were scientifically proven by Dr. N.A. Kozyrev and others, as discussed starting in the first chapter of this book. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Figure 8.12 – Surges in solar proton flux activity, 1997-1998. (Courtesy NASA) In 1995, NASA deployed the Ulysses spacecraft out to orbit the Sun at high altitudes and make specific readings. To everyone’s surprise, the Sun had lost all signs of its normal magnetic field; there was no north pole, no south pole, just a field of constant intensity over the entire surface. No one could begin to explain this and as Dr. Dmitriev states, this “drastically changed the general model of heliomagnetism, and further complicated the magnetologists’ analytic presentations.” Arguably the ultimate energy release from our Sun comes from what are known as coronal mass ejections. In these cases, the entire Sun releases a super-flash of energy over much of its surface simultaneously, which travels out into space as a halo-like expanding bubble that can contain up to ten billion tons of electrified gas. [28] Not surprisingly, Dr. Dmitriev explains that with each passing year, these super-flashes are actually traveling faster through space than ever before! This is the same reason as why you can swim faster in water than molasses; interplanetary space has become a better conductor. This shows us another consequence of our heliosphere’s movement into an area of higher aetheric energy density. So, on November 6, 1997 there was a huge coronal mass ejection rated at a tremendous X level of 9.1, which NASA labels as being, quote, “severe.” For 72 hours, the Earth was charged with highly energetic protons. The conventional models had predicted only one severe event for 1997 when in fact there were three, which shows a 300-percent increase. And as Figure 8.12 shows, the severity of this event in November 1997 was later outstripped"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"by an even greater intensity of events in April through May of 1998. Even more recently, from May 10th through 13th of 2000, the energy and dust streaming out of the Sun known as the “Solar Wind” abruptly shut off, causing NASA to announce that this was, quote, “the most drastic and longest-lasting decrease” ever observed. [25] This created huge auroras on Earth and caused the magnetic field to swell to between 500 and 600 percent of its normal size. Many international satellites confirmed that this was the single largest expansion of the Earth’s magnetic field they had ever witnessed. The graphic on the left shows the Earth’s magnetic field in a more compressed and energetic state, whereas the graphic on the right shows a more relaxed state that allowed the expansion to occur. The blue end of the spectrum shows a higher degree of magnetic energy charge than the red. Figure 8.13 – 500-600% expansion of Earth’s magnetic field after solar wind shutdown. (Courtesy NASA) Then, on July 14, 2000, a massive solar flare shot directly at the Earth. Protons from the Sun came to us in only fifteen minutes, which NASA indicated as being one of the fastest traveling speeds ever seen. [26] The speed of pure light itself is only less than twice as fast as this, at 8 minutes travel time from the Sun to the Earth. Normally, energetic protons are not thought to travel this close to the observable speed of light. After this flare, a coronal mass ejection was released that traveled fully 200 percent faster than conventional models expected. A variety of satellites and equipment were either disabled or shut down completely, including the Japanese “Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics,” which was so damaged that it was actually sent reeling blindly in its orbit. Figure 8.14 – Surge in solar wind velocity after CME on Nov. 10, 2000. (Courtesy NASA / SOHO) On Nov. 8, 2000, a massive flare was soon followed by a coronal mass ejection that created one of the most intense radiation storms in decades."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"[27] The shock wave hit the Earth in only 31 hours, arriving on Nov. 10, which is easily twice as fast as NASA scientists had expected. As we can see in Figure 8.13, the speed of the solar wind surged from 600 to nearly 1000 kilometers per second as the shockwave passed, and the amount of high- energy protons that were measured around the earth at this time spiked to a level that was fully 100 thousand times greater than normal. Both the SOHO and Stardust satellites were not built to withstand such an impact, and were rendered blind by the surge in radiation, which made them incapable of “seeing” the stars they normally use for orientation. [27] In the second week of February 2001, the Sun was still quite active, continually bombarding the Earth with particles. At this time, NASA first reported that the Sun’s magnetic poles were in the process of reversing, as is normally expected at the end of every eleven-year solar cycle. As this reversal began, the energy streaming into the Earth was again suddenly increased, causing a number of very serious, very high magnitude earthquakes. Most conventional scientists are still refusing to make such obvious connections. Between January 12 and 25, we saw a 6.9 earthquake on the coast of Alaska, a 7.6 earthquake in El Salvador [13],and a 7.9 earthquake in Gujarat, India. [14] Then on Feb. 28, a 7.0 quake struck Seattle, Washington, and the HAARP program’s fluxgate magnetometer measured a sudden dip in the Earth’s magnetic field strength from zero to –200 gamma as this earthquake occurred. This shows how the pressure on the Earth’s luminous plasma core caused it to temporarily eject a great burst of its energy to create the Seattle earthquake. As the Earth released this sudden charge, there was a momentary, major dip in the strength of its magnetic field, since the energy had been released. This energy deficit was quickly replaced by the instreaming pressures of solar torsion-field radiation, but the clear signature of this event is visible in the magnetometer data. Conventional theories believed that the Sun would become calmer once the poles reversed, since this is what had always happened before. Yet, the solar magnetic field steadily increased from March 18th to 27th of 2001, with a very large solar flare then erupting on the 29th. This event was followed by an Earth-directed CME that created significant aurora borealis as it hit. Then, soon afterward on April 2, 2001, solar flare number 9393 broke all records for brightness and strength, weighing in at the unheard-of X-class of 22; the measurement scale had previously only been designed to go to a frightful maximum of 20. This flare was considered the largest of its kind ever observed for at least 25 years, earning it the new name of “mega-flare.” [43] Two consecutive coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, were then released on April 10. The first CME traveled more slowly than the second one, and this was named a “cannibal CME”, since the first CME was consumed by the faster- moving second one. Fortunately, the X-22 level of radiation from flare number 9393 did not directly impact the earth, as it was nearly three times more powerful than the March 1989 event, which deviated the Earth’s magnetic field by eight degrees and totally shut down Canada’s power grid. A burst nearly three times larger than this could literally disable the entire half of the earth that it hit."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Again, two CMEs were released on April 10, 2001. Then, on April 11th, a rash of severe tornadoes, some a quarter of a mile wide, ripped through the Midwestern United States, affecting Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Missouri and Nebraska. Furthermore, a 5.7 earthquake occurred in Indonesia on April 7, a 5.9 earthquake on April 13 that destroyed 30,000 homes in China, and a 6.5 on April 15 off the coast of Japan. Most scientists would not be willing to acknowledge the connection between the solar activity and events such as severe weather and earthquakes, but again we see how the energy phenomena are related. All these events clustered around the surge in solar activity of April 10th. And since this time, right through to the present, the solar activity has not backed off, creating untold problems for the NASA scientists and far more CMEs than were ever thought possible in previous models. This is not being covered up or hidden by NASA or other space agencies; it is simply not given very much attention in the media. So, in short, this most recent solar maximum cycle has been so unusually energetic that George Withbroe, Science Director for NASA's Sun-Earth Connection Program issued a statement saying that, quote, “This is a unique solar maximum in history. The images and data are beyond the wildest expectations of the astronomers of a generation ago.\" [41] 8.7 ENERGETIC CHANGES OF THE PLANETS In our aetheric model, the Sun absorbs a majority of its surrounding energy at the polar regions, and accelerates this energy out along the ecliptic plane along its equator. So just as a balloon can only be inflated so far before it will burst, the Sun is forced to release this pent-up energy charge, caused by LISM energy density increases, with X-ray blasts, huge solar flares, proton emissions and mass ejections. This in turn causes the interplanetary medium to become a better energy conductor, which then helps to saturate the planets with higher and higher amounts of energetic charge. So, if the planets indeed have cores of luminous plasma that can store and release energy like what we have seen on the Earth, then we should expect that similar energetic changes will be seen throughout the Solar System. Dr. Dmitriev’s research on the planets shows accelerations in the speed of magnetic pole shifts, climate changes, earthquakes and cyclones on Earth, increased magnetic and plasma energy charges on other planets and changes in their atmospheric qualities. In addition, some of the planets are actually becoming noticeably brighter. All of the following points are footnoted in Dmitriev’s study, [15], unless otherwise noted: 8.7.1 PLUTO Pluto, our outermost observed planet, has recently shown a significant, unexpected increase in the amount of dark spots on its surface. 8.7.2 NEPTUNE On the planet Neptune, some scientists believe that there has been a complete magnetic polar shift in the recent past; as the Voyager satellite passed by, the magnetic field was measured as being tilted nearly 50 degrees away from the rotational pole. The event is considered to be recent simply"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"because such an imbalance would normally be expected to right itself in a relatively short time, planetophysically speaking. Also, the intensity of visible light emitted by Neptune has noticeably increased. 8.7.3 URANUS Like Neptune, Voyager noted that the planet Uranus also had a magnetic field that was shifted from the rotational axis, in this case by 55 to 60 degrees. This simultaneous behavior between Neptune and Uranus is believed to be possible because Neptune and Uranus are magnetically conjugate planets. Both of them show this similar, anomalous discrepancy, which suggests that a recent, still-imbalanced magnetic pole shift had taken place. Furthermore, Uranus’ magnetosphere has shown an “abrupt, large-scale growth” in its intensity. 8.7.4 SATURN Brightly colored auroras have been recently observed on Saturn, clearly indicating energetic charge. Richard Pasichnyk has directly correlated these brightness changes with solar activity. Most auroras cluster near the poles, and this dramatic energy increase can be seen through infra-red photography. 8.7.5 JUPITER Jupiter’s magnetic field has doubled in intensity as of 1992, and its total brightness has also increased. Dmitriev and others believe that “Comet” Shoemaker-Levy 9, which dramatically struck Jupiter in July 1994, was actually a series of luminous plasma formations – and this would explain why a sequence of bright spheres traveled in a long, straight line. Once this “plasmoid train” struck Jupiter, there were “a series of new states and processes” observed on Jupiter thereafter, inducing excessive plasma generation. This plasma was then released “in the same matter as Solar coronal holes,” and created a brightening of the radiation belts in the 13.2 and 36-centimeter bands, as well as creating large, anomalous aurora formations. In 1997, a tube of glowing plasma energy was observed to have formed between Jupiter and the volcanic areas of its moon Io, at an unbelievable electromagnetic strength of one million amperes. This phenomenon presents very strong evidence that volcanic activity is caused by energetic releases of the luminous plasma in the core of a planet or moon. More recently, in Feb. 2001 NASA scientists observed Io while it was being eclipsed from the sun’s light by Jupiter, and they discovered that it has now become brighter than ever before, noticeably glowing even though no sunlight was hitting it, forming a “plasma torus” around the sphere itself. [11] 8.7.6 MARS The atmosphere of Mars has shown definite signs of growth, as reported by Dr. Dmitriev. These transformations have increased the quality of its biosphere. Cloudy growth has been observed at the equatorial area, and there has been an unusual increase in the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Furthermore, in September 1997 the Mars Surveyor satellite encountered a 200% increase in the density of the Martian atmosphere, against what had been calculated from previous NASA data. As Dmitriev indicates, this greater atmospheric density bent one of the solar array arms beyond the full and open stop, which caused the satellite to malfunction."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" Figure 8.15 – Martian Polar Icecap Melting. (Courtesy NASA) Even more recently, in December of 2001 NASA released photographic images showing a major increase in the speed with which the Martian polar icecaps are melting. [7, 3] Figure 8.15 is easily the most dramatic of these images. This “global warming” on Mars was completely unexpected by any conventional model, but fits perfectly with the changes that we are encountering on the Earth, caused by the energetic increase in the Earth’s luminous plasma core. Naturally, the Bush Administration did not mention this in their recent discussion of “global warming” on the Earth. 8.7.7 EARTH We have already covered the Earth in detail, and in this current context we should remember that there have been very clear signs that the atmosphere is changing; this is occurring in the actual chemical composition of the atmosphere as well as the increasing average cloud density that has been observed. New charged particles are appearing in the Van Allen belts, with qualities normally only seen in radiation from stars. Let us also remember the overall 410-percent increase in catastrophes from 1963 to 1993, [15] the 400- percent increase in earthquakes from 1973 to 1998 and the ~500% increase in volcanic activity from 1875 to 1993. [22] 8.7.8 EARTH’S MOON According to a 1993 study by Boston University scientists, our Moon has an atmosphere of sodium (natrium), reaching out to a height of 5,000 miles, or 9,000 kilometers. [32] During the Apollo missions, helium and argon atoms were found in the Moon’s atmosphere, but Earth-based observations then added sodium and potassium ions to the list in 1988. [18] Dmitriev considers this as evidence for the growth of a “first-stage” atmosphere, as it is about a billion times less dense than Earth’s atmosphere by comparison; if the Moon’s atmosphere were compressed into the temperature and pressure of the Earth’s surface, it would all fit into a 210-foot cube. [34] More recently, following the Leonid meteor shower in November 1998, a massive tail of sodium gas with “distances of at least 500,000 miles from the moon, changing its appearances over three consecutive nights” was observed. [5] [This is believed to be caused by the many micrometeorites in the Leonids striking the lunar surface, but could also be due to their energetic plasma effects. This data on the evolution of the Moon’s atmosphere has almost always aroused great questions at our seminars, and we decided to investigate further for this book. Our research revealed that a sodium atmosphere was actually first detected by Flynn and Medillo back in 1933. [29] This technique was again duplicated with greater accuracy in 1994 by A. Potter, T. Morsan and L. Gillian, revealing that the atmosphere extends all the way down to the surface of the Moon. [29] According to Prof. Theordore E. Madey of Rutgers University,"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"...there is little data to support any one explanation [for the creation of the Moon’s atmosphere] and no general agreement about which processes are the most important. [emphasis added] [21] Dr. D.E. Shemansky again breaks with the pack when he mentions a paper coauthored with T. Morgan on “the evolution of the Lunar atmosphere,” again hinting that the amount of sodium and potassium concentration has indeed increased since the time of the Apollo missions. [35] T.E. Madey and B.V. Yakshinkskiy have proposed “charged particle sputtering by the solar wind” as one possible source for this atmosphere, since it must be continually resupplied. [21] Dmitriev’s model suggests that this lunar atmospheric evolution is being triggered by our movement into a higher energetic density of the LISM, which then increases solar activity. 8.7.9 VENUS Significant physical, chemical and optical changes are being observed on Venus. This includes a sharp decrease in the amount of sulfur-containing gases, a reversal in the areas of light and dark spots and a significant increase in its overall brightness. One mainstream article on these changes by Kenneth Chang in the New York Times, 1/28/01, said: [9] Every time [scientists] take a look [at Venus,] they seem to see something different, with phenomena appearing or disappearing like the smile of the Cheshire Cat. In November 1999, researchers from S.R.I. International and Lowell Observatory pointed the 10-meter Keck telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, toward [the night side of] Venus for eight minutes and saw the distinctive green glow of oxygen atoms. \"It was a total surprise,\" said Dr. Thomas G. Slanger, a scientist at S.R.I. and lead author of a paper in the current issue of Science. [emphasis added]"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Figure 8.16 – Green Glow on the night surface of Venus. (Courtesy NASA / Cornell Univ.) Though articles on these anomalous energetic increases of Venus have indeed emerged in the mainstream press, [8] thus far no one in the Western media has ever combined this data to see it as another function of changes that are occurring throughout the entire heliosphere. 8.7.10 MERCURY Like the Moon, Mercury has also been observed to have a thin atmosphere of sodium, potassium and other elements. Conventional theories have a hard time with this atmosphere, since Mercury is so close to the Sun – but nevertheless it is there to be measured. This too may indicate a “first-stage” generation of new atmosphere. [21] Pasichnyk reports that Mercury has also been observed to have polar ice, which is considered impossible given its proximity to the Sun. 8.8 CONCLUSIONS: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE HELIOSPHERE The information that has been presented in this chapter suggests that we are indeed moving towards an “Omega Point” of energetic change. In our online article The Ultimate Secret of the Mayan Calendar, [40] we present evidence from Dr. Sergey Smelyakov that allows us to pinpoint exactly when our movement into this new area will be complete. [36] This data has never before been written about by any other English-speaking authors. In the article, we describe how the Mayan Calendar time cycle of ~5,125 years is divided up by the “phi” ratio into “Auric” time periods, which become considerably shorter in length, leading up to a final “implosion” point. As each"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"increasing time cycle is reached, massive energetic effects occur on the Earth. All 21 of the largest earthquakes since 856 AD have fallen exactly on these “bifurcation points,” caused by our rapid passage from a lower-energy to higher-energy state in the LISM. Nearby supernova explosions of stars have also occurred at these points. [40] The aetheric model suggests that at the edges of the spiraling, pinwheel- shaped “Parker Spiral” formations in the galaxy, there will be discrete layers between one level of aetheric density and another, much as a line will form between oil and water. This boundary area naturally creates a vibrational disturbance, which in turn ripples through the aether in either direction based on the simple “phi” ratio. Each time we pass through another turning-point in the Auric cycle, we are entering into a discretely higher energetic area of the LISM. Most interestingly, the total population of the Earth has also been shown to multiply in exact lock-step with the phi ratio, centering on these points. [36] New religions, spiritual faiths and time-measuring calendar systems are born during these times, as well as the collapsing of large empires followed by relatively quick political developments thereafter. The next two “bifurcation points” where such events could occur are 2003 and 2008 – not so far away. This is one link in a vast chain of evidence to suggest that as aetheric energy density increases, human consciousness increases as well. This can also be directly associated with spiritual advancement. Part Two of this book is dedicated to fully establishing this connection between aetheric energy, biology, consciousness and spirituality. It is also important to mention the date for the final “implosion point” that Dr. Smelyakov’s marvelous cycle collapses into: Dec. 21, 2012 AD – the end-date for the Mayan Calendar. Incidentally, it is also during this same time period that the Earth comes into perfect “precessional” alignment with the center of the Galaxy, which we now know has a redshift that is ten times higher than the observable Universe in conventional models. We shall explore these connections in more detail in Part Two. [Smelyakov’s cycle is completely different from Terence McKenna’s “Timewave Zero” model, and shouldn’t be confused with it or seen as supporting it.] For now, the bottom line is this: We have the proof. We know what is happening. We know why it is happening. We know how it is happening. And we know precisely when “it” will happen. With the forthcoming information in Part Two, we can also make a very good case for exactly what “it” will do. As one voice for the ancient traditions, the Bible referred to this as the coming of the “New Heaven and New Earth,” a utopian Golden Age for humanity where each of us who choose to participate will have abilities above and beyond those displayed by Jesus and other masters: “As I do these things, so shall ye do them, and greater things...” (John 14:12) REFERENCES: 1 Aspden, Harold.

In the last two chapters we saw that an atom is actually a vortex of aetheric energy, where the negatively-charged electron clouds are pressing in towards the positively-charged nucleus via the Biefield- Brown effect. We also have seen that geometry is a major factor in the quantum realm, since it represents the natural form that vibration creates in a fluidlike medium. These naturally occurring aetheric vibrations will cause atoms that are released from a tiny nozzle to gather into perfectly geometric microclusters, which act as one large atom in their own right. These vibrations are also responsible for the formation of quasi-crystals, where a rapidly- cooled metallic alloy forms into a geometric structure that cannot be created by individual “particle” atoms, but only by those atoms blending together into a larger whole. Again, the key is that these geometric forms are being created by vibration. In order for this vibration to occur, an atom must be constantly absorbing and radiating aetheric energy at the same time. As this vibration continues, the atom will throw off torsion waves into the surrounding aether. This means that every atom is a torsion generator, and depending on its overall “spin polarization,” i.e. whether there is a greater amount of right-handed or left- handed spin in its electron clouds, the object will either generate left-handed or right-handed torsion waves. Larger “bulk” groupings of atoms into common physical objects would obviously follow the same rules. So, let’s say that you have an object whose atoms are more heavily polarized for right-handed spin as opposed to left-handed spin. Now, let’s move back to our analogy of a sponge that is submerged in water. The vibrations at work will cause the sponge to be continually expanding and contracting in size at a very fast speed. If the sponge is a perfect sphere, then the sponge will be throwing off an equal amount of water in all directions at a steady flow rate. However, if the sponge were shaped into a cone, then each time that the sponge contracts, a greater amount of water will shoot out of the top of the cone as opposed to the other areas. This is easily visualized with the analogy of seeing water passing through a funnel. In the case of this analogy, the top of the cone would be releasing right-handed torsion waves. Thus, since every atom is throwing off torsion waves as it vibrates, certain shapes can help harness and direct this torsional energy flow more than others. Obviously, any of the Platonic Solids would be in this category, but other shapes can harness torsion waves without necessarily being Platonic Solids. Dr. Victor Grebennikov discovered such phenomena in the “cavity structural effect” or CSE, through his study of insects. In this chapter, we shall also discuss Dr. Golod, Dr. Krasnoholovets, Joe Parr and others’ surprising research on the power of the pyramid shape to harness torsional energy. 9.2 MAJOR CATEGORIES OF TORSION GENERATING DEVICES"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"As described in Nasonov’s groundbreaking torsion studies, there are four major categories of devices that will produce a measurable torsion-field effect: 1 Objects with specially organized spin polarization. A magnet is the most common material that fits into this first category. Every atom has a combination of “right” spin and “left” spin in the electron clouds, and this is known as the “spin polarization” of the atom. Any bulk object will have an overall spin polarization, which is the sum of all the different spins in the atoms comprising it. In a magnet, all molecules are aligned in north-south magnetic polarization, and this creates strong torsion waves as well as a magnetic field. Czech researcher Pavilta was able to produce similar effects in non-magnetic materials, as documented in Psychic Discoveries. 2 Electromagnetic or electrostatic torsion generators. By simply generating an electrostatic or electromagnetic field, such as by passing electric current through a coil of wire, you will also produce measurable torsion waves. Generators using this principle have been created and tested by S.V. Avramenko, G.F. Ignatjev, G.A. Sergejev, S.N. Tarakhtiy and many others. 3 Objects with specially organized rotation. By rotating either magnetic or non-magnetic materials in certain specific patterns and speeds, torsion fields can be generated. In Russia, this method has been used by A.I. Veinik, K.N. Perebeinos, V.M. Yuritovsky, V.V. Bobyr and many others. Such generators have been well described in our previous volume, as many researchers have created “overunity” or free-energy devices using these principles to extract energy directly from the aether itself. Gravity-defying craft, such as the SEG device by Professor Searl, have also been created using this method. 4 Objects that distort the geometry of the physical vacuum. As Nasonov indicates, “Every object having a certain surface geometry will simultaneously generate left and right torsion fields of a certain configuration depending on the geometry of the object. This fact can be detected by various types of physical, chemical and biological indicators. Unusual effects demonstrated by pyramids, cones, cylinders, flat triangles, etc. were repeatedly observed by many researchers in different countries.” This fourth category shall be the main topic of discussion in this chapter, and we shall refer to such specially-shaped objects as “passive torsion generators.” These effects have been studied by A.I. Veinik, V.S. Grebennikov, Yu.V. Tszyan Kanchzhen, I.M. Shakhparonov, A.A. Beridze- Stakhovsky, A. Golod, V. Krasnoholovetz, Joe Parr and others. 5 Generators that combine characteristics of the previous four categories. Certain devices have been built that combine the geometric shape of an object or enclosure (#4) with other torsion-wave generating properties such as seen in numbers 1-3, producing remarkable results. These studies will also be discussed in this and later chapters, and have been performed by"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Yu.V. Tszyan Kanchzhen, V.P. Kaznacheev, Joe Parr and the authors of the 1979 French patent #2421531, among others. 9.3 CHANGES IN THE SPIN POLARIZATION OF AN ATOM ARE POSSIBLE Before we go on, we should note here that the spin polarization of an atom is not necessarily fixed in either a right-handed or left-handed direction. The Institute of Material Research in Kiev, Ukraine performed a series of experiments where an object was exposed to torsion radiation created by the third process in the above list. They found that if the torsion radiation was strong enough, then the spin state of the atoms themselves could be changed. Later in this chapter we will see that these changes can eventually be substantial enough to alter the structure and appearance of a material, such as the color of granite and the sharpness of a razor blade. Even more interestingly, the Institute of Material Research also determined that people with strong psychic abilities were also capable of creating identical changes in the spin polarization of various substances by the sheer focus of their consciousness. No other known technologies could create such changes in a physical object. This again suggests that consciousness and torsion-waves are actually one and the same – and in the Russian and Ukranian pyramid research of this chapter we will see more of the mounting evidence that points towards this conclusion. 9.4 AETHERIC ENERGY INTAKE POSSIBLY MOST IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH In this chapter, we will also begin feeling the weight of evidence that suggests that aetheric energy intake is actually the most important ingredient in the health of an organism, and that conventional processes of respiration, ingestion and sunlight exposure are only part of the puzzle – perhaps important only to the degree that each process is capable of continually renewing our supply of aetheric energy. Certain “non-eating saints” profiled in Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda and other sources have arrived at the point where they sustain the health of their physical bodies directly from this energy source, without eating or drinking. (We absolutely do not advise our readers to attempt this, as it could be fatal.) 9.5 TORSION WAVES ARE “PHI” SPIRALS Another point that should be mentioned early along in this chapter comes from the research into passive torsion generators and the cavity structural effect that was conducted by the A.E. Akimov group at the Physics Institute of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences and at Chernovitsky University. They were particularly interested in studying the effects that cones of different sizes would have upon various processes. From this research, it was determined that: The best passive torsion generators were formed by cones that were shaped into the “phi” ratio of 1 to 0.618. What this tells us is that torsion waves are indeed “phi” spirals, since a cone that duplicates this pattern will harness the waves most strongly. 9.6 GREBENNIKOV AND THE “CAVITY STRUCTURAL EFFECT”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Russian scientist Dr. Victor Grebennikov is an entomologist, meaning that he works especially with insects. He first discovered the “cavity structural effect” when he ended up working too late in the steppes of the Kamyshlovo valley and tried to fall asleep relatively near the edge of a cliff. Deep in the side of the cliff just beneath him were massive “bee cities” with multitudes of tunnels and chambers created by an incredible number of different hives that had all formed within the same area. So many bees had made their homes there that the entire cliff face looked like a piece of Swiss cheese, and in places it was so porous that it almost looked like a sponge. As Grebennikov tried to fall asleep above these gently humming, living bee cities, he started to experience very bizarre effects that were too powerful to ignore. First his body felt as if it were continually expanding and contracting in size, while also feeling as if it were in a state of free-fall. Then, as the effect intensified, he began to see flashes in front of his eyes that would continue to appear whether his eyes were open or closed. His mouth suddenly had a strong metallic taste as if he had pressed his tongue onto the contact plates of a nine-volt battery, and he also experienced a loud ringing in his ears and an enhanced awareness of his heartbeat. When he moved as little as five feet away from this particular spot, all the effects would cease, but when he returned to the spot the effects would come back. For many years he wondered why he had experienced these effects without producing any solid explanation. Then, one day he had a wide container filled with spongy clay lumps from the original nest site sitting out on his desk. These lumps had honeycomb-style cavities inside them where the larvae had grown into adult bees. As he passed his hand above these porous fragments, he felt a sudden sensation of warmth emanating from them. When he touched the clay itself with his hand, it was cold, but this warm sensation was clearly noticeable above the clumps. Grebennikov also noticed a slight jerking or “ticking” sensation in his fingers from the clumps as well as the warmth. When he leaned over and put his head above the clay lumps, he again experienced all of the same bizarre symptoms as he had at the original site in the Kamyshlovo valley, including a sense of nausea. Figure 9.1 – Clay Lumps from Kamyshlovo Valley bee nests Grebennikov soon discovered that even if the container was covered with a thick metallic lid, the effects would still continue. He then took the container of clay honeycomb lumps to various institutes within the Agricultural Academy in Novosibirsk, where they were tested with thermometers, ultrasound detectors, magnetometers, electrometers and the like. None of these instruments responded to the nests in any unusual fashion. Precise chemical analyses of the clay showed no anomalies, and a radiometer showed no effect either."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"However, as Grebennikov indicated, ...ordinary human hands, and not only mine, would distinctly feel either warmth or cold, or a tingle, or sometimes a thicker, stickier environment. Some people’s hands felt heavier, others felt lighter as if pushed up. Some people’s fingers and arm muscles got numb, some felt giddy and developed profuse salivation. Later, Grebennikov discovered that artificial honeycombs created from plastic, paper, metal and wood could create the same effects, if the basic structure of the bee nests were adhered to. As he wrote in his book, It turned out that the cause of all those unusual sensations was not a biological field, but the size, shape, quantity and arrangement of cavities formed by and in any solid object. And as before, the organism felt it, while the instruments remained silent. I called the discovery the Cavity Structures Effect (CSE)... [emphasis added] Then, Grebennikov goes on to explain some of the biological effects that were noticed from the Cavity Structure Effect: Nature has continued to reveal to me its innermost secrets one after another. It has turned out that the CSE zone inhibits the growth of saprophytic soil bacteria, inhibits the growth of yeast and other similar cultures as well as it inhibits wheat grain germination. The behavior of microscopic agile chlamydospores also changes in this effective zone. Leaf cutting bee larvae begin to phosphoresce [glow with light], while adult bees are much more active in this field and finish pollination two weeks earlier than they would otherwise. It has turned out that this CSE, same as gravitation, can’t be shielded. We shall see that although the insect-based Cavity Structural Effect inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeast, wheat grains and the like, the pyramid-related experiments show an opposite effect. This shows how the cavity structural effect seems to absorb torsion-wave energy away from most biological systems, whereas the concentrated energy inside of a pyramid will enhance them. In this next excerpt on the CSE, think back to Kozyrev’s discoveries that were discussed in the first chapter. Torsion fields are certainly capable of moving through solid matter without losing any of their strength. Furthermore, here again we see the “phantom” effect or “polarization of the vacuum” that Kozyrev and others observed: [The CSE field] affects living organisms through walls, thick metal and any other screens. It has turned out that if a porous object were moved, a person would not feel the change in CSE location immediately, but a few seconds or minutes later. While the old location would retain a “trace,” or as I called it a “phantom” of the CSE field perceivable by the hand for hours and sometimes for months thereafter. [emphasis added] In this next passage we find additional support for the concept of “nested spheres” of energy, which in this case are formed by the cavity structural effect:"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"It has turned out that the CSE field did not decrease evenly with distance, but surrounded the honeycomb with a system of invisible, yet sometimes clearly perceivable “shells.” Grebennikov goes on to remind us that we are constantly surrounded by these effects, and that we therefore have an innate ability to adapt to such changes in our environment so that we are not bothered by them: It has turned out that animals (white mice) and humans entering the zone of the CSE field (even a very strong one) would soon adapt to it. It couldn’t be otherwise. We are surrounded everywhere by cavities, large and small, surrounded by grids and cells of living and dead plants (as well as our own cells.) We are surrounded by bubbles of foam rubber, foam plastic, foam concrete, rooms, corridors, halls, roofing, spaces between machine parts, trees, furniture and buildings. The next point should again remind us of Kozyrev’s findings, showing how the energy streaming into the Earth and the energy streaming away from the Sun have direct effects on this process: It has turned out that the CSE “ray” had a stronger impact on living organisms when it was directed away from the sun and also downwards, facing the Earth center. Next, we see where Grebennikov unknowingly replicated Kozyrev’s findings that show that time itself can be sped up or slowed down in the presence of torsion-wave energy: It has turned out that clocks, both mechanical and electronic, run inaccurately when placed in a strong CSE field. The CSE seems to have an effect on time too. All this is a manifestation of the will of matter, constantly moving and transforming and existing eternally. Grebennikov built detectors for torsion-wave energy that were relatively similar to Kozyrev’s, albeit far less complex. The key to remember here again is that these spiraling waves do exert a subtle pressure on physical matter that is detectable with sensitive instruments: I have managed to devise instruments for an objective registration of the CSE, which react accurately to the proximity of insect nests during all this time. Here they are in the drawings. They are sealed [glass] vessels with straws, burnt twigs or drawing coals suspended on spider web threads in them, with some water on the bottom countering the effects of static electricity, which hinders such experiments in dry air. If you point an old wasp nest, a bee honeycomb or a bunch of cereal ears at the upper end of the indicator, it turns slowly a few dozen degrees around. This is no miracle... Those who have doubts are welcome to visit the Agroecology Museum near Novosibirsk and see it all for themselves..."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Figure 9.2 – Grebennikov’s CSE detectors in action. This next citation gives remarkable evidence for the ability of a bumble bee to feel the CSE from its hive even through a half-meter thick brick wall: I’ve had reports of highly unpleasant effects of a few wasp nests in an attic. Besides that, most multiple cell devices and objects with a manifested CSE field have a far from beneficial effect on humans in the first few minutes. Honey bee combs are a rare exception. I have often observed the bumblebees living in our Isilkul flat in the 1960s. A young bumble bee did not take the trouble to remember the entrance to the hive and it would spend hours wandering around the windows of our house and of a similar looking house nearby on its first trip out of the hive. It would give up on its poor visual memory in the evening and it would land on the brick wall precisely outside the hive and would try to break right through the wall. Now how did the insect know that its home nest was right there, four meters away from the entrance to the attic and a meter and a half below, behind the thick, half meter wall? I was lost at the time in conjectures but now I know exactly why the bumble bee behaved in that manner. Now let us remember the experiment in which hunter wasps returned not only to a given location but even to an entirely different location where the lump of soil with their nest had been moved. I do not doubt that they were able to find it because of the wave emitter created by their nest cavities. [emphasis added] In this next passage, Grebennikov demonstrates how certain flowers have a shape that creates a resonant structure for torsion waves to be generated, thus attracting the bees for pollination. Again, we see mention of the “phantom effect” or “polarization of the vacuum” when Grebennikov discusses how he was able to find these flowers in a completely dark room using a stem, charcoal rod or short pencil: There was yet another mystery to be revealed to me by my insect friends. It"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"has turned out that flowers also use similarly powerful and unstoppable wave emitters besides their color, odor and nectar in order to attract their pollinators. I have discovered it with a drawing charcoal, a burnt twig by passing it over large, bell shaped flowers (tulips, lilies, amaryllises, mallows or pumpkins). I could feel \"braking\" of this detector already at quite a distance from the flower. Figure 9.3 – Detection of CSE fields from bell-shaped flowers. I have learned to find a flower in a dark room standing one or two meters away from it with this detector, but only if it had not been moved. If it were moved, I would detect a \"false target\", the \"ghost\" field left in its old location, the residual \"phantom\" I have already mentioned. I do not possess any super sensory abilities, and any person would be able to do the same after some training. One could use a 10 cm long piece of a yellow sorghum stem instead of a charcoal rod, or a short pencil whose rear end should be facing the flower. Some people would be able to feel the flower (a \"warm\", \"cold\", or \"shivering\" sensation emanating from it) with their bare hands, tongues, or even faces. As many experiments demonstrated, children and adolescents are particularly sensitive to these waves of matter. [emphasis added] In this next passage, Grebennikov describes how this system appears to be designed to keep bee nests from blending into each other, as well as to keep roots from growing into the nests: When it comes to the bees, which nest underground, their \"knowledge\" of the CSE is vital to them. First of all, it enables the builder of a new gallery to stay away from the neighboring nests. Otherwise, the entire bee city all cut through with intersecting holes would simply collapse. Secondly, plant roots cannot be allowed to grow down into the galleries and honeycombs and indeed the roots stop growing any further a few centimeters away from the honeycomb of tunnels and chambers and start growing aside, feeling that nests are near. I have confirmed the latter conclusion by my many experiments on couching wheat seeds in a strong CSE field, as compared to the seeds germinating in the same climatic conditions but in the absence of the CSE field. Photographs and drawings show both the dying of roots in the experimental batch as well as their sharp deviation in a direction away from my artificial honeycomb. Therefore, the bees and the weeds back at the lake had made a pact long ago and they are another example of the highest ecological expediency of all being..."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Finally, our last passage in this chapter from Grebennikov shows how the torsion radiation caused anomalous electromagnetic effects, again reminding us of Kozyrev’s earlier findings: I will only mention one more thing. My battery powered pocket calculator often malfunctioned in the CSE field. It either erred, or sometimes its display window failed to light up for hours. I used the field of a wasp nest combined with that of my two palms. None of these structures had any effect on their own. 9.7 RUSSIAN AND UKRANIAN PYRAMID RESEARCH Grebennikov’s discoveries with the “cavity structural effect” show that long, tubelike structures, especially if gathered in bundles, will harness torsion waves in a way that can be confusing and damaging to most forms of life. However, he also found that if such structures are placed above a person, such as in a specially-built chair that he designed, the added torsion energy that they draw up from the earth has beneficial health properties. Such devices can be built rather simply by gluing several large egg crates above each other at their mutually shared points and mounting them above a chair where a person will sit. The beneficial health effects of a person being placed under a CSE generator can be duplicated and enhanced with the pyramid shape. Grebennikov did a certain degree of interesting research in this area, but until Dr. John DeSalvo of the Giza Pyramid Research Association published the Russian and Ukranian pyramid research of A. Golod, V. Krasnoholovets and associates, the complete picture of how much progress had been made in these areas was not available online. This research comes from the Institute of Physics in Kiev, Ukraine, a basic institution of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, which was one of the leading scientific centers in the former USSR and the premier military research association. Two steep pyramids with 70-degree slope angles were constructed in Russia near Moscow, one at a height of 22 meters and another at a height of 44 meters [144 feet,] costing over a million dollars to build. Over the last 10 years, a total of 17 different pyramids have been built altogether. In order for the pyramid effects to emerge, it was found that no metal could be used in the construction of these structures, thus modular fiberglass plastics were used instead. The pyramids were aligned to the North Star and built away from populated areas in the natural countryside. At the base of the 22-meter pyramid, the fiberglass wall was 36 centimeters thick, and at the base of the 44-meter pyramid the fiberglass wall was 70 centimeters thick. The 22-meter pyramid weighed a total of 25 tons and the 44-meter pyramid weighed a total of 55 tons. Several different teams from the Russian Academy of Sciences carried out all sorts of experiments in these pyramids, with surprising results. [These results are discussed in greater scientific detail in the article, referenced at the end of this chapter.] 9.7.1 STRENGTHENING OF ANTI-VIRAL MEDICINE The first study cited in Dr. Krasnoholovets’ summary paper is by Prof. S.M. Klimenko and D.N. Nosik, MD from the Ivanovskii R&D Institute of Virology within the Russian Academy of Medical Science. This study involved the drug"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"venoglobulin, which is a naturally-occurring antiviral compound in human beings. When the drug was diluted into a concentration of 50 micrograms per milliliter and stored in the pyramid for a time, it then became approximately three times more effective at fighting viruses than it normally would. 9.7.2 STRENGTHENING OF HEALING BENEFITS OF GLUCOSE AND WATER The team of Prof. A.G. Antonov from the Russian R&D Institute of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology tested the effects of a solution of 40% glucose in distilled water after it had been stored in the pyramid. By administering only 1 milliliter of the glucose to 20 different prematurely born infant patients with compromised immune systems, their levels of health were seen to rapidly increase up to practically normal values. The researchers furthermore discovered that the glucose was not necessary, as the same effect could be produced by simply using 1 milliliter of ordinary water that had been stored in the pyramid. 9.7.3 INCREASED HEALING RESPONSE FOR ORGANISMS WITHIN PYRAMID Another study was performed by Dr. N.B. Egorova at the Mechnikov R&D Institute within the Russian Academy of Medical Science. In this study, the torsion-wave harnessing capability of the pyramid was tested directly on living organisms placed inside. An experimental and a control group of white underbred mice weighing 12 to 14 grams were both tainted with strain 415 of the virus S.typhimurium in equal amounts over the course of one day. In smaller doses of contamination, the mice stored in the pyramid survived at a rate of 60% whereas only 7% survived in the control group. In larger doses of contamination, 30% of the mice in the pyramid survived as opposed to only 3% in the control group. In other experiments, mice were exposed to various carcinogens, and an experimental group drank water from the pyramid whereas the control group drank ordinary water. The mice drinking the pyramid water had significantly fewer tumors develop than the mice drinking the ordinary water. 9.7.4 CHANGES OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF MATERIALS IN PYRAMID Prof. V.I. Kostikov and Dr. A.C. Katasonov from the R&D Institute “Graphite” within the Russian Academy of Sciences performed various studies on the changes in electrical resistance that can be induced by a pyramid structure. In one example, a pyrocarbon material was tested that normally had a resistance of 5 to 7 micro-ohms. After a one-day stay in the pyramid, the material became 200% more resistant to electric current, which is an abnormal effect for pyrocarbon. Irradiating the same material with ~10^19 neutrons per square meter would only change the resistance of the pyrocarbon by about 5% in comparison. Similarly, silicon semiconductors would have an exponential lowering of their electrical resistance, moving from 10^5 to 10^4 ohms per centimeter, and high-temperature superconducting materials would lose their superconductive properties after a one-day stay in the pyramid. 9.7.5 ROCKS FROM PYRAMID DISTRIBUTE ELECTRICAL CHARGES MORE EVENLY A group of researchers from the All-Russian Electrotechnical Institute in"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Moscow conducted an experiment to demonstrate how pyramid-charged rocks could dissipate strong electric charges, rendering them less harmful. The setup involved a flat metallic plate that was zapped by positively-charged electric blasts at up to 1400 kilovolts in intervals between 250 and 2500 microseconds. The electric blasts were generated by a rod that was suspended 5 meters above the metallic plate. Each of these blasts will typically “discharge” and burn up a portion of the metallic plate, which is known as a “defeat,” and these defeats are logged and plotted. Two identical systems of this type, and experimental and a control, were created. In the experimental system, seven 100-gram chunks of granite that had been stored inside the pyramid were then placed on the flat plate in a one-meter wide ring. The researchers discovered that there were five times more burn marks on the control plate as opposed to the experimental plate. Obviously, normal granite rocks would not produce such an effect – only those that have stayed in the pyramid. It seems that the rocks exposed to the torsion fields in the pyramid were much more capable of distributing the electrical charges. This appears to be due to the fact that the electron clouds of the atoms in the rocks became more uniformly spin-polarized in the pyramid, thus helping to absorb and spread out electrical charges more evenly. 9.7.6 A.A. GOLOD’S PYRAMID EXPERIMENTS Five major categories of experiments, as follows, were performed by a team of researchers from the Scientific Manufacturing Union Gidrometpribor in Russia, directed by A.A. Golod. 9.7.6.1 WATER DOES NOT FREEZE IN THE PYRAMID UNLESS DISTURBED In the first experiment, plastic bottles of distilled water were kept in the pyramid over the course of three winter months. During this time, the air temperature in the pyramid sank as low as -38° C, or -6° F. Thermometers inside the bottles revealed that the temperature of the water was the same as the below-freezing air temperatures surrounding them, yet the water remained in a liquid form and would not turn into ice! However, if the water in any of the bottles was shaken or bumped in any way, it would immediately start crystallizing and quickly turn into a block of ice. Golod and his associates have videotaped these results. This first experiment obviously suggests that the presence of the torsion-wave energy was able to keep the water molecules from crystallizing into ice, yet a simple disruption in the harmonic stillness of the water would cause this equilibrium to disappear and ice would quickly form. One slight bump on the edge of the bottle would disrupt the even flow of the torsion radiation and allow the molecules to begin crystallizing. This same experiment also showed that water would retain its purity indefinitely while within the pyramid. 9.7.6.2 VISIBLE RINGS FORM IN ROCKS SCATTERED INSIDE THE PYRAMID In the second of Golod’s experiments, chunks of granite and crystal were scattered along the floor of the pyramid for longer periods of time. A visible"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"ring would appear evenly throughout the chunks, showing a clear change in the appearance of the stones when under the torsion-wave influence. Between the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1999, this result was able to be duplicated 40 different times in the same pyramid, with different rocks each time. Each ring would cover between 50 and 300 rocks, with a total weight from 20 to 200 kilograms. Golod et al. have gathered evidence to suggest that when the rings form most visibly, the amount of epidemics in the surrounding area will decrease. 9.7.6.3 A COLUMN OF “UNKNOWN ENERGY” APPEARS ABOVE THE PYRAMID In the third of Golod’s experiments, the Joint-stock company “R&D Institute TTR” conducted studies of the air above the pyramid with a Russian instrument similar to radar known as a “military locator.” A column of “unknown energy” was detected at a width of 500 meters and a height of 2000 meters. Further studies confirmed that a larger circle of this energy surrounded the area above the pyramid in a 300-kilometer-wide range, with the highest concentration being directly above the vertical fulcrum of the pyramid. Golod’s team calculated that if such an energy column were to be produced electromagnetically, it would require all the energy of the various power plants in Russia combined. Furthermore, less rigorous was the observation that after the pyramid’s presence was established, an ozone hole that had existed over that area of Russia was seen to repair itself in only two months’ time. This column of unseen energy did have other immediate uses and effects as well. Electrical energy from the pyramid could be harnessed by a capacitor that was placed at the apex of the pyramid; the capacitor would spontaneously take on a charge. Furthermore, pieces of the capacitor assembly were seen to break away and rise into the air on the energetic column that the pyramid was producing. It was also discovered that people working near the top of the pyramid might start to experience dizziness and nausea, and need to be taken some distance away from the pyramid for these effects to subside. 9.7.6.4 OIL WELLS BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH PYRAMIDS ABOVE THEM In Golod’s fourth experiment, a series of pyramids were built over one of a number of oil wells. It was discovered that the viscosity of the oil under the pyramids decreased by 30%, while the production rate accordingly increased by 30% compared to the surrounding wells. There was a decrease in the amount of unwanted materials in the oil, such as gums, pyrobitumen and paraffin. These results were confirmed by the Gubkin Moscow Academy of Oil and Gas. 9.7.6.5 AGRICULTURAL SEEDS INCREASE THEIR YIELD In Golod’s fifth experiment, agricultural seeds were kept in a pyramid for 1 to 5 days before being planted. More than 20 different seed varieties were planted across tens of thousands of hectares. In all cases, the seeds from the pyramid had a 20 to 100-percent increase in their yield; the plants did not get sick and they were not affected by droughts."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"9.7.6.6 ADDITIONAL PYRAMID EFFECTS RELATED TO BIOLOGY AND HEALTH Under less strenuous laboratory conditions, Golov’s team determined the following: 1 Poisons and other toxins become less destructive to living systems after even a short term of exposure in the pyramid. 2 Radioactive materials held inside a pyramid would decay more rapidly than expected. 3 Pathogenic viruses and bacteria become significantly less damaging to life after being held in the pyramid. 4 Psychotropic drugs have less of an effect on people either staying inside a pyramid or within close range of a pyramid. 5 Standard solutions such as glucose and iso-osmotic solution become effective for treating alcoholism and drug addiction after being placed in the pyramid. They can be administered either intravenously or outwardly. 9.7.7 PYRAMID STUDIES OF DR. YURI BOGDANOV Dr. Yuri Bogdanov conducted pyramid studies on behalf of the Joint-stock Company, “Scientific and Technological Institute of Transcription, Translation and Replication” (TTR), in Kharkiv, Ukraine. In one experiment, a 12-meter pyramid was used to increase the productivity of wheat by 400% in the Ramenskoe settlement of Moscow. The following effects were also discovered: 1 The half-life of radioactive carbon was altered; 2 The crystallization patterns of salts would change; 3 Concrete would change in its strength; 4 Crystals would exhibit different optical behaviors. In the biological arena, rabbits and white rats exposed to the pyramid gained 200% more endurance and their blood gained a higher concentration of leukocytes, or white blood cells. 9.7.7.1 WATER PURIFICATION BY PYRAMID POWER Dr. Bogdanov also built a complex of pyramids in a town near the Arkhangelsk region of Russia by order of the domestic administration there."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"In this case, strontium and heavy metals that had contaminated a well were able to be cleared by the effects of the pyramids, similar to how unwanted materials were filtered out of oil in the above example. In the town of Krasnogorskoe near Moscow, a pyramid was constructed that would reduce the amount of salt in water, again making it more drinkable. In addition, Dr. Bogdanov performed many laboratory studies on medicinal preparations, fungi and so forth. In the city of Kiev, Dr. Bogdanov studied how matter interacts with different torsion-field patterns created by various pyramid shapes, and these investigations also studied how the consciousness of the person would affect these energy fields. These studies were performed by a torsion-wave detecting device that he named the “Tesey,” which allows its user to detect peculiar properties in a particular geological feature, energetic “breathing” activity in the Earth as well as the torsion effects of various buildings including pyramids. These results were discussed on the Conference on Problems of Harmonization of Mankind, held in Kiev, and were subsequently published. 9.7.8 INCREASED HARDNESS AND PURITY OF SYNTHESIZED CRYSTALS The torsion-wave-focusing properties of the pyramid structure were seen to have a direct effect on how crystallization takes place. Diamonds that were synthesized within the pyramid turned out harder and purer than they would otherwise. Again, this suggests that the torsion-wave component is of central importance in the forming of chemical bonds to create a crystal. 9.7.9 DIMINISHED SEISMIC AND WEATHER ACTIVITY Teams from the Russian National Academy of Sciences also studied the earthquake data from the areas surrounding the pyramids and compared it to earlier data before the pyramids were built. They discovered that the pyramids have the ability to dissipate the energetic buildup that would normally create sudden, violent earthquakes. Instead of seeing one large and powerful quake, several hundred tiny earthquakes are registered instead. Furthermore, the atmosphere surrounding the pyramid seems to be shielded from severe weather as well, causing an overall decrease in the amount of violent weather patterns. This gives a clear illustration of the usefulness of pyramids for balancing the aetheric energies streaming into a planet. 9.7.10 FOODS STORED IN PYRAMID INCREASE HUMAN COMPASSION Another experiment was conducted where a quantity of salt and pepper was stored inside the pyramid. This salt and pepper was later removed and fed continually to about 5000 people in different jails in Russia. Amazingly, within a few months there was a dramatic improvement in their behavior, and most criminal behavior almost completely disappeared. This is one of the more important points, as it validates the idea that aetheric energy is “spiritual energy” and that as a person is exposed to higher intensities of it, there is a propensity for greater feelings of love and compassion for others. 9.7.11 LIGHT-PRODUCING EFFECTS AND RAZOR-BLADE SHARPENING Dr. Krasnoholovets built a small and simple resonator to study these pyramid effects, which appears to have been a piece of cardboard or glass folded in"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"half to form a small “roof” structure. Within this small resonator, a KIO3*HIO3 crystal experienced a greater clustering of hydrogen atoms in the crystal. Rare gases and the surface of metals were also seen to have a photoelectric effect while in the resonator, meaning that they were producing light. [This seems to explain why the large outdoor pyramids could not involve metal in their construction.] Furthermore, Dr. Krasnoholovets replicated Patrick Flanagan’s historic “pyramid power” experiments by studying the effects on a razor blade within this resonator. The blade was aligned east to west, perpendicular to the Earth’s magnetic field, while a piece of the edge was removed and stored away from the resonator. Under scanning electron microscope, the edge of the razor blade from the resonator was seen to take on a smoother, less angular form over time."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Figure 9.4 – Normal razor surface (a) and razor surface after resonator exposure (b) under 3000x magnification."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"9.8 HYPERSPACE PHYSICS OF JOE PARR Dr. John DeSalvo of the Giza Pyramid Research Association has also brought the pyramid research of Joe Parr to the world’s attention through his various media appearances such as on the Laura Lee Show and Jeff Rense. Joe Parr holds a law degree and also has over 40 years experience as an electronics engineer. Parr’s interest in pyramid research first came about from his meeting George Van Tassel, an early contactee, in the 1950s, who informed him about the “pyramid power” experiments of Pat Flanagan that had demonstrated the sharpening of razor blades in the pyramid structure. Other experiments showed that organic materials would naturally dehydrate without putrefying while inside a pyramidal structure. Even raw, unrefrigerated milk would keep from spoiling if properly positioned. 9.8.1 STATIONARY PYRAMID RESEARCH Parr went on to begin studying pyramid-related phenomena, first by simply using stationary pyramids and taking measurements from them. These pyramids could be made of nothing more than four horizontal rods forming a base and four vertical rods forming the edges. He would then place sources of radio waves, magnetic fields, ion sources and radioactive sources inside the pyramids, and measure their strength outside the pyramids. From this study, he found that a spherical energy field surrounds any pyramid structure. The exact center of this orb corresponds to the Queen’s Chamber position in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Inside this “orb,” the strength of the electromagnetic or radioactive source that he placed inside will still be measured at its full potential, but areas outside the orb will have a 1 to 3 percent reduction in the amount of measurable energy. 9.8.2 VARIANCE WITH SOLAR, LUNAR AND OTHER CYCLES After 13 years of studying this phenomenon, Parr found that a negative ion generator (air ionizer) would strengthen the orb, causing it to shield and hold in even more energy than before. Specific sound frequencies such as 51.5 hertz could also be used to strengthen the orb. Over the course of 20 years of measurements, Parr determined that the strength of this energy orb varies with the common 11-year sunspot cycle, and the width of the orb expands and contracts with the phases of the moon. All of these observations again suggest that the spherical orb is a static torsion field that gathers around the pyramid, and is strengthened by absorbing dynamic torsion fields. These fields can be strengthened by the electrostatic energy in the ions or in the acoustic vibration of air, which also is a vibration of the aether. Solar and lunar activity also has a direct impact on the strength of dynamic torsion energy streaming into the earth. 9.8.3 IMPORTANCE OF “PHI” CYCLE OF TIME Further analysis determined that the classic “phi” ratio was very important to these energy fields as well, again showing a clear connection to torsion fields. Parr found that a form of “virtual” clock would begin counting at the time that the pyramid was first set in a certain position. This means that once the pyramid was placed in a fixed spot, the orb surrounding the pyramid would gradually become stronger and stronger in its ability to contain the energy"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"fields inside, and the rate of growth for the energy bubble was directly proportional to “phi”. At certain mathematically-defined points in this “phi” cycle, the bubble will expand and contract in size, outside of the effect caused by the moon. This suggests a slow, long-term harmonic “wobble” in the energy field, reverberating like a gong in synchrony with the phi-proportions of the instreaming torsion waves. 9.8.4 ENERGY FROM GALACTIC CENTER Parr’s experiments were abruptly disturbed on December 4, 1979, when the spherical energy orbs around the pyramids started rapidly disappearing on all but one experiment for an unknown reason. This caused the electromagnetic and radioactive sources inside the pyramids to suddenly flow without interruption into the surrounding space. Years later, Parr was very surprised to find out that the stream of X-rays from the center of our galaxy had abruptly shut off that day, and the anomaly was widely noted by astronomers. Other pyramid-energy shutdown events documented by Parr also corresponded precisely with drop-offs in our galaxy’s X-ray emissions, though he was unaware of this connection at the time the measurements were made. This is another valuable piece of data, as it shows us that the center of the galaxy is actually our primary source of instreaming torsion wave energy. In this case, the torsion waves appear to be propagating in tandem with the X- ray wavelengths of the electromagnetic energy spectrum. Even though the activity of the Sun can increase or decrease the strength of torsion waves coming into the Earth, without the input from the Galactic Center we will have much less energy available to us. This will prove to be a very important point that we will use to explain the importance of the Mayan Calendar end-date on Dec. 21, 2012. About nine days after Dec. 4, 1979, the spherical energy fields started to return, yet all but one pyramid had lost the original energy strength of the orb, which had slowly accumulated over time according to the “virtual clock” of the phi radio. The only pyramid that did not lose its energy field throughout this entire time period was a pyramid that was rotating by a mere 5 degrees every 10 days. As Parr allowed this particular experiment to continue running, he found that the strength of its energetic orb continued increasing, eventually surpassing all of his other stationary pyramids. As we now know, the slight rotation caused the pyramid to absorb a small but measurable amount of torsion waves that would otherwise be traveling straight down and / or straight up with the gravitational field. 9.8.5 IMPORTANCE OF ROTATION IN ENERGY-SHIELDING EFFECT So, only the rotating pyramid survived the galaxy-induced “blackout” of December 4, 1979, and somehow the rotation caused it to eventually harness more energy than all the others. This was Parr’s first realization that rotating the pyramids could dramatically enhance the strength of energy that they were absorbing and radiating, as Russian scientists such as Kozyrev had already discovered. For several years he tinkered with various designs to rotate pyramids, and he also found out that he could strengthen their energy fields even further by passing them through alternating magnetic fields as they rotated. This allowed him to reach levels much higher than the 1 to 3 percent shielding for a stationary pyramid. As he reached these higher levels,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"he also noticed that there would be a reduction in the weight of objects inside the pyramid as well; gravity was also being shielded. 9.8.6 “PINCH-OFF” AND HYPERSPACE Over this time, he calculated that when he could get the pyramids to reach a certain speed while also bathing the surrounding air with atomic particles such as ions, there would be a “pinch-off” where the shielding would reach 100 percent. At this point the pyramid’s energy field would completely shield off all electromagnetic, radioactive and gravitational energy. Rotation alone could create a 50% shielding effect when the proper speed was attained, and the atomic particles were required to reach the 100% pinch-off point. Sunlight could also be used as the source of atomic particles to achieve complete shielding in the energy orb. Obviously, this fits in with our previously stated ideas about objects displacing into higher levels of aetheric density, drawing from the concepts of Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg, Dr. A.M. Mishin and Dr. Harold Aspden. Indeed, it appears that an object will gradually displace into a higher aetheric density as it vibrates closer to the speed of light. Eventually, a complete shift can be made into the higher density at that point, and when the pressure is later released, the object will naturally shift back down into our own density. This also correlates with the patent of David Hudson, where microcluster iridium was seen to disappear when it was heated up to 850° Celsius, but would reappear when the temperature was reduced. Therefore, it shouldn’t surprise us that once the 100% shielding level was attained in Parr’s experiments, the pyramid would temporarily disappear from our known “three-space” reality. At these times, the pyramids would disconnect from their epoxy mountings on the rotating arm, which was calculated to require 2000 pounds of force, or a sudden increase in kinetic (movement) energy that was 113,000 times greater than before. In 55 different experiments of this type, the pyramid would pass through solid objects such as the wall of the machine, which formed an enclosed shell that surrounded the path of the pyramid’s rotation. When the pyramid would re- emerge into our own space after passing through the solid casing of the machine, it would be traveling at a tremendous speed like a bullet and often end up embedding itself into the wall of his laboratory or exploding. 9.8.7 SETUP OF EXPERIMENT Now that we have established that this very anomalous effect would occur, it is good for us to have a better understanding of how this machine was actually constructed. In Parr’s setup, a 5-inch thick, 3-foot diameter circular chamber houses a blade that rotates in a propeller-like fashion. The wood blade is 3 inches wide by 1/8-inch thick and swings in a 25-inch diameter circle. At both ends of the arm, two small one-inch base pyramids weighing eight grams each and made of ABS plastic are attached. The points of the pyramid are horizontally aligned with the base, pointing away from the center of the arm. The centrifuge is driven by a 12-volt DC ¼ horsepower motor in the 700-2400 rpm range. As the pyramids rotate, they pass through 36 pairs of magnets arranged in a giant circle, each pair attached just over one inch above and below the path of the pyramids on the ends of the rotating arm. The magnetic pairs alternate between north and south polarity, causing a"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"continuing fluctuation in the fields that the pyramids were exposed to. As we said, Parr determined that under sufficiently energetic conditions, the interior of the 1-inch wide plastic pyramids would start to shield all known energy fields, whether gravitational, electromagnetic or radioactive. The area inside the bubble surrounding the pyramids would lose weight. Radioactive materials, radio frequency sources and magnetic sources placed inside the small pyramids would be shielded from the outside. When pinch-off is achieved, the pyramids would either self-destruct or travel through solid objects, as indicated. This would also have the effect of causing extensive damage to the rotating arm and the entire inside of the machine. 9.8.8 ENERGY STREAM BETWEEN SUN AND ORION’S BELT Parr found that this sudden increase of energy leading to pinch-off would occur most reliably every year on Dec. 13-16, and his measurements were taken over a 13-year period. Eventually, Parr discovered that at this time, the Earth’s orbital path was intersecting an imaginary line that could be drawn between the Sun and the belt stars of Orion. This led Parr to conclude that an active energy conduit of some sort exists between the Sun and the stars of Orion’s belt. This also falls in line with our expectations related to torsion fields, as there will be streams of aetheric energy connecting all the stars together and flowing between them. The closer we are to a star, the stronger the stream will be, and in the case of Orion’s belt we have three central stars in close proximity with four other close stars surrounding them in a giant “X” shape. Thus, the shape of the stars in the Orion constellation forms a passive torsion generator in its own right. 9.8.9 ACCELERATION TO AND FROM THE MOON One of the most interesting findings of Joe Parr comes from his observations of which direction the pyramids would travel in once they achieved pinch-off. Under the following experimental conditions, we should assume that the moon is new, meaning that it is not giving off light. Parr found that if the rotating chamber for the pyramid was bathed with negative ions, it would accelerate away from the moon. However, if the chamber was filled with positive ions, the pyramid would accelerate towards the moon. This fits in line with our quantum physics models, where in this case we would see the Earth as if it were a giant atom. A pyramid that is displaced into a higher aetheric density with negative ions will move towards the center of the earth, just as the negatively-charged electron clouds will press towards the center of the atom. Similarly, a pyramid charged with positive ions will accelerate away from the center of the earth, repelling against the negative charge. 9.9 STAN TENEN’S DISCOVERY OF GIZA PYRAMID AS RESONATOR In a 2000 appearance on the Laura Lee Show, researcher Stan Tenen noted that the Great Pyramid of Giza is built in harmony with the molecular structure of its materials. The vast majority of blocks that make up the pyramid are limestone, which is primarily a calcium carbonate [CaCO3] crystal. The Great Pyramid was built with a 51 degree, 51 minute slope angle, and Tenen pointed out that the calcium carbonate molecule has an approximately 52-degree angle in its shape. This is known as a “cleavage angle” and means that when pure calcium carbonate crystals are split, they will tend to split along this 52-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"degree angle. Therefore, Tenen claims, the slope angle of the pyramid brings its entire shape into harmony with the molecules of the matter that makes it up. Tenen knows of no other structure on Earth that fits this pattern. Clearly, such a harmonic connection between “micro” and “macro” would only further enhance the pyramid’s effects.
