Andthere he was. A mysterious black man sat crying on the staircase of our familyhome. His filthy clothes were drenched in sweat and tears. He was shielding hisface with both hands as he sobbed, resting his elbows on his knees. He was notinvited. I had no idea who he was, what he was doing in our house, or why he wascrying. Looking again to the fragile tungsten filament, lit up perfectly withoutthe protective shroud of the glass bulb, it happened. “Light bulbs cannot burnwhen the glass is broken. What I am seeing right now is impossible. My God, Imust be dreaming! None of this is real! And yet here I am, right now! Awake inthe dream!”At that moment, I was overwhelmed with emotions. My body, or whatever my minddecided that my body was at that moment, surged with an almost unspeakable powerof ecstasy. I didn’t know who the man was and now it didn’t even matter. I hadfinally done it. After weeks’ worth of practice and multiple failed attempts, Ihad awakened within a dream for the first time—becoming fully conscious andlucid. And now I had an agenda. The books had promised godlike abilities in alucid dream, and I wanted to test them out. I willed myself to fly right throughthe thick brown wood of the front door—and it presented no resistancewhatsoever. I glided above the white birch tree in our front yard—a much betterexperience than any climbing I had done in it as a boy. I quickly rose up andlooked down at our house from a bird’s-eye view, fully free.I knew my body was safely asleep in my room, waiting for me to drift back to itas soon as I finished my epic adventure. In this form, I could go anywhere, beanyone, and do anything. I was a superhero. The only limit was my imagination.And as any practitioner of lucid dreaming will tell you, this phenomenon feelsevery bit as real as any waking experience you could ever have—if not more so.You transcend into a reality that words do not adequately describe, but mightbest be thought of as hyperreal. Your awareness becomes vastly more effectiveand all-encompassing than in any conventional state. Thoughts come rushing intoyour mind at an impressive speed, manifesting themselves into beautifullyintricate structures before you even have a chance to ask the questions theyanswer. Limitless knowledge is there for the taking, with no effort whatsoever.And despite the awesome power of that experience, none of it seems to matterbecause you are so emboldened by the present moment. It is not at all uncommonfor a lucid dreamer to conclude, “I have never truly been awake before.”Little did I know that within a few years, my lucid-dreaming research wouldplunge me into a world that seems completely supernatural by most people’sstandards. I would eventually come into direct contact with angelic,human-looking extraterrestrial beings who helped me completely reenvisionscience and spirit into a new and greater unified whole. The beings also helpedme to identify a huge wealth of new evidence and proof that would help make thecase. I would learn that these people initially reach out to you through dreams,synchronicities, and visionary experiences. They proved over and over again thatthey could predict the future as easily as if they were reading a book. And theywould soon pass along the greatest message of all: namely that we are right onthe threshold of a spectacular mass evolutionary event many have calledAscension. I have uncovered far more than enough scientific evidence to make avery compelling case for this, as I have presented in my previous books. Forthose of us who “do the homework” and prepare ourselves for this fascinatingglobal transformation, our everyday lives will become indistinguishable from alucid dream. The awesome popularity of superhero films may be another way inwhich our mass, collective subconscious mind is preparing us for what may becoming—far sooner than we would have ever believed possible. We may well findourselves awakening within the dream we once were so convinced was reality.These angelic beings also reveal that the only way to prepare ourselves for thismass awakening is to be genuinely dedicated to following a path of service toothers—practicing forgiveness, compassion, patience, love, and understanding inour daily lives as our primary motivation. This is the core message of all greatspiritual traditions. If we apply these principles as a regular practice, wehave the potential to experience a quantum leap in human evolution that isalmost unthinkable in its scope and power. The lucid-dreaming experience cangive us a marvelous “sneak preview” of what our new lives as Ascended beingswill be like. The study and analysis of dreams has always been a very essentialpart of my work that made everything else possible, and this book is the firsttime I have ever presented a deep examination of what I was doing and how I didit.PROTOCOLS OF LUCID DREAMINGThe year was 1989. I was a sixteen-year-old student of the mystic scientist Dr.Stephen LaBerge through reading his groundbreaking book Lucid Dreaming. I wasdelighted to discover that lucidity was not that hard to achieve if you couldalready remember your dreams in the morning, as I often did. The key differencebetween waking and dreaming states is that in a dream, you can look at aparticular area, look away and look back, and something will have changed. Itmay be subtle, such as a color or the position of an object, but it may also bequite dramatic—as in a completely different scene from the one you saw before. Awall in a house may turn into a lovely ocean beach just by turning your head,looking away, and then looking back at the same spot.Dr. LaBerge encourages you to practice this exercise in your waking life. Lookat a particular area, ask yourself if you are dreaming, look away from it andthen look back. Check the area to make sure it still looks the same. Always beready to be completely fascinated by the fact that something has changed—andthink about how you might discover that you are actually dreaming, right now.That sense of childlike anticipation and wonder is a very important part of thepractice. I had consistently practiced this meditation in 1989, and I hadfinally remembered to check my environment for unusual things while I wasactually dreaming. The shattered light bulb and strange, uninvited man were whattipped me off that I had finally awakened in a dream.The real “crown jewel” of Dr. LaBerge’s method, however, is called MILD—whichstands for Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming. The word mnemonic refers tosomething that helps assist your memory. To practice this technique, you firstpick a day where you can sleep in and not wake up to an alarm. Right after youwake up, remain completely motionless and ask yourself, “What was just happeningto me? Where was I? Who was I talking to? What was going on?” This is the key toremembering any dream. If you ask yourself, “What was I just dreaming?” you arenot likely to get anywhere, because your dream will have seemed completely realas you went through it. Then, as you remember your dream, start noticing thethings in it that would be impossible from a waking perspective. Perhaps you aretalking to one person and then, in the middle of your conversation, they changeinto someone else. The objects and locations around you might spontaneouslytransform. You might be driving in a car and then find yourself walking indoors,quite seamlessly. In the dream, you usually ignore all these sudden changes andjust follow along with whatever is happening to you in the moment. I willpresent a variety of examples of lucid dreams in this book where you can see foryourself how I spotted inconsistencies in the dream, in real time, which led tomy realizing I was dreaming—and being able to consciously awaken within thedream experience.Most important, after you have identified something strange, you then imagineyourself still being inside that same dream. Visualize yourself noticingwhatever is out of place. Then allow your imagination to fully experience thejoy and wonder of awakening in the dream. Let yourself feel that rush ofexcitement as you levitate objects with your mind, transform objects from oneform into another, manifest anything you desire out of seemingly nothing, walkthrough solid walls, or levitate and soar like a bird through the air. Thesefeats may be far easier than you think they will be, since in most cases you cando whatever you want quite easily.Last, as you continue to visualize all of this happening and are feeling excitedabout it, you keep repeating a particular sentence in your mind, over and overagain: “Next time I’m dreaming, I want to remember to recognize I’m dreaming.”You might say it fifty times, a hundred times, it doesn’t matter . . . and don’tcount them. The most important thing is to keep repeating the sentence.Eventually, as you repeat the sentence, everything around you will have changedand you are in a new situation, having new experiences. It is easy to bedistracted and get pulled into another dream, but now you may notice that youare still repeating the same sentence. You then listen to what you are saying:“Next time I’m dreaming, I want to remember to recognize that I’m dreaming.”Then you take a look around and recognize that you are indeed dreaming—rightnow! I have had dozens of successes with the use of this exact technique.From there, your main job is to stay lucid and avoid snapping back into yourbody until you are ready to. Your single biggest danger is to have any thoughtof your body whatsoever as your dream goes on. You might think about theposition of your head, your arms, your legs, whether you are hungry or need togo to the bathroom, any physical pains, or anything else that might be going onin the room. If this happens, you will find yourself right back in your body,awake, and you have to try again. As you practice more, you will notice that ifyou start thinking about your body, you don’t lose the dream immediately. Youwill start seeing everything around you fading out into a gray mist. You nowhave only a few seconds left to try to stay awake in the dream.In his book Adventures Out of the Body, William Buhlman recommends shouting outthe words Clarity Now if everything starts fading away like this. You focus onkeeping a small area visible, even if it’s just a foot-wide circle at the centerof your vision, and then widening the area as you keep shouting. Buhlman alsorecommends using both of your hands as if power is shooting out of them—thepower to stabilize your dream reality. In the Carlos Castenada books, which Iread during this period of my life, the alleged Yaqui shaman Don Juan recommendsthat you look at your dream hands. They will very likely look weird and scary,with fingers missing or distorted shapes, but it is a quick move you can makethat will get you thinking about your dream reality rather than your physicalone. Oddly, there is a difference between looking at your hands in the dream andthinking about your physical body in the bed. Once you become lucid, you will beable to tell the difference. If you keep your awareness fixed in the lucidexperience and focus on whatever you see around you, everything is fine. If youstart thinking about the fact that you also have a body that is somewhere else,and especially if you try to move your sleeping body or worry about it, you willsnap right back.Dr. LaBerge recommends a fairly similar technique to avoid losing your dream,which he calls “spinning.” In this case, you lace your fingers together withboth of your thumbs sticking up. Hold your thumbs high above your head. Look atyour thumbs and then spin yourself around in circles. For some reason, if you dothis, once you decide to stop spinning, you will usually find yourself walkingaround in a new reality, where you are still dreaming. I have used this trick onmultiple occasions and it really does work.The main books that helped me achieve this fascinating state over the years areLucid Dreaming and Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Dr. StephenLaBerge,1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber0],2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber1]Conscious Dreaming by Robert Moss, and Adventures Out of the Body by WilliamBuhlman, who focuses on consciously inducing out-of-body states. In that case,Buhlman recommends some additional exercises while you are in deep meditation,such as visualizing yourself standing at the opposite end of the room you arein, and looking at yourself as you lie in bed. This was much harder for me thanusing Dr. LaBerge’s techniques, but I did get it to work on more than oneoccasion. I found myself “snapping into” the vision of myself on the other sideof the room, and from there I could float around, fly through a window, and seewhat my house looked like from the overhead view.Other methods outside of techniques in books are available to aid you in luciddreaming. For example, Dr. LaBerge invented the NovaDreamer, a sleep mask thatcan help signal when you are having a dream. The mask senses when you haveachieved the rapid eye movement or REM state, and then flashes lights in youreyes. You will see these same flashes in your dream, since Dr. LaBergediscovered that whatever happens to your physical body will appear in your dreamin some way. You may have noticed this happen when some kind of loud noise inthe room appears in your dream in a very different form. The beeping sound of atruck backing up could start in your dream as a person screaming, for example.With practice, you can train yourself to look for flashing lights in yourordinary waking reality, and be ready to capture a dream in process whenever yousee them. Certain modern versions of these lucid-dreaming sleep masks are stillavailable for you to purchase online at reasonable prices, and many people havehad great success using them.MEETINGS WITH THE OLD MANIf the dream space and even your dreaming body is strictly a product of yourawareness, as Dr. LaBerge and others have concluded, how can that world becomeso vividly realistic, solid, and three-dimensional once you are lucid andwalking or flying around in it? I have spent plenty of time walking around,touching things, talking to people, and experiencing what seems to be aperfectly real world—even though it does keep changing as you move through it.At this point you are forced to start asking new philosophical questions. Youcan no longer take “basic reality” for granted. You may find yourself wonderingif our normal, everyday life may also be an elaborate illusion—another dreamwithin a dream. And who is the dreamer? Is there some cosmic intelligence, someawareness that is within each of us, who dreamed this entire universe intobeing? And if so, then what is reality? Perhaps even more important, who isreality?Very soon after I achieved lucidity for the first time, I wrote a simple poem onOctober 6, 1989, entitled “A New Thought.” At sixteen years of age, beingconstantly bullied and feeling extremely out of place in the world, I wasstarting to ask questions that demanded answers. I had been meeting with anintriguing, fatherly, and very spiritually powerful old man in my dreams eversince I was two years old. I often felt the presence of this man as if he wasaround me, just out of view, giving me gentle and peaceful suggestions onvarious problems I faced. Who was this old man? What was this old man? Did hehave something to do with what we normally would think of as God? In aninspirational state, this was the poem I wrote as I explored those questions. Itranscribe these words now off of a printout I made from my original computer,an Apple IIc that my parents had purchased for me two years earlier in the fallof 1984, along with its very noisy old dot-matrix printer:> Within me there exists a presence, old as time yet fresh with ideas. I feel> him there like I feel the gentle beating of my heart. He comforts me in my> times of need, and watches over me in times of danger. I know not who he is,> yet I sense where he has been. He has seen a simpler earth, where the skies> were filled with wonder and the crops were generous in times of hunger. He has> been there at every battlefield, every site of human emotions being put to the> test. With him comes wisdom, feeling, and care. I feel that he is a guide to> help me through the torment of living. He has been there since the beginning,> when the state of existence and all of space in itself was merely a thought> that pierced through the white nothingness. This thought became matter, and he> began to shape it with his loving hands. He is more than an entity. He is more> than my lord. He is more than a man. Do you know who he is?This poem was partly a celebration of my first lucid dream. One interesting linein this poem is “He has seen a simpler earth, where the skies were filled withwonder,” because I remember having a very clear visual image of UFOs as I wrotethose words. As I documented in The Ascension Mysteries, I have had powerful UFOdreams ever since I was two years old. I would see cigar-shaped craft with nowings, floating and fluttering silently in my backyard. Sometimes I was aloneand sometimes I was with my mother. The feeling was always one of immensefascination. On many occasions I boarded these craft and found the old manwaiting for me inside. He had gray hair, a gray beard, a slightly off-whiterobe, and sandals. He spoke very peacefully and lovingly. He was always patientand kind, never in the least bit rude or disrespectful. I actually felt moreconnected to him than I did to my own parents, and I would often cry when I wokeup and realized that our latest conversation was “only a dream.” I told mymother about many of these dreams, often in great detail, but left out the partabout how I felt even closer to him than to her or Dad. At this point, she waskeeping a written journal of her own dreams every morning in spiral-boundnotebooks, and she was surprised by the level of detail that I would remember.From as early as I can recall, going back to age two, the old man told me that Iwas going to be a very famous person. He knew I was meeting rock stars with myfather, who had been a music journalist since Vietnam, where he was stationedduring Woodstock in 1969, and who took me to rock concerts where we usually gotbackstage passes. The old man wanted me to observe these celebrities and learnwhat their strengths and weaknesses were, identifying the mistakes that I wouldwant to avoid later in life. As a result, once I did have a public career, Iended up doing only a few conferences a year despite massive demand, as I couldsee how quickly these stars were burning out from constant touring. Most of themlasted just a few years before deliberately ending their careers in order tofind relief. The old man also strongly emphasized the importance of my studyingscience, and wanted me to learn as much about it as I possibly could. He told methat something wonderful was going to happen on Earth, within my own lifetime.Some of us would have the opportunity to transform into something far more thana “normal” human being and become like superheroes. After I saw Star Wars in1977, the old man began appearing as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi master who couldlevitate objects with his mind just like I often did in my dreams. I did thinkabout the fact that in Star Wars, Darth Vader killed Obi-Wan and then Obi-Wanreappeared as a ghostly “light being.” Similarly, in my dreams the old man hadthe same shimmering aura of light around him, and he didn’t always seemcompletely solid and real.My poem also featured the idea that “existence and all of space in itself wasmerely a thought that pierced through the white nothingness.” Once I startedcollege, I realized that there was a whole branch of philosophy built aroundthis concept, known as existentialism, and I took some classes in it. The basicidea of this philosophy is that the only thing we can absolutely prove to betrue is our own awareness. A lucid dream will definitely get you thinking likethis. Everything else around you, including the entire visible universe, couldbe some form of an illusion that is created by your awareness.MY GREATEST WISH: TO GET ANOTHER CHANCEAnother important aspect of my first lucid dream in 1989 was that it finallygranted my greatest wish. I had held on to this wish for eleven years—ever sinceI was five years old. By then, I already had been meeting the old man in UFOdreams for three years. When I first learned about UFOs from television, books,and movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I got very excited becausebefore then, I had no idea that there was a name for these unusual craft I hadbeen seeing so often in dreams. In 1978, at age five, I was a kindergartenstudent, and I woke up one night to find that I was floating about three feetover my body in bed. I was watching my body breathe gently under the covers. Iwas clearly alive. In fact, I felt more alive than ever before. My floating bodyhad the same yellow pajamas on with the red cuffs. My bedroom door was open andthe hall light was on, as usual. I began floating down the hall feetfirst,though I had no control over it. I then stopped at the stairs. Some forcesuddenly turned my body 90 degrees and tilted my feet down. Now I startedgliding down the stairs, again only about a foot below the ceiling. Unlike adream, everything stayed vividly real. Nothing around me was changing. At thispoint, I became terrified that I was dying, and snapped back into my body.I immediately started thinking I was a failure for getting scared. I felt thatif I had been brave enough to understand that I was not dying, the next stepwould have been for me to fly outside. Night after night, I wondered if one ofthose tube-shaped silver craft would have been waiting for me outside the house.Even more so, I wondered if the old man would be in the craft, and I wouldfinally get to meet him for real—and not just in another dream. The strong senseof fatherly connection that I had with the old man was a very powerfulincentive. Every night, I apologized for being scared and prayed for anotherchance. I saved the “sacred pajamas” and never wore them again, and I still havethem to this day. My prayers went on for two long years before I finally told mymother what had happened to me, and my dream of a second chance. She said that Ihad experienced something called extrasensory perception, or ESP. She took me toa bookshelf under the cellar stairs with nice-smelling paperbacks she had beenbuying since the 1960s. My eyes immediately were attracted to a book that hadESP on the spine in big letters. It was How to Make ESP Work for You by HaroldSherman. The edition I read was released on January 1, 1968.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber2]I read the book and practiced the exercises, though I didn’t get anotherout-of-body experience until I had my success with lucid dreaming as a teenager.However, I did have great success with other techniques. One of the ESP toolsSherman gave in the book was a how-to map for telepathic communication. Idecided to test this out on my best friend at the time. As I lay there in bedone night, I kept visualizing Eric’s face. I thought of his school picture,images of him smiling, images of him not smiling, just as many ways ofvisualizing his face as I could think of. At the same time, I was continuouslytelling him in my mind, “Eric, you will wake up in the middle of the night.” AsI kept doing this, I realized I needed to add something else to be able tovalidate that this had really worked. I then changed the phrase to “Eric, youwill wake up in the middle of the night and think of gold.” The next morning inthe cafeteria, I asked Eric how he had slept, without giving away anything aboutwhat I had done. Eric looked truly shocked. He told me he had bolted awake inthe middle of the night and felt a ghostly presence in the room. I then askedhim what his first thought was. He said he wanted to look at his watch. “Whatcolor is your watch?” I asked. “Gold,” he replied. We were both awestruck as Itold him about the telepathic experiment I had conducted the night before. Erichad already seen me bringing my ESP book to class every day, which I had coveredover with a white piece of paper where I had written the words Free Reading onthe cover. We were allowed to do “Free Reading” of books in school if we hadfinished our other work, and I was always one of the first kids to finish anassignment.This surprising success led to my creating a “psychic club” with a few of myfriends, including Eric. They would go around the corner of the kindergartenbuilding, far out of my sight or earshot, and pick a number between one and ten.By following Sherman’s protocols of going into a deep meditation and then takingthe first piece of data that popped into my mind, however quiet or subtle it mayhave been, I was able to guess the correct number every single time. Now that Iam an adult and my thoughts tend to be significantly more cluttered, thisperformance would probably be very difficult to repeat. At the time, I simplypicked the first number I thought of in each case, once I knew I was in theproper meditative state, and I never second-guessed that original thought. Ieven knew when they had decided to try to trick me, and I stopped them and toldthem what their trick was going to be. They were about to choose a “fake number”for me to guess that would be different from the “real number” they had alreadypicked. I saw a huge number seven fly toward me with brilliant rock and rollstage lights in my mind’s eye as they walked away. I then saw them leaning in,laughing and whispering with each other, and I suddenly realized what washappening. I yelled out to them, “Come on back, you’ve already chosen the nextnumber. It’s seven.” I thought they would be very excited about this, but itturned out they were so frightened that our “club” immediately broke up.Years later, I would discover that Harold Sherman, the author of the ESP book,was one of a few key personnel involved in creating a formalized intuitiveprogram for the government and military. Ordinary people can be trained to haveESP results that are every bit as good as these stories I just shared with you.Other key people who worked on this initial team were Ingo Swann, Dr. RussellTarg, and Dr. Hal Puthoff. The program came to be known as “remote viewing,”where ordinary people could be trained to psychically travel to remote locationsand view them. In most cases, neither the remote viewer nor the guide had anyidea what the target would be. This is what the scientists called a“double-blind” study. Nonetheless, the best remote viewers could achieve up to99 percent accuracy in describing a double-blind target. Remote viewing willbecome a central aspect of our narrative as we move on. I was fortunate enoughto get some initial information on how to do it from Sherman’s ESP book, andthen I got the rest of the basic training from reading Dr. Courtney Brown’s bookCosmic Voyage in 1996—with stunning results. In my case, I was able to use theseprotocols to pull in pages and pages of written text from a higher level of myown soul—the same part of me that was designing my dreams to help teach mevarious lessons. These words proved to have remarkable spiritual guidance and aNostradamus-like ability to peer into the future with stunning accuracy.STRANGE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCESMuch of my early adventures are revealed in The Ascension Mysteries, but thespiritual aspects of the story admittedly drop off after 1992. What comes after1992 in the personal sense is actually far more interesting, but it required anew book—which you are now reading—to cover it in proper detail, along with allthe scientific data and documentation to back it up. The second half of TheAscension Mysteries discusses what I learned from a wide variety of insiders whohave security clearances that in some cases are thirty-five levels of “need toknow” above the president of the United States. I eventually found out that theUFO subject is no laughing matter. This was very different from how I felt insome of my earliest lucid dreams from 1989 and 1990, where I would fly up intothe upper atmosphere, only to find myself aboard a spacecraft. I wasn’t askingfor this to happen—I just found myself suddenly getting pulled on board asuper-advanced spacecraft with friendly people who were dressed like the oldman. In some of my lucid dreams, I also visited a world where these people werewalking around, but everything was made out of giant blocks of pure white stonethat were perfectly polished and beautiful. There were pyramids, rings of stonelike Stonehenge, domed buildings, and so forth. Anyone who saw me there was veryfriendly to me, and many of them seemed surprised to see me walking around.At this point, I was still very much a skeptic. Dr. LaBerge believed thedreamworld was strictly a construct of your own mind. I confidently told thepeople I met on these ships that they were all figments of my imagination. Theywould just politely laugh and talk to me about things like my spirituality andfuture destiny. Since they kept sticking around and did not disappear after Ilooked away, I stayed in the conversation and decided to enjoy talking to my“subconscious mind.” The “old ones” asked me a lot of questions. They listenedto what I had to say, repeated it back to me, and gently pointed outcontradictions in my thinking. In short, they were acting like loving, patient,and forgiving therapists. In a very nonconfrontational way, they asked me aboutmy use of marijuana and helped me to see that I probably did need to quit atsome point. I was definitely suffering from PTSD due to the almost unendingabuse I had endured, such as from my fellow students who relentlessly attackedme for my abnormally high test scores and extra weight, prior to when I losteighty-five pounds on a disciplined diet. In twelve-step recovery support-groupterms, I was “self-medicating” with cannabis for a problem that was quite severebut otherwise undiagnosed. These unique conversations with the “old ones”strongly influenced my decision to major in psychology when I went to college.TIME TO START ASKING QUESTIONSIn some of my more recent insider briefings that were not revealed in TheAscension Mysteries, I realized that there was a golden thread unifying many ofthese seemingly mysterious stories from my childhood. Why, for example, was Iconsistently sleepwalking and saying strange things as I walked around the houseas a young kid? Why did I write a short story as a child in which I was pickedup and taken in a spaceship to “Planet Z” and then became a very famous person?Why did I draw an “Intelligent Being” from Planet Z whose face looked almostexactly like a modern depiction of a Gray ET? Why did I draw a life-size imageof a three-foot-tall being with unusually large eyes in my closet, and feel thathe was my friend? Why did my mother once wake up to see a short human-lookingbeing with a normal-size head walking out of her room in the middle of thenight, while having an immense feeling of fear? Why did she have dreams of craftexactly like the ones I saw in my own dreams, again hovering in the backyard,while she was pregnant with my brother Michael?Why did I wake up so many times in the middle of the night with extreme,life-and-death fevers throughout my childhood? Why would I feel like I had toscream louder than the enormous sound that was reverberating in my ears as thishappened? Why would I get so many powerful hallucinations in these fevers,including many instances where the world around me was composed of geometricpatterns? Why would I repeatedly wake up in the middle of the night, take ashower, pack my book bag, eat a bowl of cereal with milk, and walk out the sidedoor, thinking I was going to school, only to then realize that it was stillpitch-black outside? Why did this strange routine happen not once, not twice,but dozens of times, to the point where it became quite ridiculous? Why didn’t Iever notice what time it was on the clock, or how dark it was outside, butinstead went through the entire process as if I was in some sort of trance?Why did I continue to feel closer and closer to the old man as I got older? Whydid I feel like an intelligent, loving presence was always around me, guiding meand steering my life, causing me to write poems and stories like “A New Thought”from October 6, 1989, which I wrote when I was only sixteen years old? Why did Icontinue to have so many spectacular UFO dreams? Why was I constantly guided toread books about science, astronomy, DNA, body language, ESP, palm reading,Tarot cards, shamanism, ancient civilizations, and other strange mysteries? Whydid I keep getting picked up by UFOs in my lucid dreams and meet with veryfriendly people dressed like the old man, who talked to me about my spiritualityand the destiny of humanity? Why had I already written three short stories aboutbeing an extraterrestrial soul in a human body by the time I was a freshman incollege, as I discussed in The Ascension Mysteries?SKIPPING AHEAD TO THE GOOD STUFFIf you read The Ascension Mysteries, you probably don’t need to hear me tell youagain about how my soul was shattered by the people around me, including myfriend with whom I had started the ESP club. We don’t need to review, again, howI started using cannabis when I was fifteen years old to self-medicate from thenearly suicidal depression I was feeling, and how it completely changed mycircle of friends. We already discussed how I was inspired to lose eighty-fivepounds of body weight starting a few months after I began using cannabis, as Ifound a new replacement for food as my escape mechanism. Nor do we need to coverhow I finally conquered my addiction in my sophomore year of college, giving upthe use of all drugs and alcohol as of September 21, 1992, by going totwelve-step support-group meetings. I felt as if I had no other choice if Iwanted to stay alive.What I did not say in the previous volume was that my mother quit first, in thehopes of inspiring me to do the same—and it worked. Although I described avariety of difficulties that my mother and I had with each other in TheAscension Mysteries, we were able to heal our differences and move into a trulywonderful relationship with trust, compassion, and mutual support. She was ableto fully embrace the unusual events and conclusions I had come to. My motheralso ran monthly conferences with me from 2009 to 2013, both in America andabroad, where she worked as a musician as well as a guest speaker.Soon after I got sober, I started remembering my dreams again and writing themdown every morning in notebooks—I still have all of them. It took a few monthsof drug-free living for me to start feeling happy again. I felt stronglycompelled to keep documenting my dreams, whether I understood their deeper,hidden meanings or not. In those early months, I had recurring nightmares that Ihad relapsed and started using drugs again. I would be very relieved when I wokeup and realized they were only dreams. We will review a few of these dreams inthe next chapter.About five months after I got clean, in February 1993, a close friend of minegave me information that changed my life forever. His professor, who was thehead of the physics department, openly told his class that UFOs were real. Howdid he know? He had worked in the higher echelons of NASA throughout the 1970s.At that level, everyone knew that Roswell was real, that other crashes hadoccurred as well, and that we had “reverse-engineered” much of our moderntechnological revolution since 1947 out of these ships—including computer chips.That insider disclosure was the pivotal event that made me realize that mydreams of the old man, including the lucid dreams where I got picked up bywandering UFOs, as well as the mystical visions I was turning into shortstories, may have been far more than fiction. There was some kind of strangeconnection between consciousness, dreams, lucidity, spirituality, ancientcivilizations, ancient stone structures like the pyramids, and UFOs.Perhaps my single most influential teenage dream featured me getting lured intoand trapped in an underground facility where extraterrestrials were living andworking on Earth. Some of them were using a strange technology to keep teenagersin a type of mind control. I had befriended one woman in the facility, but shecouldn’t break away like I was able to. I fought an incredible battle to make itto the control room, using a technology with which I could manifest an entirespaceship out of thin air or transform it into a battle suit that protected mybody. This dream was so powerful that my friend Jude wanted to make it into amovie, and created an initial storyboard for it. I then wrote out the script asa short story, but after it was finished, it just sat in my archives. It was atotal of 102 notebook pages: 60 in one book and 42 in a second, smaller one.NOTES FROM THE ORIGINAL SCRIPTHere is an exact, unaltered transcript of my original writing from the pivotalscene where my character breaks into the control room and faces off against themilitary villain at the end. Remember that at this time, I was still just aseventeen-year-old high school student, so it is replete with some profanelanguage and adolescent-dork angst. I feel it is very relevant to include thisexcerpt, as I had no idea that I would spend the rest of my life learning aboutunderground bases, extraterrestrials, government cover-ups, and Ascension at thetime this came in. I have now come to believe that this dream wasn’t just adream but was an insight into some very real information that I would laterlearn much more about. I speak about my character, Colin, in third person,referring to him as “he” and “his.”> His drill cut through the doors like a spoon being pushed through Jell-O.

Afew of my buddies read it and thought it was very good. Now I was in mysophomore year of college, and I was thinking about what the ex-NASA professorsaid. I realized that this dream might also have been more than just a dream.The government, in this case NASA, really did seem to be hiding major secretsfrom us. The disclosure soon ignited a passion for UFO research that hascontinued to this very day, and led to a successful and highly public career.Millions of people have been influenced by my work. It is not uncommon forsomeone to come up to me and tell me that my work helped them through very darkplaces in their life. However, up until now, I have been too afraid of publicridicule to tell the full story—but now is the time. I want you to know thetruth. You may start finding a lot of personal connections in this story, andbegin asking fascinating new questions. The reality you once took for grantedmay be a dream that you can awaken within."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOSYNCHRONICITIES, DREAMS, AND ARCHETYPESThe lucid-dreaming practice I outlined in chapter 1 ended up being the “bait”that lured me into the world of dreams in general. Although a lucid dream isquite a marvelous experience, after you’ve had a number of them, you don’tnecessarily need to keep trying anymore. It’s a lot of work, and adultresponsibilities can easily distract you. On the other hand, if you can rememberyour dreams in the morning and write them down, they can become a trulyremarkable, if not priceless, source of spiritual guidance and insight. Dreamsare by far my most consistent and valuable source of spiritual guidance, andanyone can learn the language and tap into this resource for themselves. I havebeen writing down my dreams now for twenty-seven years, and I do my very best tonever miss a single day. Up until now, I have never written in any depth abouthow I deciphered the language of dreams and used it for spiritual guidance.There is ample evidence that the language is universal, and that you canidentify how your own personal experiences appear as symbolic messages in yourdreams. Once you develop the practice and learn the language, you may besurprised at how radically your life will be transformed by dream data.In writing this book, I went back and reread my dream notebooks from 1992through 1996. This was the first time I had read them since I had written themdown in many cases. I ended up being so obsessed with other aspects of my careerthat I never went back and looked at these early dreams again. I was stunned todiscover a variety of fascinating “time loops,” where events that were happeningin my life as I was writing this book in 2019 were precisely predicted in 1992through 1996.The remote-viewing community has concluded that our own human consciousnessexists outside of time. Right now, this type of phenomenon seems fantastic andhard to believe. However, I do feel that in our not-too-distant future, we willhave a far more general understanding that everyone has prophetic dreams. If youstart writing down your own dreams, it shouldn’t take very long before some veryinteresting things start happening to you, including accurate future prophecies.I will give several very compelling examples of this as we go on.STUNNING SYNCHRONICITIESWhen I first started seriously researching UFOs in 1993, and even before,strange things kept happening to me. There were countless occasions when I wouldhave my head buried in a book for what seemed like hours, only to suddenlywonder what time it was, look at the clock, and see a pattern of repeatingdigits. The two most common patterns were 11:11 and 3:33, but I also saw everyother repeating combination—like 1:11, 2:22, 4:44, 5:55, and 12:12—as well aspatterns of numbers counting up, like 1:23 and 12:34. In fact, I could actuallymeasure how well I was doing by how often these number patterns appeared. If Iwas really focused on doing my research, I might see as many as fivesynchronicities a day. The numbers could appear just about anywhere, includingscoreboards, cash registers, license plates, outdoor clocks, billboards, and thelike. It is also very important to note that in almost every case, I would feelinfluenced to look at a particular spot before I had any conscious idea of whatI would see there. My eyes were just drawn to a certain area, and there it was.Once I became a driver, I had a ridiculous number of odometer synchronicities aswell. This was before the days of GPS navigation. I might be driving to aparticular location, make a few wrong turns, stop off at a store, think ofanother place to visit, and have a seemingly random trip. Then I’d drive home,and at the exact moment that I parked the car in the driveway and turned off theignition, the odometer might have a pattern of three, four, or even fiverepeating digits in it. If this only happens to you once or twice, it might notseem to be significant, but if it starts happening as often as two or threetimes a month, it definitely gets your attention. There were many otheroccasions where I would be driving along and suddenly get the urge to look at myodometer, which I never normally did while driving, and I would see repeatingdigits.As I have said in previous books, I had one exceptionally bizarre “eventsequence” of synchronicities in what would otherwise have been a typical trip tothe health food store for groceries. In this case the store was Robin’s FoodWarehouse in New Paltz, New York, which is no longer in business. By lookingback in my notes, I tracked the first of these events to April 21, 1996. At thetime, I was vegan and mostly lived on rice and beans, for that was all I couldafford, working at two cents above minimum wage. I scooped my dry goods intoplastic bags and at least two of them were precisely 0.99 pounds when I weighedthem, though I made no apparent effort to be that precise. Other items came outto a triple-digit synchronicity number in their price. I only had $20 to spend,and the price tag came out to exactly $19.99. Then, on the way home, I reached acertain intersection in the middle of the country, on North Ohioville Road. Isaw repeating digits on my odometer and repeating digits on my clock—5:55—at theexact same time. Even more bizarre was that on a subsequent trip to Robin’s onSeptember 19, 1996, I had the exact same type of synchronicity sequence takeplace. This time I again had a random scoop of rice weigh out at exactly 0.99pounds. My grocery bill came out to $19.19, and the date I wrote on the checkwas the nineteenth. Then, as I drove back to the exact same intersection asbefore, my odometer hit 130444, and the three-digit gas odometer was at 333. Ihad wondered if I should travel back to that intersection at night and wait forsome kind of UFO contact, but I was never brave enough to try it out. That sameweekend, I booked a bus ride for my first trip to New York City. It turned outthat the bus I needed to take would be leaving at exactly 5:55 P.M. This eventtook place less than two months before I started developing conscious telepathiccommunication with angelic extraterrestrial humans, as we will discuss later.This contact only developed after years of slow and deliberate buildup of trustwith my so-called Higher Self that was clearly speaking to me in dreams eachmorning.Better yet, the day after this happened, I recorded a CD with a friend of mine.Once we had finished it, he noticed that the CD’s run time came out to exactly55 minutes and 50 seconds—55:50. He then told me that perhaps that meant weshould air it on his radio show. Right then I looked at the clock and it said5:55. He was completely stunned, and I responded by telling him, in all honesty,that I didn’t need synchronicities anymore to realize that I was a part of God.Immediately after I said that, a large hawk flew over our heads. This onlycaused my friend to be even more amazed. He called me the “Walking SynchronicityMachine.”In another case, I was driving to a job where I was playing drums in the pitband for a play at Dutchess Community College. I was running late, and thinkingin the car about how I always seemed to have tension in my mind. I never seemedto have enough time to do the things I wanted to do, and I was frequentlygetting frustrated. Very clearly, I had the thought that I needed to meditatemore often, calm down, not feel so stressed out, and not take life so seriously.At this moment, I looked at the clock and saw repeating digits. Simultaneously,rain began pouring down, where it hadn’t even been a trickle before. This was apivotal event that helped teach me to “read” a synchronicity. Whatever I wasthinking about right before the synchronicity happened was important. Thesynchronicity was encouraging me to keep thinking along those same lines, ordoing those same things. Again, synchronicity happened so often that I wouldbecome concerned if more than a day or two went by without any of these types ofevents happening. If the synchronicity stopped, then I knew I was “off” andneeded to be more meditative and positive in my overall state of mind.DREAM GUIDANCEEver since I got sober on September 21, 1992, at age nineteen, I clearlyappeared to be getting direct messages from a higher aspect of myself on a dailybasis through dreams. I finally started writing them down in the mornings incollege-ruled spiral-bound notebooks as of October 23, 1992. It took quite awhile to be able to decipher the language that the dreams were using, but withthe help of various books and the repetition of a daily practice, their meaningsstarted to become clear. I was eventually able to understand what the dreamswere telling me in 95 to 98 percent of all instances. As the years went on andmy research deepened, there were countless occasions when a dream would offer mesome new insight into something I was reading about and studying. I was tippedoff about threats and unforeseen situations on countless occasions, and wasguided through a variety of different jobs and relationships that helped me toaccomplish various goals. Anytime someone was attempting to deceive me, I wouldquickly be able to identify their true intentions thanks to my dreams.I would often go back and review my dreams, such as a month later, only to findout that they had predicted the future in ways that I could not have seenbeforehand. This system provided me with very consistent prophetic guidance onhow to navigate innumerable life challenges successfully. Anyone who tried toget into my life and control me, including how I thought or what decisions Iwould make, quickly discovered that I would always defer to the “higherguidance.” I will explore the great significance of the Law of One series laterin the book, but one of my Law of One–inspired quotes, paraphrased by Dr. ScottMandelker, is “Most of your peoples cannot differentiate between love andcontrol,” and I certainly have had extensive experience with that samephenomenon.As I ventured into full-time work as a UFO researcher, author, and radiopersonality in 1998, I lived my adult life with military precision. I wasconstantly strategizing each minute of time during the day to try to optimize myeffectiveness for the greatest good of humanity. If someone started talking tome for very long, it was easy to feel this was not the best use of my time,though I was invariably polite and respectful. The main friendships I developedafter college were usually with insiders who were conveying highly classifiedand fascinating information. I rarely ever watched television or movies. I neverwanted to leave the house for any reason except to buy groceries and runnecessary errands.I experienced karma—the negative and painful side of synchronicity—as almostinstantaneous and utterly inevitable. I would marvel at people who would crashthrough life thinking they could “get away” with anger, jealousy, control,dominance, manipulation, lying, stealing, and other negative behaviors. It wasalso painful to note their own inability to see the consequences of theiractions in their daily lives, regardless of how seemingly obvious the connectionwas to me. Any significantly upsetting attack against my basic happiness andpeace of mind was usually followed by a distressing personal upheaval for thatperson, such as an unexpected accident or severe illness. In multiple cases,friends and associates attacked me heavily enough that they went through greatlydebilitating and even life-threatening karma. It was surprising to see how oftenthe karma would appear in such an obvious, undeniable fashion. I was alwaysdoing my very best to run a clean karmic game, with the precision and focus ofan Olympic athlete. For many years, I was afraid to set effective boundaries, asI knew it would upset the other person, and I was afraid this might cause meadditional damaging karma. This proved to be a gross error in judgment that Ihave since had to work very hard to process and integrate.DREAMS AND RAPID EYE MOVEMENTThe first book I read on dream analysis was Lucid Dreaming by Dr. StephenLaBerge.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber3] This was later followed by his sequel,Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber4] Inaddition to discussing lucid-dreaming exercises, Dr. LaBerge’s books also gave avery valuable overview perspective on what dreams really are, as seen byconventional and Jungian psychotherapists alike. This view is notably differentfrom the theories of typical cognitive scientists. I gained additional insightsinto this information through some of my college psychology classes, as well asbooks I read independently, such as those by Carl Jung.First of all, a surprising number of people think they never dream. It is nowfairly common knowledge that everyone dreams an average of two to three timesper night. Scientists can detect this in the lab by looking at your eyes. Whileyou are dreaming, your eyes dart around with the lids shut, in the phenomenoncalled REM, or rapid eye movement. Most people rarely bring any quality dreamdata back because of the violence of a morning alarm, and their overall lack ofsufficient sleeping hours on any regular basis. It is far better to let yourbody wake up on its own time, and to set your alarm only as a last-minuteprotective measure. I often found myself waking up right before my alarm wentoff and turning it off ahead of time anyway, so it was easy to adopt thispractice.Most of these cognitive scientists believe that dreams are simply the brain’sway of deciding which memories to store and which memories to throw away. Theresearchers realized that people would typically dream about things that hadhappened to them earlier that day, but in oddly symbolic ways that weredifferent from what actually happened. They believe that our dreams are takingour thoughts and experiences from the previous day and transferring them fromshort-term into long-term memory. Other than that, the strange symbolic natureof the things that would happen in dreams was basically overlooked. Dreams arestill often dismissed as the mostly useless chatter of a brain doing its best tostretch out and take a hot shower before the new day begins, filing away certainevents and understandings for their long-term survival value.HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONBy comparison, once you get into the opinion of psychology, and particularlyJungian psychology, things get more interesting. Psychologists were fascinatedby the powers of hypnosis, where people could be given commands, or“suggestions,” while in a hypnotic trance state. When I was only seven yearsold, I started reading books on hypnosis while also reading books on ESP. Thatsame year, my brother and I had proven that hypnosis worked by convincing ourfather, while he was fast asleep, to buy us a sausage and mushroom pizza. Weused a walkie-talkie at a very low volume next to his ear while he slept on thecouch. Very quietly, we planted the “suggestion” of how delicious it would be toorder a sausage and mushroom pizza. As soon as Dad awoke, he clapped his handstogether and said, “Hey, boys, what do you say we go get a sausage and mushroompizza?” This was the last time I ever hypnotized someone, as I feel it is anunethical practice that interferes with free will. A person given posthypnoticsuggestions can be awakened, have no memory of what they were told to do, butthen carry out the instructions they were given by some invisible butirresistible compulsion. Once put under hypnosis again, a person will remembereverything they had been told before, and their instructions can be furthermodified. The best hypnotic subjects are “somnambulists,” literally translatedas “sleepwalkers.” These are people who can talk, walk around, and performspecific actions while completely asleep. They can complete complex tasksrequiring thinking and interacting with others, all while seemingly wide awake,and have no memory of what they did after they are brought out of hypnosis.The original term for this hidden but accessible part of the mind that thehypnotist would speak to was the unconscious. Some of the books I read onhypnosis, dating back to when I was seven years old, had still used that term.The hypnosis books invariably warned you not to let anyone hypnotize you,because that person could get you to do just about anything—and it is far toodangerous to give anyone that level of trust. I remembered being verydisappointed by that, as I felt like amazing things could happen if I werehypnotized. More recent psychologists had deduced that this hidden, obedientpart of our minds did indeed have an active presence in our conscious thoughtsand behavior—though we were not fully aware of it. As a result, the termsubconscious was coined, and is still used today.The big guns of the corporate world certainly knew about the suggestible natureof the subconscious mind. By this time in my life, I had already seen televisionshows and read magazine articles about the real problems we had with subliminaladvertising. A drive-in movie theater might show its viewers a single frame, in1/24 of a second, that encouraged them to go to the concession stand and buy asoft drink. Consciously, the viewers do not see the image, nor are they aware ofwhat they are shown, but their subconscious mind is able to see and read theentire advertisement even at such fast speeds. If the advertisement is shownslowly enough for your conscious mind to read it, you can analyze theinformation and choose not to buy the item. However, once your subconscious iscommanded to want a soft drink, it can then influence and compel your consciousmind to go and buy it. This was considered to be an unethical business practiceand made illegal, but as I discussed in The Ascension Mysteries, there are manyexamples of subliminal advertising of various sorts still being used.THE SUPERCONSCIOUSSince the subconscious seems to love to follow orders without question, the nextquestion would be why? There must be a justifiable reason for our having anobedient inner self if we presume that we are the product of an intelligentdesign. Is there some other aspect of our consciousness that is giving theorders? Are we hardwired by some universal spiritual principle to trust this“higher self” that guides us through life? Apparently yes. Carl Jung theorizedthat there is a “superconscious” mind that we all ultimately have access to, butusually only through dreams and synchronicities. Our subconscious minds followthe guidelines from our superconscious, and we learn our own subconsciouslessons as we move through our dreams on a nightly basis. Those lessons in turninfluence our conscious thoughts, whether we are aware of it or not. Many of thebooks I read called the superconscious mind the Higher Self, and I willoccasionally use that term here.Jung’s belief in a superconscious mind was strongly inspired by a profoundnear-death experience, where he felt he had come into direct contact with thisuniversal mind—which often presents itself to people as a superintelligent,marvelously loving source of white light. Experiencers also report that thislight is Home, in a way that seems to greatly transcend any other sense of homethat they may have had before. There is a highly expanded awareness within thislight, and you realize that it is you, and you are it—in the greatest sense.Tibetan Buddhists like Namkhai Norbu are well aware of this universal presencein their practices and refer to it as “the mother light” or “natural light.”Norbu’s book Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light said that wetemporarily access the “mother light” after we fall asleep and before we startdreaming.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber5] This book had a huge effect on mewhen I discovered it in college. The Tibetan Buddhists also teach that we accessthe “mother light” after we die and before we enter into the afterlife realms,which they call the bardos. The ultimate goal of Tibetan Buddhism was to accessthis “mother light” by capturing that brief moment when you have access to itbefore you start dreaming but are already asleep. Once you have accessed thislight, you have merged with universal awareness. Among other things, you can getanswers to any question you might possibly have. Tibetan Buddhism alsoencourages its monks to develop to a point where every dream is lucid. Norbueven compared our normal, non-lucid-dreaming state to “sleeping like an animal.”In Western society, if you can even remember your dreams at all with anyconsistency, you are in great shape. Then, once you learn how to decipher yourdreams, they can become a highly useful source of spiritual guidance.In Jung’s model, the subconscious mind is a separate but intimately connectedpart of us that has its own personality and agenda. The subconscious is thepersonality that we enter into every time we are having a dream, or that iswalking around and doing things if we are in a somnambulistic trance. Jungbelieved that the superconscious mind was designing dreams for our subconsciousself to experience and learn from. The subconscious then could do its part totry to influence us in the waking world, based on what it had learned. Oursubconscious does not always make the best or wisest decisions while it is beingtested by our superconscious in dreams. Just like our own waking personalities,the subconscious is experiencing its own lessons and growth patterns, fears andinsecurities, strengths and weaknesses.Hypnotists proved that the subconscious could do very powerful things, includingcreating a blister if we believed we were being burned, even when the hypnotisthad only touched our skin with an ice cube. Jung also saw that thesuperconscious mind could somehow anticipate future events before they happen,and tip off your subconscious mind in dreams to send you a signal as a warningbefore these events occur. Thus, you might end up having a sudden pain or itch,a ringing in your ears, a pressure in your head or chest, or a sense of immenseimpending dread directly before heading into a genuinely dangerous situationthat you could not have otherwise foreseen consciously.This dream phenomenon is also the source of déjà vu. You may visit a certainlocation or meet a certain person in vivid dreams that you do not consciouslyremember afterward. However, once these events manifest in your physicalreality, your subconscious gets excited because it remembers what you saw. Somepart of this can bleed through into your conscious mind, creating a very strangefeeling of familiarity. After twenty-seven years of capturing, writing down, andanalyzing the majority of all my dreams every morning, I have had many hundredsof instances when I find myself in a situation I had precisely dreamed aboutbeforehand. This never becomes boring or commonplace. I am always very surprisedand excited when my waking world has an obvious crossover with what I hadalready dreamed. It has happened so many times that I could fill multiplevolumes of books just telling the various, fascinating stories.The subconscious also guides and directs us to experience synchronicity—strangeevents where our outside, worldly experiences correlate with our inner thoughtsin strange ways that defy our typical ideas of physics. Jung’s classic exampleof this was where he was discussing the Egyptian scarab beetle with a patient,only to have its Western counterpart fly in through the window and presentitself to them in a very obvious fashion. This suggested that some higher,cosmic intelligence had guided the beetle to fly into their room at just theright moment. Synchronicity became a very important part of my own awakening,enough so that my second published book was entitled The Synchronicity Key. Aswe head into the very strange events that started happening to me after I beganwriting down my dreams, and especially after I read the Law of One series in1996, you will hear of many other stunning examples.ARCHETYPESJung also felt that the superconscious mind had certain blueprints in it thateveryone has to go through in our own ways. He believed these were primordialpatterns that were written into the consciousness of the universe, and calledthem archetypes. The dictionary definition of archetype is “(in Jungianpsychology) a collectively inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought,image, etc., universally present in individual psyches.”4[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber6] Jung’s four main archetypes he identified withinus were the Shadow, the Anima, the Animus, and the Self.5[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber7] We will review these and other archetypes now,as I believe this is very useful information for everyone. Once you beginremembering and documenting your dreams, you will quickly start finding multipleinstances where these archetypes appear. These symbols will also appear in luciddreams, which presents the very interesting challenge of trying to decipher whatyou are seeing in real time.According to psychologist David Straker, the shadow “is, by its name, dark,shadowy, unknown and potentially troubling. It embodies chaos and wildness ofcharacter. The shadow thus tends not to obey rules, and in doing so it maydiscover new lands or plunge things into chaos and battle. It has a sense of theexotic and can be disturbingly fascinating. In myth, it appears as the wild man,spider-people, mysterious fighters and dark enemies. We may see the shadow inothers and, if we dare, know it in ourselves. Mostly, however, we deny it inourselves and project it onto others.”6 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber8] This isan important point. Most of us do not want to own the negative aspects ofourselves. This reluctance can force those negative aspects to appear asfrightening characters in our dreams, or even waking hallucinations undercertain circumstances. We can become obsessed with seeing the negativity andupsetting aspects of others, without ever consciously realizing how we areexaggerating these characteristics by being unable to identify and accept ourown shadow. Jung also believed that this part of ourselves can directly takeover our thoughts, actions, and behaviors when we become sufficiently triggered,such as in a temper tantrum. It can also occur in moments of extreme stress,confusion, or drug-induced states.Jung considered the anima to be the female aspect of the soul, and the animus tobe the corresponding male aspect. Jung’s description of these two archetypesseems closely related to what most psychologists would call the subconsciousmind. Jung therefore identifies our subconscious as having a separate male andfemale aspect. Together, we use the anima and animus to speak with what hecalled the collective unconscious, or the superconscious mind. The innatecharacteristics of each gender appear in a more sacred, advanced form in theanima and animus. Our creativity emanates from these aspects of ourselves, inJungian terms.Most of us have only brief and fleeting access to the anima and animus withinus. When we see someone who embodies these sacred male and female archetypes inphysical form, such as a great leader, artist, or musician, it is very commonfor us to feel a sense of awe and reverence for that person. In other cases, wemay project our shadow onto them, as many often do, and view them with greatdisgust, looking for any possible way to remove their apparent righteousness.Jung believed that the anima and animus archetypes appeared as superheroes andgods in mythology. Some of these mythologies may have been taken directly out ofpeople’s dreams. Men have a far more dominant animus, and their anima istypically shaped by the female members of their family. Jung believed that womenhave a dominant anima, but that their animus is more complex than that of menand can be shaped by a variety of characters and influences throughout theirlives.If you are lucky enough to find a romantic life partner who has an anima oranimus that is compatible with your own, you have what Jung called syzygy, the“Divine Couple.” He believed that such unions have great power, and appear in avariety of trinity models in different traditions—which Joseph Campbell referredto collectively as the father, the mother, and the androgynous son. The wordsyzygy also refers to a planetary alignment, indicating the power that Jung feltsuch a union could have. The more you can tap into the power of your dreams andthe guidance they provide, the more likely you are to be successfully steeredinto a blissful, meaningful, and productive coupling of this nature. It mightalso involve the very painful work of facing your deepest fears to disentangleyourself from someone who clearly does not have your highest and best interestsin mind. Although it took most of my adult life to “find the right one,” Ieventually got together with my wife, Elizabeth, when I was forty-three yearsold. I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to experience this level ofsynergy with another person.Perhaps best and most ironically of all, Jung saw the superconscious, collectiveunconscious, and/or “mother light” as simply the Self. The infinite awarenessthat most of us would call God or the Creator is the Self in Jungian terms. Theterm Higher Self is an easier way to avoid confusion when discussing thisconcept. Jung’s concept of the true Self provides much deeper insight into thecommon use of the term Self-Realization. Jung believed that mystics and yogiswho had achieved bliss, enlightenment, and the “nirvana” state had reunified thevarious archetypes within their beings to become embodiments of the true Self.The Law of One series and other philosophies suggest that this work takesmultiple lifetimes, and goes through a variety of stages. It is important toidentify the archetypes that are the most active within ourselves, and learn howto integrate them with our overall Higher Self. In the simplest terms, we wantto identify and heal our own shadow so we are not obsessed with looking for itin others, while also making sure that we do not allow others’ shadows toovertake us. We want to identify and heal our own anima and animus so we do notproject them onto others and worship them inappropriately, and instead developour own creative talents. We also want to make conscious contact with our HigherSelf so we can gain guidance and knowledge about what our soul has in mind forus, and begin following that path. If we begin practicing regular dreamanalysis, we will be receiving direct messages from our Higher Self that willgreatly assist us in each of these categories.Other archetypes Jung identified included the following list, again according topsychologist David Straker.7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber9] Bear in mind thatJung saw these characters as appearing in everyone’s dreams and having the samebasic symbolic meanings, regardless of where they might be in time and space.This list of definitions may help shed some light on various symbols that willappear in your dreams:FAMILY ARCHETYPES * The father: Stern, powerful, controlling * The mother: Feeding, nurturing, soothing * The child: Birth, beginnings, salvationSTORY ARCHETYPES * The hero: Rescuer, champion * The maiden: Purity, desire * The wise old man: Knowledge, guidance * The magician: Mysterious, powerful * The Earth mother: Nature * The witch or sorceress: Dangerous * The trickster: Deceiving, hiddenANIMAL ARCHETYPES * The faithful dog: Unquestioning loyalty * The enduring horse: Never giving up * The devious cat: Self-servingJung also studied the meanings of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and believedthey represented a highly advanced and all-encompassing summary of the differentpersonality archetypes that we all move through from lifetime to lifetime. Mostof us will identify with just a few of them, but ideally, we will experience andmaster each of these various archetypes.With all this in mind, scientists like Dr. LaBerge do not follow theconventional view of seeing dreams as “brain garbage” that sorts out usefulmemories from others that can easily be discarded. They see the subconscious asa separate and valid part of ourselves in its own right—having its ownexperiences, going through its own trials and nightmares, and influencing how wethink and behave in our waking minds, whether or not we fully remember what wehad dreamed. Dreams provide us with valuable lessons about who we are and whatwe are really doing here. Dreams are problem solvers, always looking to give usvaluable advice that could help us make more effective choices in our lives.After twenty-seven years of remembering and analyzing my dreams on a dailybasis, it never ceases to amaze me how I am almost always given insights abouteveryday issues that I might not otherwise have thought of.In the next chapter, I will present you with my own distilled knowledge of howto analyze and interpret your dreams after twenty-seven years of experience. Forme, every dream is a treasure chest of information from my Higher Self, and Ihave almost never met a dream that I cannot crack. The more you do it, theeasier it becomes to understand what you are getting—so let’s get started!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEDREAM ANALYSIS 101Most important, remember that the language that dreams use to teach us lessonsis symbolism. If you can remember a dream, you always want to begin by analyzingit through the language of metaphor and symbolism instead of taking the eventsthat occurred in it as a literal statement of fact. There is no hard-and-fast,absolute rule for what each person’s dream symbols may mean. You do not need toget worried about “being right” and looking up the meaning of various symbols ina book. Learning your own dream language is ultimately a self-evident processthat will occur as you meditate on the deeper meanings of what you are seeing.It is most important to explore these symbols within yourself, and determinewhat they mean to you. In some cases, it took me years to understand whatcertain recurring symbols in my dreams meant for me. Once I figured out whatthese symbols meant, it was as if I had a master key that now unlocked themysteries in many other dreams I had written down and documented over the years.Everyone has at least one or two powerful dreams that they can remember, fromsome point in their life. Those dreams can be analyzed for their symbolicmeanings to gain greater understanding of whatever you were being told at thattime in your life.EVERYTHING IS YOUThe single biggest key to understanding your dream language is to see thateverything in the dream—every landscape, every object, every character, andevery event—is a symbolic representation of some aspect of yourself, and ofwhatever you are going through at that time in your life. The entire dream is astory that is telling you something about yourself in a symbolic form. Due touniversal laws of free will explained in the Law of One series, dreams generallycannot be completely honest about what they are telling you. They have tocommunicate through the language of metaphor and symbolism. That way, you havethe free will to reject the message they are offering if you are not ready tohear it. As an example, if you are having a dream that is really about a familymember or a loved one, that person will almost always be symbolized by adifferent character in the dream. The character symbolizing your loved one willrepresent them in some way that you can decipher with logic and reason but isn’tnecessarily obvious at first. I have had countless occasions when dreams told mesomething immensely embarrassing or humiliating about myself or others I know,but I wasn’t able to decipher their meanings until I was ready enough to acceptthis unpleasant truth.What follows is a basic outline of the different symbols that I see in my owndream language, after twenty-seven years of study, and how I apply these symbolsto the dreams of others. To begin with, animals represent the more primitiveparts of yourself, ruled by strong emotions. You can study whether the animal ispeaceful or aggressive, predator or prey, its color, where in the world itappears, and other traditional understandings associated with it, for greaterinsights. Children usually represent your own “inner child,” the part of youthat was shaped by early influences and that you can still revert to at varioustimes, either positively or negatively. Female characters typically representthe more nurturing, caring, and compassionate parts of yourself, whereasmasculine characters represent those parts of you that go out into the world andtake action. You can obviously meditate on gender symbolism and take it muchfurther than these basic concepts.If you see a character from a distinct time in your past, it usually means thatwhatever struggles you are going through right now are intimately related to themost significant events that occurred in your time with that person. Let’s sayyou are going through hell with a very difficult boss who seems to bully youevery chance he gets. The discipline you experience from him triggers a sense ofdefiance in your personality. You deliberately avoid doing what you areasked—even though you know it is your job, and your defiance will cause you evenmore trouble. You end up making excuses for your behavior and feel that if youcan avoid responsibility, you have “won” against your boss, who you have nowprojected the archetype of your Shadow onto. In a case like this, you may have arecurring nightmare where you meet up with a similar bully you had to deal withback in high school.The dream will attempt to show you how you are creating the problems youexperience. In a case like the abusive boss, if your dreams are successful, youwill learn to forgive your boss for doing his job, which is to try to make surethat you are doing yours. And if your boss consistently abuses you beyond anylevel that is fair or justifiable, you will likely start getting dreamsencouraging you to face your fears and find another job. In my early years inthe working world with jobs just above minimum wage in their hourly rate, thisended up being a very common theme for me.Another symbol that is surprisingly common in my dreams, and seems to berelatively standard with whomever I talk to, is the bathroom. In physical terms,the bathroom is where we relieve ourselves of toxic material that is no longerneeded in the body. In dream symbolism, bathrooms almost always symbolize how weare processing and releasing our most toxic emotions. I have had countlessdreams in which I keep trying to use a toilet, only to have it move around onme. This almost always means that I am not adequately working through my owntoxic emotions. Similarly, I have had countless dreams where a bathroom isoverflowing or otherwise a gigantic mess in some way. This means that my toxicemotions are “backing up” and overflowing into everyday life. If you are gettingsymbols like this, it is very important to slow down, take some time to be byyourself, and review the things in your life that are upsetting you.Insomnia is almost always caused by our failure to process our emotions in anadequate fashion. All the great classic meditation teachings instruct us toavoid distraction as much as possible. Ideally, we focus on one thought at atime. We don’t have music or video running in the background. If we have musicon, we listen to the music. If we have a video on, we watch the video. If we arehaving a conversation, we stay present in the conversation, maintaining eyecontact, and not getting distracted by push notifications on our phones. If weare driving, we are actually paying attention to the road and not just lost inthe jumble of our own thoughts and the volume of the car stereo. If we keepourselves distracted throughout the day, we may very well be avoiding painfulissues. Then when we lie down at night, our minds are flooded with theseupsetting problems. In the worst cases, we have a very difficult time fallingasleep. In a case like this, a dream with an overflowing bathroom is a verynormal symbol to wake up with the next morning.UNIVERSAL SYMBOLSMy own experience has proven that certain symbols seem fairly universal indifferent people’s dreams. It was quite a revelation for me, after years ofdaily dream analysis, to discover that water almost always symbolizes emotions.In using the example of the abusive boss, you might have a recurring nightmarewhere your office is flooding. This is a clear sign that you are being floodedwith negative emotions about your boss. You may not even be consciously awarethat you are sabotaging yourself and refusing to do the simple things you areasked. Any time I am going through emotional sorrow and pain, I can expect tohave dreams of indoor flooding, rain, and getting caught up in rivers, powerfulocean currents, and the like. In the worst cases, I will be struggling withpotentially drowning. Sorrow is probably the most prevalent “negative emotion” Ihave dealt with in my life, so I have had many thousands of water and floodingmetaphors in my dreams over the years. Although some of these dreams may alsofeature bathrooms, I have countless hundreds of other dreams with flooding waterwhere no bathrooms appear.The other three natural elements besides water seem to appear equallyconsistently in everyone’s dreams, according to their deeper archetypalmeanings. Fire in dreams may refer to light, warmth, and inspiration. It canalso refer to paradoxes, mysteries, and conflicts that can ultimately have apurifying effect, much like how forest fires stimulate new growth. In my case,fire in dreams almost always means some sort of anger or rage, whether it issomething you are experiencing yourself or something that is being directed atyou. This was one of the last ones I discovered, as I tend to have extraordinarypatience and not react to upsetting events in my life with anger. I discoveredthe dream meaning of fire after I had ended up in an abusive relationship. Therewere literally dozens of cases where I would have a dream of fires or volcaniceruptions of some kind before I was about to get severely yelled at, either thatsame day or the day after. In fact, I eventually realized that my dreams werehelping me to prepare for the next episode before it happened so I would sufferless when it arrived. This was not a “self-fulfilling prophecy” either. I woulddo everything I could to be polite, patient, forgiving, and understanding, butthe conflicts still erupted.Wind can represent spirit, creativity, change, messages, and intellectualactivity, and a severe windstorm in a dream can mean you are having obsessivethoughts that are running out of control. If you are having consistent troublewith concentration or thinking clearly, you may have dreams where there is airpollution, a lack of breathable air, or a lack of necessary wind, such as for awindmill or a sailboat.The element that most would call Earth is not so easily categorized, since everydream will have some sort of landscape, either indoors or outdoors. Earth andnature scenes are usually invitations for you to get out of the rat race andfind a way to relax and reconnect with your roots. Going out into nature canrejuvenate us in many ways that are not currently appreciated in ourconventional science. If you have a nightmare that involves being buried insoil, or otherwise features negative experiences with Earth touching your skin,it very likely means that you have a desperate need to get grounded. You are notadequately taking care of the responsibilities in your life. The answer is tostep away from your stress, get yourself out of the situations that areirritating you, and take time to breathe, relax, meditate, and unwind.Another universal symbolic principle I discovered in dreams is the height ofsomething in the landscape. Any time you find yourself going down in a dream,such as a staircase, an elevator, a cave, a tunnel, or the lower floor in abuilding, it invariably means that you are dealing with the more primitive partsof yourself—the so-called lower chakras—where the strongest primal urges andemotional blockages can reside. Similarly, any movement you make above groundlevel in a dream is a sign that you have recently made choices that areelevating your overall spiritual level. A turn to the left can indicate that youare heading down a negative path, that is, the “left-handed path,” and a turn tothe right often indicates a positive shift. If the paths you have to take aremazelike, it usually indicates that your journey to work through these spirituallessons is going to be complex and difficult—involving multiple phases thatcould take days, weeks, or months. You then study whether you are going up ordown, left or right, and compare it with other symbols you see, to understandthe deeper message.Similarly, the speed with which you travel through the dream landscape indicateshow rapidly you are making spiritual growth. If you are just walking, that is anormal speed. If you are on a bicycle, you are making faster progress. If youfind yourself driving in a car, you are growing very quickly. If you findyourself in a bus or a train, this usually indicates that you are making rapidspiritual growth with a group of people. If you are flying in an airplane, thatis an even better metaphor, because now you are also going into the higheraltitude, thus rising in your spiritual vibration even more. The single bestthing that can happen to you in a dream like this is flying through the air likea superhero. If you have a flying dream of this sort, congratulations—you havejust earned your way into a quantum leap in the speed of your spiritualevolution.After years of study, I also concluded that extraterrestrial or angelic beingsshow up in everyone’s dreams, whether they realize it or not. This will usuallybe symbolized by characters who are of a different race than you are. The moredifferent-looking someone is from the way you look, the more likely they willrepresent beings from “the other side.” Angelic beings also often appear asauthority figures who may be in uniforms, such as police, fire, doctors, nurses,and so on. In the early years, I had many dreams of the band KISS in their fullmakeup and costumes, as we will see, and eventually realized they symbolizedpositive mystical beings in my own symbol set. Others may be triggered by thestrange makeup and loud music, and have KISS appear in a negative context, sincesymbols like this do depend upon the person. For me, any dreams involving musicare invariably referring to spirituality and my overall mission in this life toelevate consciousness.RECURRING DREAMSI remember being captivated by Dr. LaBerge’s description of a man who discoveredhe had arterial blockages around his heart, and who realized that his recurringdream about a tangle of clogged plumbing pipes was encouraging him to go get acheckup. The recurring dream may very well have saved his life. Any time a dreamkeeps repeating, this is a sign that you are consistently not seeing somethingthat you really need to be aware of in your life. I wouldn’t necessarily call itan emergency, but I would definitely encourage you to get serious about tryingto analyze, decipher, and understand the message this dream is trying to conveyto you. Every dream ultimately has an agenda to guide you into being a moreloving, patient, forgiving, and compassionate person, toward yourself and othersalike.Recurring nightmares are the most obvious and intrusive dreams we get, and theyoften involve some kind of menacing villain that is chasing after you. Dr.LaBerge said this villain invariably represents some shadow aspect of yourselfthat is self-destructive and that you are not facing. You can analyze thespecific details of the villain for further clues as to what he or sherepresents within yourself. There are countless examples of how this works.For instance, pick a damaging addiction like alcoholism, sexual infidelity,gambling, or abusing others. Then imagine some character who has a freakishlyexaggerated symbolic connection to the addiction. An alcohol villain may havemultiple empty bottles tied to his body that he drags along with him. Someoneengaging in infidelity might have a very perverse and upsetting sexual villainwho threatens to violate them. A gambler’s nightmare villain may be made out ofrotting money, playing cards, dice, or other symbols associated with the type ofgambling they engage in. If someone is verbally or physically abusing someone,perhaps from feeling so hurt and violated that they feel they have no otherchoice, they may have some demonic, terrifying creature that abuses them indreams. I have found that dreams almost always exaggerate the problems you arefacing, and will present them as far worse situations than they really are. Thisis intended to help catch your attention and get you thinking about the problemsin your own life with perhaps greater seriousness than you had consideredbefore.In my own case, I once had a nightmare while I was half-asleep on the floor ofmy friend Jude’s house. This occurred while we were working on an album togetherin the early fall of 1993, a year after I had gotten sober in the fall of 1992.I had lost weight, stopped wearing black clothes, and cut my heavy-metal hair,but in my dream I had an exaggerated, ogre-type villain with these samequalities who was chasing after me. I had a handgun tucked in the front of mypants, and I knew I could turn around and shoot him and bring an end to this.For some reason, I did not want to take this final step, and instead chose tojust keep running. At this moment, Jude spoke in his sleep and instantly woke meup. In a distressed-sounding voice, he said, “Shoot him. Just shoot him. Twobullets!”That was another one of the most profound moments in my early awakening. It wasvery hard to get back to sleep as my mind was reeling with the implications.Having read Dr. LaBerge’s books, I knew that the ogre-like villain must haverepresented some aspect of my personality from my marijuana-using years. As theysaid in the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, it is all too easy to become a “drydrunk,” where you still have all the same bad habits you had when you were anaddict, only you are not actually using your former substance of choice.At the time Jude had this bizarre shared-dream experience with me, I still had aparalyzing lack of self-confidence. I could not get up the courage to ask womenout on dates even if they displayed obvious interest in me. I was not exercisingvery much, and I had transferred my addictive fixation to UFO and paranormalresearch with an obsessive-compulsive fervor. Any time I spent exercising wastime when I could have been thinking and researching. The equivalent of shootingthe villain in this oddly shared dream would be turning and facing my ownweaknesses instead of running from them. Dr. LaBerge says that the best thingyou can do in a dream where a villain is chasing you is to turn around, face thevillain, tell them that you love them, and embrace them. If you actually dothis, nothing bad happens. Instead, the villain will typically transform intosomething far less threatening and hug you back. At this point, many peoplereport that everything transitions into blinding white light. These dreams canalso be interpreted symbolically. In the case of my ogre dream, the message wasfor me to slow down, stop running from my past, and learn from it instead: Getmyself in better shape, manage the responsibilities of life, and face my fear oftalking to women.The terrifying recurring nightmare is often the entry point for people to startpaying attention to their dreams, but Dr. LaBerge and other scholarsunilaterally agree that there is no such thing as a meaningless dream. Ourso-called Higher Self, or what Jung simply referred to as the Self, has adefinite agenda for us to become more loving and spiritual people.I also have had positive recurring symbols. One that kept coming in for me wasdrums, since I had minored in jazz drumming in college. In the initial yearsafter I graduated, I had many, many dreams where I was trying to play a drum kitand I couldn’t get it to work. I would try to set it up, but things keptdisappearing or moving around. For years I thought this was telling me I neededto play more music. It was a huge discovery to realize that the drums and allother musical instruments and symbols actually represented my spiritual work,such as with dreams and my advanced UFO research, and that I should focus onthis more in a healthy way.COLOR SYMBOLISMOnce I read the Law of One series, I gained what I felt to be a much deeperinsight into the true meanings of colors in dreams. In the Law of One system, itis revealed the universe ultimately has seven main dimensions, or “densities.”The proper technical explanation of how this works is outside the scope of thischapter, but suffice it to say that in the Law of One system, there are seven“rays” of light that radiate throughout the universe and permeate all of space,time, matter, and energy. These rays create and uphold what we would think of asseven main dimensions. They also correspond to the seven colors of the rainbow:red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.The Law of One series reveals that we have bodies that actively exist withineach of these densities, completely outside linear time. This is much morecomplex than most people’s basic idea of having a mind, body, and spirit. Eachof the seven densities are anchored in our bodies with an energy center. This iswhat Hindu mystics called the chakras. In Law of One terms, the energy centerscould be visualized as roughly spherical balls of light that appear in regularintervals as well as move up the spine. Red is at the base of the spine. Orangeis in the navel. Yellow is in the solar plexus. Green is in the heart. Lightblue is in the throat. Indigo is between the eyebrows, in the “third eye” area.Violet is above the head, and is also called the crown chakra. Anotherinteresting detail is that in the Law of One series, the higher chakras appearto extraterrestrial beings as if they were crystals. The more advanced webecome, the more “crystallized” these energy centers will appear from thespiritual perspective.Although I could pull from very technical and elaborate Law of One quotes on theseven densities and their properties, for now I will keep it simple. I havefound these symbolic interpretations of colors to be remarkably consistent anduseful across many hundreds of my own dreams, as well as my analyses of thedreams of others. Whenever I am analyzing a dream, this is how I interpret eachof the colors:RED: Safety, sexuality, and security. Primal forces in the body and mind. Thedesire to protect oneself, to survive, to have food and shelter, and toprocreate.ORANGE: The self. How you see yourself. Depending upon the placement of thiscolor in your symbols, this could indicate a positive, such as healthyself-esteem, or a negative, with a self-esteem being greatly challenged. Sexualissues can also easily appear in the orange color, since sex is extremelypersonal.YELLOW: The other. How you see others. Positive instances of yellow can indicatethat you are being loving, supportive, patient, and friendly to others. Negativeinstances of yellow may reveal that you are being manipulative and controllingtoward others. Sexuality can also appear in this color, such as if you are beingdominated by others or have your own desire to manipulate people. Any type ofsocial problems you are going through in life are apt to appear in your dreamswith some sort of yellow color symbolism attached to them.GREEN: Love. This can represent love for yourself or the struggle you are goingthrough to reach self-acceptance. This also can represent the love you have forothers, as well as the love you are receiving from others. Generally speaking,green and the “higher” colors that follow are a good sign. Any dream where youare outdoors will typically feature green grass, trees, and the like. Thisindicates that you are working through the lessons of love.LIGHT BLUE: Light. In this case, light refers to a variety of concepts,including wisdom, communication, honor, responsibility, and duty. The throat isobviously the part of us that speaks, and the Law of One indicates that thethroat chakra is light blue in its spiritual “true color.” When you see lightblue in a dream, it can indicate that you are building knowledge and wisdomthrough dedicated study. It can represent a call to action, telling you there issomething you need to communicate and have not yet done so. Light blue may alsoindicate that there is something you have elected to do, and once you make thatchoice, you have a duty to fulfill that promise. You also ideally see thisresponsibility as an honor that you are happy to carry out. Hence, the Law ofOne series typically merges those two words together as “honor/duty.” This levelis where many of the ancient sacred warrior codes have originated in variouslineages.INDIGO: Love/light. At this level, the spiritual feminine path of love and thespiritual masculine path of light are merged into a greater whole. Self andother are seen as one. This is a very good color to see in your dreams and isalmost always a positive. It means that you are activating your ESP,experiencing synchronicities, starting to remember your dreams, and gaining trueintuitive insights. To embody this level in your conscious, everyday awareness,the Law of One series says you have to make a conscious commitment to dedicateyour life to serving others and their spiritual needs. This is admittedly noteasy in today’s world, but there are many different ways to do it. If you areconsistently kind and loving to others in your seemingly regular job, that caneasily become a dedicated spiritual practice.VIOLET: Timelessness and foreverness. The Law of One calls this the “gatewaydensity.” It is the last stage of evolution we go through before we merge backinto the “pure white light” of what they call “intelligent infinity.” At thislevel, there is no self and there is no other. There is only timelessness andforeverness. Seeing violet in a dream is an excellent sign. It indicates you aregetting into the deepest levels of meditation, awakening, and self-reflection.We will have much more to say about this level in a later chapter. This colordoesn’t show up very often in dreams, but if it does, rest assured that you areon a positive spiritual path.PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF DREAM SYMBOLISMWith the information in this chapter, you now have a solid basis upon which youcan begin analyzing your dreams successfully. If you wake up and can stillremember your dream, write down everything that happened to you, even if youdon’t think it is important. Note the characters, who they are and what they arewearing, including the colors. Always indicate whether you are indoors oroutdoors, and describe the objects around you. Pay attention to who these peoplewere in your life when you knew them. After you are done writing everything up,think about what these people might symbolize for you now. Always check for anyof the four elements, and at the end, see how these elements may be giving you amessage. Notice whether you are going up or down, left or right, and howdifficult it is to navigate through a particular area. Remember that every twistand turn of the story, everything you go through and everything you talk about,is a symbol of something you are going through right now.Furthermore, the most important protocol that will help you recall your dreamsis to not move when you wake up. Remain still, and think about “Where was I? Whowas I talking to? What was I doing? What was happening?” rather than askingyourself, “What was I dreaming?” The dreams seem real while they are happening,so you will remember them as if they were real events.It is a marvelous spiritual exercise to begin remembering your dreams, for thisincreases your ability to tap into alternate realms of consciousness and getextremely precise messages from your Higher Self. I originally wrote everythingin notebooks, but I now always use a laptop computer. I keep a word-processingfile open and put the laptop in suspend mode before going to sleep. Each nightbefore bed, I write the following day of the week, the date, and then a dash.That way, when I get up, all I have to do is hit the space bar and write thetime. The day of the week is important to add for context, since you will beexperiencing different life situations on workdays than on weekends. Thesedifferent situations will directly affect what types of dreams you might have.On the next line, I write my first initial and a colon, and report on any straythoughts I have after I wake up. This is a valuable technique to clear yourconscious mind so it feels heard and can then get out of the way. Similartechniques exist in the remote-viewing training programs. Then, as I write downthe dream, I do it with bullet points. I try not to make each bullet pointlonger than any one line of text. This keeps everything looking neat and makesit much easier to organize and move around. If I have a particular character whoappears in a dream, I might have three to five different bullet points where Idocument different specific things about the way he or she looked, spoke, and soon.You may not remember the dream in the original order that things happened. Byusing bullet points, you can grab an entire area of text and easily move it toanother area once you remember when it happened. By far, one of the most amazingthings about dream recall is when you start remembering new details from thedream while you are writing up other details that you already remember. Beforetoo long, you can find yourself bringing back vividly long and detailedaccounts, with multiple sections. You will then often find that your dream willrepeat the same or similar messages over the course of the dream, usingdifferent symbols to do so. It appears that your Higher Self will do this onpurpose in case you do not remember the entire dream. That way, even if youremember only the last portion of it, you will still get the basic message thatthe dream is trying to communicate. Dr. LaBerge also encourages you to rememberas many specific details as possible, even if you don’t think they areimportant. You will remember them as you write the dream down, but later on,they may disappear—so just document everything.Another key technique is to make sure you don’t move or get out of bed until youhave three distinct and separate memories of dream events. I try to take each ofthose memories and turn them into phrases that have no more than three or fourwords each. Then I repeat the phrases verbally in my mind as I continue tryingto remember other details. As a hypothetical example, I might not let myself getout of bed until I have something like “Red barn. Dove in a tree. Muddy stream.”Then, the first thing I do when I get over to the laptop is to write thosefragments down. Otherwise, I may remember the red barn and the dove in the tree,and explore them in more detail once I start writing, but I may forget the muddystream.It is also important to be patient with yourself and not expect perfection.There are still a few days a month when I wake up and forget everything,particularly if I am under stress. I don’t get too upset about that, and I justwrite down No dictation for that particular day. Once you start capturing dreamsregularly and deciphering your dream language, you will find them to be anincredible storehouse of wisdom and knowledge. I have never found any otherspiritual practice that produces so much valuable information. Think about whatit would be like to live your life, day after day, knowing exactly what yourHigher Self thinks is the most important thing for you to be focusing on at thetime.Best of all, you can also “incubate” a dream. Before you go to bed, you canspend several minutes concentrating on a particular problem or question withstrong intensity. Ask your Higher Self to give you a dream about this issue thatwill contain the answer. In many cases, I discover that my Higher Self alreadyanticipated that I would do this, and my dreams from previous mornings alreadyhad the answer. Then the next dream that appeared after I asked the questiononly helped to further refine the details.We all come up against strong programming from the modern world that tells ussuch behavior is a waste of our time, and that dreams do not matter. In the nextchapter, we will address this situation and take a look at how my own“conditioning” started to be informed by greater truths."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURA SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEWToday, most of us are not remembering and recording our dreams, and even fewerof us have any idea of what our dreams might actually mean. In other eras, inour various past civilizations, however, this was not the case. Our present-daysociety is surprisingly materialistic, focusing only on what we encounter withour five senses in our waking life. Therefore, when I encourage you to writedown and remember your dreams every morning, I admittedly have quite thechallenge. We have all been conditioned into accepting and believing a highlymaterialistic viewpoint. Dreams may not appear to be worth your time, if youadhere to the sophism that “time is money.” Nonetheless, if you put this dreamwork into practice, you may be very surprised at how quickly you will begin toreap the benefits. The first time you realize that one of your dreams hasaccurately predicted the future is a very exciting moment, though you may needseveral more examples before you can really allow yourself to believe it. Allyour life, you have been taught that prophecy and psychic phenomena is “NotScientific,” and that if you dare to believe that an accurate prophecy hasactually occurred, you are suffering from delusions.Our educational system teaches us that our value, ultimately to society as awhole, is determined by the truthfulness of the information we possess. We aregiven “accepted” books to read, political ideologies to embrace, flags to pledgeour allegiance to, and scientific models to live by as if they were universallaws. We sit down with a pencil and paper and are given tests, which are gradedbased upon the accuracy with which we can repeat the information our authorityfigures told us was true. If we deviate from these social norms and do notaccurately remember at least 65 percent of what we are taught to believe, we aregiven an F, which stands for “Fail”—and implies that we are also a failure inlife. We are said to have scored a “poor” grade. The word poor also refers tosomeone who has no money, and without money, you will likely have a verydifficult life. Worst of all, if you actually fail a grade, you risk losing yourfriends—the following year, you have to start over with a class of entirely newand younger people, while everyone else carries on without you. This can programus through fear and trauma to believe that we must accept the words and thoughtsof “the authorities” as if they were absolute facts. If we do so, we will berewarded with wealth, power, status, and friends. If we do not accept andregurgitate the information that is fed to us, we are social outcasts who willlive in poverty.This causes most people to get defensive about the status quo—and it can bequite surprising and distressing to see the degree of savagery, aggression, andhatred people can have when someone presents a viewpoint that is alternative toour existing models and beliefs. I have had plenty of opportunities to explorethis in responses to my articles and videos, and I have had to accept a certainamount of pathological hatred as a basic and unavoidable aspect of doing mywork.Even within our educational system, however, we are told of many timesthroughout history that those who discovered innovative truths were punished forsharing their knowledge. Nicolaus Copernicus aroused great controversy in the1500s for theorizing that the Earth revolved around the sun, instead of the sunflying around a fixed Earth as it appeared to be doing in the sky. GalileoGalilei was attacked by the papacy, which was the dominant political power ofhis day, for following up on the work of Copernicus. The priests literallyrefused to look through Galileo’s telescope. Galileo was found guilty of“vehement . . . heresy” by the Inquisition and spent the rest of his life underhouse arrest. Nonetheless, most of Galileo’s conclusions were found to be true,and he is now considered to be the father of modern science. Isaac Newton wasridiculed for his theory of gravity. Benjamin Franklin was ridiculed for histheory of electricity. Albert Einstein was ridiculed for the Theory ofRelativity. The Wright brothers were vilified by the American scientificestablishment for discovering powered flight. They were taken seriously onlyafter shipping a working airplane to France and flying it before a crowd ofesteemed authorities. It took the Wright brothers four years for the generalpublic to accept that their initial breakthrough at Kitty Hawk actuallyhappened.From a young age, I realized that science is still evolving. What we think weknow to be true could easily change as new information comes along. Upon thedirect request of the old man, I began reading as many books on science as Icould find—and conducted a variety of experiments at home that they suggested.This included things like soaking a chicken bone in vinegar for a couple daysand then being able to tie it into a knot, or using a battery and a saltwatersolution to electroplate copper atoms from a penny onto a nickel coin. I feltthat we still had tremendous scientific breakthroughs ahead. If the UFOs that Isaw on television and in various movies were in fact real, then there were stillvery significant scientific breakthroughs yet to be discovered. Once again, itappeared that we were suffering the arrogance of know-it-all syndrome. Webelieved we had all the answers, and that our current scientific knowledge wasthe pinnacle of our achievement as a species. We also had obvious politicalpowers that were enforcing certain beliefs and opinions in order to maintaincontrol. When we consider all of these factors and how they actively impact ourlives, it is obviously wise for us to keep an open mind.THE LONG ISLAND PHILOSOPHY CLASSIn the second semester of my sophomore year of college, as my sobrietystabilized, I got my first insider NASA disclosure, and I started doing UFOresearch. I took a class in philosophy that proved to be highly frustrating, butalso extremely revealing. The professor was attempting to teach us a history ofvarious philosophies. The word philosophy itself, which comes from ancient Greekroots, translates as “the love of wisdom.” Some philosophers were attracted tothe strange question of whether or not we really exist. This branch ofphilosophy is known as existentialism, and this same word was in the title ofthe class itself.René Descartes was often felt to have won the battle over the question ofwhether we exist with his simple phrase, “I think, therefore I am.” Descartesalso had a profound effect on science, with notions that came to be known as theCartesian Doctrine, or materialism. The basic idea is that the universe is madeof atoms—small, hard particles—and if we can’t physically see and measuresomething, then it doesn’t exist. All questions of dreams, visions,spirituality, higher consciousness, life after death, and so forth were handedover to the church. Science remained rigorously focused on the absolute validityof the material world—and nothing else. This agreement was made over fourhundred years ago and it is still obviously in effect today, at least to a largedegree.Many philosophers, however, continued to doubt the basic concept of existence.Some believed that the only thing we can know for certain is that we are havingcertain perceptions. We appear to be seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, andtasting the world around us. We appear to be talking to other people who areseparate from us. We appear to be human beings, in human bodies, walking aroundon a planet that orbits a star within what we now know to be one of billions ofgalaxies. Yet, just as we see in a lucid dream, we cannot absolutely prove thatany of this is real. All we can prove is that we are having an experience thatwe normally accept as being real, through what appear to be our five senses. Yetin a greater sense, we could in fact be living in a great illusion—a dream. Itis even possible that our true identity as a conscious and aware being isactually that of the dreamer who is dreaming this entire universe intoexistence, moment by moment.These were very lofty “Ageless Wisdom” concepts that were not unknown to anyonewho has had psychedelic experiences. I was intrigued by the idea that awarenessitself might somehow be more “real” than the material world we perceive aroundus with that awareness. There may be some truth in this idea, since this conceptdoes seem to consistently arise in deep meditation, contemplation, and othermystical states.Within this philosophy class was a highly argumentative and confrontationalstudent with a distinctly Long Island accent. She had bleached-blond hair andwas obviously a severe binge drinker; I had seen her at a variety of collegeparties in the past. In my notebook, I called her Long Island, and used “LI” forshort to document her side of the arguments she always had with the professor. Iam not sure I ever caught her first name.Every class quickly descended into a “fight to the death” between LI and ourprofessor. She would listen to one small part of what he was saying and thenignore the rest while she was thinking up her next attack. She would confrontthe professor with highly materialistic thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions,often with simplicity and down-home sarcastic humor. She might say somethinglike “If I am going to drink a beer, I just grab it. I’m not sitting therewondering about whether that beer really exists or not.” The professor wouldattempt to address her statements and explain the course curriculum further,only to have her again capture one small part of what he said and confront himwith it, ignoring the rest. In any one class, she might confront the professortwenty or more times. The perpetual arguing within this class became almostunbearable to sit through and was one of my first prolonged experiences with apsychopathic personality structure. No one in the class liked what washappening, but for the most part, she was able to keep doing it without anyinterruption. Some people would try to participate and steer the discussion inthe way the professor intended to teach us, but invariably, LI would drag usright back down into the mud pit.At some point our exhausted professor finally admitted that if we could notagree, as a class, on some very basic foundations, and if we did not have awillingness to listen for periods of time without interrupting, it would be verydifficult for us to learn anything . . . if not nearly impossible. He wasclearly talking about LI, who participated vastly more often than anyone else.Like others in the class, I had become so upset with her by this point that Icouldn’t even stand to look her in the eye. I always wondered if there might bea certain point where I would finally snap and confront her in class, as othershad already done. She didn’t even seem to care if this happened. She greatlyenjoyed arguing with anyone and everyone, and made sure she dominated the entireclass. There were a few precious days where her partying issues caused her notto show up, and we were able to go deeper. Our professor thought he was going tobe teaching us about the history of philosophy, but he eventually admitted thatour class had a very different lesson for us.A PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTIn philosophy, the word argument is used to describe a conversation between twophilosophers in which they discuss whether certain new ideas might actually betrue or not. Many things that we now take for granted, such as the idea ofmatter being made of tiny, individual atoms, began as philosophical discussionswith scholars like Leucippus and Democritus in the fifth century BC. Much ofmodern mathematics originated in philosophy, such as the works of Pythagoras.Many of our understandings of astronomy, biology, and physics originated withphilosophy. We also can credit philosophy with clarifying our understandings ofvirtue and ethics, and therefore it had critical importance in the developmentof written law and politics. Warfare, weapons technology, and battle plans oftendeveloped out of philosophical arguments as well. Philosophers also tackledspiritual concepts, including many scholars in the early formative years ofChristianity. In the present day, there are a variety of ongoing philosophicaldiscussions in our society, such as the role of artificial intelligence and thepossible existence of extraterrestrials. Philosophy is a valuable part of how wechart out our future. It is no accident that PhD stands for “Doctor ofPhilosophy.”Our professor told us that the single most important “rule” in philosophy isthat to have an argument, certain basic fundamental principles must be agreedupon as facts. These ideas may eventually be disproven, but for the purposes ofa philosophical argument, both parties agree to accept that these principles aretrue. That way, they are not arguing over their most basic assumptions. Ourprofessor stressed this point repeatedly throughout our entire class, almostevery time we met. Once you can agree on certain basic points, your argumentthen goes forward with the basic tools of logic and reason. Otherwise, you maywell be witnessing a narcissistic person bullying someone they don’t agree with,and satisfying their egoic needs for dominance and control in the process.As a very simple example of how the philosophical argument works, let’s takeRené Descartes’s classic line, “I think, therefore I am.” To have aphilosophical argument about the idea that having thoughts proves that we exist,both parties would need to agree that thinking is real. This might seemridiculous, but believe it or not, some people have dedicated their entire livesto exploring concepts like this. Theoretically, you would have to think in orderto have a thought, but some would-be philosophers enjoy questioningeverything . . . including the most basic assumptions we need to work with inorder to function as human beings.So let’s explore this a bit further. You, as a person, appear to be having anexperience that we call thinking, where various distinct concepts come and gothat we call thoughts. However, some might believe that our thoughts are not ourown, that we have no free will, that our thoughts might not be created by us atall, and that what we consider to be our own thoughts might actually be amanifestation of some outside force manipulating us.This is just a hypothetical example that I do not believe to be true. I doaccept that we think our own thoughts, and that we have the free will to do so.Yet you can see certain modern philosophers speculating that we might all be theproduct of a vast artificial intelligence, like in the movie The Matrix, andthat the nature of our true existence is completely hidden from us. In thatcase, the source, meaning, and destination of our thoughts, and of who and whatwe are as seemingly conscious beings, may be something we are completely unawareof.If one of the philosophers in an argument refused to accept that such a thing as“thinking” was actually happening, then they would have no fundamental agreementfor their argument to work off of. René Descartes considered it to be a factthat we think. To have an argument about the greater point Descartes was makingabout the nature of the universe, other philosophers would have to agree that wedo think thoughts. In this example, if the philosophers cannot agree thatthinking is real, then they could never progress to the second half of thediscussion, which is whether or not our basic existence, the part of us thatlets us say “I am” with confidence, is actually real: “I think, therefore I am.”If you continue to argue over whether or not thinking is real, that’s where theentire argument begins and ends. You never can make it past the word therefore.You are constantly fighting over whether “I think” is even true, and the deeperquestion of what it means to say “I am” is never even able to be asked.LI had completely shattered any and all hope of having a philosophicaldiscussion. In every single class, she would attack the fundamentals, and sheand the professor were constantly arguing over the same things. These conceptswere the building blocks that we needed to have in place before we could haveany greater discussion. Without those foundation stones, nothing ever got done.It was one class after another after another of infuriatingly repetitivefighting. No matter where the professor tried to take us as a class, LI keptcircling back to the idea that most of the ideas he was teaching us werefundamentally stupid. She would ridicule the professor, make jokes, and act asif he was wasting our time for trying to get us to think about such unusualthings. She was completely incapable of accepting certain basic ideas, even longenough for us to have a discussion about what it might mean for us to be aliveand aware as conscious beings in a universe of galaxies.THE ORIGINAL BRIEFINGIn the same semester when I went through this very difficult philosophy class, Iwas fortunate enough to receive a private briefing about the nature of the UFOphenomenon from a college friend of mine. This, again, was in my sophomore year,sometime approximately in February 1993. My friend’s physics professor was thehead of the department and had worked for NASA throughout the 1970s, in the“higher echelons.” This professor blithely disclosed, to his entire physicsclass, that the Roswell crash really happened and was indeed an extraterrestrialspacecraft. Had LI been in this class, it was very unlikely that he would havebeen able to say much without being interrupted. The professor said that thepeople behind NASA didn’t mind if we learned about this information throughmeans such as a college classroom. NASA just didn’t want it to be the topheadline in the New York Times. He cited the example of the public panic fromthe War of the Worlds radio broadcast from October 30, 1938, when people thoughtwe were suffering an alien invasion, to explain why we were not ready as aspecies for this information. Strangely, the professor also told his class thatif anyone ever asked him about this again, he would deny ever having saidanything. This caused a visible shock wave to ripple through the entire class.Clearly, he was very afraid . . . about something.My friend was brave enough to meet the professor directly after class andinterrogate him for two more hours about exactly what he knew. The professorshared far more detail with my friend than he had with the class. My friend thenrevealed every single part of that conversation to me, at great length, andanswered a wide variety of questions I had, to the best of his ability. Theprofessor was told that the Roswell crash and several other similar crashes hadoccurred. Beings had been found in these crashes, most of them dead but some ofthem alive. Considering that I had been having UFO-related dreams ever since Icould remember at age two, I was extremely fascinated to discover that there wasapparently a great deal of truth surrounding the phenomenon. I already hadstarted to notice that my dreams could predict the future and provide accuratespiritual guidance, so this NASA disclosure was extremely fascinating.The professor told my friend about three types of beings that were found withinthese craft. There were taller “Grays,” with skinny, whitish bodies, long limbs,and unusually large heads with large black eyes. There were shorter “Grays,” andthe professor said their heads were actually helmets. Underneath the helmet wasa “monstrosity,” some kind of frightening-looking humanoid face, but theprofessor never revealed exactly what it looked like. Last, the professor hadheard about beings that looked almost exactly like us—human—but they had subtledifferences. This could include deep blue or purple irises, diamond-shapedpupils, odd skin colors, and unusual catlike ridges on the roof of the mouth.A CELESTIAL ENDOWMENTI found out that technological marvels like lasers, LED lights, infrared nightvision, fiber-optic cables, solid-state transistors, computer chips, Teflon, andVelcro had all been found initially on various crashed ships from elsewhere. Thematerials were then reverse-engineered, often by being sent to corporations as“foreign technology” to be studied and duplicated. I was absolutely stunned whenColonel Philip Corso came forward as a whistleblower in 1997, saying exactly thesame things in his groundbreaking book The Day after Roswell, coauthored withWilliam Birnes.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber10] At this time, I had spokenabout our professor’s insider testimony only in obscure posts on Richard C.Hoagland’s discussion forum on his website, enterprisemission.com. It was veryunlikely, if not nearly impossible, that Corso’s recollections could have beenborrowed from my own written accounts—particularly because he also had far morespecific details than I had ever gotten. This is the type of argument thatskeptics might defend with everything they have. On some basic level, they areunwilling or unable to honestly examine the wealth of interconnecting evidencethat exists.Corso and the professor both revealed that our technological revolution wasinextricably connected with this “celestial endowment.” Without it, we mightstill be using vacuum-tube computers that fill entire basketball courts. Theprofessor also said we had gotten other technologies, like antigravity and freeenergy, which were still highly classified—but were very much being used “on theinside.” With those technologies, it was entirely possible, if not likely, thatwe had already developed bases on the moon, Mars, and other planets andsatellites in our solar system and potentially beyond. I had absolutely noreason to doubt what my friend was telling me. The professor was the head of thedepartment and an established authority. No one else in the class was braveenough to ask him any further questions about what he had said, but my friendwas the star pupil of the class. I never dared to approach the professor myself,owing to his promise to deny ever having said a word about it.A GATHERING OF TROLLSThough my philosophy class was almost mind-shatteringly frustrating, it provedto be of extreme importance in understanding how to proceed in the career Iwould eventually create for myself beginning in 1996. That was the year I beganparticipating in Richard C. Hoagland’s online discussion forum, after havingread over three hundred books on UFOs, ancient civilizations, and theparanormal. The year 1996 was well before the term troll became widely used tomean a person who creates trouble for others in an online discussion, but trollswere extremely active in Hoagland’s forum. It was nearly impossible to have ameaningful discussion about the UFO phenomenon, because certain individualscould never agree upon whether or not UFOs actually exist. The trolls wouldmercilessly attack every single piece of interesting data that came along. Theywould look for flaws, try to point out minor inconsistencies, and then attemptto “win the argument” and conclude that the entire discussion was a completewaste of time. Every discussion was staged to steer the reader back to theirpreexisting beliefs, which they defended with all the fervor of religiouszealots. They never even considered the possibility that they might be wrong.Like the actions of LI in my philosophy class, this trolling was done withsnark, sarcasm, and an obvious delight in causing misery to others.Even to this day, many UFO researchers are still trapped in this basic problemof attempting to determine whether or not UFOs and intelligent extraterrestrialsreally do exist. They may analyze reports of sightings, photographs or films ofalleged craft, landing-trace markings, cattle mutilations, abduction and contactstories, government and military insider testimonies, crop circles, or therecords and remains of ancient civilizations. However, at the end of a publiclecture, radio show, article, or book, the whole subject is usually still leftopen-ended, with a huge question mark hanging over it. Even if extraterrestrialsare acknowledged to exist, the philosophical questions of who they are, wherethey came from, and what they want with us are almost never addressed. Thespiritual aspects of the phenomenon are usually almost completely ignored, asare the deeper implications of the reality of the UFO presence. As a result, anygreater philosophical discussion about the nature of space, time, matter,energy, consciousness, and existence itself is greatly reduced, if noteliminated entirely.FOUR MAIN TOOLS FOR A PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT ON UFOSFrom a strictly logical perspective, there are four main tools available to helpdeepen our philosophical understanding of the extraterrestrial presence, once weagree they exist for the purposes of a scholarly argument. First, we have thewritten reports of ancient dreams, contacts, and communications, many of whichare dismissed as mythologies or get codified into religions. Second, we havespectacular architecture all over the planet made out of gigantic, multitonstone blocks that cannot be duplicated with today’s technology. Third, we havethe phenomenon of “close encounters” with UFOs, which can include sightings,photographs, films, radar tracings, alleged wreckage, possibly extraterrestrialbodies or skeletons, and apparent contact with extraterrestrials, the memoriesof which often will only become available through hypnosis. Fourth, we havemodern-day alleged communications with extraterrestrials, most of which aretelepathic in nature and which often arise out of contactee reports. Last, wehave insider testimonies of individuals who claim to have interacted directlywith these beings in highly classified military projects.Once I began studying the UFO subject in 1993, I did my best to assess thevalidity of claims in each of these categories. As a general rule, if the samepoint shows up in three completely unrelated sources that are unaware of eachother, I am more likely to consider that the information might be true. In somecases, multiple insiders have shared almost identical pieces of information withme that are highly specific, without ever having had contact with one another.In each of these cases, I had never published or spoken of this informationonline in any form. As I will discuss a little later on, the Law of One serieshad an astonishing number of connections to the insider testimony and scientificdata I was gathering. It also anticipated many otherwise unexpected andmysterious scientific breakthroughs by two or more decades.A PERSONAL CONNECTIONAs I continued to meditate on the awesome implications of my NASA disclosure in1993, I did have the distinct feeling that I had earned this information, in thekarmic sense, through the very hard work I had done on self-improvement. I hadlistened to what the old man told me. I was starting to wonder if his friends onthe ships that picked me up in my high school lucid dreams were actually realpeople and not just constructs of my subconscious mind.The torture of my philosophy class with LI seemed to be encouraging me to startmy own philosophical argument about UFOs. I rejected her irrationally skepticalattitude and stopped arguing with myself over the fundamental question ofwhether or not UFOs and extraterrestrials actually existed. I was able to acceptthat my friend was telling the truth, and that the professor was reportingaccurately on the information he had seen and heard during his time at NASA. Iwould still search incessantly for proof, but this was coming from a perspectiveof accepting that such proof was likely to exist. Years later, I looked up theprofessor’s name online and confirmed that he had worked at a NASA facilitythroughout most of the 1970s. Out of respect for his surviving family, I havenot shared his name. There are plenty of other insiders who have indeed chosento come forward and go on public record with their accounts, such as ColonelPhilip Corso. Almost everything Corso disclosed was included in the things theprofessor had already revealed to my friend four years earlier.Once I had established the basic, fundamental understanding that UFOs andextraterrestrials did indeed exist, I focused on gathering as much material aspossible. I would assess its overall credibility, and then work to build aunified model to integrate what we know. Before too long, I again startedreading books that talked about unusual feats of consciousness, such astelepathy. Some of these books were linking ESP with the idea ofextraterrestrials. Certain people, such as Edgar Cayce, seemed to be incommunication with an advanced extraterrestrial or higher-dimensionconsciousness. Edgar Cayce was a name that popped up quite often in the books Iwas reading—and for good reason.THE EDGAR CAYCE ENIGMAThe mystery, awe, and power of what was achieved in the Edgar Cayce Readingsfrom the early 1900s until Cayce’s death in 1945 seems to be a forgotten memory.These types of psychic results now appear to be an impossible dream that isimmediately dismissed by skeptics who have a misplaced sense of confidence.Cayce was a walking paradox—a seemingly ordinary Kentucky tobacco farmer andchild laborer with limited education who somehow gained access to omniscientintelligence. There are fourteen thousand documented examples of Edgar Cayceperforming a “psychic reading,” as his source called it. While under hypnosis,some part of Cayce would travel to a remote location where his client waslocated, accurately diagnose their medical problem, and prescribe unique andeffective treatments. The only information he was given beforehand was theperson’s name and address, and an agreement that they would be present at thataddress during the scheduled time of the session. Since I had experienced my ownout-of-body experiences, lucid dreams, and strange UFO-type contacts, I did nothave a problem accepting what I was reading.Cayce was completely asleep while he was doing this work. While under hypnosis,some greater part of his consciousness began speaking, and it usually spoke as“we” instead of “I.” This was all recorded by Cayce’s stenographer; Cayce had nomemory of what he had said when he woke up. The words were difficult to read,including some written in a strange language, and with long run-on sentencesthat often extended into paragraphs. Yet the accuracy that his readingsdisplayed was astonishing, including many documented future prophecies thatproved to be correct. Once you have surveyed some of the more than six hundredbooks that have been written on Cayce’s work, the simplest explanation is theobvious one. It appeared that some nonphysical part of Edgar Cayce was visitingclients in their homes, in a process similar to what is now performed undercontrolled laboratory conditions with military remote viewing. Once there, Caycecould view inside their body, analyze its difficulties, and prescribetreatments—with an encyclopedic knowledge of medical terms, diagnoses, andobscure remedies that nonetheless really worked.Here is a brief excerpt from my previous book, The Synchronicity Key, about someof the more fascinating aspects of the Cayce story:> Warner Books published The Edgar Cayce Reader in 1967, twenty-two years after> Cayce’s death.2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11] In the introduction, it is> noted that the ten books written about Cayce up to that time had “totaled more> than a million in sales.” In 1998, fifty-three years after the death of Cayce,> Paul K.

Yet most of them actually have had paranormalexperiences, upon questioning, but they discount the validity of their own fivesenses in these cases. I myself admittedly needed to have many, many differentrepetitions of certain experiences, such as accurate prophecies of futureevents, before I was truly able to take in the greater model of the universethat I was being presented with. Again, it is my hope that you will be inspiredto pay attention to your dreams as a result of reading this book, as this opensthe door to a wealth of seemingly impossible miracles.EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTSOnce I accepted the reality of the UFO phenomenon as a starting point for aphilosophical argument, I eventually started exploring a variety of alternativescientific concepts. If UFOs exist, that means someone, somewhere, has perfectedthe ability to control gravity. They also would need to have discovered a sourceof energy that is vastly superior to our own, and would be nearly limitless inits longevity, unlike our own typical batteries.Furthermore, Einstein’s apparent boundary of the speed of light as the fastestvelocity we can travel in the universe would have to be false. Otherwise, evenvisitors from the closest stars to our own would take a prohibitively longnumber of years to make it here. The travelers would probably need to go throughsome sort of cryogenic freeze, and would have the full knowledge that it wouldlikely be a one-way trip. Then, as I dug deeper into the reports of contacteesand UFO abductions, I would hear many accounts of people being telepathicallyinfluenced. They would “know” to get up in the middle of the night and gooutside. This certainly sounded familiar. Once they did make it outside, theywould see a ship hovering over their yard. Many UFO reports have these “weird”elements to them. The strange sleepwalking type of trance states encouraging meto go outside at night had happened to me, but I remembered seeing UFOs only indreams, so I was puzzled.As my search went on, I eventually discovered that some people on Earth appearto have souls that are significantly more advanced spiritually than most. Oneterm we will encounter for such people is Wanderers. It does appear that thesepeople are effectively extraterrestrial souls living in human bodies, who haveconsciously forgotten who they are. Another interesting aspect of this story isthat apparently their original ET family continues to contact them throughouttheir lives. This contact can occur through dreams, telepathy, or benevolentcontactee experiences, in which they are physically brought on board the shipsof their home group. In the vast majority of all cases, these contacts are thenblanked out from the person’s conscious memory. They have only a vague sensethat something very unusual may have happened to them. As bizarre as this mustsound, the concept explained many different bizarre things that were happeningto me throughout my childhood in upstate New York.Most Wanderers stay asleep their entire lives, by design. The world is improvedby their subconscious memories of a far more harmonious place as they work tohelp the planet. In my case, I was able to “penetrate the veil of forgetting,”using a term from the Law of One series, and discover far more about who I amand what I am doing here than most others do. The most exciting part aboutsharing my story in this book is that you may start putting the pieces togetherin your own life and begin asking new questions. If you have been interestedenough to pick up this book and are still reading it now, the chances are wellabove average that you yourself may be a Wanderer. If so, you owe it to yourselfto commit to discovering the answer—and I will discuss tools that can help youfind it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVETHE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION HEATS UPMy investigation into UFOs and the paranormal went further and further after Igot sober and began writing down my dreams in 1992, and especially after Ireceived my NASA disclosure in February 1993. I read well over three hundredbooks in the first three years alone, and then began migrating to the Internetstarting in late 1995. There were countless occasions when my dreams gave mefurther insights into the scientific data I was researching in these books, farbeyond the scope of what I could cover in this volume. I eventually began a newdepth and focus of research after I became self-employed as a UFOlogist in July1998, working fourteen hours a day, seven days a week.None of this felt like hard work to me. I was very focused on my quest due tothe awesome passion that I had to explore this greater truth. I did not want tobe distracted by anyone or anything for very long, which at times caused obviousproblems. I launched my own website and online business in February 1999, andbetween then and 2004, I printed and bound books out of all the best research Ifound online. During this period, my collection of research documents quicklyexpanded into nine feet of shelf space. The challenge of moving this mass ofpaper with me wherever I went led me to store all the information digitally, indetailed notes with hyperlinks, after 2004. If I were to print it all out andbind it into books now, I would probably have at least five times as much as theoriginal collection.I discovered that there were literally thousands of groundbreaking scientificdiscoveries out there that most people had never heard of, and probably wouldn’tbelieve despite the fact that they had been verified. Established PhDs weremaking discoveries that could be repeated under controlled conditions in alaboratory. They did everything properly, made sure that their discoveries werenot poisoned by their own biases, prejudices, and preexisting beliefs, and yetwere often very reluctant to publish their conclusions. They understood thatthey were presenting information that contradicted our prevailing beliefsystems, and that by doing so, they opened themselves up to ridicule,harassment, and career ruin. It was surprising to learn how much of this kind ofmaterial was out there, and how little of it had been integrated into anygreater whole. Some of it would appear in various online publications, but noone ever seemed to put these many thousands of scattered pieces together. Oneearly example of a book that did do a great job of tying together contentiousmaterial like this for me was The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot, whichI read around 1995.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber19]THE ALIGNMENTS OF MARSNothing captivated my imagination in those early years more than theHyperdimensional Model that Richard C. Hoagland talked about in his classic TheMonuments of Mars, which I first read in 1993, just a few months after my NASAdisclosure.2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber20] Hoagland was analyzing NASA imagesof the moon and Mars, and pointing out multiple anomalies that did look like theruins of intelligently built structures. On the Cydonia plateau of Mars, thereis a mountain that is a mile and a half across with a giant human-looking face,surrounded by what appears to be a headdress. Just to the west of the face is acity of objects that are clearly shaped like pyramids. South of the face and thecity is another, larger pyramid that is five-sided. Best of all, this is not ageometrically perfect pentagon but is actually styled in the exact proportionsof Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man. This means that the pentagon is built tothe exact proportions of the human body. Once you add in the human-looking faceto the north, it isn’t hard to conclude that humanlike beings built thesestructures.Hoagland postulated that Mars was once Earth-like, with oceans, atmosphere,clouds, and rain. This was nearly two decades before NASA finally announced thatMars once had a large ocean that was at least a mile and a half deep across muchof its surface. It is absolutely fascinating to have a philosophical discussionin which you begin by accepting that Mars was once an Earth-like home to anancient human race with advanced technology. By starting with that as yourfundamental premise, you can mount an intriguing investigation. Hoagland notedthat one half of the face on Mars looked human and the other half appearedcatlike. Here on Earth we have the Sphinx, which is a half human, half felinecreature—and as we know, the Sphinx sits immediately adjacent to the pyramids ofGiza. The face on Mars sits immediately adjacent to pyramid complexes as well.This established the intriguing idea that the people who built the Sphinx andthe Giza pyramids here on Earth may have been aware of the visible artifactsthat were still on Mars. Perhaps the ruling caste of Egyptians may even havebeen descendants of that civilization, or had at least found records from thedescendants. This is the central focus of the cosmic history of our solar systemthat is discussed in the second half of my previous book, The AscensionMysteries.Some people in Hoagland’s discussion forum absolutely could not make it to thepoint of believing that any of this was true. They simply could not accept thatNASA had photographed anything other than “a trick of light and shadow,” or“Jesus on a potato chip.” This made it nearly impossible for them to followalong with the next part of the discussion, where Hoagland’s team analyzed thegeometric and mathematical relationships between the unusual-looking structuresthey found on Mars. With my mind newly opened, I accepted that these objectswere not optical illusions and were very likely ancient ruins. I studied all thedata regarding the alignments very carefully and concluded that, at the veryleast, it was a highly compelling argument, if not actually the truth.Hoagland’s team argued that the monuments were deliberately designed to give usthe mathematical clues to decipher an entirely new and more advanced form ofphysics than the one we were currently using. This new form of physics is whatHoagland called the Hyperdimensional Model, and it was deep with mystery. Withthis new model, we could potentially unlock the mysteries of antigravity, freeenergy, faster-than-light warp drive, time travel, and the true source ofconsciousness. The Hyperdimensional Model was the scientific Rosetta stone thatwould allow us to explain all of the seemingly impossible aspects of the UFOphenomenon. Even better, it held the promise of how we could develop thisremarkable technology for our own civilization. Additionally, as I went deeperand deeper into this model, it became increasingly clear that we were living ina holographic universe, just as Michael Talbot had postulated in his book of thesame name. That meant that ultimately the universe could actually be the productof a dream from an “intelligent infinity,” or One Infinite Creator, just as theLaw of One series had indicated.SCALAR WAVESHoagland’s model was heavily influenced and guided by the work of LieutenantColonel Tom Bearden, who had worked in classified government and militaryprograms and had made a variety of interesting scientific discoveries. Bearden’swork focused on the idea that he had discovered a new type of energy that hecalled a scalar wave. The jargon quickly got dense, but it became a verysobering discussion when Bearden argued that scalar waves could be made intoweapons that were potentially far worse than nuclear bombs. Scalar waves couldcause water to instantly boil into steam or freeze into ice, even in largeamounts, and humans are mostly made of water. Scalar waves could create andmanipulate severe storms, including tornadoes and hurricanes. Scalar waves couldbe used to trigger massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Scalar wavescould manipulate the way our minds work, creating mass hysteria or other statesof consciousness that certain power brokers might deem useful. Scalar wavescould invisibly attack our technology, such as an airplane, and cause it to comeflying apart in midair without anyone understanding what happened. Beardenbelieved that the infamous Space Shuttle Challenger disaster of January 28,1986, was an attack by the Russians using scalar waves.Bearden had some very elaborate science in his writings. This was by no meansentry-level material. He wrote for an educated audience who were alreadyoperating at a PhD level of knowledge of physics. To understand what he wastalking about, I had to quickly bring myself up to speed on all the terms andconcepts he was referring to. Most people would have been incredibly frustratedby this challenge, but I forged ahead undeterred. I began intensively workingthrough this “learning curve” in the summer of 1998 to try to gain a deeperunderstanding of exactly what Bearden was talking about. Much of my knowledge ofphysics was acquired by reading articles and books online, where credentialedindependent scholars were tearing apart the existing models and pointing outtheir numerous, embarrassing flaws. This was what triggered the origin of mynine-foot-long collection of printed books of Internet research. Printing thiscomplex material into books allowed me to get away from computer screens andspend long hours sitting and contemplating the meaning of the words.It took several months of nonstop fourteen-hour days to get the basics down. Inthe process, I found a wealth of authors who were reviewing the basics whilealso pointing out many key areas where these established scientific conclusionswere blatantly wrong. Since you needed to have a scientific mind to create awebsite back in those days, with the complexity of software, HTML programminglanguage, and the like, a variety of great research works into alternativescience were available in the late 1990s. You didn’t have to look very far onceyou began searching for certain terms. These scientists were very happy to havea free press in which to share their conclusions with the general public,without fear of censorship. This data included a huge wealth of formerlyclassified material from Russia. After the USSR collapsed in 1991, many of thesescientists were now free to declassify their work and publish it online withoutrepercussions.Bearden argued that we were working with a grossly oversimplified view of theelectromagnetic wave. We think we are seeing two simple sine waves that movesimultaneously: the magnetic wave, which moves left to right on the X axis, andthe electrostatic wave, which moves up and down on the Y axis at the same time.The legendary scientist James Clerk Maxwell had originally mapped out far moredetail and structure in the electromagnetic pulse than these two simple waves.Oliver Heaviside came along and drastically simplified everything to create thetwo-sine-wave model we still use today. Heaviside removed most of thethree-dimensional details that Maxwell had found in the wave. Bearden calledthese hidden three-dimensional details “scalar potentials.” The electrostaticand magnetic waves we map out in today’s science textbooks are tracing only theoutlines of these hidden three-dimensional energy structures. By eliminating thescalar potentials from our discussion, we actually lost an entire branch ofscience that could dramatically accelerate our technology. Though scalar wavescould be used to harm people, they also have incredible healing potentials thatare unavailable through any other means. If these technologies are properlyregulated, they can be of amazing benefit to humanity—including eliminatingmany, if not most of the diseases we now take for granted, such as cancer.THE HYPERDIMENSIONAL MODELAs the years went by, the Hyperdimensional Model proved to be exactly what I hadbeen looking for. The more I probed the nature of geometry and looked for cluesto how the pieces all fit together, the more truths I uncovered. I had reason tobelieve that geometry was the hidden key to solving the greatest scientificmysteries of the universe. And the more I explored this idea, the more obviousit became. Much of this science appears in my first book, The Source FieldInvestigations, with over one thousand academic references, but in this presentbook, I will explore a smaller amount of information and expand upon it forgreater insights into dreams, extraterrestrial communication, and Ascension.Most important, as this book continues, I will use the Hyperdimensional Model asthe basis for a new and very interesting philosophical argument—namely, that theuniverse itself is a dream.TETRAHEDRAL GEOMETRYOnce Tom Bearden started talking about the scalar potentials he saw in theelectromagnetic wave, the discussion quickly shifted to geometry. These scalarpotentials actually had a distinct shape. The entire electromagnetic wave wastraveling along in the shape of a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron is similar to apyramid in its basic shape, but instead of having a four-sided base, it has athree-sided base, which creates a total of four equilateral triangle faces. Andsure enough, if you study the up-and-down movement of the electrostatic wavewith the left-to-right movement of the magnetic wave, you can see that the wavesare perfectly tracing the shape of a tetrahedron.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber21]Bearden very likely got this idea from Buckminster Fuller, who had alreadynoticed the hidden geometric structure in the electromagnetic wave yearsearlier. It still amazes me that hardly anyone talks about this, since it is sosimple and obvious once you look at it. This is probably because most peoplewouldn’t have any reason to expect to see a hidden geometric pattern within theelectromagnetic wave. We have no context for it, no idea of what it might be,nor how something like this could fit into a greater model of physics. Yetmysteries like these can also contain the greatest secrets, with the highestpotential to transform our civilization as we know it. As the years went by, Ieventually discovered this same geometry appearing in the structure of theEarth’s continents, the relationships between the planets in our solar system,the growth patterns of plants, the nucleus of the atom, the electron clouds ofthe atom, the DNA molecule, and even the activity between clusters of neurons inthe human brain.I have every reason to believe that Unified Field Theory of physics—the trueHoly Grail of modern science—will be fundamentally and deeply connected tosacred geometry. The term sacred geometry refers to the idea that certaingeometric patterns, such as the tetrahedron, may actually be alive and consciouswhen they appear intertwined with the basic forces of nature and biological lifeas we now know it. Most of the key discoveries have already been made, and thereal challenge now exists in presenting this message in a way that can reachmainstream consciousness. By this token, I also believe that a variety ofextraterrestrial civilizations have already discovered this same science, andencoded these secrets into ancient architecture, sacred symbols, and otherrelated forms.For me, the most shocking part of this Hyperdimensional Model in those earlyyears was in Richard Hoagland’s suggestion that these same tetrahedral geometricpatterns were appearing within planets in visible ways. Hoagland discussed thisregularly, and he was arguably the most frequent and popular talent on Coast toCoast AM with Art Bell. This was the largest nighttime talk-radio program in theUS, and had up to twenty million listeners per episode in the late 1990s. Inthose days, if you could get a show on Art Bell, you would instantly become arecognized name in the UFO community. It opened the door for book sales,conference invitations, and the possibility of collaboration with otherlike-minded scholars. You might very well be able to become self-supporting as aUFO researcher instead of needing to have a “regular job” and doing yourparanormal work on the side. For me in 1996–1999, getting on the Art Bell showseemed like an impossible dream. Each episode began with the signature thumpingsynthesizer music and Art’s opening monologue: “From the high desert in thegreat American Southwest, I bid you all good morning, good afternoon, goodevening, wherever you may be in this great land of ours. . . .”Art Bell was one of only three paranormal radio shows that were available onlinethrough streaming audio, using the Real Player. At the time, it was completelyfree to listen, and the show was supported by the sale of advertisements, whichdid consume a large amount of airtime. Some of Art’s products were for the endof the world, such as a hand-powered crank-generator radio so you could stilllisten to Art Bell after all the power went off. This was expected in a varietyof scenarios, such as the dreaded “Y2K” event, where power-grid computers wereexpected to reset themselves to the year 1900 once we hit the year 2000, sincetheir software had been written to use only the last two digits for the year.Art was pivotal in raising public awareness about this issue, and billions ofdollars were spent ensuring that we dodged that bullet.I never missed a single episode of Richard Hoagland when he was on the air withArt Bell. I had been a huge fan of Hoagland’s work and had been pondering hishyperdimensional physics model ever since I first read The Monuments of Marsback in 1993. I had devoted literally hundreds, if not thousands, of hours tomeditating on these concepts and trying to gain a deeper understanding, using asimilar form of reasoning, logic, and intuition as the philosophers I hadstudied in college. From 1993 to 1996, I had felt as if Hoagland had been my ownprivate discovery that hardly anyone else knew about. Anytime I tried to discusshis research with others at my college, they were quite surprised, having neverheard of it before, so I was stunned to discover that Hoagland had become such apopular radio personality and public speaker in the three years since I firstread his groundbreaking book.Hoagland would always talk with mystery, awe, and reverence about “19.5,” as hecalled it. This refers to a specific latitude that could be north or south ofthe equator on a given planet or satellite. Tom Bearden had noticed that large,rotating storms appear on gas planets at 19.5 degrees latitude. This includedthe Great Red Spot on Jupiter, which has been spinning at the same exactlatitude ever since the invention of the telescope. Conventional science has noexplanation for how a gigantic storm like this, big enough to fit four Earthsside by side inside it, could continue raging away at the same, odd latitude forover four hundred years without drifting around or disappearing. The mysterybecomes even stranger when we realize that the same exact thing is happening onNeptune, which has one gigantic storm called the Great Dark Spot. And there itis, at the same mysterious latitude: 19.5.The mystery became even more enticing once we went over to solid planets. Thereagain, we see unusually energetic and visible structures appearing at the“magic” 19.5-degree latitude. On Earth, we have the volcanic island chain ofHawaii. There is so much volcanic activity there that an entire collection ofislands has been formed as the bubbling lava has hardened into crust. Thevolcanoes are still very active, occasionally releasing volcanic fog or burstsof lava that can be potentially lethal for the local residents. Hawaii is wellknown to be the most volcanically active area on Earth, and it’s right there atthe magic 19.5-degree North latitude. We see a very similar thing happen when wetravel over to Mars. There, we have the massive shield volcano Olympus Mons,which is two times higher in altitude than Earth’s Mount Everest. Olympus Monsis by far the largest volcano on Mars, and obviously creates an incrediblydamaging spectacle when it has a full eruption. Once again, it appears preciselyat the 19.5-degree latitude.At that time, we could not see Pluto in any detail, but four out of our eightvisible planets showed undeniable vortex patterns at 19.5—a full 50 percent.Clearly, something is going on here. This phenomenon is real and it is not goingaway. The discovery wasn’t as simple and straightforward as the idea of theEarth revolving around the sun, but it had every bit as much potential to be ascientific breakthrough as the work of Newton, Copernicus, Galileo, or Einstein.Wonderful new discoveries could be made, and I was definitely attracted to that.My great-grandfather Frederick Wilcock designed and built the New York Citysubway system, with a juris doctor degree in law and a PhD in engineering. Mygrandfather Donald F. Wilcock had a PhD in engineering with over eightydifferent patents, mostly in the field of bearings and lubrication. Mygrandfather taught me to have a passion for science from a very young age, andthe mystery of these geometric vortexes ignited my curiosity like nothingbefore.By the time I heard Hoagland talking about this on Art Bell, I had already spentyears looking at his diagrams for how this model supposedly worked. Thetetrahedron shape has a very interesting quality that might not seem to be thatimportant, at first, when in fact it is of tremendous significance. Hoaglandshowed that a tetrahedron fits perfectly inside a sphere, such as the Earth.Each of the four corners of the tetrahedron will perfectly touch the edges ofthe sphere. And spheres appear in nature everywhere we look. Stars arespherical. Planets are spherical. Many fruits are predominantly spherical, suchas apples and oranges. Cells are often roughly spherical in shape. Soap bubblesare naturally spherical since the air pressure pushes on them equally from allsides. Now we see that the tetrahedron geometry exists in perfect harmony withthe sphere as well. To generate the 19.5-degree alignment, all you have to do isto draw a tetrahedron that was the appropriate size to fit inside a sphere. Youthen take one of the four corners of the tetrahedron and align it with the northor south pole of the sphere. The other three corners of the tetrahedron will allappear at the opposing 19.5-degree latitude. They will also be exactly 120degrees apart from each other, dividing the circle into three equal sections.[../images/Image-001_012120.jpg]Image of Sphere with Circumscribed Tetrahedron, Showing 19.5-Degree Vortex PointHoagland does not believe this tetrahedron is any type of solid object, such asa crystal. It is actually an energy wave, again what Bearden would call a“scalar potential.” Most important, this tetrahedron of energy is not visible ormeasurable in our own “third dimension.” The tetrahedron does not glow withanything like a dim, blue light that could show us where it was. You can’t touchit. We can only see its aftereffects on the physical matter of planets, such asin the Great Red Spot, Great Dark Spot, Hawaii, or Olympus Mons. Hoagland alsopoints out that there are two noticeably different cloud bands on Saturn at the19.5-degree latitudes, perhaps owing to this same geometry. Additionally,sunspots usually never travel farther than 19.5 degrees of latitude north orsouth on the sun—as if this hidden geometry prevented them from going outsidethese boundaries. The thick atmosphere of Venus prevents us from seeing if ithas a similar volcano at the 19.5-degree point on its surface—but it probablydoes.I always had the sense that Hoagland had received classified insider briefingson this, such as from Tom Bearden or Arthur C. Clarke, and that whoever createdthose briefings knew a lot more about this science than they had ever releasedto Hoagland or anyone else. Science is all about repetition, and in this case,we have four different planets in our solar system where all their mostnoteworthy visible disturbances occur at the magic 19.5-degree latitude. Thisstrongly suggests that these disturbances are the result of a hidden geometricenergy pattern that is yet unknown to conventional science. Hoagland also saidthat the key to this science was “rotation, rotation, rotation.” He believed, orwas told, that once you started rotating an object, such as a planet, you couldbegin accessing these “scalar potentials” of energy that otherwise remainedhidden but were nonetheless all around us. Hoagland implied that this was thesecret to antigravity, if you understood how to properly harness its power.DEPALMA’S SPINNING BALL EXPERIMENTRichard Hoagland’s The Monuments of Mars also discussed the work of Dr. BruceDePalma, which was quite fascinating. DePalma was the brother of the noteddirector Brian De Palma, who is known for intense movies like Carrie, Scarface,Body Double, The Untouchables, Carlito’s Way, Mission: Impossible, and others.Hoagland often talked about a very fascinating scientific discovery from BruceDePalma, which suggested that we had made some serious mistakes in ourunderstanding of gravity and its effects on physical matter. The discovery wasknown as DePalma’s Spinning Ball Experiment and was published in a paper onMarch 17, 1977.4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber22]The experiment was almost ridiculously simple. You create two catapults thatsimultaneously launch two balls into the air. The catapults and the balls areexactly the same in size, weight, and composition. The balls normally rise andfall in the same exact shape, known as a parabolic arc. The balls travel to thesame height and fall at the same speed, just as we would expect. However,something very different happens if you set the experiment up again and changeonly one thing. This time, you simply spin one of the balls up to a speed of onethousand revolutions per minute while leaving the other one motionless. Then yourelease the catapults. Now something different happens—something that defies ourknown laws of physics.For some unknown reason, the spinning ball will first rise higher and then fallfaster than the ball that is not spinning. This is quite astonishing, and itdoesn’t make any sense within our conventional Newtonian physics models. Mostscientists would laugh in your face if you told them about this, and wouldautomatically assume that DePalma must be a “quack” who is practicing“pseudoscience.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Gravity is expected totravel at a “constant” rate of acceleration, and it works no differently for afeather than for a chunk of lead. This experiment suggests that if we couldunderstand what was happening, we could harness the power of antigravity. Inthis next quote from the paper, DePalma said that the ball that was not spinningwould be called the identical non-rotating control. You have to remember thatodd-sounding term in order to make sense of this quote. In his own words,DePalma said, “I think it is a mind-bending experience to see every stone fallat the exact same rate as any other stone. And when you spin an object, why doesit fall faster? And most mind-boggling of all, why does it go higher than theidentical non-rotating control released to go upward at the same initialvelocity? . . . [This] presents a dilemma which can only be resolved orunderstood on the basis of radically new concepts in physics . . . growing outof the many discussions and correspondence pertaining to rotation, inertia,gravity, and motion in general.”5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber23]Perhaps the most important thing Dr. DePalma said in this quote is that hisdiscovery “presents a dilemma which can only be resolved or understood on thebasis of radically new concepts in physics.”6 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber24]That means that for us to explain his discovery, we will need to think aboutscience, physical matter, and the universe in a “radically new” way—which isobviously not being taught in our schools. Spinning objects are not supposed todefeat gravity simply by rotating, but now we know that they actually do—atleast in part. DePalma also said, “Without a theoretical foundation ofunderstanding to make the experiment comprehensible—to fit the results into acontext of rational understanding and harmony with the facts of otherexperiments—the data become trivial and worthless and, worst of all, subject tomisinterpretation.”7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber25]DePalma is clearly calling for an entirely new theoretical model to integratethese observations into a new and superior scientific view. By definition, thisnew theoretical model will be surprising, unexpected, and quite different fromwhat we think we know today. We need to find other experiments that have similarresults, combine them, and try to figure out what we are dealing with. We haveno current reason to expect that a rotating object will weigh less than astationary object with the exact same mass, but now we know that it does.DePalma dropped some names of scientists who had discovered similarlyinteresting things, without going into detail about exactly what they had found:“We should remember the pioneers in this field: Wolfe, Cox, Dean, Laithwaite,Rendle, Searl, Kummel, DePalma and Delvers, to name but a few.”8[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber26] Once we figure out what is going on here, thisresearch may finally allow us to control gravity, which is a true Holy Grail forour planet—propelling us into a Star Trek age.In 2019, we finally saw some exciting movement in this direction from officialsources. The US Navy declassified a patent by Salvatore Cezar Pais thatdescribed the creation of a flying triangle-shaped craft that uses “gravitycontrol” to fly. In short, the US Navy is formally acknowledging that they havea working “repulsive gravity” system. They don’t actually say they have aworking prototype, only that they “might” have one—but the patent is veryspecific, and this suggests that such a craft was definitely developed, tested,and flown. The author does explain that gravity control is possible, and usesthe experiment of Hideo Hayasaka and Sakae Takeuchi to help justify it. This isvery similar to DePalma’s Spinning Ball Experiment.In this case, the Japanese scientists placed a gyroscope on a chemical beambalance. When the gyroscope is rotated in a rightward, clockwise direction, italso weighs slightly less. This was discussed in a New Scientist article from1990:> Hayasaka and Takeuchi found that when a gyroscope spins in a clockwise> sense—looking down on it from above—it loses weight. The amount it loses is> only about five-thousandths of one per cent of its resting weight. The> researchers also found that the faster the gyroscope spins, the more weight it> loses (see figure). They published their work in Physical Review Letters (vol> 63, p 2701).9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber27]The navy patent said, “For the mathematical formalism of inertial (and thusgravitational) mass reduction consider that in a published Physical ReviewLetter (December 1989), Hayasaka and Takeuchi report the anomalous weightreduction of gyroscopes for right rotations only. . . . [This] yields thepossibility of a local quantum vacuum effect, namely a negative pressure(repulsive gravity) condition being present.”10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber28]I had discovered the Hayasaka-Takeuchi experiment back in the 1990s as one of afew studies that further validated the results of DePalma’s Spinning BallExperiment. This “hyperdimensional” knowledge is now finding its way intomainstream consciousness through the navy gravity-control patent.Even more excitingly, this same inventor also filed a patent for a “compactfusion” device that generates massive quantities of energy, potentially over athousand megawatts, with hardly any input power, in an object as small as 0.3meters.11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber29] This is literally a “free energy”device, and the obvious implication is that it could be dropped into the navy’sflying antigravity triangle craft as a power supply.According to The Drive, a reputable online publication discussing militarymatters, “It is claimed in the patent application that this plasma compressionfusion device is capable of producing power in the gigawatt (1 billion watts) toterawatt (1 trillion watts) range and above with input power only in thekilowatt (1,000 watts) to megawatt (1,000,000 watts) range. By comparison,America’s largest nuclear power plant, the Palo Verde nuclear power plant inArizona, generates around 4,000 megawatts (4 gigawatts), and the A1B nuclearreactors designed for the Navy’s Gerald R. Ford–class aircraft carriers generatearound 700 megawatts.” The patent even claims that the device can “possibly leadto ignition plasma burn, that is self-sustained plasma burn without need forexternal input power.”12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber30] After I wrote aboutthese patents on my website, a reader pointed out that the name “Salvatore Pais”translates as “Savior of Our Nation” in Spanish. This suggests that the navy isdeliberately releasing this technology to help save the planet from the ravagesof coal, oil, gas, and automotive transportation. There is hardly anyinformation on Salvatore Pais, and at this point we can speculate that he mayhave been assigned to file these patents because of his suggestive name.Hoagland seemed to envision a tetrahedral energy wave forming within thespherical ball in DePalma’s experiment. As the ball rotated, perhaps thistetrahedron-shaped energy wave was pulling in and shooting out energy thatmanipulated the force of gravity around the ball in some measurable way, justlike a spinning planet. The 19.5-degree point created rotating cyclones on gasplanets, and if we could harness that extra rotational energy, we might be ableto tap it like a windmill or a water wheel. Thus the hyperdimensional physicsmodel could also be our ticket to limitless clean, free energy. Rotating objectslike the spinning ball were apparently accessing energy from some yet-unknownsource that caused them to bend the “law” of gravity in exciting new ways.This idea of invisible, hyperdimensional geometry was very interesting to me.Hoagland had clearly identified a geometric shape that was causing strangephenomena to appear on planets, but we really had no idea what this geometry wasor why it was there in the first place. I had experienced strong fevers as achild and would often have elaborate hallucinations of geometric patterns. Thesame thing happened under the effect of psychedelics as well as in deepmeditation. Many other people have reported having similar perceptions, and thisincludes various Eastern mystics who end up drawing elaborate geometricmandalas. I had always wondered if there was some deeper meaning for why so manypeople, myself included, had these unique visionary experiences with geometry.Perhaps we already knew the answer at some deep level of our being, and we justneeded to remember it.I started deeply meditating on these concepts in 1993. By the time I discoveredthe Law of One series in 1996, it was unlikely that a single day had gone bywithout my thinking about sacred geometry. I was extremely surprised to discoverthat the Law of One series presented a very advanced integration of geometry,science, and consciousness that went far beyond anything I had come up with onmy own, even after countless hours of dedicated research. The main reason I amsharing this science with you now is to eventually show you the Law of Onequotes that revealed the importance of geometry in the universe. Ultimately, wewill see that the One Infinite Creator generated all the matter in the universeas a single thought, which also manifested as a vibration that creates geometry.We will read these quotes in later chapters, after some additional material hasbeen filled in to help us set up the story. After three years of dedicated studyin sacred geometry, it was truly fascinating to discover that a source alreadyexisted that puts all the pieces together and presents a truly unified physicsmodel."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXCROP CIRCLES REVEAL EXTRATERRESTRIAL BLUEPRINTSCrop circles were perhaps the most enigmatic aspect of Richard Hoagland’sHyperdimensional Model. In the original Monuments of Mars book, Hoaglandincluded images of two different crop circles that very directly revealed themathematics of a tetrahedron inside a sphere.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber31]In some notable cases, these crop formations created visible diagrams oftetrahedrons and the angular relationships they generate when they are placedinside spheres. These mysterious formations had been regularly appearing inEuropean crops for at least twelve hundred years. I found records where thearchbishop of France passed a law that made it illegal for pagans to removecrops from crop circles. The actual existence and appearance of crop circles, atthe time, was never even questioned.Dr. Robert Plot sketched out multiple interesting crop formations that hadappeared on his land in southern England back in the 1600s. These formations hadastonishing geometric precision despite being inscribed into ordinary fields ofwheat. The stalks would bend at the growth nodes without breaking, and wouldcontinue growing after the formation had appeared. There were no signs oftampering from humans, such as broken stalks or pathways in and out. Multiplewitnesses saw the formations appear spontaneously right in front of their eyes,much like the opening of an Oriental fan. Certain witnesses saw Nordic-typeextraterrestrial humans in unusual, silvery outfits who seemed to be perfectingthe design of the crop circles after they were formed, using some kind of smallmachine. As they turned the knobs on the machine, certain stalks of wheat wouldmove back and forth in the crop circle.The crop circle mystery was quite significant, and my first introduction to itwas with the German researcher Michael Hesemann’s book The Cosmic Connection.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber32] The book was full of gorgeous and fascinatingpictures and had some truly inspiring theories. I was lucky enough to meetHesemann and have extensive conversations with him at my first UFO conference inthe fall of 1996. It was difficult to imagine how such beautiful patterns couldbe created in a wheat field, since you could appreciate them only from the air.Once I got online in the late fall of 1995, I quickly found the Crop CircleConnector website,3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33] where you could scanthrough a huge library of crop circle images. These images had staggering beautyand precision, and were richly varied. At the time, certain people did try tomake fake crop circles, such as the infamous “Doug and Dave,” who were presentedby the media as the ultimate answer to appease all the skeptics. The fake cropcircles were very crude, however, and obviously quite different from the realones, which had incredible beauty and sophistication. Some truly amazing cropcircles appeared that next summer of 1996, and they again repeatedly told us tolook at tetrahedral geometry. For me, it was deeply exciting to see these newformations showing up and validating Hoagland’s model within less than a yearafter I had first gotten onto the Internet.Hoagland’s Hyperdimensional Model, therefore, was infused with incrediblemystery and wonder. It seemed he had stumbled onto a whole new branch of sciencethat the extraterrestrials very much wanted us to discover. I didn’t really knowwhat the tetrahedron was, nor did Hoagland, beyond a certain point, but theextraterrestrials apparently wanted us to figure it out. Someone had encoded themathematics in the layout of ancient monuments on Mars, and now some obviousintelligence was encoding this same science into the layouts of a variety ofmysterious crop circles on Earth. I was frankly astonished that more peoplehadn’t jumped into this modern-day scientific adventure. To me, it was like agold rush to see who could be the first to decipher this mystery, handed to usby advanced beings of a higher intelligence. If you could solve the puzzle, youcould make breakthroughs that might significantly improve life for everyone onEarth. The extraterrestrials may be giving us the clues to unlock the secrets ofantigravity, free energy, consciousness, and the true space age. This newscience may also end up changing everything we thought we knew about reality asa whole, requiring us to rewrite almost every branch of science that we now takefor granted.I was happy to look at this whole body of data as if it was a philosophicalargument. To have a successful platform to argue from, I accepted certain basicsas being true after I did enough research to convince myself of their validity.My foundation therefore included the idea that extraterrestrials did exist, thatcrop circles were made by extraterrestrials, that the monuments of Mars weremade by extraterrestrials, and that the alignments discovered by Hoagland’s teamon Mars did indeed reveal tetrahedral geometry. I was further able to acceptthat storms on gas planets, and giant volcanoes on solid planets, were somehowbeing generated by tetrahedral geometry, and that the extraterrestrials wantedus to study this same tetrahedral geometry by encoding it into their cropcircles. Now I was free to explore what this geometry was, how it formed, why itformed, and why the extraterrestrials would want us to study this curiousphenomenon. They could have encoded just about anything into their cropformations, but over and over again they reinforced the main message: “StudySacred Geometry.”SACRED GEOMETRYIn the fall of 1997, I found a book by Robert Lawlor called Sacred Geometry. Herevealed that these same basic patterns appeared all throughout nature in veryinteresting ways, in the proportions of the human body as well as in all otherliving creatures. Many ancient philosophers, such as Pythagoras, studied sacredgeometry and speculated about the reasons why these patterns appear soprevalently in nature. Lawlor and others also revealed that many of thesephilosophical investigations were hidden behind the veils of secret societies.Anyone who dared to reveal this knowledge to the general public was literallysubject to the death penalty. They would swear under oath to “ever conceal andnever reveal” the information.The initiates apparently believed that this geometry also contained the secretsto attaining godlike states of being. Meditating on these patterns for prolongedperiods apparently could activate dormant potentials in the human body, mind,and spirit. Therefore, the mystery schools believed the information had to bevery carefully protected. If someone were to access this power and use it forevil intentions, they could potentially do tremendous damage. Most of us hadlost any curiosity about sacred geometry in our modern age, though it wasdiscussed in the original book version of Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code. Therewas undeniable evidence of this same geometry encoded into classic architecture,such as cathedrals, as well as classic Renaissance paintings. The geometry alsoappeared in ancient stone monuments like Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid. Manyscholars and philosophers believed that the geometry itself was somehow aliveand intelligent—sacred. By tapping into this knowledge, through meditation forinstance, it was believed that you could eventually develop seemingly superhumanabilities. Ultimately, you could experience Ascension—a transfiguration intosome higher level of what it means to be human, where your body is transformedinto a visibly glowing “light body” form.This again was a very fascinating concept. Ancient mystery schools wouldapparently have their initiates build models of various sacred geometricobjects, and then study and meditate on them for extended periods of time. Isoon found myself doing the same thing. It definitely appeared that there was amassive gold mine of new scientific breakthroughs waiting for us. Our ancestorsmay well have been given this information by extraterrestrials and did the bestthey could to understand it with the science they had available in their time.Now, with far greater observational tools, we could hopefully finish the job andgreatly enhance our scientific models. Unfortunately, as I found out later, somepeople would immediately throw my book down if they saw pictures of geometry init. They would say that this is math, and that they “hate math.” I had onepotential customer do this right in front of me while I was at a book-signingtable early in my career, back when I was printing out and hand-binding my ownbooks. People like this had the same attitude as the priests with Galileo’stelescope. I was greatly saddened to observe this behavior, since if we don’thave enough curiosity to explore new ideas, we will never progress as acivilization.QUANTUM FIELDS ACT LIKE A FLUIDI listened very carefully to everything that Richard Hoagland said on the radio,and after a while it seemed clear that he hadn’t fully solved the puzzle. Hedidn’t appear to fully understand what the geometry was, how it formed, or whyit formed. He ultimately agreed that there were still many aspects of the modelthat had not yet been discovered. He was happy to partner with me to further theinvestigation, beginning privately in 2000 and publicly in 2005. It wasn’t clearhow this geometry was causing giant vortexes to swirl around in the atmospheresof gas planets, nor in the lava under the surface crust of solid planets. Italso wasn’t clear why this same geometry appeared in living things. Theconnection between DePalma’s Spinning Ball Experiment and the vortexes thatappeared at 19.5 degrees latitude on rotating planets also did not seemimmediately obvious. Hoagland believed that some power was kicking in when anobject started rotating, and this power appeared in a tetrahedral geometricpattern. However, it really wasn’t clear what the power was, or why it appearedin a rotating object. Again, this is more a physics discussion, and I recommendreading The Source Field Investigations to go more deeply into this topic thanthere is space for in this book.Early on, I did realize that we obviously had made a big mistake about matter.René Descartes had created a materialistic philosophy in which matter at itssmallest levels was made of tiny, hard particles. There was no alternate realitywhere these particles could go—they were always here with us. Descartescertainly had never heard of the quantum “wave-particle duality,” where mattercan appear as a particle one minute and then appear as a wave, with no solididentity, the next. It is possible that if we could transform enough particlesin a piece of matter into a wave state, the object would weigh less. Descartesnever had anything like this to work with. In his worldview, an object wouldalways weigh the same unless you physically removed some of its mass, say, bychipping a piece off.At this point, I started visualizing DePalma’s Spinning Ball Experiment as ifthe ball was like a wet dog shaking off a bunch of water. Each atom might havesome type of energy in it that behaves like a fluid, and is not strictly trappedwithin that atom. This is different from the conventional idea that atoms cantake in or give out only single photons at a time, which become electrons oncethey merge with the atom. In this new model, if you rotate the object fastenough, you might force some of this quantum fluid to spray out of the atoms,and the object then weighs less. Another way to look at this strange loss ofmass is that rotating the object might cause some of its particles to transforminto a wave state. There may be some fluidlike way in which this was happening.Even the “solid particle” state of matter could still behave more like a fluidthan a hard object, and by introducing enough motion, the particles might flowinto waves.Later on, I found the cannonball experiment of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev, which madethis “quantum fluid” even more obvious.4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34],5[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35] Kozyrev weighed a cannonball and then droppedit on his concrete basement floor. After the cannonball hit the floor, itactually weighed less, even though none of it had chipped or broken off. It tooktwenty minutes for all the weight to return to the cannonball. In that case, thehard crash of the cannonball against the floor may have caused some of thisfluidlike energy to splash out of its atoms. Particles turned into waves on alarger scale within the cannonball after the impact, and its weight decreased.Over time, the background energy of space and time itself flowed back into thecannonball and the waves reverted back to their normal particle state, causingthe weight to return.Equally fascinating was a discovery by Dr. Harold Aspden.6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36] He took a magnetic rotor and brought it up to3,250 revolutions per minute. He measured how much energy it takes to get the800-gram rotor spinning that fast, which is normally 300 joules. Then he stoppedthe magnet from rotating. Within sixty seconds or less, he started spinning themagnet again. Now, for some amazing reason, it took far less energy to bring themagnet back up to the same rotational speed than it had before—only 30 joulesinstead of 300. This again suggested that there was some sort of fluidlikeenergy inside the magnet, and that even once the magnet physically stoppedrotating, the fluidlike energy inside the magnet was still spinning very fast.As he started rotating the magnet again, the spinning energy made it much easierto bring the magnet back to its highest rotational speed. As I found more andmore experiments like this, I realized that we really do not understand matter,gravity, and magnetism as much as we thought we did. There should be a way forus to harness this fluidlike behavior within physical matter so that we couldultimately control gravity.FACING FEARSI felt that with the many hundreds of crop circle diagrams that had appearedover the years, the extraterrestrials were giving us a homework assignment. Theywere asking us to look into this science, to embrace it, and to study it in moredetail. I thought I had a pretty good handle on it by 1996 and 1997 as I keptstudying sacred geometry. However, as the crop formations continued to repeatthe same point, I decided that I needed to take this far more seriously. Thatmeant facing everyone’s greatest fear—tackling a vastly complex body oftechnical information that one really knows nothing about. I would have to startfrom scratch, without the guidance of a professor, class, or structuredcurriculum to find the answers I sought. No one had figured this out yet, atleast not within our own unclassified world, so there was no course in existencethat could teach it. Much like how I started my practice of recording andanalyzing dreams, I just had to throw myself into the study without reallyunderstanding the language.I rolled up my sleeves and began exploring Tom Bearden’s works in far moredetail beginning in 1998. At times, it was crushingly frustrating to try tofigure out what certain terms or concepts meant. However, my grandfather hadtaught me to have patience in the face of unfamiliar information. Ever since Iwas very young, Papa would sit me down and describe his work on a softwareprogram that used advanced trigonometry, such as “matrix inversions,” tocustom-design a particular type of bearing. The “tapered land thrust bearing”was quite difficult to manufacture, and this was his unique area of expertise.He felt it would be a huge breakthrough in his field to write a piece ofsoftware that could custom-design the bearings at any size. At the time, he toldme, the US military had working models in only two different sizes, and theywould have to design entire machines to fit one of these two sizes. He wrote hissoftware in Fortran and had a series of subroutines, all of which had to compileand work together as a whole. He was pushing the power of his archaicamber-screen IBM computer, with its five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy disks, to theabsolute limits of what it could do.Throughout my entire childhood and adolescence, right up to his death in 2000,Papa would tell me exactly what he was working on, the problems he was having,and how he solved them. At one point, he discovered that a single semicolon haddestroyed the entire program. I never fully understood what he was talkingabout, but I learned not to be afraid of any of it, to keep an open mind, and tounderstand as much of it as I could by listening very carefully to what he saidand asking questions. This ended up being great training for me to tackle theimmense frustration that can happen when trying to understand material astechnical as Tom Bearden’s papers. I also learned to read through scientificstudies and not be intimidated by the equations. I would look for the concepts,where they used words instead of mathematics to explain the things they haddiscovered. In most cases, this was more than enough to understand thediscovery.THE GLOBAL GRIDAnother quantum leap I had in understanding and appreciating this new sciencecame when I found Anti-Gravity and the World Grid,7[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37] a collection of essays by various authors thatwas compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress, who is now one of my costarson Ancient Aliens. I first found this book when I was still a college student,on my winter break between 1994 and 1995, at Borders books in Albany, New York.Richard Hoagland had focused exclusively on the geometry of the tetrahedron,whereas David Childress’s book clearly indicated that there were other geometricpatterns affecting the behavior of the Earth. This included the cube,octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron. Together with the tetrahedron, theseshapes formed the five basic Platonic solids, originally spelled out by Plato.The Platonic solids are invariably featured in every book on sacred geometrythat you find. The Platonic solids have uniquely symmetrical properties. Everyline is the same length. Every face is the same shape. Every internal angle isthe same number of degrees. And each of the five shapes will fit perfectlyinside a sphere, where each of its points contact the edge of the sphereprecisely if they are of the same approximate width.[../images/image-002.jpg]The Platonic Solids: Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Icosahedron, andDodecahedronOne fascinating chapter in Anti-Gravity and the World Grid was from the NewZealand scientist Bruce Cathie, who analyzed many hundreds of UFO sightingreports and concluded that they were always traveling along the same “gridlines.” Cathie eventually expanded these lines into a worldwide pattern, whichdescribed a cube inside the Earth, superimposed over its surface. That wasextremely fascinating in light of Hoagland’s discussions of tetrahedralgeometry, particularly since Hawaii was at the magical 19.5-degree point. Thetetrahedron was definitely at work on the Earth, as noted by the position ofHawaii, but now it appeared that the energy pattern of the cube needed to beconsidered as well. Yet you could very easily draw a cube around a tetrahedron.The tetrahedron fit perfectly inside a cube and happened to fill exactlyone-third of its volume.THE BERMUDA TRIANGLEI was even more amazed by the work of Ivan T. Sanderson, which was featured in achapter written by William Becker and Bethe Hagens in David Childress’s book.Sanderson began studying airplanes and ocean vessels that had vanished without atrace. Although skeptics might not think there is any credibility to thisphenomenon, once you actually do the research, you discover that there are nothundreds but thousands of mysterious vanishings in the historical record. Planesare flying along in cloudless skies with clear radar and radio contact, only tosuddenly vanish, with no distress calls, no traces of oil slick or floatingdebris on the ocean’s surface, nor any visible wreckage on the seafloor. In somecases, multiple rescue planes out looking for the original missing pilot hadalso vanished without a single trace. In many other cases, ships are sailingalong in clear seas and then suddenly disappear—or are found intact, with foodstill cooking, but everyone on board has mysteriously vanished. Every timeSanderson found an incident like this, he marked it with a pushpin on his map.As his map kept building, almost every incident clustered into one of ten pointsacross the Earth’s surface. The Bermuda Triangle is only one of these ten pointsbut is by far the most well-known of all, thanks to mass-media publicity from agroundbreaking and bestselling book by Charles Berlitz entitled The BermudaTriangle.8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber38]These ten points were all equidistant from each other, and if you also added inthe North and South Poles, they were perfectly aligned with the other points.Now you have a total of twelve equidistant vortex zones. If you playconnect-the-dots between these twelve points, you will see the sacred geometryof the icosahedron, one of the five basic Platonic solids. It seemed very clearthat this invisible icosahedral geometry was just as important as thetetrahedral geometry, at least on Earth. The geometry was now trulyhyperdimensional, being our main key to unlock the mysteries of “portal” travelthrough space and time. It was quite amazing that an independent researcher likeIvan Sanderson had discovered this on his own. I felt it was worthy of a NobelPrize and should have endowed his name with as much historical significance asGalileo, Newton, or Copernicus. I would only find out years later that thesesame vortex points were very well known to exist within classified militaryscience programs that were actively using them, such as by building militarybases at each available nexus point.Sanderson’s discoveries made the geometry far more mysterious than it alreadywas. In Hoagland’s case, the geometry was creating giant atmospheric storms andvolcanoes. Now this invisible geometry, at certain times, was causing largeobjects to completely disappear, along with their human passengers. Where didthese people go? Were they still alive? Did they travel to some other world? Didthey leap forward or backward in time? Airplanes would just vanish out of thesky if they flew through these points but, for some reason, only at certaintimes. Ships could be sailing the seas, with everyone feeling fine one minute,only to have completely vanished without a trace the next—right as they sailedthrough one of these “Devil’s Graveyards” on Earth.TIME SLIPSWilliam Becker and Bethe Hagens had found other cases of “time slips” that wouldoccur right along these same “grid nodes” and “grid lines.” An entire plane fullof people might jump ahead in time, finding their watches ten minutes behindeveryone else’s. There was also a compelling suggestion that prehistoriccreatures such as dinosaurs occasionally wandered into these vortexes and jumpedahead through millions of years to our own time. This provided possibleexplanations for phenomena like the Loch Ness Monster, medieval dragons, thelegend of the phoenix, the image of a stegosaurus carved into an ancientCambodian temple, and other such reports. If any of this was true, then it meantthat we have “natural stargates” on Earth that can send us shooting throughspace and time or into completely alternate realities and dimensions. It againlooked as if we had an amazing new frontier of science waiting for us. If wecould fully identify and understand how this geometry worked with the Earth, wemight be able to harness its power to create our own stargates, and travelthrough space at faster-than-light speeds, as the extraterrestrials alreadyappeared to be doing. Best of all, we might be able to conquer the mostoutrageous scientific paradox of all—the mystery of genuine time travel.A WORLDWIDE MAP FOR ALL GIANT STONE MONUMENTSBecker and Hagens didn’t stop with Ivan Sanderson’s grid. The story became evenmore intriguing when the Russian team of Goncharov, Morozov, and Makarov gotinvolved after Sanderson published his results. The Russians contemplated thefact that you can turn the icosahedron inside out to get what is called itsgeometric dual, or inverse, known as the dodecahedron. This is now a shape thathas twelve faces, where each face is a five-sided pentagon. Overall, it lookslike a soccer ball. It is perhaps the most beautiful and mysterious of all thePlatonic solids since it is the only one that is made out of pentagons.When the Russians took the shape of the dodecahedron and superimposed it overthe Earth, in its exact inverse position to the icosahedron, they had an amazingdiscovery. Somehow, every single pyramid, monolith, stone circle, and“megalithic” stone formation on Earth was built right on one of the lines ofthis “icosa-dodeca” grid. The Russians had found a whopping thirty-three hundredstone structures that fit on the grid. Not one pyramid or giant stone monumentwas found in a location that was not crossed by the grid. How could this bepossible? These ancient formations were believed to have been built by culturescompletely isolated from one another. The pyramids in Egypt had smoother designsthan the ones in Mesoamerica, which were built in layers that looked like giantstaircases. Now we find out that every single stone formation, on everycontinent except Antarctica, is built according to a unified, worldwide pattern?This suggests that everyone who built pyramids was very well aware of thisGlobal Grid, and that it may indeed have been a worldwide effort by a single,unified group of people.As I thought about this even more, I realized that the energy from this gridcould have somehow given the creators of these monuments an antigravity forcethat could be used to levitate the huge stones. The mysterious, invisible linesof the Global Grid may have been creating an energy that not only could causeships and planes to disappear but could cause stone to become lighter—if you hadthe right technology to manipulate it. Perhaps these people could not levitatethe stones unless the stones were already on one of the grid lines. At the veryleast, it might require far more energy and difficulty for them to levitate anystones that were not on the Global Grid. This was truly fascinating stuff, andas far as I could tell, no one else was asking these questions or connectingthese dots. Yet, whoever had built the pyramids was obviously well aware of thislost, ancient science. There was simply no denying what the Russians haddiscovered. The answer was openly visible for those who chose to look.Becker and Hagens took the Russian grid and connected all the points by addingsome extra lines. This formed what they called the Becker-Hagens Grid. Now theyhad a geometric object with 120 different triangles on it, superimposed over theEarth. Once they added in these extra lines, magical things started to happen. Ispent many, many hours staring at the Becker-Hagens Grid diagram and meditatingon it. The more I looked at it, the more I realized that the Earth itself wasbeing structured and shaped by this grid. Australia was perfectly positionedbetween two nodes and their surrounding lines. South America fit preciselywithin a triangular pattern of lines that tightly hugged its overall shape. AndBecker and Hagens pointed out that the entire Mid-Atlantic Volcanic Ridge, agigantic mountain range at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, was in perfectalignment with the Global Grid in that area. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge continued instraight lines, made distinct angular turns, and then went on in additionalstraight lines, and its path was precisely the same as the Global Grid. Therewere far too many correlations to be random chance, and once you started lookingat them, it was all very obvious. The grid was real.VIBRATING FLUIDS CREATE GEOMETRIC PATTERNSAnd sure enough, as the crop circles continued appearing year after year, theymade it very obvious that we needed to look at all five of the Platonic solidsfor answers, not just the tetrahedron. This became particularly clear in 1999,when three different English crop circles clearly indicated a cube inside asphere: Honey Street on July 16, Wimpole Hall on July 23, and West KennettLongbarrow on August 4.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber39] The crop circles alsohad certain formations that appeared to illustrate the activity of sound wavesrippling through water, or some similar liquid. For example, in 2001, we haveKexbrough on August 2, Keresforth Hill on August 12, and West Stowell on August15, with a very similar formation again at West Stowell on August 15 of thefollowing year.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber40] I eventually discovered thework of Dr. Hans Jenny, initially in a book entitled Cymatics, and finally Ifelt I understood how this geometry might be forming. Jenny showed that thesesame geometric patterns would naturally appear in fluids, as if by magic.Jenny’s experiment started with tiny particles floating in water, where thesolution just looks like a milky liquid. However, once he vibrated the waterwith certain “pure” sound frequencies, like what you hear when playing the whitekeys on the piano, something amazing happened. The particles in the watermysteriously arranged into beautiful geometric patterns that remained stable aslong as he kept playing the sound. Instead of milky-white water, now he sawwhite lines where the geometries are located while everything else is dark, withno floating particles at all. All he had to do to get these amazing designs wasto play single, sustained sound tones into the liquid, such as by singing. Thegeometric patterns that were formed by this process included the Platonicsolids. Therefore, the Platonic solids were obviously visual representations ofvibration. They were crystallized sounds, in a sense. We don’t normally think ofour own voices as creating sacred geometric patterns, but as we move throughdifferent syllables at different pitches, we see different geometric shapescoming and going if we measure them with a liquid solution like Jenny was using.THE LAW OF ONE TIED IT ALL TOGETHERThese are just a few of the many scientific mysteries that I uncovered duringthat time, as I began intensively researching this subject with the newly foundpower of the Internet. The more I read, the more I discovered. I was totallyaddicted and spent every waking minute of every day in full pursuit of this newknowledge. In other books, I have described the importance of the Law of Oneseries and of dreams in assisting this investigation. However, I never went intovery much detail about how all of this happened. I began reading the Law of Onematerial in January 1996, three years after I had begun intensively researchingUFOs and hyperdimensional physics. By the time I read The Law of One, I feltthat I had made a variety of unique and original discoveries. I was quitesurprised to discover that these discoveries were already featured in the Law ofOne material. In fact, the Law of One model was vastly more advanced thananything I had come up with on my own. This strongly enhanced my confidence thatI had come in contact with an authentic source of higher-dimensionalinformation.My path to discovering the Law of One series in January 1996 is a fascinatingstory in and of itself. Increasingly stunning synchronicities and dreamexperiences led me to read the Law of One. I was very interested when I readSession 14, Question 25, where the source was asked how the Law of Oneinformation was normally communicated to the people of Earth. The answer was, inpart, “We have used channels such as this one, but in most cases the channelsfeel inspired by dreams and visions without being aware, consciously, of ouridentity or existence.”11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber41] As we have discussed,I began writing down my dreams every day in September 1992, and after years ofdedicated effort, I eventually learned how to decipher the dream language. In sodoing, I was able to tap into a much more highly advanced source of spiritualguidance than anything else I had available at the time.A WEALTH OF NEW DREAM DATAI fought very hard for many years to have my work taken seriously by the UFOcommunity. In the midst of that struggle, I was so busy that I never actuallywent back and reread any of the dreams I had written in notebooks between 1992and 1996 before I switched over to typing my dreams into the computer. It wasonly after I put this book together that I realized I needed to thoroughlyreview the entire body of material. In so doing, I found a wealth of informationthat I had otherwise completely forgotten about in all my previous writings,lectures, and videos on this subject. Even more outrageously, the dreams I wasreading from as far back as 1992 had many direct and obvious references to myown present as I was writing this book in 2019. The dreams somehow knew exactlywhere I would be living, who I would be living with, and what various objectsaround my house would look like, as well as describing a wide variety ofsituations I was dealing with at the time. There is no logical way that any ofthis could have happened unless consciousness itself somehow exists outside oftime.It definitely appeared that some part of me knew that 2019 would be the firsttime I would go back and reread these notebooks. A period of up to twenty-sevenyears obviously posed no boundary whatsoever to this effect manifesting itselfin my dreams. I remembered writing down these dreams in many cases when theyfirst came in, and had no idea that they would be describing events that wouldhappen many years in my future, with such astonishing clarity. This phenomenonhas caused me to meditate very deeply on concepts like destiny and free will. Icall this the time-loop phenomenon, and it would take literally an entire bookto properly document how many of these time loops I had while rereading my oldnotebooks and writing this book in 2019. However, the time-loop phenomenon hasoccurred all throughout my work, ever since it started, and I will provideplenty of intriguing examples of this phenomenon as we go on. Even before Istarted doing psychic readings in 1996, I had several mind-blowing examples ofdreams predicting my own immediate future that I rediscovered while doing theresearch for this book. The time-loop phenomenon became far more direct andunavoidable after I began dictating entire paragraphs of information in EdgarCayce–style readings as of November 1996. I used the protocols of remote viewingto ensure that my conscious mind was not tampering with the data beyond aminimal level.Some people love the scientific discussions, such as those I briefly touchedupon in the preceding chapters, and would feel cheated if I didn’t mention themin a book. Others may have already lost interest by this point, and may only behanging on by a thread or otherwise have already put the book down. If you havemade it this far, congratulations! The rest of this book is not going to focuson these types of scientific arguments, since I have already done the best I cando to present them in previous volumes and other creative works. The reason Itook two chapters to present you with the science I was studying at the time isto help you understand how amazed I was when I started reading the Law of Oneseries. I discovered that these exact same scientific concepts and ideas hadalready been presented in this mysterious five-volume book series that waswritten between 1981 and 1983. In fact, the Law of One had a vastly moreelaborate understanding of the science I had discovered than I had been able topiece together on my own. This gave my research a quantum upgrade and answeredcountless thousands of questions I would otherwise have never thought to ask.Yet, at its core, the Law of One is fundamentally a work of philosophy andspiritual guidance. The source stresses the importance of the positive,service-to-others mind-set above all else.The study of my earliest recorded dreams is new and quite fascinating,particularly after I discovered so many forgotten examples in my notebooks. Wewill see how a variety of concepts I would later discover in the Law of Oneseries, and from various insiders, was being presented to me through the dreamspace. The dreams also gave me a dramatic sneak preview of the concept ofAscension. I have had hundreds of dreams with breathtaking, incredibly powerfulscenes that could easily translate into gorgeous cinematic sequences. We willsee how these dreams guided me through a profound personal and spiritual healingprocess to prepare me for the work that would still lie ahead—and for my ownpotential Ascension. Now that I have had many hundreds of accurate futureprophecies demonstrated to me over a twenty-seven-year period, I have no reasonto doubt the Ascension prophecies. The most exciting prophecies, of course, arethe ones that haven’t come true yet—and that’s why I wrote this book.As you read these various dreams and how I analyze them, you will quickly beginlearning the language. This will provide a very useful tool for you to harnessthe power of your dreams for higher guidance. In Session 86, Question 7, the Lawof One series said that once you start working heavily on your spiritualevolution, becoming what they call an “adept,” you will find that, in thesource’s words, “dreaming becomes the most important tool” to enhance yourspiritual growth. That is about as marvelous an endorsement as anyone could everask for, given that the Law of One series has formed the spiritual andscientific backbone for my entire career and all previous works—and it fits withmy own experience. You can also have direct contact with your own spiritualguides in dreams. As the source said: “While the so-called conscious mind rests,this adept may call upon those which guide it, those presences which surroundit, and, most of all, the magical personality, which is the higher self.”12[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber42]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENPROPHETIC MYSTERIES FROM A FELLOW SEEKERIn the first month after I got sober, I had multiple dreams that I did not writedown, then I awoke from a recurring nightmare that I had started using marijuanaagain. The first dream I actually did write down in a notebook was on October23, 1992, just over a month after my sobriety started. In this dream, I hadinherited a very large room that I could decorate or design however I chose. Ithad a true wealth of space and an unusually high ceiling. However, the room wastotally bleak and colorless. Everything was either concrete-gray or white. Thewalls needed to be repaired and painted.An interesting, peaceful person standing beside me told me I could try hangingcolorful parachutes from the ceiling to brighten up the space. This person toldme that my new space would be only as nice as the energy I decided to put intoits creation. Looking back on it now, this dream was obviously talking about howdepressed and unhappy I was at the time. The sad condition of the roomrepresented my psychological state at the time. I had just given up a drug habitthat had become the focal point of my life. I needed to invest time andattention in myself, and find more ways where I could be happy and add colorsinto my life.LUCID DREAMS AND TIME LOOPSThe next morning, October 24, 1992, I broke through and had a lucid dream. Inthis case, the loud, brash, and controversial rock and roll singer Meat Loaf hadsome sort of bizarre magic power. He was able to transform a range of fur peltsinto ferocious, live animals. He then directed these animals to attack me. Atfirst, I was terrified, but then I realized how ridiculous the whole thing was.Fur pelts do not transform back into living animals. I remembered StephenLaBerge’s teachings about testing my reality for strange things that wereclearly impossible, and this was an obvious example. Right then, I realized Ihad to be dreaming, and I became lucid. My brother, father, and grandfather werethere with me, and I started trying to explain to them that all this was adream. None of them wanted to listen to me. I then went after Meat Loaf, for Iknew I had to stop him from making the monsters. I concentrated and hit him witha blast of energy, using my hands to shape the energy into a beam. Heimmediately shrank down to half his original size. I blasted him three moretimes until he could fit in a mayonnaise jar that I suddenly manifested in myhand. I put him in the jar, where he no longer posed a threat to me, and coveredthe jar with a lid that I screwed on. He banged on the glass with his fists andI could hear his muffled voice.At this point, I again tried to convince the men of my family that we wereactually all in a dream. They did not want to believe me, even after what theyjust saw. I held up my hand and added an extra finger to show them someadditional proof. They clearly saw this, but were still not impressed. At thispoint, I felt that if no one would believe me, I at least needed to write downwhat had happened to me in this dream. I manifested a notebook and a pen. AfterI finished writing some basic notes, I went back to read them, and they were allin perfect French. This was well beyond my conscious ability to speak and writeFrench, yet as I read it, I somehow knew that the language, grammar, andspelling were perfect.Amazingly, after I reread the dream for the first time while writing this bookin August 2019, I had quite the time loop. I walked outside to my back porch inColorado and a beaver pelt was sitting there on the patio. This genuinelyshocked me. As it turned out, my wife had carried this with her for many yearsas one of her shamanic tools. She was going through her closet and noticed thatthe beaver pelt had become infested with moths. She had placed the pelt outsidein the hope that the moths would fly away before she put it in the freezer tokill any eggs, and it had since gotten rained on. She had no idea that I wasabout to read a dream where fur pelts just like this were being turned back intolive, aggressive animals.The very next dream in my journal from 1992 had another time loop to my present.In this dream, I was seeing a series of stylized ice-like rocks that werepolished smooth, round, and nearly clear in some parts. Each of them had designscarved into them that looked like peace signs. In the dream, the rocks werebeing grown in a Pyrex glass jar with a chemical solution and a stirring rod.The crystals could be grown to whatever size you wanted them to be, based on howlong you left them in the solution. In my waking life in 2019, my wife,Elizabeth, had just purchased a carved crystal that looked almost exactly thesame as these polished stones in the dream. My wife’s new crystal was made of awhitish, icy material and was smooth and round, about two inches wide. Thesurface of the crystal was carved with the image of the Hindu Sri Yantramandala. My dream from 1992 had the exact same objects, except that the carvingin the dream was a simpler-looking peace sign. Otherwise, the objects werepractically identical—yet my wife had just bought the crystal and brought ithome a couple of days before. She had no idea about this dream when she boughtthe crystal, and neither did I.The next dream I wrote down in my notebook was from November 1, 1992. In it, Imet up with a group of Koreans and began falling in love with a particularwoman. This was two solid years before I got together with my Japanesegirlfriend Yumi in 1994. Now, in 2019, I was able to see that it was clearly aprophetic dream—I just didn’t realize it at the time. Near the end of November1992, on Thanksgiving Day, I had yet another dream in which I had an Asiangirlfriend.On November 3, 1992, I had a dream in which I again achieved lucidity. In thiscase, the lucidity happened as I was seeing one fantastic-looking UFO afteranother flying past me in the sky. Bear in mind that my insider NASA disclosurewould not appear until three months after this point. Consciously, I did not yetknow whether or not UFOs were real. However, in this experience, I was seeingsuch fantastically wonderful crafts that I knew I could not be living in wakingreality—I had to be dreaming. After I became lucid, I wished for the UFOs tobecome more and more magnificent, and they did just that. Wonders flew past myeyes. Huge, gargantuan, and ridiculously sophisticated ships roared by. Theywere all sleek, white, and very high tech. Some of them were of almostimpossible size. This dream was a total flashback to the many awe-inspiring UFOdreams I had when I was young, and helped to prepare me for my NASA disclosurethree months later.That same December, once I was back in my hometown, I had an incredibleexperience that I documented in both The Synchronicity Key and The AscensionMysteries. I looked up at the sky after having a huge fight with my formerfriends, who had not gotten sober and doubted my new spiritual insights. I toldthe universe that I knew I was here for a spiritual purpose. Right then, ashooting star streaked through the exact part of the sky I was looking at. Ahuge surge of energy rose up from the Earth through my entire body, causing meto heave in ecstasy. Shortly after I returned to school the following semester,I got my NASA disclosure. I was much too interested in my UFO research at thispoint to write down any of my dreams. I didn’t pick it up again until thesummer, now in the year 1993. Most of those dreams were clearly demonstratingthe tension I was feeling with my mother and her live-in boyfriend at the time.There did not appear to be any UFO or Ascension-related themes of significanceat the time.A PERSONAL CRISIS LEADS TO RELIGIOUS STUDIESIn the fall semester of 1993, as I began my junior year, I migrated fromCrispell Hall, the “study dorm” where we had three rooms that all opened outinto an adjoining suite, to Bouton Hall, a dorm where everyone’s room openedonto a commonly shared hallway. My hallway had one bathroom with a series ofshowers and stalls that the entire corridor of guys had to share. Bouton Hallwas considered the artists’ dorm. It was right next to the art building, and Ienjoyed being around creative people. I found myself living in room 111, andagain laughed at the synchronicity of my room number.I ended up living with a roommate who was a member of a campus group calledSCUM, short for Student Coalition for Universal Medievalism. His main passion inlife was to be a Dungeon Master for the Dungeons and Dragons board game, whichhas now been greatly popularized by the hit Netflix show Stranger Things. Myroommate had created an entire world for his fellow players to explore. Everymeeting they had was in our room, and it would go on for hours. This greatlyimpacted my sense of private space, and my roommate and I were not gettingalong. I had no interest in the dark themes of Dungeons and Dragons, and myroommate soon began giving me the silent treatment for days on end. He also didpassive-aggressive things like putting water in my bed, and even sculpted apointy, dagger-like object out of gray clay and hung it on the ceiling rightover my pillow.Our room itself was barely more than twelve feet wide, and we had to share abunk bed. For many days, I felt a great sense of personal crisis from what washappening, and decided that I needed to start reading spiritual literatureinstead of UFO books to try to find some higher guidance on what I should do. Iended up reading the Hindu Bhagavad-Gita; the Dhammapada or Buddha’s Book ofRighteousness; a book by the Dalai Lama entitled A Flash of Lightning in theDark of Night; a book by Thomas Merton entitled Zen and the Birds of Appetite;and the Wilhelm-Baynes version of the I Ching textbook.After reading all these works, I realized that the key to solving my problem hadto involve compassion and forgiveness. I opened up to my roommate and beganhaving long conversations with him in which all I did was ask him questionsabout himself. I got deeply involved in his personal issues and helped him workthrough his problems and frustrations. I used many of the tools I was practicingin my suicide hotline internship. With this strategy, I was able to turn a veryupsetting situation into a pleasant friendship, so we were able to get alongjust fine for the rest of the year. This became a key experience in teaching mehow to get along with other people, even if I didn’t initially agree with them.I spent as many waking hours as possible doing UFO and paranormal research whiledoing just enough work for my classes to make sure I had decent grades. I wasconsistently meditating on the Hyperdimensional Model, and I was always readingfour or five different books at once. At the same time, I was having incrediblesynchronicity experiences, usually on a daily basis. Although I did not writedown any of my dreams during this time, I created entire books’ worth oftypewritten personal journals. This included a regular catalog of interestingand bizarre synchronicities that were happening to me as I worked my way throughhundreds of books.I shared what I was studying with my roommate, at least to whatever degree hewas willing to listen. At the end of the year, he let me know that he was movingback to his hometown. He ended up marrying his high school sweetheart, whom hehad left behind to go to school and have other girlfriends. He gave up on allthe Dungeons and Dragons material and actually became a Christian minister.Although he never told me that I had any influence on these things happening, Icertainly suspected that my influence had been of key importance in getting himonto a spiritual path.A FELLOW SEEKERI ended up reaching out to my friend Artie, who was a year younger than me, andasking him if he wanted to room with me for my senior year. He gladly said yes.Artie was shorter than me, with thinning blond hair, a sensitive jawline, andglasses with very thick lenses. He obviously had a genius-level IQ. He had grownup in Connecticut, a tiny, affluent state just a short drive from New York City.Artie was very interested in my UFO research and would listen to me talk aboutit for however long I felt like sharing. He and I had been friends since thebeginning of my junior year. I met him through my buddy Adam, who played guitarin my Chamber Jazz Ensembles band while I was the drummer. The only times Artiewould interrupt my grand cosmic summaries of the books I was reading would be toask questions, and he was hanging on every word.I was utterly fascinated with Artie’s life story as well—and this was admittedlya major part of why I asked him to move in with me. As best I could tell at thetime, both of Artie’s parents were involved in a terrifying and very secretivecult that was somehow connected with the government, secret societies, blackmagic, military defense contractors, and the reverse-engineering of UFO-relatedtechnology. Artie’s mother ended up taking her own life when Artie was sevenyears old, and his father disappeared under very mysterious circumstances whenhe was ten. Artie was told his father had died, but as we will see, this mayvery well not be the case. Artie then was lucky enough to be raised by a normalwoman who happened to be a friend of his mother’s, along with her husband. Artiehad never met his new mother until the day she assumed guardianship.Later in life, Artie started having brief but very disturbing memory flashes,which he told his wife about. I remember hearing him tell me about this samememory at some point back in college, but at the time, it was very mysterious tome. Artie could vaguely remember being taken somewhere in the middle of thenight. Once he arrived at the destination, he saw people wearing animal masks.Some of the masks had antlers or horns, and the masks depicted different animalslike an elk or a moose. The men were wearing suit jackets and regular neckties.The women were wearing elegant dresses. When I asked him what he was feeling atthe time, he said he was scared—actually petrified. His brother was also therein his memory, and he asked his brother about it several years ago, as of thetime of this writing. His brother obviously didn’t want to talk about it, saying“I don’t remember that,” while acting very agitated. Artie then tried to talk tohim about it on one additional occasion, and his brother said, “I don’t rememberthat at all. No, no, no.” He again was very agitated and immediately changed thesubject.When I spoke to him for this book, Artie had again started to remember briefflashes of the experience after waking up from a very weird and disturbing dreamin which someone was trying to hurt him. Then a few months after I interviewedhim, he uncovered a new memory of an elderly man sexually abusing him at thissame party while his parents stood by and did nothing to stop it. Whether welike it or not, there are many insiders who have come forward to report nearlyidentical-sounding trauma, which psychologists refer to as ritual abuse. Memoryloss is clinically referred to by psychologists as dissociation, and this typeof amnesia is another extremely common element in these whistleblower reports.Once I began learning about this dark universe in 2000. through the writings ofan insider named Svali, I realized that Artie’s story fit perfectly with what Iwas now learning much more about. He may have forgotten what happened to him,but many others have not—and a fair number of them have been quite public abouttheir experiences. Stanley Kubrick’s movie Eyes Wide Shut was one of the mostprominent efforts to expose and publicize this dark aspect of our society, andthe disturbing Epstein story has greatly increased public awareness of thisproblem.As best I could tell, Artie was able to escape whatever nightmare his parentshad been involved in after both of them allegedly died. I presented him with mytheory while we were roommates. I knew there was something terrifying hidingbehind his story, and he has since dedicated his entire life to trying to figureit out. Much of what he may have gone through is still an absolute mystery tohim. I called him up as I was finishing this book in 2019, clarifying manydetails of what he had told me, and got some new information that adds shockingnew elements to the mystery. I have noticed that when people are lying andmaking up stories, they usually like to connect all the dots so everything makessense. In Artie’s story, a wealth of puzzle pieces needed to be put together,and he himself had no idea how they fit. Yet this data aligns extremely wellwith what I have learned from many other insiders over the years, as well asthrough my private research into the so-called Illuminati and the Secret SpaceProgram.PSYCHIATRIC EXPERIMENTS AT THE ORPHANAGEArtie’s parents met each other while they were children, living in an orphanagethat was run by a secret society similar to the Freemasons. The orphanagepublicly referred to itself as a boarding school. Artie’s father was transferredto the orphanage when he was still a small child, after his own father died in atragic fire. If your father was a member of this society and he passed away, youwould then be taken to live at the boarding school, since there was noDepartment of Children and Families at the time. You and your mother would thenparticipate in “studies” and “experiments” that were done at a psychiatricfacility on the campus. Considering everything that we now know, this almostcertainly involved mind-control techniques.Artie had to work very hard to find any information about the psychiatricbuilding, which was torn down after his parents grew up. The boarding school hada significant partnership back in the 1930s through 1950s with a majoruniversity in the area. Artie suspected that after the kids left the school,they were still being studied by the psychiatrists and whoever they were reallyworking for, but at that point, it was done more covertly than overtly. Artiewas so intrigued by the mysteries of his parents’ past that he ended up going towork at this same boarding school for many years as an adult, helping the kidswho were living there. Nothing too strange ever happened to him, but he didgather some very significant new clues. In addition, he was placed in the exactsame room that had been his father’s bedroom growing up. No one told him thisand it took him years to find out.By talking to people who had worked there while both of his parents grew up inthe orphanage, Artie found out that a psychiatrist would come in a couple oftimes a week to work with the kids and give them various pharmaceutical drugs.One woman who still worked there remembered that Artie’s mom would get takenaway at times to go to the “hospital,” as they called it. On a number of theseoccasions, she wouldn’t be brought back to her room until the next day.If we compare the possible experiences of Artie’s mother to the whistleblowerSvali’s very extensive written testimonials, some of which are preserved atsvalispeaks.wordpress.com, it is entirely possible, even likely, that Artie’smother went through many, many hours of very specialized training. According toSvali, the group calling themselves the “Illuminati” has “Six Branches ofLearning” that every member is trained in to varying degrees, depending upontheir proclivities. The Six Branches are Sciences, Military, Government,Leadership, Scholarship, and Spiritual.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber43]Similarly, if you are working on a Regional Leadership Council, which ranksbelow the National and World levels, you have Military, Spiritual, Scholarship,Finances, Training, and Sciences as your six main divisions.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44] Government is notably missing at these lowerlevels.To explore the Six Branches of Learning sequentially, first we have Sciences,which focuses on the study and practice of mind control. This is the branch thatSvali was allegedly a member of. Each group member must endure hours and hoursof very torturous mind-control programs, and members of the Sciences branchstudy these techniques and administer the protocols. According to Svali, if anordinary person were put through these techniques without formal training, theycould be so traumatized that they would either die from a heart attack or have acomplete mental breakdown and require permanent hospitalization. All members aregiven drugs that put them into a highly suggestive state, with effects similarto LSD but of shorter duration, and are then deeply hypnotized. Variousprogramming commands are introduced, such as with “training films” and verbalkeywords, while electric shocks cause extraordinary trauma to the body withoutvisible or lasting physical damage.The goal of these programs is to cause the mind to splinter, and to then programthese fragments of the personality and ensure they remain in place over timewith so-called tune-ups. If this process is performed before the age of threeand a half, the person can develop a “core split” where there will be completelyalternative identities that they have no conscious awareness of, protected by anamnesic barrier. These identities can then be called up through the use ofcertain code phrases. Orphanages like the ones Artie’s mother and father grew upin can be used to administer these programs on children without the prying eyesof parents. Both versions of the movie The Manchurian Candidate, 1964 and 2004,reveal key aspects of how this technique, known as MKULTRA, or Mind-KontrolUltra, actually works. It can be used to create programmable assassins who haveno memory of having killed someone afterward. There are apparently manydifferent examples of these assets being deployed throughout recent history,including Sirhan Sirhan, who assassinated Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968.In the second category, Military, you dress up in uniforms, such as German Nazioutfits from World War II, and are trained in firearms, bomb-making ofimprovised explosive devices, assassination techniques, surveillance, settingtraps, stalking, and riot control. Military can also include espionage tactics,including how to “drop a tag” and evade capture if someone is following you. Thethird category, Leadership, cultivates members with the skills necessary to be apublic figure and influence how others think, such as by being the CEO of amajor corporation. The fourth category, Government, is self-explanatory, whereyou learn the skills to obtain a law degree and how all the different aspects ofgovernance must function. Leadership is a separate category from Governmentbecause in addition to training CEOs, Leadership may also prepare people forcareers as actors, musicians, news anchors, and the like, where they are taughtto remain loyal to this group’s hidden agenda. There is apparently anEntertainment subcategory within Leadership.The fifth category, Scholarship, focuses on academic subjects that revolvearound the hidden history of the organization. These members stage andparticipate in plays where historical events that are important to the group,but otherwise overlooked by or unknown to the general public, are acted out inthese secret meetings. Scholarship may also focus on the academic study ofnations, corporations, and/or social structures the group intends to understand,in order to assist with efforts to infiltrate and control them. This can includetraining spies who learn languages fluently so they can physically infiltratethe desired countries.The final, sixth category, Spiritual, focuses on practices that include thedeliberate cultivation of out-of-body experiences to gather information that isotherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. This supposedly also includes “timetravel,” where a practitioner apparently enters the mind of someone in the pastwho is vulnerable, such as a drunk hobo passed out in a haystack. Apparentlywith enough training, a practitioner can occupy that person’s body andpotentially get them to commit murders that may eliminate people who the groupdislikes in the present. If a person performs this “edit” successfully, theworld ends up on a different timeline, and only the practitioner remembers theversion of history that happened before. According to Svali, this was dramatizedin the movie The Matrix, where the Agents were able to occupy the bodies ofanyone within the Matrix and then get them to commit murders. This plot point isalso the key feature of the X-Men movie Days of Future Past from 2014, whereWolverine travels back in time to 1973 in order to prevent a destructive eventfrom ever taking place.I understand how outrageous this sounds, and again, as various insiders havetold me over the years, it doesn’t matter whether you believe this is true ornot. These people absolutely do believe this works, and they are “as serious asa heart attack” about it. Svali also says these out-of-body practices are veryhard on the physical body, and cause the person to age more quickly, such as bycausing their hair to turn gray at an earlier age than normal. The Spiritualbranch also designs and conducts very disturbing ritual ceremonies like the oneArtie had brief flashes of experiencing as a boy, where everyone was wearingmasks. These ceremonies can feature elaborate black magic rites conveying veryspecific spiritual practices.Of course, at the time Artie was telling me about his parents, I did not knowany of this, but when I began reading Svali’s testimony in 2000, many dots beganconnecting. Artie met another alumni at the orphanage who joked about how he hadheard that some kids would get taken into the sewer systems underground at thissame facility. Artie later discovered that one of the older homes on the campushad a door downstairs that was always locked, and a maintenance worker told himthat it was an entrance to the sewer system. This may very well have been usedas a ceremonial space.ONCE AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT . . .As an adult, Artie attended a highly fundamentalist Christian church inConnecticut for several years. He was very freaked out about his mysterious anddisturbing childhood memories, and found comfort in the Christian faith. Duringthis time, Artie met a fellow parishioner who had served as an Army Ranger andGreen Beret, worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, and knew Artie’sfather. This was how Artie found out that after leaving the boarding school, hisfather joined the military, entered Army Intelligence, and served during theVietnam War. His job was to perform logistics, which is to covertly infiltratevarious locations, sketch out detailed maps of their internal layout, and gethimself out of there undetected. This suggests that Artie’s father hadspecialized in the Military branch. Artie’s father would then bring the maps tohis superiors, who would use this information to conduct assassinations, rescueprisoners of war, or collect other valuable targets. One of my insiders workedin this exact operational specialty for many years.Logistics is difficult and dangerous work that involves the use of a vast arrayof spy skills and elite training that must be perfected over the course ofyears. This includes neutralizing anyone who tries to interfere with yourmission. According to many insiders I have spoken to, most operatives neverleave the intelligence community. Often, if one does try to leave this kind ofwork behind, they are haunted by PTSD. Memories come up that can cause them tospend all night sweating in bed, revved up with maximum adrenaline. Nothing inthe ordinary world ever feels exciting or important enough, and a formeroperative can spiral into a deep depression. If someone stays involved in thecommunity, however, their work generally gets more and more involved, and thepay goes higher and higher—they may well end up working directly with prominentsocial and political figures. Many of these agents take on seeminglynormal-looking cover assignments in what appear to be ordinary companies, whileactually continuing to work for the intelligence agencies. It is also possiblefor someone to begin in one agency and then get pulled into an even moreclandestine organization or division as they advance.Loyalty and skill are rewarded with positions of higher and higher influence andsignificance. The agents are sworn to secrecy and can never say a single word totheir families about what they are really doing; otherwise, their cover storycould easily fall apart. They just appear to be working a normal, boring job andare too emotionally unavailable to want to talk about it. The burden of all thishidden personal information often tears families to pieces. The family becomesan outsider group, and the agent can only develop true intimacy with his or herown immediate coworkers and superiors. I remember how my father always came homeeach night with at least one story about his work at General Electric while mybrother and I were growing up. It would have been highly bizarre if our fathercame home and never said a single word about his job, but this is the life thatthese intelligence agents must live.I had my suspicions about secret intelligence agencies and classifieddefense-contractor projects long before meeting Artie. My junior high friendKevin, who was one of the smartest kids in my grade, had parents who both workedfor a local nuclear power laboratory. They could not take him to work, nor couldthey tell him anything about what they were doing there. If they were everhaving a conversation about their work and Kevin came into the room, they wouldimmediately stop talking. They let Kevin know more than once that theyconsidered UFOs and ETs to be real, without saying why. They were very concernedabout the potential existence of extraterrestrial life, and considered it to bean incredibly dangerous situation. This opinion seemed to be a direct result ofvery specific information that they were given as part of their jobs, while manyother data points about benevolent, angelic extraterrestrial human life aredeliberately omitted. These programs are very highly compartmentalized, and eachworker is only told the exact amount of information he or she needs to properlydo their job. Kevin’s parents also talked quite a bit about wormholes andEinstein’s concept of a space-time continuum, where space and time areinterconnected, so as you move through space, you are also moving through time.According to one prominent insider I recently interviewed while writing thisbook, everyone who goes above a low- to midlevel position in the intelligencecommunity is very well aware that UFOs exist, that they crashed here, and thatwe have since built our own by studying and replicating how they work. We haveas many as 276 cities underground that can house up to 65,000 people each, aswell as a variety of off-planet bases to visit as you get into the more highlycompartmentalized programs. Once you enter that world, it is almost impossibleever to return to “surface life” on Earth again. I believe the main reason thisseems so hard to believe for most of us now is simply because we have been liedto for so long, to such an exraordinary degree. Since the Roswell crash, ourmilitary-industrial complex has had well over seventy years to study, analyze,and build their own working UFO prototypes.The Apollo missions achieved the seemingly impossible feat of putting a man onthe moon, but then we are supposed to believe that humanity got bored afterwardand simply gave up for fifty years? The dark side of the moon is a great placefor the military-industrial complex to build bases, since no one here could eversee them with a telescope, and the reverse-engineered antigravity craft we’vecreated have a technology called masking, which makes them invisible to thenaked eye in most cases. The only way you may be able to see them is if you usethe most advanced infrared night-vision technology. However, in that case, ifyou start actually getting good results and try to publicize them, you couldeasily receive threats. One of the whistleblowers I met from Dr. Steven Greer’sDisclosure Project in 2001, Dan Salter, was assigned to buy off or threatenpeople who knew and saw too much—often referred to as offering them gold orlead.THE ORGANIZATIONAfter his time in the military, Artie’s father worked at a scientificorganization and continued that job until his alleged death. For legal reasons,I will not share the name, so we will just call it “The Organization.” All Artieknew about this company was that they ran a bunch of automated machines, andthat his father apparently worked there as an “inspector.” Artie did once get tovisit his father’s office at The Organization. Some of the work areas were allcubicles and did not look very well kept. His father worked in a room that wasmuch better, with yellow floors, where the humidity and temperature had to beregulated. His father’s supposed boss said to him at the time, only half joking,“I think your dad’s office might be nicer than mine.” There were many scientificinstruments in his father’s office, including traditional microscopes and avariety of machines. One of them looked like the spectrometers Artie worked withat SUNY New Paltz.When I looked up The Organization online, I found that this company works withboth public corporations and private military groups. One part of TheOrganization serves as a defense contractor that builds carbon-fiber parts forthe aerospace industry. To me, that helped to answer many questions, because avariety of insiders have revealed that it is very common for defense contractorsto be involved in UFO-related black projects, designing classified aircraft thatare far more interesting than the Stealth bomber. Other parts of TheOrganization make products for the civilian sector. This very likely serves as acover business for their highly classified work. The Organization hascustom-designed unique products for many top Fortune 500 companies. TheOrganization also received awards from President Bill Clinton, President GeorgeW. Bush, and the Department of Commerce. It was bought out and taken private bya large equity firm within the last ten years, which means that now they mustanswer to no one but their own investors.When Artie was about twenty-four or twenty-five years old, he and his brothermet a man who had worked with his father at The Organization. The man reminiscedabout working together with Artie’s father on a project in Northampton,Massachusetts. Artie responded, “I thought you worked with him at TheOrganization in Connecticut?” The man had a shocked and worried look on hisface, and then immediately brushed it off and changed the subject. Artie’sbrother later joked with him about this. He said that maybe their father’s jobwas a cover story, and they were never told what he was really doing. Now thatwe know The Organization was an aerospace defense contractor, it makes perfectsense that Artie’s father was developing highly advanced classified technologyin that lab and elsewhere. This may also have been only one aspect of hisoverall work. I was also intrigued when Artie told me his father ended upjoining the same elite society that ran the boarding school he grew up in, andhis father was about to graduate into the highest rank within this societybefore his apparent death in 1986. This, again, is not the Freemasons, but asimilar and less well-known organization.THE BOY GENIUSKeeping all this in mind, Artie had some very interesting anomalies in hischildhood. His cousins remember him singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme songwhen he was only eighteen months old, and also being able to speak fluently.Artie had to wear reading glasses in first grade, and was too shy to read outloud. Once he finally did, he got moved from the lowest to the highest readingclass in a single day. Artie was a true child prodigy, almost at a savant levelof intelligence. As a boy, he could solve complex math problems in his headfaster than someone could process them with a calculator. Artie was somehow ableto multiply and divide five- or six-digit numbers this way, but after a fewyears, the ability mysteriously wore off, never to return.Artie’s mother supposedly had a job as a nurse, but she usually stayed home withhim, until her tragic death. He blocked out most of the memories of his motherfor reasons we will discuss. Artie read all her nursing textbooks when he wasonly four or five years old, and could give a full discourse on all the detailsof each phase of the human gestation process. If he didn’t know a word, he wouldlook it up in the dictionary. He also regularly researched things inencyclopedias, and read many different adult books on topics that interestedhim. His brother would go out and play with friends, but Artie usually wanted tostay home and read. He remembered his mother quizzing him on scientific topicsas a kid, even before he entered kindergarten. She asked him to describe, inspecific detail, what would occur in the blastula stage of development, thegastrula stage, and so on.In another strange incident, Artie rattled off something in Japanese when he wassix or seven years old, attending the second grade. His mother was still aliveat this point, and the event happened in their living room. His father wassitting in a rocking chair with a Corelle plate and was cutting something with aknife at the time. His father stared at Artie and said, “What did you say?” Hewas clearly freaked out. Artie did not respond. His father repeated thequestion, and Artie said, “I don’t know.” His father asked him again and Artierepeated the same answer. Then his father said, “How did you know that?” He wasgenuinely shocked. Tears started welling in Artie’s eyes. He didn’t know. Hesaid it just came out.Later on, in a meeting with his uncle, this incident came up in conversation.His uncle said that Artie’s father told him he had spoken in perfect Japanese.He spontaneously uttered a phrase that his father knew well from having servedin the military. This was another mystery, because his father supposedly servedin Vietnam, not Japan. However, in the world of defense logistics, anything ispossible. Artie had not seen or heard anything in his normal, waking life thatcould have taught him this phrase in Japanese. It is possible that Artie wentthrough training he does not consciously remember, such as in the Scholarshipbranch, where he was beginning to learn Japanese for anticipated future work.CONTACTEE EXPERIENCES—BUT FROM WHOM?I was particularly interested by two different stories Artie told from this timein his life. The first event took place when Artie was about four years old. Hehad a pair of Spider-Man Underoos, a type of underwear with a cartoon pattern,and a shirt that went along with it. He woke up in his bed and found that hisunderwear was now on backward, but not the shirt. He would never have put hisown underwear on backward, and there was no way this could have happened on itsown while he was sleeping. This mirrored many classic abduction and contacteestories I had been reading in a variety of books. As I was hearing this in 1994,I told him he may have been through some sort of medical exam, and whoever puthis clothes back on did not understand which way they needed to go. I had alsosuspected that I had been through similar experiences myself, based upon theintriguing clues I discussed earlier, like waking up in the middle of the nightin a trance, packing my bag, and walking out the side door of the house into thedark night, only to suddenly snap out of it.When Artie was in first grade, at about six years of age, he remembers seeing alarge, lighted object coming down in his yard outside. He vaguely rememberssleepwalking outside to take a look and see what it was. His parents saw himwalking along, and he told them he was going out to see that big ball of light.It did not appear that his parents saw the light like he did. I was the firstone to ever tell Artie that this sounded very much as if he had been throughsome sort of UFO contact and abduction experience. It also seemed to beintertwined with the weird things his mother and father were saying and doing.I speculated that there might be more to this story than extraterrestrials.Artie’s alleged UFO contacts could have been coming from some division ofwhatever strange group his parents seemed to be involved in. If you have readPart Two of The Ascension Mysteries, then you already know I spoke with manyinsiders who said that the military-industrial complex uses its own classifiedUFO-type craft to carry out its own abductions. These are often called militaryabductions, or MILABS. In an interview with Jenny McCarthy on the Jenny McCarthyShow of November 7, 2019, insider Corey Goode revealed details of his ownchildhood experience that appear to integrate very nicely with the clues fromArtie’s testimony. Here are two excerpts from the show, quoted in Corey’s ownwords:> MILABS stands for Military Abductions. Back during the days of MKULTRA, and> some of these other dark programs that we know about, there were a lot of> other programs that we don’t know about. They were seeking out youth,> preferably before seven years old, who had certain abilities. They would> discover those abilities in various ways, through testing in school,> standardized testing, and other ways. When they identified these children,> they would bring them into a program, like the Explorers program, [where]> instead of going to school, you would go to a museum or something like that.> [In my case,] they would take us instead to a military base in Fort Worth,> Texas, called Carswell Air Force Base at the time. There, during the day, they> would train us and exploit our gifts in different ways. They put us in a> program for ten years. At the end of those ten years, we would go into various> different programs. Some of them could be quite dark. The one that I happened> to be pulled into was the secret space program, where you served twenty years> in the secret space program.Corey went on to say that these programs deliberately looked for children whocame from troubled families that were less attentive to them. This made thechildren far more resilient to things that could traumatize most people, such asmeeting unfamiliar-looking extraterrestrial humanoid beings. These kids couldalso be picked up in their own backyards at night with craft that we would thinkof as UFOs. These craft could actually be operated by the clandestineorganization they were working with, and performing what would appear to mostpeople as a classic ET abduction. Artie’s reports of developing unusuallyadvanced, savant-level mathematical skills and then losing them is anotherperfect correlation with Corey’s testimony about MILABS. Here is another quotefrom Corey’s appearance with Jenny McCarthy, this time beginning at the 7:02mark, where he is describing the job he was trained to perform as an “intuitiveempath”:> Intuitive Empaths were very coveted. They take your natural ability and train> you with guru-type people and also scientists to help develop it. And then> they give you a serum that boosts this ability, but the drawback is that it> burns up your neurology. It overclocks your neurology. Intuitive Empaths would> be brought into things to detect danger or deception. We were used to> interface with various extraterrestrials. Oftentimes while the> [extraterrestrials] were being interrogated, they would have us sitting by and> analyzing what type of emotions, feelings and that type of thing they were> picking up, and what we thought was the agenda and the motive behind those> sorts of feelings. . . . Also, when you leave the program, they do a type of> mind-wipe. They call it blank-slating someone. That way, they send someone> back into normal life, and they don’t have the memories. But with intuitive> empaths, about three to five percent of them begin receiving the memories> again. They become very confused, have trauma, and have to put it all> together. The military tries to intervene when they see people who are> beginning to go through that process. . . . They will try to confuse them> more, get them committed, or blank-slate them again and hope the blank-slating> takes this time.Corey Goode has revealed it was well understood that certain human beings onEarth are extraterrestrial souls volunteering to be here, and usuallyconsciously unaware of this connection. However, these people will invariablyget positive contacts from their home group throughout their life, only to bere-abducted by a terrestrial military organization in each case. Theorganization debriefs the contactee, takes detailed notes of what happened tothem, and then blank-slates them, so they have no memory of either contactexperience. Then they are returned to their homes. Owing to the advancedtime-manipulating technology that is used, they can be brought back just momentsafter they were taken. An interesting technology is used to make sure that allother people and animals in the area will remain asleep as this is done. Thetechnology is called delta. It is only in rare cases like Artie’s when peoplecan remember anything at all.Corey has hinted on many occasions that he knows a lot more about my own pastthan he is authorized to reveal, but up until now, I myself have been able torecover only bits and pieces of it. Thankfully, I have no doubt that I was nevera member of the Illuminati. Many people apparently have these MILAB/secret spaceprogram experiences without having to suffer through the occult black magicaspects of the organization. The mind-wiping technology works so well that theonly way you can really uncover what happened is to pull it out of your soul,such as through dream recall and analysis. Yet those dreams will seem so bizarrethat you would never imagine they were in any way related to actual events thatyou may have experienced. I have gone back and reviewed a wide variety of dreamsand experiences in my childhood after having had this information and am nowquite convinced that I have had MILABS myself, as we will discuss. I doadmittedly find it frustrating that I have not been able to remember more ofthese experiences consciously, but apparently the technology is extremelydifficult to circumvent with the waking, conscious mind.SUSPICIOUS DEATHS OF BOTH PARENTSAs an adult, Artie’s mother got shock treatments and was often hospitalizedbecause of her anger, but this only served to make her angrier. She consistentlysuffered from negative emotions, right up to the time of her tragic death. Atcertain times, she would go into a full tantrum and would act very strangely.Her hands would trace out complex symbols in the air at a high speed, withremarkable precision and violence. This suggests that she was a specialist inthe Spiritual branch, along with Sciences due to her career focus on nursing.Artie noticed a similar phenomenon once he became obsessed with ninja movies, inwhich the characters make symbols with their fingers in the air, apparently toharness energy.Artie’s mother would do these movements really fast, almost like she waspossessed by some outside force. In 1994, I speculated that she might have beendoing some sort of black magic, such as summoning negative entities. This is notsomething she would have discovered on her own. It was very likely that someonehad trained her how to execute these maneuvers. This may have been only one ofmany things she was taught on the nights she was taken away from the orphanageand was not brought back until the next day. As sad as this may sound, there aremany people, potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions, who are caughtup in this dark and mysterious world. Artie was very scared when his mother didthe hand symbols, for it looked so disturbing that he was afraid she might hurthim.In one particularly severe episode of this phenomenon, Artie felt as though aninvisible angelic being had entered the room as his mother went through themotions. She clearly seemed to hear something, because she turned her head as ifto listen, suddenly stopped moving, sat down on the floor, and immediatelybecame calm and relaxed. At the same time, Artie heard soothing words in hismind and felt a beautiful, loving presence that calmed him down as well. Henever told his brother about this incident, because he didn’t think his brotherwould believe him. This was another key event that led to his eventuallybecoming a Christian. I do believe Artie is telling the truth—that he had anencounter with benevolent human angelic ETs who are watching over, guiding, andprotecting us. Thankfully, my own experiences throughout my life have been withthis element of the extraterrestrial presence.Many years later, I found out that one of the key founders of the modernrocketry and defense-contractor business, Jack Parsons, had done somethingsimilar to what Artie often saw his mother doing. An article in Vice magazinefrom January 2, 2015, reported that Parsons performed an occult magical ceremonycalled the Babalon Working, in which, among other things, he was “drawing occultsymbols in the air with swords.”3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45] As it turnsout, certain magical symbols, such as runes and sigils, can be drawn in the airwhile the person is visualizing them being formed out of light. It is believedin these occult groups that the person is creating actual thoughtforms in thespiritual plane, which can be used to both protect and defend themselves as wellas to invoke and command spiritual beings.Parsons’s goal in the Babalon Working was most definitely to summon an entity,and the details are quite unsettling. The article reads:> Just think about that for a second: one of the top minds driving America’s> early rocket program, a program that helped fuel the space race and the Cold> War, was at the same time a leading figure in the world of the occult. . . .> But for Parsons it didn’t seem strange at all. He treated magic and rocketry> as different sides of the same coin—both had been disparaged, both derided as> impossible, but because of this both presented themselves as challenges to be> conquered.4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46]Corey Goode and other insiders have suggested that this occult linkage to theorigin of the space program goes much, much deeper than most of us could everimagine.Artie’s mother took her own life on April 27, 1982. This happened to be his bestfriend’s birthday, and he was seven years old at the time. Artie was going toLittle League baseball tryouts, and was scheduled to go to his friend’s birthdayparty afterward. Artie came home to find that his mother had taken a variety ofpills, and she passed away later that same night.Artie’s father was then left to raise Artie and his brother alone. Artie stillnever heard a word about what his father was doing at work, and they hardly evertalked about the loss of his mother. Three years after his mother passed, whenArtie was ten, he got up early on a Saturday morning to prepare for a birthdayparty that a friend of his was having down the street. His father came out intothe hall and stared at him for an unusually long time, without ever saying aword. It was extremely awkward, if not terrifying. Artie said, “Dad, what’swrong?,” but he wouldn’t answer for a while. Artie repeated the question fivedifferent times, and his father finally said, “I love you.” This was notsomething his father normally said. Then, right before Artie left for thebirthday party down the street, his father again said he loved him, and huggedhim very tightly, for a long time—like he had never hugged him before.When Artie came home, a neighbor from across the street called out to him. Shehad been his nanny and watched over him when his father was at work for the lastthree years. She told Artie and his brother that their father had been taken tothe hospital. Then their uncle visited and said their father wasn’t doing well.No other details were given. The nanny later told Artie that his father hadpassed away. Artie did not go to the wake, and they held a closed-casketfuneral. Even when he first told me this story, I did not feel that his fatherhad actually passed away at all.With the full experience and knowledge that I now have, I speculated that hisfather got pulled into an assignment where he would live out the rest of hislife working in an underground or off-planet facility. This could have happenedas a result of his making a mistake, such as getting caught telling someone justa bit of what he was really working on with the aerospace contractor. It isnormal for people in this community to be forced to spend the rest of theirlives in secret bases if they make a mistake of this sort. They are usuallynever again allowed to return to normal surface life on Earth. This isconsidered to be a far more desirable option than killing the person who madethe mistake, since these people are highly trained in very specializedcategories, and there are very few staff who have such unique training withinthese compartmentalized programs. At one point, I was threatened by peopleconnected to Dr. Pete Peterson, one of my top insiders, who said I might end upbeing abducted and spend the rest of my life in an underground city if I talkedabout certain subjects online, but I continued doing so anyway. The threat nevermaterialized and I am still here.If my informed speculations are correct, then once Artie’s father was takenunderground, he could continue his work for The Organization on advanced andhighly classified “black projects” without needing to maintain a cover story. Hewould be well aware that he could not tell his son anything about what he wasabout to do, or his son could be harmed—so all he could do was to give him along, knowing stare, say he loved him, and give him a big hug before he left. Hehad to appear to have died in order to have a plausible cover story explaininghis disappearance. These sorts of clandestine organizations take care of all thedetails to make the death seem authentic. By holding a closed-casket funeral,they did not need to create any convincing facsimile of his father’s dead body.However, in this case, I believe Artie’s father “bent the rules” by giving hisson a knowing look before he had to leave. He knew that if he said anything outloud other than “I love you,” it would be recorded and his son could beharmed—so all he could do was stare in silence.Although this may sound very strange, it completely fits with a variety of otherpieces of intel that I would end up gathering in later years. Intuitively, fromthe very first time Artie told me this story, I felt very strongly that hisfather had never actually died. His father was not unusually depressed and hadnot shown any signs of being at risk. There was no note or any type of statementthat would have suggested he might take his own life, and he hadn’t shown anysigns of illness.At the funeral, his father was given an honorable twenty-one-gun salute. Artieand his brother were presented with his American flag. The strangest aspect ofthis story was that in addition to army soldiers, there was a man in a navyuniform, another who was wearing a marine uniform, and yet another man who waswearing an air force uniform. Artie’s father had served in the air force, butthese other branches of the military had attended his ceremony as well. Thisseems to be quite unusual for a veteran’s funeral, and it again suggested thathis father had a far more prominent position in the military-industrial complexthan he had ever been able to reveal to his own children. Once you enter theinside world, nothing is more important than the development of the black-opstechnology in any one of a variety of secret space programs.Artie met his adoptive parents after he lost his father. When Artie wasorphaned, he found out that his aunt was the executor of his father’s will andthat his guardianship had been legally transferred to her. If Artie was borninto an intergenerational and highly secretive cult, as it most definitelyappears he was, then his aunt and uncle would be absolutely aware of it. In thiscase, I feel the most likely explanation is that Artie’s aunt figured out a wayto get him out of the cult so he could live a relatively normal life. His auntturned over guardianship to a good female friend of his parents, since thiswoman and her husband could never have kids but really wanted them. The femalefriend had worked at a drugstore where his mother was once employed. When Artiebegan living with his new parents, he no longer had to deal with weird andterrifying ceremonial rage, nor any unsettling secrecy around his parents’ workor history. It was only many years later that he discovered his new parents hadto fight like crazy to keep custody of him. As a result of a very strange legalbattle, his new parents could never actually adopt him—they could only act ashis guardians.TWO AMAZING ARTIFACTSWhen Artie was in middle school, his surrogate mother handed him the classicbook on Edgar Cayce, There Is a River. She also gave him a few other Caycebooks, including The Sleeping Prophet by Jess Stearn. In college, Artie wasfascinated to hear additional details about the Cayce Readings from me,including material about Ra-Ptah, Atlantis, and Egypt, which I will go intolater in this book. He was obsessed with Egyptology, the Sphinx, and pyramids asa child, and wrote a fourth-grade paper on the Great Pyramid. The Cayce bookshelped steer him further in that direction.In addition to reading about Edgar Cayce and studying Egyptology, as a childArtie came across two very fascinating stories of UFO-related artifacts. I spentcountless hours meditating on both of these stories and trying to understand howthey fit together into the greater picture that my research was revealing. Inthe first case, a friend of Artie’s surrogate father had found a football-size,egg-shaped metallic object somewhere in the muddy sand of the Connecticut River.The object was unusually lightweight, and the metal was a dull, brushed-aluminumcolor. He could not cut, burn, or smash the object open, and there were novisible seams, buttons, or external markings on it. The smooth egg sat on hiskitchen table for weeks. One day, his son happened to blow a dog whistle in thehouse. At this same moment, the egg suddenly spun open like a flower into twoequal parts, dividing along spiraling, invisible corkscrew seams. Inside theobject was a Rolodex-style series of photographic images, much like Polaroidpictures, only these images were printed on a very thin metallic type ofmaterial. Each picture was square, and there were quite a number of them.The module had photographed important historical events that took place in theConnecticut River. There were images of ships that had sailed through the riverover hundreds of years of time. One picture was from Norwich, Connecticut, inwhat appeared to be the Battle of 1812. In this case, the British were trying toinvade Connecticut by coming up through the Connecticut River. A chain was putacross the entire river to form a naval blockade, and the egg had apparentlytaken a picture of this event. The man was particularly puzzled by anotherpicture that seemed out of place, because it looked like a scene from theRevolutionary War as opposed to the Civil War or the War of 1812. He knew thatno technology like this should have existed that far back in time, and wonderedif a group of people had been photographed doing a reenactment with this unusualdevice.After the egg opened and he studied the remarkable pictures inside, the manexcitedly called the FBI and reported his fascinating discovery. He did not knowwhat the object was. Perhaps it was a classified tool used by Russian spies. Hefelt he was the rightful owner of it, and that he would be able to get officialsupport to help him understand his fantastic discovery and bring it out to theworld. Instead of having a cooperative attitude, some men appeared at his housewho were clearly not FBI agents. They said nothing about who they worked for orwhat they were. They immediately confiscated the object after they arrived. Theydid not ask him any questions, nor would they give him any information. Artiedid not know whether the agents used guns to threaten him or not, but theyalmost certainly would have been armed. After they took the object, they refusedto acknowledge that they had ever received it in the first place.The second artifact was perhaps even more fascinating than the first. Thisinformation again came to Artie through his surrogate mother, who heard thestory from a female friend of hers, who in turn had heard it from her husband.Artie’s surrogate mother clearly had some degree of connections to the insiderworld, but it appears that she herself was not a member of it. In this case, herfriend’s husband worked for a major defense contractor. Somehow, in the courseof his work, this man was able to gain access to a crystal-powered, gun-likedevice that could levitate objects. At least part of the technology seemed toinvolve the power of sound. The device looked like it was made of crystal, butit was much lighter than it seemed it should be for its size.It worked somewhat like a revolver in that it had a rolling barrel with a seriesof compartments that would hold individual elements. Each compartment held acrystal that was in the shape of a four-sided obelisk, with a flat bottom and apointed top. Each crystal was small enough to hold in your hand, and they variedin length from six to ten inches. You could roll the barrel and dial in thesedifferent-size crystals to engage them with the main mechanism. The crystalsweren’t necessarily perfectly smooth, nor were they clear on the inside. Some ofthem were clearly damaged and wouldn’t work. The smoother, unbroken crystalssometimes would generate audible tones when you dialed them in, and at othertimes would not generate any sound.While the gun was making the sounds, you could point it at things and get themto levitate, even if they were very large. Additionally, the researchers notedthat people would get very euphoric and happy when they worked around thedevice. I would encounter a variety of similar reports from scientific studiesof what I have called the Source Field, such as from Russian institutions. Thedefense contractor then conducted research to see if a device like this could beused to generate various types of moods in people. It was unclear if thisresearch had ever produced tangible results, but I would have given just aboutanything to be able to get my hands on that device and test it for myself. Boththe Cayce Readings and later the Law of One series reported on the extensive useof crystal-based technology in the Atlantean civilization. In fact, the CayceReadings said the reason the Bermuda Triangle was so prone to cause planes andships to disappear was that a giant crystal was still operating beneath theseafloor in that area. The crystal had been called the Firestone, and apparentlyit was used to satisfy almost all the power needs for the entire civilization.Clearly, both of these world-changing technologies Artie heard about had beenhidden away in classified programs. This made me greatly angry. I felt that theegg was almost certainly an extraterrestrial artifact, placed here by a groupthat was watching the people of Earth over many centuries, if not millennia. Ienvisioned hundreds of thousands if not millions of them positioned all over theworld in key locations, and this man was lucky enough to find only one of them.It clearly was using some sort of technology to take the photographs that wentfar beyond a typical camera lens, since the surface of the egg had no visibleseams. In this case, instead of storing the pictures digitally, apparently theychose to keep them in physical form. I also speculate that each photograph mightbe akin to a removable card that could then be inserted in a holographicprojector. With the right technology, you might end up seeing far more than justthe initial image. You might well get a full holographic replay of the event,complete with all the sights, sounds, smells, colors, and textures.I feel that the crystal revolver could easily have been found in an ancientarchitectural site, such as Egypt. A device like this may well have been used tobuild the Great Pyramid and other such monuments out of gigantic, multiton stoneblocks. I was very unhappy to find out that our own military-industrial complexwas sitting on such a wealth of technology and keeping us in the dark. I wassure they had an excuse about how the truth would destroy our civilization, justas I had heard in my NASA disclosure, but I didn’t agree with them. Ourcivilization has handled plagues, economic collapses, and world wars. It canhandle UFOs as well—particularly once it becomes common knowledge that most ofthe extraterrestrials visiting us are highly positive, loving, and benevolent,and have been protecting us for millennia.STRANGE HINTS OF A DEEPER MYSTERYAfter college, Artie and I stayed in contact by phone at least once or twice ayear. I was intrigued by his commitment to go back to work where his parents hadgrown up, searching for answers. In 2008, Artie and his wife ran into a Bordersbookstore in the pouring rain. They ran in for just a few minutes, not even ten,since Borders did not have the book Artie was looking for. When they went backoutside, a plastic sheet from a three-ring binder had been placed under thewindshield wiper of their Chevrolet HHR. A Xeroxed article was nestled insidethe protective covering.The article was talking about mind control, and mentioned Eric Harris, one ofthe two shooters in the Columbine school murders. Someone had circled the nameEric Harris with a black Sharpie marker. This article speculated that Harris hadbeen through a type of mind control known as MK-ULTRA. This research projectinvolved top universities and hospitals, just like Artie’s parents had beenaffiliated with as children. Psychiatric drugs were used along with hypnosis andelectrical shocks to create alternative personalities in people, and theirconscious minds remained unaware of it. These alternative personalities couldstore information and even carry out elaborate, dangerous missions. After theprogram was exposed in congressional hearings in the 1970s, it was supposedlydiscontinued. Artie was born in 1975, so his parents grew up in the orphanagewithin the period when these deeply disturbing projects were conducted.Having circled the name Eric Harris with the Sharpie marker, the mysteriousauthor had then written, “Who is this guy? You need to research him. This willhelp you answer questions.” Artie’s wife was very freaked out. She used to thinkArtie was crazy when he talked about these sorts of things, but this event wasundeniable. The paper had appeared so quickly on their windshield that someonemust have been following them, and then positioned the paper immediately afterthey went inside the bookstore.The next event took place two or three years ago, where they live now, a fewstates away. Again, Artie and his wife went into a store and came back outwithin a short period of time. Once again, something was left under thewindshield wiper of their car, now a Ford Fusion, in the same type of plasticsheet. It was a white piece of paper with a message that was made of individualletters that had been cut out of newspaper and magazine articles. The messagesaid, “Your physical and mental abilities have been impaired. There is nothingyou can do to correct it. However, any further threats have been removed. Don’tworry anymore.” It wasn’t raining this time. No punctuation had been used in themessage, and both Artie and his wife were extremely freaked out. The message didnot at all have the calming effect that its author had apparently intended. Thisagain fits perfectly with the idea that Artie had been involved in MILABprograms as a child.I explained to Artie that when we look at these two messages together, theimplication is that he did suffer some sort of mind control that had damaged hisphysical body and his mental abilities to some degree. Nonetheless, he was ableto break completely free of whatever his parents had been involved in, thanks tothe work of his aunt, and he had nothing more to worry about. In 2011, Artiecontacted The Organization to ask about his father’s work history. Artie gavehis father’s name, said that he died in 1986, and tried to find out what he haddone. The man on the phone wouldn’t answer any questions. Artie said he hadheard his father was an inspector, and the man said, “Yeah, that sounds aboutright.” The man said they would call Artie back, but they never did. He alsosaid they would send him an email, but they did not. Later on, Artie calledagain and one gentleman finally told him that his father had worked as aninspector on some projects—but other than that, he wouldn’t give any specificdetails whatsoever.It is my hope that sharing Artie’s story with you can encourage morewhistleblowers to come forward as time goes on. As we head into the nextchapter, our story returns to the time when Artie was my roommate, and I got myfirst girlfriend at age twenty. The events that took place during that periodpropelled me ever deeper into the world of the mysterious, fueling my quest toseek the truth about extraterrestrial presence, the military-industrial complex,and our own origin and future destiny as souls awakening in the dream."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTWANDERER AWAKENINGTo have a full spiritual awakening, it is often necessary to first have a verystrong break with the material world. My break took about a year to develop, andstarted in my senior year while I lived with Artie and traded fascinatingstories. I knew something was wrong when a wasp stung me on the arm shortlyafter my first kiss with my new girlfriend, who was from Japan. In this book, Iwill call her Yumi. I was one of five buddies competing for her affection in thefall of 1994. The wasp sting was a synchronicity, but not the good kind. I hadanother “bad omen” the next day. I was thinking of our new romance while I wasat work and I dropped a hand truck on my foot, causing a painful bruise. Wereally didn’t have very much in common, other than that we both thought wewanted an exotic, foreign companion. I began picking up bits and pieces ofJapanese, and I gave her detailed coaching on the English language. Artieeventually ended up moving into a house off campus and left me with the room soYumi and I could live together.Many years later, Artie told me he had a powerful dream in which a being thatlooked like Jesus appeared to him and said it was important that Artie let mehave the room that year, free of charge. When Artie asked the being why this wasnecessary, the only answer was that this was an important thing for me toexperience, and it would very much help with my spiritual awakening. Artie didgive me an amazing gift, for it ultimately allowed Yumi and me to share a roomtogether in the coolest dorm on campus during my senior year. I was terrified ofliving off campus, owing to all the malnutrition and starvation I saw peoplegoing through. By staying on campus, I had everything paid for, including all myhousing and meals, and I could focus my efforts on reading as many UFO-relatedworks as possible.Yumi didn’t like how I was reading books all the time, so I started telling herI had homework to do, and would then disappear into the study lounge to continuemy research. Or I would have to sneak the books in like an addict while she wasasleep. Very strange things started to happen as a result of this. One night, Iwas reading a book called Aliens Among Us by Dr. Ruth Montgomery while Yumi wasasleep in the bed next to me. Supposedly, Ruth was pulling in psychic readingsfrom her Higher Self and recording them directly with her typewriter, similar towhat Edgar Cayce had done under hypnosis. Ruth’s source went through anelaborate discussion of what it called Walk-Ins.In a Walk-In, a person’s soul has decided it has done everything it can do forthis lifetime, usually after a series of increasingly horrible disasters thataffected that person’s life in seriously negative ways. Since the soul is readyto give up, it then agrees to allow a much more highly advanced extraterrestrialbeing to “walk in” after it leaves. The resulting effects on the person arequite profound. Almost overnight, they have a massive spiritual awakening.Everything about how they think, act, and feel suddenly changes. Everythingbecomes fresh and new, and the problems that once seemed so insurmountable intheir lives suddenly become easy to fix. As I was reading this, it occurred tome that I might also have an extraterrestrial soul. However, in my case, itseemed that I had always been this way, not that I had traded a less advancedsoul for a more highly advanced one after a series of deeply upsetting events.Just as I was having the thought that I might be an ET soul, Yumi sat up in bed,opened her eyes, looked right at me, said something to me in Japanese, and thenfell back asleep. This was incredibly bizarre and actually did scare me atfirst. I wrote down what she said, phonetically. It was a word I did notrecognize, followed by the word wa, which translated as “aren’t you.” I askedher to translate it the next morning. She had to get her dictionary to find thematching word in English, and did not remember the event from the night before.The two words translated as “You’re shining, aren’t you?” I had to ask myself ifsome spiritual force had come through her while she was sleeping to tell me thatI was actually glowing with light on a spiritual level, as I read this book andthought about being an ET soul. This was quite the synchronicity, and it alsoseemed to suggest that I might indeed have an extraterrestrial or angelic soul,in a way that most people on Earth do not have. It would certainly explain why Ialways felt like such an outcast.On another occasion, Yumi got up in bed and appeared to be holding something inher hands, rubbing it as if to show me that it was wonderful. In Japanese, shesaid, “Kon no waraji ro katandakedo,” and I quickly wrote it down, not knowingwhat it meant. Then she looked around the room and her eyes widened, as if theroom itself was extremely bizarre and mystifying to her—quite unlike thetraditional Japanese architecture she may have been expecting. Suddenly, a forceseemed to come over her and cause her to immediately fall asleep. Her eyesclosed and she sank back onto the bed, as if some invisible being was gentlyguiding her back down.The next morning, she translated it for me. The phrase was “Look at these newsandals I just bought.” However, the word she used for “sandals” was waraji.This was a traditional wooden Japanese sandal that she would never have boughtin this lifetime. We both wondered if we had some past life together. This wasfurther enhanced by another night when she talked in her sleep, patted me on theleg, and called me Obakun. In English, this would be a cute and loving way ofcalling me Mr. Oba, which clearly was not my name. The old man in my dreams hadappeared as Obi-Wan Kenobi throughout my childhood after I saw Star Wars in1977. Obakun was phonetically similar to Obi Ken. Perhaps her Higher Self wastapping into that name somehow, and her soul was saying that I was now on my ownJedi-type path of sorts.SHAMANIC INITIATIONYumi and I started having serious problems in our relationship early on, andbefore too long, we were having fights on a regular basis. I was never sure ofwhether we were going to stay together, or what I needed to do to make herhappy. My body started falling apart with pain and illness. I soon realized thatwhen she said she loved me, it meant something very different than it did when Isaid it. I developed crippling back pain from all the stress, but was stillfunctioning.At this point, in early December 1994, our jazz department hosted a concert onthe stage in the Old Main building, and I took Yumi to see it. This was acollaborative effort between a psychedelic jazz saxophone player and a femaleTuvan throat-singing shaman, who was wearing her traditional shamanic clothes. Isat there with Yumi in the front row as the shaman created a low, growling basstone and simultaneously made high-pitched, whistle-like sounds. I was impressedwith the sound system, for at times you could hear her voice coming in from theback of the auditorium and not the front. However, when I finally turned to lookfor the speakers in the back, there were none. She was somehow “throwing hervoice” off the back of the auditorium like a cosmic ventriloquist.At that point, I decided to close my eyes, go deep, and meditate. This shamanseemed like the real deal, and I wanted to try to tap into whatever domains ofconsciousness she might have been accessing. My breathing became deep andregular. I was counting my heartbeats and using a technique I had read about ina book on Hindu meditation—Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda. Iwas breathing in for six beats, holding for three, exhaling for six and holdingit out for three. I did this for several cycles with my eyes fully closed, andsoon the woman’s voice was taking me to a very, very deep level oftranscendence. I felt the sounds she was generating were vibrating my entirebody to its very core. The period between exhaling and holding the air out of mylungs for three additional heartbeats was very long. I had just done this againand was about to breathe in again after the third heartbeat.Suddenly, I had some kind of extremely intense chest spasm. I could not inhale.My entire chest seized up and I had no oxygen. My eyes stayed closed. I wasdeeply terrified for just a split second, and then suddenly something utterlybizarre happened. I found myself transported into some other realm. It appearedthat I was somewhere out in space, surrounded by stars. I felt perfectlycomfortable—neither cold nor hot. In front of me was a beautiful lightphenomenon. It was somewhat like a nebula and somewhat like a galaxy, but mostlyspherical in shape. It was bright white in the middle, followed by a starrylayer of yellow, then orange, then red on the edges. It looked like it was madeof a series of concentric spiral galaxies that were tilted at different angles,like the traditional view of the electron orbits in an atom, but in a sphericalshape.The feeling I had as I saw this mass of light was one of indescribable joy. Itwas as if I had access to all knowledge in the universe, instantaneously. It allseemed to be emanating from the white light in the center of the formation. Icould get any answer to any question just by thinking about it. At the sametime, none of it even seemed to matter. There was just an incredible feeling ofwarmth, comfort, familiarity, and belongingness. It was Home—like a warmfireplace in a beautiful cabin with the one you love—but it was far strongerthan anything I’d ever felt before. I was in sheer, rapturous religious ecstasyfor what seemed like an eternity, and yet I somehow knew I wasn’t there for verylong. It is very difficult to assign words to an experience like this.Before I left, I realized that I should take something back with me. I askedthree specific questions about my life and instantaneously got the answers. Onewas whether or not I should stay together with Yumi. The immediate answer wasthat I already knew we were not compatible and we would soon go our separateways. I then asked if I would be able to have a career in the UFO field, and theanswer was a definite yes. Everything in my life was already steering me in thatdirection and I should learn to trust my feelings. Last, I asked if my work wasalso going to involve some sort of spiritual teaching and helping people healand evolve. I had an incredible rushing sensation of wonder, and was told thatthis was the most important part of my journey—the true reason for why I washere.Once I got the answers to my three questions, I knew I could return to my bodyand pull out of the experience. I decided that I wanted to breathe, and in thatmoment my body allowed my lungs to take in a huge gasp. My eyes and my mouthshot wide open. At this point, I truly had one of the greatest shocks of mylife. The woman had moved on the stage and was now standing in front of me,about eight feet away. As soon as my eyes opened, I was looking right at her—andshe was looking right at me. She did not break eye contact. This was definitelynot my imagination. I was in complete shock. She then bowed to me and gave me ahuge, knowing smile, maintaining full eye contact the entire time. In thatmoment, I absolutely knew, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that she had somehowcatapulted me into this shamanic realm. I had read about shamans and yogis beingable to create spontaneous bursts of religious ecstasy known as “darshan,” butuntil that moment, I had never experienced it myself.THE FINAL BREAKMy back pain kept getting worse. One day in the food court, I arched my backover the chair and tried to get it to pop. I did get a loud crack, but Iimmediately realized that I had just made it much worse. After this happened, Icould not stand up straight without searing pain. I had already gotten aspiritual message saying that my relationship would end, but I did not have thestrength to actually break up with Yumi. Artie stopped by the room after Iinjured my back. I tried to act like everything was fine, but every time I triedto move, I cried out in pain. Artie ended up insisting that I go to the campushealth center, and they in turn sent me to the emergency room at VassarHospital. The X-ray, thankfully, did not show anything wrong with my spine. Iwas prescribed codeine and muscle relaxers for the pain. This was the first timeI had ever taken mind-altering pain medication in the two years since I hadgotten sober, but I felt I had no choice. The drugs and physical stress weakenedmy immune system enough that I soon developed a bad case of mononucleosis—withextreme flu symptoms—right during finals. I ended up having to take my testslate because of pain and the effects of medication.I went back home to my mother’s house for Christmas, while Yumi returned toJapan and enjoyed a graduation ceremony where she reunited with all her friendsfrom high school. I had a miserable dream; I kept being attacked by very longworms. I had to grab them, rip them off my body, and throw them away from me. Icould see this was dramatizing my body’s fight against the virus. I was barelyrecovered from this illness when I returned to college in January. Yumiimmediately went into a huge depression from having seen her friends and thenlosing contact with all of them again. Day after day, she kept telling me shewanted to go back to Japan, and she obviously wasn’t happy with me. Nothing Icould say or do seemed to get her out of this, and I felt miserable.However, Yumi also brought back one particularly remarkable prophecy from Japan.While visiting her relatives, Yumi showed a picture of me to her family psychic,a renowned Shinto priestess. This woman was very famous for her psychicaccuracy, which went far beyond the capabilities of the average intuitive. Itwasn’t at all uncommon for people to be reduced to tears as the priestess toldthem things she could not possibly have known from any conscious level.Normally, it was far too expensive and her schedule was much too busy to seethis woman more than once a year, but Yumi’s parents had formed a unique bondwith her that was unlike that of any other clients. Yumi had given the priestessthree different cities where she could go to school, and the priestess was theone who said it was very important that she go to New Paltz, New York. Thepriestess had already told Yumi that she had “the gift” if she wanted to developit, and that she could become just as powerful a psychic as the priestess was. Itold Yumi that she would be crazy not to study with this woman and learneverything she could, but Yumi was afraid of the whole thing.When Yumi reunited with the priestess that winter, she showed her a Polaroid ofthe two of us together. The priestess took one look at my face in the pictureand said, “This man is going to become very famous. Spiritual leader. Veryfamous spiritual leader.” This was a fascinating prophecy, but I had obviouslyno way of knowing if it was true. It did fit precisely with the guidance I hadheard in my shamanic visionary experience from the Tuvan throat singer, though Ihad never told Yumi about any of the specifics of that experience. I publishedthis prophecy in a book I put on my website back in 1999, entitled WandererAwakening, when I was first getting started online and was not at allrecognized. I obviously had no way of knowing at the time if I would become afamous spiritual leader, but now it is clear that my work has reached andinfluenced millions of people.The priestess also gave Yumi a two-inch-wide, very finely woven gold wafer thatwas sealed inside a protective layer of clear laminated plastic, and asked herto give it to me. It had a large equilateral triangle in it, and the trianglehad a treelike trunk down the middle, with a series of about twentystraight-lined, perfectly horizontal branches that extended to the edges of thetriangle on the way up. The priestess indicated that this gold object would helpme reach my ultimate spiritual destiny more quickly. I had never had any goldbefore and carried it with me at all times until Yumi returned to Japan.In the midst of all this pain and sickness, I thought back to the experiencethat the Tuvan shaman had given me just a couple of months before. I had writtendown my dreams after I first got sober in October 1992, and then had stoppedpracticing by the beginning of 1993, as I became completely obsessed with UFOresearch. I had another brief burst of dream work in the summer of 1993, andthen again became totally involved with my UFO research. Now in early 1995, Ifelt that I had truly hit rock bottom. I needed to start remembering my dreamsagain and really commit to the practice. As it turned out, the very first dreamI was able to recall after getting a notebook and a pen and leaving it next tomy bed was quite surprising.NOW STOP MURDERINGThe date was January 30, 1995. At the time, I was happy to blame Yumi foreverything that was going wrong in our relationship. In my dream, she had beenmurdered. As I said in the dream analysis chapter, you always want to begin byseeing every character as some part of yourself. In this case, Yumi couldrepresent my feminine side. The murder could easily represent how my ownsensitive, caring, emotional, and feeling side was going through incredible painand loss by all the fighting I was experiencing. If you have murders in yourdreams, you always want to begin by looking at how you may be sabotagingyourself and your relationships by doing things you may well be able to prevent.In a strange dreamlike way, Yumi had actually been murdered two different times,in two different locations. In this dream, I was one of the key investigatorsvisiting the crime scenes and trying to piece together exactly what hadhappened. There were various areas to explore that led up to the final crimescenes themselves, and I went through each one of them with intense scrutiny.Much to my surprise and terror, in every crime scene I found evidence suggestingthat I had been there myself. In fact, as I continued doing this research, I wasthe only person who could be connected to every crime scene. By the end of thedream, I was convinced I must have been the one who had murdered Yumi, eventhough I had no conscious memory whatsoever of doing it. I certainly did notwant to tell my fellow investigators about this; I knew I would be immediatelyarrested and imprisoned. The whole experience was extremely disturbing as I wokeup and wrote it down. Again, in dream analysis terms, you could read this asbeing a clear indication that I was the one causing my inner feminine self to be“murdered,” by disavowing the Tuvan shaman’s guidance and continuing to stay inan unhappy relationship.Yumi and I were having a very rough second semester together, with never morethan two or three days without a major fight. She became very jealous and didnot want me to have any other friends. I found myself curled up in a fetalposition in bed and crying when I had a chance to be alone. My dreams wereconsistently telling me that I needed to get out. I also had now been sober fortwo and a half years, and the guys in the room immediately next to me weresevere alcoholics. One night, not long after the dream in which I murdered Yumi,I heard glass smash in the room next to me. Everything then got frighteninglyquiet. They turned off the loud music and no one was talking above a murmur.Not long afterward, I went into our common dorm bathroom. My long-hairedrock-and-roller neighbor was covered in blood, and very wasted. His long-hairedfriend had a stark white T-shirt that was also grotesquely covered with blood.The friend was being aggressive and bullying toward me, using lots of profanityto ask me what my problem was, telling me to get the hell out of there, not totell anyone anything, and that I didn’t see anything. I was so shocked by thewhole thing that I did what he said, turned around and returned to my room. Ifound out later that my neighbor had smashed a beer bottle against the wall andcut his hand open. Someone finally called the police as they tried to staggeraround outside, covered in blood, and he was taken to the hospital. For me, thiswas another very strong negative synchronicity, showing me that I had an aura ofviolence and extreme pain around me in this relationship—and I felt there wasnothing I could do about it. I couldn’t help but feel that this real-worldsynchronicity had dramatically highlighted the dream in which I murderedYumi—but I had no idea why.Two years later, in 1997, after I started doing Edgar Cayce–style readings underhypnosis by a trained regression therapist, I had another dream about Yumi. Thiswas connected to my dream about murdering her that I’d had two years prior. Inthe original dream, I had no recollection of killing her, but this dream allowedme to remember murdering Yumi. In this “memory,” she had been a man living inrural Japan and I had been a woman. I was getting repeatedly violated by himafter he would come back from long fishing trips, reeking of fish. Eventually,in distress, I got some poison from an old woman in town and put it in the soysauce for his rice after he came home, reeling drunk on sake. The woman said hisdeath would be peaceful, but in fact he fell to the ground in violentconvulsions, with foam coming out of his mouth. It was absolutely horrific. Iran out the door into the night, terrified and traumatized, with bare feet. Itwas pouring rain and there was a powerful wind. I ran blindly across afootbridge that connected our mountaintop to another nearby mountain, stretchingacross a deep, rocky chasm. My foot slipped on the rain-saturated bridge and Iplunged to my death in a sickening fall.Before I ever hit the ground, I felt myself move from falling to rising.Everything went completely dark, and I again saw this same group of light beingswho I now knew had always been with me, lifetime after lifetime. We laughed andjoked about what had just happened, and I said, “I guess I really screwed upthat time.” This type of gallows humor, even in the face of seemingly terribleevents, is a common element reported by people who have had near-deathexperiences. There is great compassion and understanding for the humanexperience in the afterlife, even in its most difficult and violent aspects.In another dream from January 31, 1997, before I had the regression experience,I saw myself as an Asian woman. This dream happened shortly after I had brokenup with Yumi on the telephone, and it was admittedly a messy breakup. Myroommate Eric was not at all happy with me for how I had handled it, but I feltlike I needed to be tough. In the dream, I was smelling a bottle of soy sauceand then was repelled by it, as if there was clearly a dangerous chemical addedto the brew that did not smell good at all. Immediately after dictating thisstrange dream, I did a psychic reading where an entire sentence fragment camethrough that was almost all in Japanese, except the words no good. I did my bestto speak the syllables I was hearing, having no idea whether they would meananything. What I wrote down was “Yatsu wo ogoshi—no good. Mo yame koroshi.” Ineeded to have my housemate’s Japanese girlfriend Yuriko translate what I hadheard. The translated phrase read, “Threatening him—no good. Now stopmurdering.” This was one of the most shocking things that had ever happened tome at the time. Surprisingly, I had been able to listen to the Japanese clearlyenough that I had made only one minor mistake in translating what I was hearinginto written, phonetic syllables.Once I obtained the translation, I was dazzled and terrified at the same time. Idid not know the words threatening or murdering in Japanese, and yet my ownvoice had spoken both of them. In this case, I believe this was obtainedpsychically, not through having experienced a clandestine program, as may havebeen the case with Artie. It clearly seemed this was not a typical dream but washelping me to recall an actual past-life memory, where I, as a woman, hadpoisoned my husband and then fallen from a bridge in the rain. Once I wentthrough the hypnotic regression, I realized that this explained why I had somany dreams as a child in which I would be driving across a bridge in a car andsuddenly plunge to my death. It also helped to explain why I had such a dreadfulfear of rainstorms, as if getting caught in one of them could easily kill me.This is one of many examples where dreams can be multidimensional. My originalnotebook-written dream from January 30, 1995, did feature me murdering Yumi, notonce but twice. It is interesting to note that the original dream and thefollow-up dream in 1997 were precisely two years and one day apart, on January30, 1995, and January 31, 1997, and I did not notice this until putting thisbook together. In terms of analyzing the original 1995 notebook dream, youalways want to begin by reading the dream as a metaphor of your currentpsychological and spiritual issues. Once you go through that level of analysis,you can look to see if the dream is talking about other people you know. Thenyou might find additional levels of meaning, including the idea that you areactually getting an accurate memory of past-life events.My relationship with Yumi was apparently an example of past-life karma thatneeded to be balanced in the present. We had to get back together in a futurelifetime, have a similarly dysfunctional relationship, and this time make betterchoices. My dream from January 30, 1995, had predicted that I would discover Ihad murdered Yumi—somehow, some way, at some time. As it turned out, I did not“get away” with murdering my spouse in another lifetime. I had to come back andredo the entire experience without an upsetting ending.This is a very common element within reincarnation research. The people who areclosest to us are almost never “new.” We have a backstory with them thatdirectly affects what is happening to us now, and our dreams can occasionallygive us a precise view of what had happened in the past. In this case, I waslucky enough to have an entire sentence come through in Japanese that explainedto me that this was not just a dream but an accurate retelling of a past-lifeevent. If I hadn’t had such a stunning event—telepathically bringing in wordsfrom a language I did not speak—I would probably have never believed that Yumiand I had had a past life together. I eventually reconnected with her on a tourof Japan in 2002, and apologized to her for murdering her in another lifetime.She just laughed and told me it was okay and that she had a very happy life now.DREAMS OF FUTURE SUCCESS IN THE UFO FIELDAfter the upsetting dream in which I had apparently murdered Yumi, I decided tocommit to writing down my dreams every morning, and I have done so ever since.The second dream from February 1, 1995, ended up being prophetic. In thenotebook, I wrote, “Dad was clearly in a time of crisis. He was talking tosomeone on the phone and was essentially bargaining, trying to get a sum ofmoney on some type of insurance-based loan. I couldn’t believe that Dad had nomoney at all, and was surviving by taking a perilous loan.” I found out laterthat my father had lost his main paying job as the host of a radio show, and wasindeed thrown into a deep financial crisis. At the time the dream came, I had noconscious knowledge of this.Just five days later, on February 6, 1995, I had a very epic, complex, andmultifaceted prophetic dream. I found myself returning to a large suburban houseover and over again. Each time I would run up the stairs and into the bathroom,and then make a precipitous jump through the bathroom window to a ledge on theother side. I could easily fall to my death each time I was doing this. Eventhough it was highly dangerous, for some reason I felt compelled to keep doingit over and over again. Bathrooms in dreams represent toxicity in your life thatis usually not being healed. Jumping through the bathroom window therefore meantI was repeating the same unpleasant experiences with Yumi over and over again,without learning from them. The jumping metaphor ultimately also seemed to havea past-life connection, where I was replaying the experience of falling off ofthe footbridge across the chasm in my tragic past-life experience. In this case,the dream was showing me that I had to keep reliving the experience of havingupsetting fights with Yumi without a terrible ending.After about four times of running through the bathroom like this in the dream, Irealized I might be better off if I stopped repeating the same behavior. Insteadof going through the bathroom again and again, I might want to explore the restof the house. That way, I might be able to get to the other side without havingto make the same dangerous jump each time. Just as I was about to run up thestairs again, I decided to stop and walk into the living room. This was a greatsurprise to the young African American girl who had been watching me run throughthis obstacle course each time. As I said earlier, people of other races tend torepresent extraterrestrials or angelic forces, so in this case the girlrepresented some aspect of my Higher Self that wanted to help me break thisunfortunate and repetitive pattern. Now, in dream-metaphor terms, since I waswriting down my dreams again, I had finally taken an interest in what my soulhad to say.“Hi, I’m David Wilcock,” I said to the girl, slightly out of breath. “Do youmind if I take a look around?” She said, “No, that’s okay, David. In fact, we’vebeen expecting to see you for quite some time.” I was puzzled. “What do you meanby that?” She responded, “Well, I’m really not supposed to say anything aboutthis, but the extraterrestrials are working here right now to build up thishouse, and they know that you’re here.” I replied, “Come on, give me a break.You’re telling me that there are extraterrestrials in this house right now?” Sheanswered, “Yes, David, there are. If you walk over into the far hall to theleft, you just might see them while they are working.” My response was “This istoo outrageous to believe. I’m going to go over and take a look for myself.”Here, in symbolic terms, this dream was clearly talking about my love of UFOresearch. I had gotten into such a dark place with Yumi that I had stoppedreading my UFO books. The dream was clearly encouraging me to keep readingthem—even if I had to fight for it.As the dream went on, I walked down the hallway and took a left as the girl hadsuggested. I do not interpret the left turn as anything negative. You have toconsider the context of each dream to decide whether or not the direction youare traveling has a particular meaning. The only possible connotation for theleft turn, in this case, was that my girlfriend at the time considered it anegative if I was doing UFO research. At that point in the dream, I went downanother long corridor. At the end of the corridor was a waist-high barricade,and I stepped over it. Going into an adjoining, unfinished room, I looked outwhat was going to become a window later on. There, to my surprise and amazement,were about eight Gray-style extraterrestrials, all doing construction work onthis house! They seemed to be bathed in a brilliant, deep-blue light, and theirskin was also somewhat blue. As I said in chapter 3, “Dream Analysis 101,”indigo is a great sign in dreams, for it means your psychic abilities areactivating. The ETs were erecting a massive chandelier in the room as well asseveral other fancy touches, like a black-marble bathroom with gold fixtures. Itwas quite stunning to watch them work.Twenty years later, in 2015, I discovered that my friend and insider Corey Goodehad heard about a group of blue-skinned, Gray-style extraterrestrials who hadmet with President Eisenhower in the 1950s. The secret government programscalled these particular beings “the Blues.” Apparently, these ETs had offeredEisenhower a deal: If we agreed to stop all development of nuclear weapons andto destroy our stockpiles, we would be given amazing technologies that wouldtransform life on Earth as we knew it, end poverty, disease, and hunger, andsave the planet. The only other terms of the deal were that we would have tocreate a global spiritual education process, bringing in new scientific conceptsto inform the people of Earth that all religions were different perspectives onone common, universal truth.Some people might think this is a dangerous “globalist” agenda, however I dofeel that we all need to stop fighting and killing one another over such basicdifferences of opinion. My scientific work, such as in The Source FieldInvestigations and The Synchronicity Key, clearly shows that the universe isindeed alive and conscious—the product of a vastly intelligent design. Accordingto various insider reports, Eisenhower felt we were not ready for this plan, andrejected the offer. It was quite stunning to go back and see that these same ETshad appeared in my dream from 1995, twenty years before I consciously obtainedthis information. In my dream, the Blues were building quite the gorgeousmansion. Eisenhower’s rejection had obviously not stopped them from trying tohelp us.In this same dream, I was aware that government personnel were right in the samearea and were observing the behavior of these extraterrestrials. I was in greatdanger by being where I was, seeing what I was seeing. None of the neighborswere supposed to have any idea that extraterrestrials were building somethinginside this house. And yet, there was another building to my far left, and Inoticed that a man was watching the ETs work from inside this place. He was asshocked as I was. Then I watched as men in military fatigues came up behind himwith machine guns and ushered him away at gunpoint.I very quickly left the area, not wanting to be spotted by the agents. The ETsseemed to keep on working regardless of this government presence. Then, after Iwalked back into the main room, I ran into a woman whom I recognized as awealthy, prominent friend of my father’s, who put on big music events in theCapital District of New York State, in and around Albany. In dream-analysisterms, a prominent authority figure of this type typically represents an angelicextraterrestrial being. The woman and I began talking, and she soon offered me aprominent job at their facility. This obviously meant I might end up workingside by side with the same extraterrestrials I had just seen. There was a partof me that really wanted to say yes. I was very excited by the prospect. Insymbolic terms, this was my Higher Self telling me I would be making a greatdecision if I decided to go into UFO research full-time, despite whatever fearsI might have about whether I could make a living at it. Clearly, the house theETs were building was exceptionally beautiful, and I could end up living thereif I chose to join their team. The house turned out to look a good deal likesome of the hotels where I would regularly participate in UFO conferences manyyears later.Even though I had been given such an amazing offer in the dream, I remembered Ihad made a promise to pick up a female friend of mine in a little red car. Redis the color of sexuality and basic survival. I knew that this woman was Asian,was my girlfriend, and we were in love. She would be very upset with me if I didnot meet with her on time, as we had agreed. I forlornly rejected theopportunity to work in the house, and did my best to feel excited about theimminent reunion with my girlfriend. The director woman seemed verydisappointed, telling me that they “really needed me” there at the house. Insymbolic terms, this was the dream showing me I was consciously allowing myrelationship to pull me away from my UFO research, which I was being told wasimportant. The next section of the dream showed me the consequences of thisdecision—in very brutal terms.As I prepared to leave the mansion, I noticed that a large television was on inthe room. It was showing some sort of horror movie, taking place in a longtunnel fashioned out of cobblestones. Flaming torches were evenly mounted alongthe walls of this tunnel, about every fifteen feet. In between each set oftorches was a decaying body chained by the wrists. As I continued to watch thisscene, I suddenly found myself directly projected into it!I could feel the oppressive heat in the dark tunnel. I could smell the dank,wet, moldy horror of the dungeon and the miserable smoke of the torches. It wasas if I was in some sort of hell. At the far end of the tunnel, there was along-haired male figure, who, like the bodies, was also hanging in chains. Helooked remarkably similar to Jesus. I suddenly heard a terrible demonic voiceecho through the hallway. “Solomon,” the voice cried out. “You realize now thatmy power has superseded your own. You will do as I say.” I turned my headquickly and realized that the evil one was there, cloaked in many small piecesof flowing black cloth. He clutched a scepter in his left hand that was toppedwith a stylized skeletal claw hand holding a crystal ball. His face could not beseen, but the most prominent feature was his head, a dressed-up horse skull withbig horns at the top. This was similar to the villains at the end of the movieTime Bandits, which I had watched many times on HBO as a child. The evil onethrust the scepter forward, and the scene shifted back to Solomon.Now I felt like I was a part of the scenery. I was hovering in front of thechained spiritual figure. Suddenly and without warning, a series of perhapsthirteen thick, two-inch metal bars popped through Solomon’s body, causing bloodto gush out. It was incredibly graphic. The bars were at all different heightsand angles, and they went straight through, causing Solomon to cry and wailpathetically, like a small child. This obviously was a direct metaphor of thecrucifixion of Jesus and the wounds on his body from the Spear of Longinus. MyHigher Self knew I would have balked at the name of Jesus at the time, so thename Solomon, the wise one, was chosen instead. In this case, the Christsymbolism in the dream refers to the part of each of us that is in alignmentwith the deepest spiritual mission of our soul.The horse-headed demon continued teasing and taunting Solomon in my dream. Isuddenly realized that I was now supersize, holding this tiny human in my handsand carefully sticking pins through his flesh like a voodoo doll. I was tryingto make sure that I did each puncture exactly right—and this meant I wasobviously listening to what the demon was telling me to do. As I drove theneedles through, I would feel the rush of incredible pain within my own body. Iwas shocked awake, gasping for breath, with a thought that was more a psychicimpression than a physical sentence, but it translated into “You are the one whois stabbing yourself.” This was very intense, and I cried as I wrote down thedream. I was very well aware that this had to do with my relationship with Yumi,and my need to stand up for myself. The dream was obviously saying that Yumi’sinsistence on having all my free time was now standing in the way of my UFOresearch. For whatever reason, the forces in the dream said they “really neededme.”I took the advice of this dream seriously, and began to insist that I have thetime to read my UFO books. I would make time for Yumi, and I certainly did,every day, but I also had to have some time for myself. Shortly thereafter, onFebruary 11, 1995, I had a dream in which people were panning for gold with pansthat looked like flying saucers. I picked up one of these pans and startedmimicking what the others were doing. Almost immediately, I found two rocks thathad intricate-looking clock parts in them. The clock gears were all made out ofgold. I felt in the dream that I had made a vitally important historicaldiscovery. This could have been some type of ancient machine, similar to theRhodes Calculator that I had read about in the first UFO book I ever read aftermy NASA disclosure—Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space by Maurice Chatelain.1[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47] In that case, a rock had been found on May 7,1902, by a diver named Elias Stadiatos off the Greek island of Antikythera. Therock had a very advanced mechanical device embedded in it that seemed to trackthe planetary orbits, and it was able to predict solar and lunar eclipses.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48] The rock was found in an ancient Greekshipwreck, and it had at least twenty gear wheels in it, some of which hadmachining that was quite advanced. The technology was far more sophisticatedthan anything the Greeks were believed to have had at the time. The last datefixed on the calculator was 86 BC.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber49] It may haveactually been a surviving relic from a lost, advanced civilization that wasancient even to the Greeks at the time. I was very excited about discovering asimilar archaeological find in my dream.MY FIRST MAJOR ASCENSION DREAM IN THE NOTEBOOKSAs I continued to heed the warnings of my dreams, and got back to work on my UFOresearch, I had a truly magnificent dream on March 5, 1995. This was less thantwo months after the great 6.9 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, on January 17, 1995,which obviously alarmed Yumi and her family members. In the dream, I foundmyself in a large city, and many people were milling around me. What follows isa direct transcript of what I wrote in my notebook at the time:> Yumi hangs up the phone from talking with her mom or someone, and says to me> that her mom is very afraid that there’s going to be an earthquake, and she> believes it was coming in Japan. She was very restless and uneasy about it,> and I felt very strange too, like my body was humming or vibrating very fast.> I also had a dizzy, queasy feeling of being off center or off-balance somehow.> I walked up to a picture window, which was also like a mirror, and looked into> it. To my surprise, I was bathed in very luminescent, magnesium-burning white> light—pure, radiant white. And I had a well-developed beard! It was brown and> whitish from the light. The look in my eyes was one of intense knowing, and I> felt for that moment that I was seeing my future self. Then, I wondered why I> had a beard and started to inspect it.This dream captured a variety of interesting elements that are now commonplacein my work. Once we review the Law of One material and other such works, we willsee that the expected time of our mass Ascension is directly correlated withmajor “Earth changes” such as earthquakes. The vibrating feeling that my bodywent through in this dream symbolizes the activation that we go through in theAscension process. I then saw myself suddenly transformed into a Christlikebeing of light. This is apparently the fulfillment of the promise that Jesus andother great teachers gave us. In works such as the Law of One, we are taughtthat Jesus was the “way-shower” who would reveal our own path to Ascension. TheCayce Readings called Jesus our Elder Brother who revealed the path that all ofus must one day follow. If we don’t get the message to be more kind, loving, andin service to others now, we will soon end up having twenty-five thousand moreyears of reincarnation to figure it out on another planet, as we will discusslater on. And I don’t know about you, but I have had enough of the abuse,bullying, sickness, loss, greed, jealousy, betrayal, anger, depression, andsadness of third-density life. If all you have to do is “just be nice” tograduate from this “Earth school,” then sign me up."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEGRADUATIONAs I headed toward the end of the semester, I knew I was going to graduate witha bachelor’s degree in psychology, as my grades were fine. That being said, Idid not want my education to stop. My goal was to continue right along and get amaster’s or doctorate in something related to metaphysics and spirituality. Ifelt that an advanced degree would give me greater credibility as a UFOresearcher. After surveying a variety of schools, I decided that NaropaInstitute in Boulder, Colorado, would be the best possible choice. To apply tothis school, I had to write up and print out an admissions letter that explainedwhy I felt I would be a good candidate.PROPHETIC WARNINGSI had already had a prophetic dream that suggested this plan was not going towork out very well. On March 7, 1995, in my dream I got onto a bus that wasgoing to Colorado. I had to forge through enormous amounts of muddy streamsalong the way, and it was quite a mess. Once I finally made it to Colorado, Ineeded to find a phone so I could talk to my family and figure out where I wasgoing to stay. The only phone I could find was covered in mud. These metaphorsclearly showed how ungrounded I was at the time. I then walked up to a staircasethat I thought would take me where I needed to go. Instead of ascending, Islipped and fell, dropping fifteen feet down. This again seemed to refer back tothe apparent past life I eventually remembered having with Yumi, where I hadfallen off the footbridge. In this case I was fine, and had not been hurt.Several people came up to see if I would be okay. The dream clearly predictedthat I would go through a very rough time by heading out to Colorado, but I wasnot going to be deterred.I sat down to write my admissions letter sometime in May 1995 and started towrite about all the Earth changes that were visible at that time. Again, Kobe,Japan, had a massive 6.9 earthquake on January 17, 1995, that had caused over ahundred billion dollars in damages, killing six thousand people and makingforty-five thousand more homeless.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber50] That wasjust one example that hit close to home, since Yumi was from Japan. It had beena sunny day when I started writing. As I continued describing the ongoingcollapse of our society and the incredible problems that we faced as a planet, astorm suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. Before I even had time tofigure out exactly what was happening, a savage wind started wresting the trees,causing them to reel back and forth. The sky darkened. Thunder started booming.Then, rain began cascading down in sheets. The next thing I knew, a huge flashof light appeared at almost the exact same moment that a tremendous bang ofthunder exploded outside. Lightning must have struck something right near mydormitory, like a telephone pole. All of a sudden, my computer was dead and thepower was out. I lost everything I had been writing, as I had not yet hit SAVE.I had unfortunately forgotten the classic nerd’s saying, “He who saves firstlaughs last.”Once the power came back on, I worked this event right into my new admissionsletter to Naropa, and cited it as a positive example of synchronicity. Thesudden, violent storm gave synchronistic support to my case about the EarthChanges that were going on, and I reconstructed what I had written from memory.The whole event appeared to be so well timed that I could not ignore thesignificance of what had happened. I was sure that this was a sign that theinstitute would want to take me on board. Soon enough, I received a lettertelling me that they wanted me to journey out to Colorado for an entranceinterview. I would need to make the trip only two weeks after I graduated, whichgave me very little time to recover from an extremely difficult year. At thetime, I did not see that all the thunder, lightning, and pouring rain, as wellas the loss of my written work, was actually a synchronistic warning that thistrip to Colorado was not going to go well—at all.YOU’RE SHININGShortly after this event, as my graduation was looming, my former roommate,Artie, stopped by to chat. Yumi quickly lost interest in my metaphysical talk,and ended up falling asleep in our bed. I went on at great length about the ideaof Ascension, which I had now been reading about in books such as the works ofRuth Montgomery and The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield. I was now startingto see that Ascension was the grand focal point that all my research waspointing me toward. I was also speaking to Artie about the significance ofbenevolent, angelic extraterrestrials in this process, and how everything fittogether into the “big picture” that I was now building. It was an excitingconversation, and Artie was totally fascinated. Suddenly, Yumi sat up in bedagain, while obviously still fast asleep. Slowly and deliberately, in a deeptrance, her head turned toward Artie and me.By now, I was used to this, but Artie was obviously scared to death. Yumi thenbegan to speak. “Shining, wa?” she asked, looking directly at me. She gave me avery interesting and ironic smile that was almost exactly the same as the one Ihad seen on the Tuvan priestess after I gasped for breath and opened my eyes.Then, just as suddenly, something seemed to “turn her off,” and she collapsedback onto the bed. Artie looked at me with wide eyes and a big, goofy smile, forhe had no idea what in the world was going on—and he was clearly nervous. “Yep,that’s one of the things that happens,” I told Artie. “Some force has been usingYumi to give me messages. Tomorrow she won’t remember a thing. This is obviouslyanother Ascension message. I believe some part of her is saying that we areglowing with light on a spiritual level right now—just like we might end updoing one day if we are lucky enough to Ascend.”In that moment, I realized that Yumi’s conscious mind now knew the English wordfor “shining,” so she didn’t have to say it in Japanese this time. I explainedto Artie that in the past, Yumi had said the word for “shining” in Japanese. Itseemed quite obvious that, once again, Yumi’s Higher Self had been able totemporarily speak through her physical body to give us an important, timelymessage. I was clearly being shown that the Ascension message I was starting tothink about was indeed something very, very important for me to study. This wasanother bold and bizarre prophecy telling me that Ascension was real.When I received my diploma onstage soon afterward, I was anxious. In allhonesty, I was terrified. I did not want to leave college, but I knew my parentswould have been extremely upset with me if I had taken an extra year to finish.If I didn’t go to graduate school, I would have to enter the working world, andnothing was more terrifying to me than that. Everyone knew that a bachelor’sdegree in psychology was not very useful unless you went on to get a master’s ora doctorate. I knew I would end up living in extreme poverty and lose most ofthe freedom I had enjoyed in college life. No good jobs were available in NewYork State for anyone who graduated with only a bachelor’s degree in psychology.Yumi drove back with me to my family home and stayed with me for about a weekafter graduation. On the second to last day that Yumi was in our house, I had anabsolutely spectacular lucid dream, which I deliberately induced myself usingDr. Stephen LaBerge’s MILD technique. In this dream, I found myself back in NewPaltz. I was effortlessly flying around the campus, to the wonderment of otherswho watched me. I was so excited about what was happening that I tried to takenotes, not realizing that the notepad was part of the dream too, and that Iwould not be able to bring it back with me when I awoke. As I tried to writedown my experiences, I looked at the page. To my amazement, all of my thoughts,which were in English, were once again written in French! Furthermore, asbefore, I could tell they were accurate sentences, even though I myself wouldnot have been able to put them together. It was an amazing, stunning, andeminently gratifying experience, and mirrored the lucid dream I discussedearlier.THE PROPHETOn the day Yumi left, I walked down into the basement after her yellow taxi hadpulled away, and I began sobbing. I was deeply saddened by the fact that we hadnever really been able to get along, and I knew our relationship was about toend. She had wanted me to wait three years for her to come back, but I knew weneeded to break up. It would be easier to do so once she was back in her homecountry and we could both meet some new people. Instinctively and without eventhinking, I walked over to the same paperback library under the stairs where Ihad found Harold Sherman’s How to Make ESP Work for You and two other books onhypnosis when I was only seven years old. I blindly reached out and grabbed TheProphet by Kahlil Gibran, sat down, and started reading it.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber51] I had never read it before and knew nothingabout it except that it was considered a classic.With tears still streaming down my face, I noticed that the opening scene inthis book featured a prophet who had finally come of age, and was being calledby God to leave his hometown. At first, I didn’t realize how significant thiswas, but as I kept reading, I figured out that I was having another majorsynchronicity. The spiritual forces wanted me to realize that the character inThe Prophet was a metaphor for myself, as well as my own imminent departure forNaropa in Boulder, Colorado, in a few days’ time. In the book, the Prophet’sdeparture ship had just arrived in the port, and the entire village was cryingalong with him. Given that I was still crying as I read this, and Yumi had justleft me in her own vehicle, it was a most powerful experience. Before theProphet was to leave his friends and family for the last time, they asked him ifhe would give them some final parting words of wisdom.From this point forward, each chapter of the book is the Prophet’s response totheir questions. I was particularly inspired by the passage where the Prophetdescribes love as the force that grinds the “grain” of your soul in order tomake “bread.” He talked of the incredible work and sacrifice that went into arelationship, and I had just lived it. By this point, the synchronicity was sooverpowering that I continued sobbing openly as I read the words. Thankfully, noone else was home at the time. It was so odd that I was guided to read this forthe first time as Yumi had just left, and I myself, “the Prophet,” was about tohead off in a ship to my “place of calling,” Naropa Institute in Boulder,Colorado.I didn’t consider myself a prophet at the time, so the whole thing was amysterious but obviously meaningful synchronicity. Three years later, I wouldmeet up with a spiritual friend in Virginia Beach who owned a farm, and he toldme that The Prophet was seen by many spiritual scholars to be an Ascension book.The ship that the Prophet was set to board was a metaphor for Ascension andleaving the third-density world entirely.THE TRAIN TO NAROPANaropa Institute was founded by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, a lama who had movedto Boulder from Tibet. Before I would learn whether I had been accepted orrejected, I needed to travel out to the institute to undergo my entranceinterview.At this point in my life, I had never owned a working car. I had only ridden ona plane once as a child, when we went to Disney World. Both of my parents werehorribly sick before we left on the Disney trip, almost to the point of deathlyillness, but they decided to take us anyway. On that same flight, my brotherended up screaming and crying from the pressure in his ears as we landed—so theidea of flying freaked me out. I had always used the Adirondack Trailways bus toget to college, unless I was lucky enough to get a car ride. For some crazyreason, I decided that the best way to get to Colorado would be to take theAmtrak train from Schenectady, New York, all the way to Denver, in the normalcoach class. Then I would travel the final leg of the trip by bus from Denver toBoulder. At this time in my life, every dollar was precious, and this was atleast a hundred dollars less expensive than the cheapest flights I could havebooked.On the very first night, I realized that the train was a horrible idea. My dreamprophecy of going through rivers and rivers of mud was already coming true. Itwas nearly impossible to sleep in a normal coach seat. The train was constantlyswaying back and forth and making all sorts of loud and irritatingnoises—clanging, screeching, thumping, rattling, and chugging. People wereconstantly opening and closing the mechanical doors between the cars, and eachtime they hit the button, the door would make a huge noise. I had no earplugs toblock the sound, so sleep was nearly impossible to achieve.If I was lucky, I might nod off for an hour or two in the dark, but never forvery long. Then I would try to act like a normal person during the day. I spentmost of my time talking to Amish people, who also refused to use airplanes andwere very down-to-earth, open, and receptive to the things I liked to talkabout. I also enjoyed the views as we chugged on through the heartland ofAmerica, but I was consistently surprised by how many broken-down and blown-outbuildings I saw along the railroad tracks. It didn’t take long to realize thatonce the money is pulled out of something in our society—once it no longer makesa profit—it just sits there and slowly rots away. The railroad used to be avibrant business, but now the entire industry was on life support—and more oftenthan not, shocking signs of that decay would zip past me again and again.THE WATCHERSI also brought one book with me to read on the journey—The Watchers by RaymondFowler, which explored the classic Betty Andreasson abduction case. Fowlerdedicated much of his life to researching this one story, but most of the UFOcommunity wouldn’t touch it because of its spiritual overtones. At the time, Idid not realize how significant the Andreasson material would become for me;there is an entire chapter dedicated to the subject of the Watchers later on inthis book.Betty Andreasson’s contactee information did feature typical Grays, and just aswas revealed by the work of Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack, these Grays werenot at all evil, though other types of Grays definitely can be. On page 202 ofthe paperback edition, Betty was told that these ETs call themselves theWatchers. They explained that they are responsible for taking care of the Earth.They claimed to feel a love for the Earth that is constant, and lasts forever.They have supposedly been storing the genetic seed of humans from Earth forhundreds and hundreds of years, as well as every species and gender of plant forthe same length of time. That way, if anything were ever to happen to us, theseed of human life on this planet would not be lost.I admittedly wasn’t convinced by this material at first. The Grays certainly hada bad reputation in UFOlogy, outside of John Mack’s book. Betty’s initialcontact experience was in 1967, and her memory of this was later retrieved inhypnosis and written into Fowler’s first book, The Andreasson Affair, which waspublished in 1979. In this contact, Betty and everyone else in her family werewide awake when the ETs arrived, although, like Betty, their memories werewiped, and recovered only with hypnosis. Betty’s father watched the Grays walkright through their door as if it was made of air, on into the kitchen. In anearly hypnotic session from 1978, Betty Andreasson seemed to be listening towords in her head and speaking them out loud. The words remained untranslatedfor several years until researcher Leonard Keane discovered that they werespoken in Gaelic, which is the native language of Ireland. The likelihood thatBetty could have faked this is nearly impossible, since she was fully hypnotizedand did not have any way of looking at reference material. The first twosentences of the translation were given in the introduction of The Watchers.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber52] The full translation by Leonard Keane reads asfollows. I find that it sounds surprisingly similar to the classic “quatrains”from Nostradamus, which seem to have eerily accurate future prophecies embeddedwithin them:> The living descendants of the Northern peoples are groping in universal> darkness. Their (My) mother mourns. A dark occasion forebodes when weakness in> high places will revive a high cost of living; an interval of mistakes in high> places; an interval fit for distressing events.4> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber53]This is a very clear indication that Caucasians—the living descendants of theNorthern peoples—are almost completely deactivated spiritually in the modernworld, as are most other peoples. As a result, many of us wander in what theseETs consider to be an impenetrable spiritual darkness. The “mother” hereobviously refers to our own mother Earth mourning this sad turn in our society.The prophecy goes on to say that the cost of living will become very high due to“weakness” and “mistakes in high places.” This message came through in 1978 andwas first published in Transformation by Whitley Strieber in 1988. It iscertainly far more accurate now than it was at the time it was originallyspoken, particularly since the so-called Great Recession in the aftermath of the2008 economic collapse.Another surprise for me in The Watchers was that what we think of as allegedlyextraterrestrial Grays could actually be grown from our own human DNA. Fowler’sresearch revealed that if an ordinary human fetus were grown to adulthoodoutside the womb, and retained its form along the way, it would look just like atypical Gray ET. According to Raymond Fowler, the medical name for thisphenomenon, if we were able to achieve it, would be a “neonate.” Without thepressure of the womb, the larger eyes and head of the fetal form would remainlarger in proportion to the body, which would be thin. As the countryside rolledby for hours and hours, my mind was brimming with ideas about how the Graysmight not be extraterrestrials at all. Some part of our own military-industrialcomplex could be growing them in laboratories to be used in ships that weourselves are building. This is exactly what Dr. Steven Greer, a prominentUFOlogist, heard from his own insiders.THE BIG INTERVIEWTo save money while I was in Colorado, I had booked a room at the Boulder YouthHostel, and it was quite a scene. The shower curtain had thick, gray mold on itthat kicked off an overpowering smell. Thankfully, I could go outside and findall sorts of interesting and funky businesses, places to have a nice breakfast,a healthy dinner, et cetera. I went to Naropa for my entrance interview andbecame friends with two other students applying there—a down-to-earth hippiegirl named Meredith and a long-haired athletic guy named Carl. The staff showedus around the campus and everything looked very nice. They had a series of roomsfor students to meditate in, with each room lit in one of the seven colors ofthe rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. There was aspecific yoga posture they wanted you to hold in each room as you meditated.In my interview, the admissions officer asked me if I had a daily meditationpractice. I knew from their literature that they considered this a requirementfor anyone who was applying. I cannot remember whether the minimum standard oftime they wanted you to meditate each day was a half hour or an hour. Theywanted you to do a sitting meditation every day, where you did nothing but sitin a contemplative state with your eyes closed. This was never my preferredstyle of meditation. I knew there were two different major types of meditation,contemplative and concentrative. In concentrative meditation, you intenselyfocus on one thing for prolonged periods, and this is what I was doing as I wentthrough my research while I was apparently “shining” on the soul level. Somepeople cannot sit with a book or in front of a computer for more than an hour orso, whereas I could stay focused for many hours at a time without even moving.Concentrative meditation was my specialty, whether I would be remembering,writing, and analyzing my dreams, or studying and analyzing the contents of abook for hours on end. Each dream write-up took me about a half hour tocomplete. I did not want to lie to them, and I was very honest about how Imeditated in my own way.In my admission letter, I had already sent a list of about three hundred books Ihad read on UFOs and other paranormal topics during college, and also presenteda fresh copy of the list when I arrived. I challenged the admissions officer toname any book on that list, and I would immediately give him a summary of thebook’s contents and how it related to what I hoped to learn from getting mydegree at Naropa. My biggest goal at the time was developing thehyperdimensional physics model, linking it to spirituality, and exploring therole that extraterrestrials might be playing in human evolution and Ascension. Ifelt I could get to the answer by integrating this vast body of researchmaterials. The only real sign of trouble I had in the interview, other thanperhaps being too honest about the exact nature of my meditation practice, wasthat the officer never bothered to answer my challenge. I had put several hoursinto compiling the list, all from memory, and I knew I could give him animpressive report on any of those books. He had zero interest in accepting myoffer and seemed to be mildly insulted when I again tried to convince him to“take the challenge.”We also talked with honesty about how I would pay for the education. I was verylucky in that my paternal grandfather had pledged full financial support for mytuition to go to graduate school. Papa wasn’t thrilled about my education comingfrom a metaphysical institute, but he felt that any advanced degree was betterthan nothing. I told the officer how Papa had graduated top of his class atHarvard, that he had filed over eighty engineering patents, and that there wasmore than enough money there for him to pay for me to get this degree. I alsoexplained how Papa’s own father, Frederick, had designed and engineered tunnelsall throughout the underground areas of New York City to build the initial eastside of the subway system. I said I would be happy to work a regular job, ifneed be, to earn spending money if my grandfather didn’t give me enough to covermy basic living expenses, but I expected that he would. However, I did not go inthere with anything like a signed affidavit from Papa, confirming that he hadactually agreed to pay for this. My mother and father’s own financial situationwas far too rough for them to be able to help me with so much as a singledollar, which I had been required to confirm with paperwork as part of theapplication process.I had brought a quartz crystal along with me on the trip to Denver, one that Ihad been carrying around since I was in high school. This crystal had fallen andcracked in half while I was taking a shower after my single worst fight withYumi, near the end of the second semester in my senior year. At the time, thisfelt like an obvious synchronicity showing me how my own heart was breaking.Oddly enough, the crystal had cracked along an interesting, wavy surface thatnow made it look like a rippling wave of water. This wavy surface was apparentlyshowing me the original trace of the crystal’s growth while it was being formed.I went up into the beautiful Flatirons with Meredith and Carl, who by this pointhad already fallen into a whirlwind romantic relationship. This was the mostbeautiful view I had ever seen in my entire life until then. As I looked outover the stunning vista, I had the strong urge to throw the crystal into theforest and release that part of my life—the pain and the broken heart—forever. Ibelieved I had actually done it at the time, and part of the proof was that thecrystal had gone completely missing afterward. Little did I realize that I wouldfind the crystal again at an auspicious future moment, two and a half yearslater—setting up another profound synchronicity.Carl encouraged me to get a “quick-and-dirty job” and start getting myselfestablished in Boulder right away, so my transition into being a graduatestudent would be less stressful. I agreed, and got a job packagingthree-and-a-half-inch floppy disks into mailers for a software company. All Idid was stand there and stuff envelopes, all day long. The guys I was workingwith had plenty of time to talk as they stood there doing this. All they did wascomplain about a wide variety of things they didn’t like about themselves andabout life on Earth in general. I rode the bus to work and then came back to thefilthy youth hostel in the evenings. Apartments were so expensive in Boulderthat I knew I would need to get a much better job just to afford the most basichousing there. I was deeply, deeply tired, and my positive attitude was startingto fade. After about a week and a half of doing this routine, my mother calledme and she sounded very grim. “David, I’ve got a letter here for you fromNaropa. It’s awfully thin. Do you want me to open it and read it to you?”REJECTEDI already knew what she meant by her saying it was a thin letter. I knew that my“metaphysical scholar and dream prophet” pitch had not gone over very well.Whether it was the fact that I did not do contemplative meditation on a dailybasis or that I had failed to provide documented proof that Papa would pay formy tuition, I had not been accepted. Mom opened the letter and read it to me,and sure enough, they had turned me down. No explanation was given.Regardless of whatever the hidden reason might have been, I was absolutelydevastated—and I let myself cry. My mother kept telling me over the phone thatit would be okay, while I allowed myself to grieve. I had figured out how to getit all paid for, and never had believed for a single second that they would turndown such an enthusiastic paying customer, since I was already almostoverqualified. I hadn’t bothered to apply to any other graduate schools. I hadwanted to become a prominent UFO researcher, and some of the best ones had PhDs,like Dr. Leo Sprinkle, Dr. Steven Greer, Dr. Courtney Brown, and Dr. John Mack.I felt I was already making intriguing discoveries by combining the data I hadread in these many books, but the officer never gave me a chance to show how itall fit together and tied in with the Hyperdimensional Model. If I could get myPhD in a subject I would actually be able to use in my career, that was evenbetter. At Naropa, I was applying for a degree in transpersonal psychology, andfrom the list of books I would be reading, it was clear that this educationwould further enhance my understandings.I still had my return train ticket booked, so I quit the job at the softwarecompany and tried to enjoy my last few days in Boulder before I returned home. Amystical, older hippie lady met up with me at a local restaurant, and wanted togive me a Tarot card reading. I said sure, why not? She did an elaborate spreadwith many different cards that she laid out in a circle. Each of the cardscorresponded to an astrological sign and house; it was her own personal styleshe had developed. At the end was one card that was supposed to be the summaryof the entire reading, telling me where my life was heading. She used quite abit of drama and intrigue to build up to the moment when she threw down the lastcard. It was one of the worst cards in the entire Tarot deck. She seemed quitepuzzled, as if that card had never shown up in such a crucial position before.Her brow furrowed and she grunted, “Hmm.”“Well, what does it mean?” I asked, already knowing how bad it was. The card wasthe Five of Cups, which pictures a morose man standing by a river. The man iscompletely covered with a deathly black robe, hiding his face and crying overthree cups that had tipped over and spilled in front of him. Two more cupsremained upright on his opposite side, but he obviously didn’t care about those.The three fallen cups represented a broken heart in this case, and the waterthat flowed out of them indicated the love and joy that he could not replace.The only positive thing about this card was that the two cups still standingbehind the morose man indicated that the situation wouldn’t be a complete loss.You would still have something left over if you chose to look for it.“Suffering,” she responded. “The cards say that your future is definitely goingto have some suffering.” I responded, “Well, I hope not.” Yet, I knew thisreading was indeed accurate. The suffering she was talking about would last alot longer than just the train ride home. I was going to have to face mygreatest fear and become a “beast of burden” in the world of low-paying,entry-level jobs.JOINING THE ASHRAMOn the trip home, I quickly bonded with two guys who were giving up their livesto join a Hindu ashram in South Fallsburg, New York. It was founded by arenowned guru, Baba Muktananda. In yet another incredible synchronicity, one ofthe two guys had literally just graduated with a doctorate in medicine from aschool in California. Although he had finished all his exams and had gotten goodgrades, he still had to go through a series of board certifications before hecould use his degree to practice medicine.Just as he was about to graduate, he received a series of visions that literallycommanded him to renounce his future in medicine and work as a “common person.”His goal was now to move toward becoming a self-sufficient monk. Given theprogramming about college education that I had received from my family, Iadmitted to him that he sounded truly insane—but he was absolutely certain thathe was doing the right thing. The synchronicity of meeting him on this train wasalmost beyond belief. He laughed as I told him about Naropa turning me down.“You don’t need it,” he said. “Look at me. I was asked to walk away after I hadalready finished the whole thing. For me, that was the ultimate test of myfaith, and I’m doing it. I think the reason you met me on this train is to showyou that you are now answering to a much higher calling. My whole family thinksI’m crazy for what I’m doing, but I absolutely know that this is the rightthing.”He was traveling with a friend who had studied with Muktananda while the guruwas still alive, and had a very interesting story. Over time, the friend hadbecome tired, bored, and disillusioned at the ashram. He was doing his chores,mopping the floor in the hallway, but he had become deeply depressed. Muktanandashowed up at the other end of the hall, with no one else around, and immediatelyknew how his student was feeling.Muktananda then dramatically held out his hand, and a visible orb ofbluish-white light formed in it, about two inches wide. He grabbed this light asif it were a ball, and threw it at his student. The ball traveled to the arearight between the student’s eyes, and as it hit him, he was overcome with totalecstasy. His body dropped to the ground and he was literally convulsing withdivine pleasure. This was a powerful example of the gift that true gurus canconvey, known as “darshan.” I eventually explained in detail about how I hadexperienced something similar with the Tuvan throat-singing shaman the previouswinter, but at this point, I was totally captivated by his story. Muktanandathen walked up to the man, looked down at him in his drooling ecstasy, and said,“Now you stay, and be happy, no?” The man was so blissed out, he could only nodhis head and moan in agreement.Although this story might sound completely ridiculous to a skeptic, the mantalked about it in so much detail that it was obvious that, at the very least,he had experienced this event as if it was a reality. He had seen the bluesphere of light form in Muktananda’s hand, watched it fly through the air, feltit hit him in the forehead, and then experienced an ecstasy that was far betterthan any drug experience he had ever had. He was not expecting a darshanexperience, and it was definitely not his imagination. This reminded me thatmystical experiences can and do happen to people, and that amazing things couldstill occur in my future regardless of whether or not I made it into ametaphysical graduate school. My new doctor friend had obviously come to believethat a doctoral degree was not necessary—that we were all responding to asignificantly higher calling as we rode this train together.I wrote down the name, address, and telephone number of the man who had thedarshan experience in the back of The Watchers. Little did I know that I wouldeventually live right near the address he gave me in Santa Monica, California. Ihad completely forgotten about this until I picked up The Watchers again whilewriting this book, and his information was waiting there for me on the backpage. To me, this was just another synchronicity showing how powerful of amessage I had just received from the universe. We were all chugging through theheartland of America, headlong into an appointment with destiny."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENDREAMS OF RA-PTAH, ATLANTIS, AND FLYING SPHERESIn spite of my experience with the two men on the train, after I dragged myselfback home, I was devastated. The prophecies of wading through mud and cryingover spilled cups of love immediately came true. My mother demanded that I get a“regular job” and pay fifty dollars a week to live there. Without a car, thiswas extremely difficult. I crashed through a series of very stressful dead-endjobs, with only my bicycle for transportation. At the same time that my externalworld was imploding with stress, depression, and anxiety, my inner world came tolife like never before. I started experiencing truly remarkable spiritualdreams.To understand what I was thinking as I interpreted these dreams, it is importantto point out another key element of the Edgar Cayce story line. By this point, Ihad read several dozen books on UFOs and ancient civilizations that had goneinto the Cayce story of Atlantis. What we now identify as the myth of Atlantisis actually a part of the history of ancient Egypt, as well as other areas. Anumber of the books I read revealed that Cayce’s own readings indicated that hehad once been the first pharaoh of Egypt, who we now call Osiris. The CayceReadings said that many details had gotten lost in translation, and a moreaccurate name for this beloved leader at the time was Ra-Ptah. Cayce’sstenographer spelled the second word in the transcripts with only two letters,TA, but it now appears that PTAH is a more accurate spelling.Ra-Ptah was originally from Atlantis and, while living there, had received aseries of shocking and undeniable visions and prophecies of a coming catastrophethat would nearly destroy the Atlantean civilization. This was what we wouldlater come to know as the sinking of Atlantis. A small group of two hundred andthirty-one followers banded with him, and together they were able to survive thefloods and devastation that wreaked havoc upon the Earth. Once things settleddown, they relocated to Egypt and were able to integrate with the indigenouspeople of the area. Ra-Ptah knew he had to build a truly remarkable monument—theGreat Pyramid—and Egypt was the only suitable location for its construction.The readings revealed that Ra-Ptah had worked with a mysterious entity calledThoth Hermes Trismegistus to build the Great Pyramid. It appeared that Hermesand Enoch were also the same character, and the Cayce Readings said this beinghad been a prior incarnation of Jesus. In The Ascension Mysteries, I delve intothe mysteries of the Book of Enoch, which is as old as the Book of Genesis andactually far more revealing. Enoch received visions of a coming flood, and Noahwas apparently his grandson. The date that the Cayce Readings gave for thebuilding of the Great Pyramid was “10,490 to 10,390 years before the entrance ofthe Master (Jesus the Christ) into the earth planes.” This was obviously a farolder date than conventional scholars would believe, placing the pyramid’sconstruction at a beginning date of 10,490 BC.Another very interesting point here is that in Egyptian histories, the reign ofthe original pharaoh Osiris was known as Zep Tepi, or the “First Time.” In themany artistic depictions from this time, we see that the pharaoh and his peopleare openly interacting with unusual-looking humans. At least two of thesecharacters, Horus and Thoth Hermes Trismegistus, are pictured as having avianheads on human bodies. Other types of interesting-looking humans were depictedas well. Although the Cayce Readings never mentioned UFOs, there was aninteresting reference in one of them to a man who was helping to monitor portalsthat would apparently teleport people to “outer spheres,” and/or allow thosefrom these other realities to visit Earth. This enigmatic quote appeared on June7, 1930, in reading number 1681-1, for a thirty-three-year-old banker who was aQuaker. Apparently, in Atlantis, his name was Segund, and he was a “keeper ofthe portals.” Here is a portion of the quote:> The entity was very close to those in authority; being that one who was the> keeper of the portals, as well as the messages that were received from the> visitation of those from the outer spheres.1> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber54],2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber55]This quote is widely considered to be a true gem in the Cayce collection, for itclearly indicates that there were portals through which extraterrestrials from“outer spheres” were coming and going, and passing messages through to Earth aswell. It is truly heartbreaking that no one ever asked Cayce’s source anyfollow-up questions about this fascinating and controversial information. Thereading did go on to say that Segund had a key role in unifying messages fromAtlantis, Egypt, India, Indo-China, Mongolia, and the Aryan regions of whatbecame India and Iran. Segund was also responsible for planning expeditions thathelped identify where the survivors of the coming Atlantean catastrophe wouldneed to relocate. If we accept the validity of the Cayce Readings as one of thebasic foundations of our philosophical argument, then we have a great deal towork with when we bring in reading number 1681-1. If the birdlike human beingsportrayed in the First Time are not actually mythological, they may very wellrepresent extraterrestrial beings that are humanlike but have obviously unusualfeatures, and were visiting and communicating through portals.This group of two hundred and thirty-one people, including Segund, stayed withRa-Ptah through thick and thin—even after he was eventually banished from Egypt.Ra-Ptah’s banishment was the result of a grave mistake he had made. Although hetaught monogamy, he himself decided to take on a second wife and have childrenwith her. She happened to be the most beautiful woman in all of Egypt and arenowned temple dancer. The Cayce Readings said that her original name wasIsris, and that over time, it had become simplified to Isis. The politicalopponents of Ra-Ptah’s day used this example of spiritual hypocrisy to get himthrown out of the country, and for a time it worked. Ra-Ptah’s core group offollowers left Egypt along with him when he was banished.Clearly, one of the most interesting things about this story was that it did notportray Ra-Ptah in a very favorable light—to say the least. Despite all hisgrand achievements, Ra-Ptah had lost much of his spiritual righteousness througha classic infidelity scandal. The Cayce Readings further hinted that this washow the story of the severed phallus of Osiris originally got started. In themythological version, Osiris was chopped up into fourteen pieces, and Isis wasable to recover all the pieces and restore his body to normal health, except thephallus.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber56] An artificial replacement was thenmade, and this was apparently where the symbolism of the Egyptian obeliskoriginated. Osiris was also said to have conceived his son Horus, thehawk-headed deity, after this bizarre restoration, by procreating with his wife,Isis.Some Cayce researchers believe this story can be seen as a dreamlike mythdescribing how Ra-Ptah eventually returned to Egypt after being banished, butwas always haunted by the sex scandal. In fact, the Cayce Readings said thatafter he returned, Ra-Ptah took on multiple wives and threw his originalteaching about monogamy completely out the window. The aftereffects of theseunfortunate decisions changed the course of humanity’s spiritual path for theensuing twelve thousand years. We will go into more detail about this once wedelve into the Law of One, which has astonishing correlations to the CayceReadings but were consciously unknown to the woman who spoke the words.According to the Cayce Readings, this same core group of two hundred andthirty-one people continued reincarnating with Ra-Ptah lifetime after lifetime.Even more interestingly, the readings revealed that America in general was acountry where the Atlanteans were reincarnating as a group, so they could workoff the karma of having destroyed their previous high-tech civilization throughselfishness, greed, and materialism. Many Americans, therefore, had very intensedreams of catastrophes, for their souls were having vivid flashbacks of havingdied in the sinking of Atlantis. This was said to have been caused by a poleshift—when the Earth suddenly tilted on its axis.I found the Cayce Readings’ story of Ra-Ptah to be very interesting. Afterreading three hundred books and seeing the impossibility of so many ancientmegalithic stone monuments around the world, it wasn’t at all difficult tobelieve that there had been an advanced civilization on Earth that had beendestroyed in what we would consider to be prehistoric times. We could choose tocall it Atlantis or something else, but no one could deny the presence of thesestrange ruins. The Cayce reincarnation story was certainly one of the mostinteresting aspects of what I had come across in my research, particularlybecause his source claimed that a “Hall of Records” had been buried underneaththe right paw of the Sphinx, along with a wide network of underground tunnels wehave not yet officially discovered. Apparently, Ra-Ptah, Segund, and others hadfilled this secret underground chamber with a treasure trove of artifacts thatdocumented their entire civilization and history. These treasures seem to haveincluded holographic projectors that would play back three-dimensional movies ofwhat had actually happened in our own ancient past. Since I knew there was adirect connection between the Monuments of Mars and the Giza plateau, I had towonder if the Mars connection would appear inside the Hall of Records as well.The Cayce Readings had also said that these people had cigar-shaped antigravityflying craft at the time. I was intrigued by the fact that I had seen the exactsame type of craft in many of my own childhood dreams. I reasoned that if thesecraft could conquer gravity, they very likely could also have gone to Mars andinspected the ancient, fascinating ruins. The Cayce story did seem to tie it alltogether, complete with the connection to extraterrestrials visiting Earththrough portals, and the suggestion that Americans were uniquely connected tothe story of Atlantis. Given how obsessed I was with all this information, andhow many synchronicities and dreams I was receiving, I had to wonder if I mighthave somehow been part of this same ancient Atlantean group. Before long, as Iworked through a series of utterly miserable low-paying jobs, I had severalmarvelous dreams that seemed to be feeding me the answer.DREAM OF AN ATLANTEAN CATASTROPHEThe first dream that seemed to relate to Ra-Ptah, Egypt, and Atlantis came in onJuly 6, 1995, less than a month after I had been rejected by the NaropaInstitute. In this dream, I found myself on top of what appeared to be a giantstep pyramid of some kind, similar to the Mayan temples. It was a very large,castle-like building made of stone, with a ring of pillars standing at thesummit. I was the only one there who seemed to understand that the pillars andthe building itself were all designed to function as a giant astronomicalcalendar. The society that had built this pyramid had reached its ultimatecrisis as my dream began. Lightning was crashing. The Mayan-style pillars weretoppling down, right in front of me, and water was flooding in from everywhereat a fantastic rate. It was extremely terrifying, to say the least.All the people around me were from my honors classes in high school. There werea total of perhaps forty kids who were all in the same “gifted” classes with meevery year. I have had countless dreams in which these same people show up. Inthis case, I seemed to be their spiritual leader. I was able to show them how tocross over the flooding parts of the pyramid and travel to safety. In fact, wewere actually walking on water in order to do this. Much like Moses, I was alsoable to part the sea so everyone could travel through the area to safety, andthey were amazed that I was able to do this. At one point, I stepped out intothe water and was able to psychically form it into huge, beautiful quartzcrystals with my hands. I showed them to the people as if they were gifts, butas soon as they tried to grab them, the crystals immediately melted like icecubes.THE GOLDEN BEINGSI had the next dream of this type ten days later, on July 16, 1995. In thiscase, I went to a large, green outdoor park with my father and brother. We knewthat the rock band KISS would be performing there, and we were excited to seethem. Dad went into the bathroom to change his clothes, and we ended up waitinga long time for him to get ready. We urged Dad to hurry up, because we wanted tosee KISS. Once Dad emerged, we all headed outside to the stage area and therethey were! By this point, the concert was already happening in front of anaudience. Once we arrived, the members of KISS stopped playing. They privatelytook the three of us over to a different spot in the park, and for some reason,no one in the audience tried to follow us. I then witnessed a sight that was afeast for the eyes, unduplicated by any movie I have ever seen in my life.We were standing in front of a large, grassy field that didn’t seem to be allthat interesting. Suddenly, with a deep rumble that almost knocked us over, theground opened up in a long straight line. Somehow, the whole park was built ontop of an underground base that could open and close with this massivemechanical door. We peered down into the base, which seemingly went downforever, through this relatively narrow channel. Once I looked up, I realizedthat a giant spaceship had risen up through the channel—so large that I couldn’teven begin to see what it really was. All I could see was the flat side of somemassive object that was covered with lights, machinery, andtechnological-looking things. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.Now I tried to crane my head back to see exactly how big this object really was.As I looked up, I realized it was absolutely colossal in size and scope, so bigthat it looked like nothing more than a towering wall extending as far down andas far up as the eye could see. Panels of blue-white light in huge rectangleswere interspersed along its incredible metallic frame, with dazzling, intricatedetail. It was absolutely, completely breathtaking, to the point where I wasliterally moved to tears.A door either opened or was already open, and the mysterious members of KISS ledme directly inside this phenomenally massive structure. As I walked in withthem, we headed through a large rectangular corridor that was perhaps forty feettall. The walls were precisely cut with razor-sharp lines. The hall reminded meof the inside of the warehouses I was now working at, but this was far moremajestic than any of my job sites. Everything looked like it was made out ofgold. The walls were decorated with a multitude of technological-looking itemsas well as an endless amount of Egyptian-looking artifacts. Elaborate,gold-encrusted hieroglyphics covered the empty spaces, and there were countlessnumbers of what appeared to be solid-gold Egyptian statues lining the hall allthe way down on both sides. The sheer majesty of what I was seeing wasspectacular. I was so awestruck that I had to remind myself to breathe.The members of KISS continued leading me deeper and deeper through thispassageway. Finally, I met about three beings who were gigantic and exceedinglymysterious. They were approximately thirty-five feet tall. These beings, each ofthem wearing what appeared to be a robe, were quite extraordinary, appearing tobe living statues made of solid gold. They sparkled and shined with thebeautiful luster of gold as they stood there. These beings were so tremendouslytall that their heads nearly touched the ceiling of the massive hall we were in.Their heads were larger than one would expect for the size of their bodies, andshaped like flattened fishbowls, almost like a McIntosh apple. The sides bulgedout like an apple, but the top and bottom of their heads were straight-linedlike a fishbowl. The lines on the top and bottom of their heads were the samewidth. Their facial features were quite stylized, like masks, and their facesnever moved. Each face looked like something one might see on a Mayan templewall. Despite their incredible size and imposing appearance, I felt completelysafe in their presence—while also being very impressed by the level of spiritualpower they were radiating. They told me to come with them, and we walked downthe hall together. The entire experience was utterly breathtaking.The first thing the beings did was to lead me to a large, solid-gold statue thatclearly seemed to commemorate Horus, the falcon god. The beings notified me,through a form of mental telepathy, that they now had to find a new Horus,because the original Horus had somehow been destroyed. They would not give meany additional information about it. At this point, the dream got even morebizarre. We walked farther ahead and they ended up leading me to the originaldesk that I had used to hold my private memorabilia when I was growing up. Noweverything looked like my bedroom, complete with the desk, which was always ahuge mess. They pointed at the desk ominously. On a telepathic level, I knewthey wanted me to search through the desk, categorize everything, and relive thememories of my past. They told me I needed to do this to find batteries thatwould power a small synthesizer. This appeared to be the same Casio SK-1 that myfriend Jude and I had used to make our earliest music together in high school.To locate these batteries, I would have to go through various things that Irecognized from all the different parts of my life.After a good period of time searching through the desk, I finally located thebatteries. The beings told me I could go. I quickly found myself back outsideand met up with my father and brother. My perception then expanded, and I foundmyself flying high over the Earth. Now I was looking down at what were obviouslythe main pyramids on the Giza plateau in Egypt. However, there were alsotemporary silos built next to the pyramids: one large silo and two smaller onesin front of the main three pyramids. Strangest of all, everything was coveredwith snow, although Egypt was supposed to be a desert!At this point, I suddenly found myself back on the ground level. Now theoriginal gigantic doors to the underground base had opened even more. Agigantic, brownish-gray moonlike object rose out of the doors and into the air.It looked just like the Martian moon Phobos, and it seemed to float up into thesky like a balloon. As the moon went up, I again found myself levitating in theair and watching it rise. I was completely transfixed as I again looked down andsaw the Giza pyramids covered in snow, with the silos nearby. At this point, thedream ended. I spent well over an hour writing it all down, complete withseveral sketches to illustrate what I had seen.During this same time, I was reading Genesis Revisited by Zecharia Sitchin. Inthis book, Sitchin argued that Phobos was not a natural moon but had beenhollowed out to form a massive extraterrestrial base. He had a variety ofreasons to speculate on this, including the fact that the orbit of Phobos isunusually fast and eccentric. The orbital characteristics led many to concludethat the only explanation would be that Phobos was hollow. It would only be muchlater in life, beginning in about 2007 with Henry Deacon, that other insidersrevealed to me that there were multiple moons in our solar system with gigantic,habitable civilizations inside them. I had also read other books that said therewere gigantic passageways carved underground in areas like Peru and Egypt. Somemodern explorers had found them, but their stories were inevitably covered up.I could clearly tell that this dream had many direct connections to the Ra-Ptahstory line. I saw the Egyptian pyramids, apparently while they were still underconstruction. The surrounding countryside was in a different climate at thetime, where snow could accumulate. The golden beings were exceptionally amazingto behold. I could see that they were obviously suggesting that I might somehowbe a replacement for Horus. The key was to go through the memories of my pastand organize them. Only then would I find the “batteries” that would allow me to“make music.” I have had many battery metaphors in dreams, and they representthe spiritual power we need to move forward with our greatest purpose. The musicI would make in this case would be the spiritual career as a UFO researcher, afield I was hoping to break into.NEW BIRTHS AND ANOMALOUS FLYING SPHERESThe next dream of this type came in five days later, on July 21, 1995. In it, Ilooked out the windows of my childhood home and saw a huge plane flying almostimpossibly close to the ground. The craft was utterly enormous, and it wastrying to land, in a strange leaflike, fluttering motion. This craft looked verysimilar to the UFOs I had seen in so many dreams as a youth. I went outside thehouse to investigate and found a body of water. A baby was floating in thewater, and I of course felt the need to rescue him and bring him to safety. Thedream then shifted, and I was now sailing on the ocean in a ship. We were havinga very hard time, for it seemed we had just survived a global pole shift. Agroup of people around me were looking up to me as their spiritual leader. Iaddressed this group, telling them we had just survived a global pole shift andthat things weren’t going to be easy anymore. I held up a newspaper and toldeveryone they could each have two sheets to use as a blanket. One woman startedviolently arguing with me about this. After a while, I was able to convince herto accept our collective fate. This was a great relief to everyone else in thegroup.The next dream like this occurred on July 25, 1995. I found myself going to alocal museum to see an incredible UFO exhibit entitled “Anomalous FlyingSpheres.” While I was inside, I met a strange-looking girl who could read mymind with great depth and precision. Her face showed her visible shock when Irevealed to her, telepathically, that I knew what she was doing. I sat down nextto her and told her that she needed to meditate more often to develop herabilities. Later, after I woke up and analyzed this, I knew she was a metaphorfor myself, as is the standard rule of all dreams. I told the girl about many ofthe UFO-related topics that I had been studying. At this point, an overweightman became very angry with me for doing this. He wanted to fight me for mybeliefs, and I did not back down. We went outside and I became a third-partyobserver. I watched the entire conflict happen, and my character won the fight.In my analysis, I could tell that this man represented the past part of me thathad suffered through various addictions and bad habits, including laziness andovereating, and still had doubts about my own research.As soon as I won the fight, a beautiful spherical UFO appeared in the sky. Ithen began flying up into the air, and soared higher and higher. Suddenly, andwithout even knowing why, I shouted out, “Take me through the vortex!” There wasa sudden flash of white light, and now the Earth was altogether different. Itwas nonetheless dimly familiar to me in some way as I glided back to groundlevel. Everyone was wearing white robes, and it appeared to be a veryenlightened society. I had an immediate feeling of kinship with the people andthe culture. There were plenty of megalithic stone monuments like Stonehenge,only in this case the stones were all a very pure white. An unusuallyexotic-looking woman then appeared beside me. She was wearing a white robe justlike everyone else. She was very attractive, and she seemed to want to connectwith me on a very deep level that could well have been romantic. As soon as Itried to approach her, something seemed to block me, and I woke up. By thispoint, I felt that I most certainly had had at least one past life in Atlantis,and I was starting to remember accurate details of what it had been like in mydreams.I wouldn’t find out until 2015 from the insider Corey Goode that dozens, if nothundreds, of gigantic spheres had flown into our solar system. As I described inThe Ascension Mysteries, the first of these appeared in the mid-1980s, duringthe Reagan administration, and was called the Sentinel. This craft left, butbeginning in 1999, many more started arriving in our solar system. They came inthrough our sun or from the outside of our solar system. I was very aware ofplanet-size objects entering our solar system at the time, thanks to a websiteby Kent Steadman entitled Cyberspace Orbit. Steadman was tracking the arrival ofthese planet-size, visible objects from the SOHO satellite. He called them SunCruisers. They could move through huge areas of space in a matter of days. Onmany occasions after they showed up, the satellites would mysteriouslymalfunction and the images would be cut off. A much larger number of thesespheres apparently came in during the year 2012. Corey Goode receivedinformation that these spheres were intended to help stabilize our solar systemas we moved through a massive energetic transformation. They would ensure thatwe would all be safe and end up going where we needed to go.After having explored the Corey Goode disclosure material in a wide variety oftelevision shows, conferences, videos, and website articles since 2015, I wasquite surprised when I went back to my dream journals and saw this elaboratedream about “Anomalous Flying Spheres.” The woman I had met up with seemed to bea picture-perfect description of a race of inner-Earth beings who callthemselves the Anshar. I will have much more to say about them as we go on.TIME TO LEAVE THE NESTI was eventually able to get my father to cosign a bank loan so I could get alittle white Subaru hatchback with four-wheel drive for the snow. My mother madeit clear that I needed to move out and get on with my life as an independentadult. Nothing could have been more terrifying to me at the time. I had quitethe profound synchronicity as it hit me that I was really going to have toleave. I go into more detail in The Synchronicity Key, but I went out into thebackyard, lay down on my side in the grass, and sobbed. A robin came up and wasquite obviously trying to cheer me up. He just sat there with his red breast,tilting his head, looking me right in the eye, and chirping away. The wholething was extremely bizarre, and it went on for some time. I had neverexperienced this type of animal communication before, and I knew I had to facemy greatest fears to reenter the working world, but ultimately it would all befor the best. My “place of calling” was now the New Paltz area, where I had justfinished college. I still had a whole network of friends down there whom I couldrely on to help me get started with adult living, and at the time I had onedream after another telling me I had to move back to New Paltz as soon aspossible."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENTHE PLACE OF CALLINGMy weird, mystical experience with the robin helped give me the confidence totake the Subaru and drive back down to New Paltz, where I had just finishedcollege and still had a variety of friends I could stay with. I had been havingalmost daily dreams in which I had gone back to New Paltz to begin my adultlife. I made the big drive on September 3, 1995. That morning, I had a dreamthat I was being chased by horrible, demonic-looking people. There were certainphrases you could say, partly in Japanese, that would defeat them. One of thesephrases translated as “Do not speak of your intense hunger.” At first, I wasterrified because so many of them were chasing me, but then I realized that theywere all in a single classroom from my high school. I ran out the door, shut it,and locked them in so they could not get me. Once I escaped, an interestingperson showed up and told me that it was all really just a game, and they werenever that dangerous. This person told me that if it ever happened again, themain thing I needed to say to them was “By the grace of God and the Law of One,begone!” I was unaware that I was about to discover the Law of One series justover two months later. This dream could be interpreted as my turning my back onall the demons from growing up very unpopular and disliked in my hometown. InNew Paltz, I had a large circle of friends.STARTING A NEW JOB FROM THE KITCHEN FLOORI had played drums in a college jazz ensemble with my friend Adam, and he had alittle apartment in the back of an insurance building. There was only enoughroom for me to sleep on an air mattress on his linoleum kitchen floor. On myfirst morning, September 4, 1995, Adam came in the kitchen to have a bowl ofcereal. As the cornflakes and the spoon hit the porcelain, it ripped me out ofthe dream state and seemed much louder than it really was. I bellowed out, “Whatare you, breaking glass?” We ended up laughing and laughing about that event onmany other occasions afterward. Soon after, I began wearing earplugs to sleep,and I have almost always done it ever since. I had already become comfortablewith wearing earplugs in my work as a drummer. The drumming magazines all warnedthat one had to protect the ears, for hearing damage was permanent.The very next day, I got a job delivering pizzas for a local business, thanks tomy friend Eric, who was also working there at the time. Adam’s kitchen floor wasonly an emergency crash-landing site to get me started, and I did not want toimpose. Since I now had a job, I was able to move into my own place just fivedays after I returned to New Paltz, on September 8, 1995. I chose a collegeboardinghouse that was just a short five-minute walk from Adam’s place, rightdown the road. It had about seven bedrooms, and my rent was only two hundredtwenty dollars a month. The morning after I made the big move, I had a wonderfuldream in which I was surrounded by beautiful women who were all being very niceto me. In retrospect, it now seems likely that these were representations ofbenevolent, angelic extraterrestrial humans who were showing up almost everymorning in my dreams to give me strength, guidance, support, and encouragement.And again, I would later read in Session 86, Question 7 of the Law of One seriesthat during a dream, “while the so-called conscious mind rests, this adept maycall upon those which guide it, those presences which surround it, and, most ofall, the magical personality which is the higher self.”1[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber57] I did not consider that the people I wasinteracting with in dreams at the time were anyone or anything other thanprojections of my own subconscious mind.LOOKING FOR CONTACTOn the night of September 12, 1995, my friend Matt came over for a visit. He wasthe only person I knew who was as interested in UFOs as Artie was. We had a longconversation. I told him that I had now been studying UFOs nonstop for two and ahalf years and had read well over three hundred books. I had wished that theextraterrestrials would show themselves and talk to me somehow, since I wasdedicated to learning more about them. Matt’s answer was that perhaps theyalready had been in contact with me, and I just hadn’t been allowed to rememberit yet. I thought back to Artie’s experiences and realized Matt was absolutelyright. Whatever was happening to me was clearly a very positive and benevolentphenomenon, so I was not afraid to find out that I had been contacted. I wascertainly having a wealth of interesting dreams. At the time, I still did notrealize that dream contacts were just as authentic as waking ones.The next morning, on September 13, I realized I was dreaming and I capturedlucidity. I was at my childhood home, in the driveway, and now, in this state, Iwanted a solid answer about UFOs. I soared up into the air but discovered that Icould never get above a certain height. I did not see any crafts in the sky.Finally, in frustration, I cried out, “Where are you? Come to me! Showyourselves!” Nothing was happening, from what I could tell, except I did see twobizarre lights in the distance that appeared to be UFOs. I sank back down to theEarth and tried to run through a fence, to convince myself that everything wasjust a dream and I still had control over my environment. The fence stretchedlike a rubber band, but I couldn’t make my body pass through it, as I usuallywould have done in a lucid dream. After I awoke, I realized that the dream wastelling me I hadn’t prepared myself for any type of greater UFO contact, such asEdgar Cayce–style readings. The stretching fence seemed to indicate that therewas some sort of barrier in my mind and emotions that I hadn’t pushed throughyet.Part of the problem was that my job delivering pizzas was incredibly stressful.I was still learning how to drive the Subaru, and no matter how fast I made mydeliveries, they always wanted it to be faster. On the nights when it wasraining, the orders would go through the roof. I did not enjoy being inrainstorms, which now appears to be due to my past life experience with Yumi,plus it proved to be very difficult to see the numbers to find a particularhouse in the pouring rain—and people would be angry if their pizza was late.There was one night when I absolutely could not find the house I needed todeliver to, and I then dented the bumper on my car against a tree while backingup. I had a true “dark night of the soul” experience as I stood there andscreamed in the rain, soaked to the skin. Many people did not understand or carethat you are supposed to tip your delivery driver and would just say “keep thechange” when it was something like thirty-seven cents.ANOTHER CHANGE OF PLANSOn September 17, 1995, I went and visited a female friend, who I will callAngelica, at her apartment. I knew her from the music department at New Paltz,where I had a few classes, and I had always wanted to spend more time talking toher—but we were both very busy. I had already lent her my hardcover copy ofFingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock, which I felt was truly spectacular,and now I was going to visit her to get it back. Hancock had summarized much ofthe very best evidence I had encountered over the course of reading the threehundred books, many of which were on ancient civilizations. This included theidea that the “lost continent” of Atlantis was actually Antarctica, and that ourlast ice age from 12,500 years ago had been caused by the Earth shifting on itsaxis. Atlantis was inundated with water, and then in its new position at thesouth pole, the water flash-froze into the glacial ice we see today.There were some other facts in Hancock’s book that I had never seen before andwere completely amazing to me. Most notable was the work of Giorgio deSantillana and Hertha von Dechend. These were high-end, well-establishedhistorians with a long list of published scientific works to their names. Intheir epic masterpiece Hamlet’s Mill, they had searched through a variety ofhistorical records and had identified a total of thirty-five ancient spiritualtraditions around the world. For some inexplicable reason, every single one ofthese legends had encoded information in them about a strange 25,000-year cycle.The Earth would apparently counter-rotate on its axis over the course of about25,000 years, in a cycle with an imposing-sounding name: the Precession of theEquinoxes.This cycle would cause the stars in the night sky to drift one degree everyseventy-two years, if you looked at them on the same day each year—such as thespring or fall equinox. This meant that anyone who built an ancient stonemonument and aligned it to the stars could not keep it in alignment for verylong. The monument would drift out of position in only seventy-two years.Whoever wrote these ancient traditions clearly wanted us to understand this25,000-year cycle and study it in our own modern era. It was extremely bizarreto see this same mathematical and astronomical data encoded in all thesespiritual traditions that were isolated from one another, on differentcontinents, at different times in history.The 25,000-year cycle had also just gotten a huge boost through the work ofRobert Bauval, in his classic The Orion Mystery, which was originally publishedin 1994. I didn’t see it in the bookstore until the paperback version waspublished in 1995. Bauval noticed that the three pyramids of Giza preciselymatched the three stars in the belt of Orion. The relative sizes of the pyramidscorresponded to the brightness magnitudes of the stars, and their positions werethe same. The Nile River was positioned in the same place as the Milky Way inthe night sky. Other pyramids in the area were precisely aligned with stars aswell.What made this particularly fascinating was that, thanks to the 25,000-yeardrifting of stars in the night sky, the pyramids did not align with theircelestial counterparts unless you dialed the clock back to approximately 10,500BC. This would have occurred during the Age of Leo, and the Sphinx obviously hasthe body of a lion. The Sphinx also aligns with the constellation Leo on thehorizon during this same time period. The time window 10,500 BC was literallyonly ten years before the date Edgar Cayce’s readings gave for the constructionof the Great Pyramid: 10,490 to 10,390 BC. For a cycle spanning 25,000 years,this connection was almost impossibly perfect. I had already seen these Caycedates featured in many other books, and seeing it validated through ascientifically measurable star alignment was incredibly exciting. I was quitesurprised that Bauval himself had not spotted this connection in the book, so Ifelt I had made an original discovery. It had therefore been a huge sacrificefor me to lend Angelica a book that was this important to me—and now I was thereto make sure I got it back. On the way over to her apartment, I saw a couplekissing on a bench; they were obviously very much in love. I wondered if thiswas a synchronicity letting me know that Angelica and I had a future together.Angelica’s apartment was sparsely furnished, which was normal for a collegestudent. The only real furniture, apart from a mattress on the floor and akitchen table with chairs, was a maroon-colored coffee table. Each leg of thetable featured a stylized elephant head, and it was covered with gorgeous inlaywork, mostly of white tiles. Little did I know how important this table wouldbecome just over two months later. As I looked at the table, I felt the need totell Angelica about my train ride back from Boulder, and how I’d met these twoguys who were going to South Fallsburg, New York—less than an hour from where wewere now—to join an ashram founded by Baba Muktananda. I started my story bytelling her that the items on her sacred table reminded me of an amazing guru Ihad just heard about, named Muktananda.Angelica was absolutely shocked. “That’s my guru,” she said. “The ashram. I grewup there! Spent most of my life there. I only left so I could come here to go tocollege and get an education.” She was visibly shaking. This was a profoundsynchronicity. I was fascinated to hear what it was like to live in an ashram,particularly after I had heard the story of Muktananda throwing the ball oflight into his student’s third eye, sending him into a spasmodic fit of ecstasy.I began asking Angelica all sorts of questions. I found out that Muktananda’sdaughter, Gurumayi, was now running the place, and she didn’t seem to have anyof the “sidhi” powers her father once had. Nonetheless, she seemed to be a verygenuinely compassionate and loving person. Angelica ended up letting me borrowGurumayi’s new book, My Lord Loves a Pure Heart: The Yoga of Divine Virtues.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber58]After the amazing story I had heard on the train, and comparing that life to themiserable job I had now, I felt as if staying in a community like this wouldliterally be heaven on Earth.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber59] My friends onthe train were giving up their entire lives, including one man who wasrenouncing his doctorate, just to join this community. I had wanted to explorethe idea of joining the ashram myself but had been too busy surviving to pursueit. However, the more I talked with Angelica about it, the more I realized thateverything has its limitations.Angelica had grown up with very wealthy parents in Manhattan, who eventuallydivorced. Her mother took their entire family estate and handed it over to theashram in exchange for being allowed to live and work there for the rest of herlife. Angelica had then lived a cloistered life. It was extremely routine, andshe always had to work a job. There had been no outrageous darshan experience ofecstasy in her case. She had predominantly worked as a food server at the AmritCafé. It was always the same people, and there wasn’t much for anyone to talkabout after a while. There was also a strict celibacy rule for everyone livingthere—no sex or romantic involvements of any kind. Angelica was very glad to befree and to come back into the “real world” with the rest of us. She said, “Tome, the whole point is to get that knowledge and take it out of the ashram. Ifyou just go and stay there your whole life, then you will never really bring itto others who need it.”I felt genuinely dazzled by our conversation, and was buzzing with energy andlife as I walked home alone. Angelica did end up taking me down to the ashram afew weeks later. Although it was indeed beautiful, she pointed out a variety ofthings that got me to understand the problems she was talking about. There was alife-size golden statute of Muktananda’s own guru, a Buddha-like man named BadhiBaba, in the middle of a large prayer room. I noticed how people wereworshipping this statue, and some of them had a look on their faces that seemedmuch too proud and superior. It didn’t seem healthy to me. Ideally, a statuelike that would be only a reminder of the divinity we each have insideourselves.DREAMS FORECASTING A MAJOR EVENT IN THE NEAR FUTUREOn September 18, 1995, the day after I got my book back from Angelica, I had astrong series of dreams suggesting that Yumi was about to contact me and say shewas coming for a visit. I couldn’t remember all the details, but I definitelyknew what the overall theme had been. Shortly after I awoke, the phone wasringing—and it was Yumi. She told me that she had this terrible dream in which Iwas talking to a beautiful woman and developing romantic feelings for her. Ifelt that Yumi was misusing her psychic gifts in this case, and that on somelevel she was spying on me.I felt cornered, and denied that I had spoken with anyone, which was unusual forme to do. Yumi then proceeded to tell me that she was coming back to America tosee me in just a couple of weeks, and had already booked her tickets. This wasonly three months after she had left, I had thought for good, and the wholething felt quite overwhelming. In the notebook, after the dream that soperfectly predicted her impending call, I wrote, “All in all, we have here aclear-cut example of mental telepathic communication, wherein her ideas beforegoing to bed were transmitted to my dreaming brain in the morning with anastonishing degree of accuracy.”Yumi soon arrived and stayed for about ten days. Her hair had gotten longer andshe looked better than ever. We ended up having a great time. I got some timeoff work and on the days when I did have to go, I would spend time with herbefore I left. At one point, I brought her up to my favorite outlook in theShawangunk Mountains. I talked to her about the book I was reading by ZechariaSitchin, and how extraterrestrials had built the ancient monuments we see aroundthe world. I also told her that I now had every reason to believe we wereheading into a profound, worldwide spiritual activation event of some kind,which many people called Ascension. She had never seen a view like this, and thebeauty of the mountaintop led to her hearing and receiving the message on adeeper level than she ever had before.The next interesting dream I had during this time was on October 7, 1995. In it,there was a machine that had captured some spiritual entities and held them, sothey were unable to escape. At the end of the dream, they finally broke free andliterally consumed the highly negatively oriented man who had trapped them. Thisdream featured extraterrestrials, and the idea that the head on the Grays thateveryone sees may be nothing more than a helmet. As you may remember, in myinitial NASA briefing from 1993, I learned that one type of ETs were wearinghelmets that made them look like Grays. The dream told me that this might be ahelmet I myself could wear someday. Unlike the original NASA briefing, whichsaid that the face underneath the mask was troublesome looking, in this case thedream was using this symbol of the helmet to inspire me for something positive.The intel about the helmet had a deep emotional resonance with me, and greatlyhelped to fuel my passion for UFO studies. This dream was clearly prophetic ofmy future work in using my research to stand up to the darkest forces on planetEarth. Artie’s intriguing mysteries would take me many years to solve, but Ialready was well aware that we were being lied to on an almost unimaginablescale.Three days later, on October 10, 1995, I ended up being symbolized as a thinperson in a boxing match. My character realized that he was no match for thegiant he had to fight. He was terrified at the size of his opponent. Once thefight began, everyone in the audience, including his opponent, transformed intohideous monsters. The main character then turned into a monster of his own,cartoonish and whimsical instead of terrifying and ugly. In this persona, heeffortlessly and savagely destroyed his opponent. He looked at the bloodymonster he had defeated and at the audience, and he felt disgusted by theirmonstrosity and trapped in their world of violence. This again seemed to beprophetic of my future career, where I would often use whimsical humor to exposevery dark secrets.Two days later, on October 12, 1995, I had a dream in which I was traveling withmy UFO friend Matt to investigate an apparent UFO encounter. For some reason, wewere extremely frightened about what might happen when we got there. Nothingmuch seemed to happen. I finally ended up driving back home without Matt. Ifound myself at the intersection where I saw the shooting star and had theenormous surge of energy come up through my feet. I saw my mother washing hercar on a round, rotating pedestal in the middle of this same intersection. Thecar represented a vehicle that would allow me to travel much faster through thespirit world, and very clearly could have symbolized a UFO. However, I knewsomething was wrong as soon as I approached Mom, because she seemed to beextremely disturbed.As soon as I got close to her, she told me that our house cat Mandy had died. AsI wrote up this dream, I knew Mandy was a symbolic representation of my animalself, such as the ego and the childlike id. Mom explained to me that Mandy hadto face her UFO double, who was significantly larger, and that she had died inthe process. This could symbolize the “shamanic death” that occurs when youundergo a profound transformation in how you see yourself and your relationshipto the universe around you, and that was already starting to happen to me at thetime. In the dream, Mom somehow knew that this death had happened, even thoughshe hadn’t actually seen it yet. The dream also reminded me of when Artie wastold about his father’s alleged trip to the hospital. He had been out in thestreet, in roughly the same position relative to his house as I was to the carin this dream. When Artie first told me that story, I had visualized the sceneas if it had happened in this exact same location. I always felt that Artie’sfather had gotten pulled into some kind of a black project rather than havingdied.Since my household cat had to face her own UFO double, and had died in theprocess, this dream seemed to be predicting that I was soon going to learnsomething interesting about myself that was UFO-related. Like Artie’s father,this discovery would take me into an entirely new and different world. I wouldapparently see that I had a “UFO double” that was “much bigger,” on the soullevel, than I had seen myself as being until then. In the process, the person Ihad been until then, at least in the egoic sense, would be seriouslytransformed.The dream then shifted and I found myself in a grocery store. I called out formy UFO friend Matt, but he was nowhere to be found. I was very, very nervous,but I didn’t even really know why. I saw a dish that had a giant leek sitting onit, and I was compelled to walk over and pick it up. In the dream, however, Iknew that by choosing to pick up this leek, I would be agreeing to face my ownimpending extraterrestrial contact alone. I realized that if I ever found myselfstanding face-to-face with actual, live Grays, that could prove to be anextremely terrifying experience. Nonetheless, I was brave enough to walk overand pick up the leek anyway. I knew the choice meant I was putting myself on atimeline where this future meeting with extraterrestrials would become utterlyinevitable. Ironically, I did not realize they were meeting with me almost everymorning in my dreams. This prophecy referred only to a deepening of the contactinto accurate spoken transmissions, and the realization that I was far morerelated to them than I had ever thought.On October 27, 1995, well after Yumi had returned to Japan, I had a dreamwherein most of the floor in my father’s house had been removed, and a giant pithad been dug in the dirt right below it. An archaeological dig was beingconducted, and the archaeologists had found a series of archaic masks buriedunderground in the area. My father’s house happened to be directly above thesite where the bulk of this ancient treasure was now expected to be found. Atthis point, we had not yet uncovered what we were digging for, but we knew wewere very close—and I was a part of this same team. This again suggested that Iwas going to learn something quite profound about myself and my lineage. Thegolden beings in my epic KISS dream had faces that looked like masks, and thesemasks had the same Mayan-type appearance. There was no sense of the heaviness ornegativity of the masks people were wearing in Artie’s fleeting childhoodmemory. The dream seemed to say that this new discovery would lead to merealizing that I had a connection to something that was very ancient and highlyvaluable.A JOB AT THE MENTAL HOSPITALAfter several weeks of suffering with the pizza delivery job, I decided that Ihad to do something better. Since I didn’t have to work until 4:00 P.M., I hadmost of the day to look for other work. Yumi’s arrival and emotional support hadinspired me to begin the search. One of the jobs I applied for was at a localhospital, in the mental ward. With my new bachelor’s degree in psychology, I gotin as a tech as of about November 3, 1995. I was there to assist the nurses. Atthe time, I still wanted to get a PhD in psychology, and I felt that a job inthe mental health field was of critical importance to building a residencycredit for my degree. This job proved to be my final break with the materialworld before the much deeper awakening experiences began occurring immediatelyafterward. At times, I was greatly harassed and disrespected by the patients,which seemed to be a normal thing that all the nurses and techs went through inthe ward. I did my best to keep the peace and be friendly to the patients, eventhough I was told that I “had nothing to offer them” and to just perform myduties with a minimum of social interaction. So many strange and upsettingthings happened to me in just two and a half weeks that I was completelyoverwhelmed. I could write a whole play or movie script out of those experiencesthat would run the viewer through the full spectrum of human emotions.The early wake-up time I had to hit for this job made it very difficult tocapture dreams, but five days after it started, on November 8, 1995, I pulled inquite an epic one. In one section, I was looking at some sort of intricate,elaborate set of star maps that were used for space travel. Someone was tellingme that traveling through a galaxy involved a great deal of work. You couldn’tjust go from point A to point B. You had to make a series of jumps along theway. Eight years later, after I met my first mega-insider, Daniel, in 2003, Idiscovered that we do indeed have a network of “stargates” thatextraterrestrials use to travel around the galaxy. They were built in veryancient times and use existing wormholes that naturally appear between stars,and can be seen by their plasma filaments. In my dream, traveling from onegalaxy to another was a tremendous proposition, and it caused me to have a veryodd feeling throughout my entire body.As the dream went on, I learned about a manned mission to Pluto. At the sametime that I heard about the mission, I had a rubber ball model of the planet inmy hands. I was squeezing the ball, and the people I was talking to were tellingme that Pluto wasn’t much different from Earth inside. It had grass, trees,animals, birds, rivers, lakes, and oceans stocked with fish. I found this quitefascinating and hard to believe, but I did trust them. As I looked at the ball,I noticed that it appeared almost identical to the levitating Martian moonPhobos from my fantastic earlier dream where I had met the golden beings. Fromthere, I started thinking about all the shattered moonlets of Uranus andNeptune, and how the author Zecharia Sitchin thought that they proved theexistence of the tenth planet, Nibiru. I then saw a visual image of this hiddenplanet in the dream as being grayish-white.At this point, I woke up suddenly and looked at the clock. It was exactly 5:55,and I was greatly surprised. I felt the digits were burning into my soul, and itwas immensely powerful. I had to wonder if I actually was receiving some sort ofdream class from extraterrestrials, for these were very strange and vividconcepts. At the same time, it felt quite comfortable in the dream. It was niceto have this experience while I was going through hell at my job. Many yearslater, insiders would reveal that a variety of moons in our solar system do haveEarth-like habitable worlds inside them, complete with clouds, rainfall, rivers,lakes, oceans, forests, meadows, and plenty of beautiful places to live. This isone of the many benefits of having highly advanced technology.RESIGNATION AND REALIZATIONI could easily fill two or more chapters of this book with hundreds of specificdetails about how difficult my job was during this time. Ultimately, on themorning of November 20, 1995, I wrote my resignation letter. I didn’t bring itin with me that day, but as it turned out, I didn’t need to. Once again, I hadreceived a crystal-clear prophetic vision. My boss called me into his officefirst thing in the morning and told me I was being fired. When I asked him for areason, he said it was because I was too friendly to the patients. They wantedsomeone who would just do their job and not offer any conversation or opinions;that was the treatment team’s responsibility, not mine. Even with a bachelor’sdegree in psychology and a master’s equivalent from suicide-hotline internships,they did not consider me to be educated enough to share my own thoughts withanyone. I was completely dumbfounded. I had gotten a psychology degree to beable to help people, and I certainly felt that being friendly was an essentialelement of that process.I cried heavily when I got back to my car as I watched our local family of aboutfifteen wild turkeys glide by. I was well aware that I had taken this job onlyto help me get a PhD so I could eventually become a respected UFO researcher.The job was horribly stressful and had nearly ruined my life after only two anda half weeks. In just the last two days or so before I got fired, I had startedlearning to ignore the patients and maintain complete control over the ward—andthis had frightened me. Had I kept doing it, my entire personality could havechanged. I nonetheless still felt like an enormous failure for getting fired,and I had no idea what to do next.When I got home, I was curious to revisit my journal entry of what I had dreamedthat morning. At some point in that dream, there had been an exciting airshowlike we used to have at the local military base every year in my hometown ofScotia, New York. In this case, I saw colossal aircraft that were flying muchtoo close to the ground. They looked almost exactly the same as the UFOs I hadseen in the dreams I used to have when I was very young. The craft were alsosomewhat dented, and I could see inside one of them. To my surprise, this craftappeared to be completely empty inside, and I wondered who or what was flyingit. The obvious implication in this dream was that I would soon be able to flysuch a craft myself, at least in the greater spiritual sense. The craft hererepresented my greater spiritual body and the ability that it had to traverseinto unforeseen realms.As I was watching this, I noticed that a woman was standing next to me who wasexotic-looking and beautiful. She was a recurring character who had shown up ina variety of other UFO-related dreams. Now she finally revealed to me that shewas part human and part extraterrestrial. I felt an incredible kinship andconnection to her, as if we had known each other over the course of manydifferent lifetimes. However, after I woke up, I still didn’t believe this dreamwas “real,” and I simply assumed that she represented a more spiritual aspect ofmy own personality structure.Many years later, as I reread this dream for the first time while writing thisbook, I was surprised to see that she precisely matched Corey Goode’sdescription of the Anshar priestesses. The Anshar claim to be human beings fromEarth’s own future who had to travel back in time to ensure that they were notdefeated by a negative extraterrestrial group. If we as human beings fail toreach our Ascension, the Anshar claim that they will cease to exist. The woman’scalming presence in the dream clearly let me know that I did not need to put upwith the horrible stress of the mental hospital job any longer. She and herfriends certainly did not want me turning into a prison warden. Her peacefulpresence had inspired me to write my resignation letter as soon as I woke up.Little did I know that I would be fired before I was brave enough to bring theletter in and finish the job myself.FROM ELSEWHERE: THE BOOK THAT CHANGED MY LIFEI drove back up to my mother’s house for Thanksgiving break, and I stopped offat a Barnes and Noble, on Wolf Road in Albany, New York, on the way home. Iwould always go straight to the UFO section and look for any new releases. Forme, this was the equivalent of going to the movies or reading the headlines in anewspaper. This time, in November 1995, I saw a new orange-and-black hardcoverbook called From Elsewhere: Being E.T. in America. The author was ScottMandelker, PhD, which immediately caught my eye. He had already achieved thesame honor I had hoped to earn for myself. When I read the author’s biography onthe inside jacket cover, I was quite surprised to discover that he had earned aPhD in East-West psychology from none other than the Naropa Institute. Thisimmediately struck me as an intriguing synchronicity, since I was still dealingwith the fallout from having been rejected by this same school. Mandelker hadalready achieved my dream—earning a PhD and becoming a published authordiscussing UFOs.The tagline on Mandelker’s book cover was “The Subculture of Those Who Claim toBe of Non-Earthly Origins.” As I read the inside jacket, it was clear thatMandelker’s name for this type of “ET soul” was Wanderer. Admittedly, my firstresponse was sarcastic laughter. “A PhD, huh? Just look at the title.Non-Earthly Origins. People are people. They are born and die here on Earth.This guy is crazy.” However, as I held the book in my hands, I could feel ittingling with an almost unbearable amount of energy. It was alive, electric,crackling and buzzing with what seemed like a very high vibrational field. I hadnever felt anything like that coming off a physical object before, and I hadexperimented with “psychometry,” obtaining psychic information from a physicalobject, since reading about it as a teenager. I soon realized by flippingthrough the book that Mandelker was basing the majority of his argument on aseries of 106 Edgar Cayce–style intuitive readings known as the Law of One. Ihad already flipped through Book Three of the Law of One at the same bookstoreand found it to be so densely written that, at the time, I was not interested inpursuing it any further. Ultimately, I would find that the term Wandererappeared in eighty-eight different passages throughout the material.4[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber60]I opened the book to appendix 2, a twelve-part Wanderer Questionnaire. Accordingto Mandelker, a Wanderer was an alleged ET soul. This was a person who hadvolunteered to become human, but their soul had originated in higher realms, orhigher “densities,” as the Law of One called it. At those levels, these soulshad already integrated the basic lessons that Earth could teach us, such asthrough understanding and mastering karma. They came here because our planet wasin an unusually extreme amount of trouble compared to most other third-densityworlds. In the higher realms, it was as if we were all screaming and crying forhelp, and these benevolent, angelic beings could not ignore the call.Part of the Wanderer’s contract was called the Forgetting: They had to agree toforget who and what they really are. Only through intense spiritual work couldthey bring some but not all of the memories back. However, there was a definitesilver lining for anyone consciously choosing a path like this. Mandelkerreferred back to passages such as Session 36, Question 17, showing thatWanderers can make progress much faster on Earth than is possible in the higher“densities” they came from:> The Wanderer has the potential of greatly accelerating the density [from]> whence it comes in its progress in evolution. This is due to the intensive> life experiences and opportunities of the third density [like you now> experience on Earth]. Thusly the positively-oriented Wanderer chooses to> hazard the danger of the forgetting in order to be of service to others by> radiating love of others.5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber61]Another very fascinating point that Mandelker focused on was that the Wandererwould never be authorized to fully activate its true potential while living onEarth. Otherwise, that person would have magnificent superhero abilities,including levitation and telekinesis. This was explained in Session 65, Question19 of the Law of One, as follows:> The forgetting process can be penetrated to the extent of the Wanderer> remembering what it is and why it is upon the planetary sphere. However, it> would be an infringement if Wanderers penetrated the forgetting so far as to> activate the more dense bodies and thus be able to live, shall we say, in a> god-like manner. This would not be proper for those who have chosen to serve.6> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber62]I had experienced many lucid dreams by this point, where these magnificentabilities were literally effortless. Throughout my life, I had felt that I oncehad abilities like this but could not access them now, and it was greatlyfrustrating.THE WANDERER QUESTIONNAIREIn short, Scott Mandelker said that if you could answer enough of these twelvequestions in the affirmative, then it meant that you were likely a Wanderer. AsI reported at the end of The Ascension Mysteries, this was the most incrediblypersonal and revealing set of questions I had ever seen. Somehow, Mandelker hadput together a list of questions that showed a deeper knowledge of me, and howmy mind and spirit really worked, than even my own parents could have understoodat the time. It was deeply and intensely personal, and incredibly profound. Iwould never have imagined that someone could have put all these strange thingstogether into a single questionnaire, and in my case, almost every singlequestion was a powerful yes. Here is the original list: 1. You were often lost in daydreams of ETs, UFOs, other worlds, space traveland utopian societies as a child. Your family thought you were “a bit odd,”without knowing quite why. 2. You always felt like your parents were not your true parents, that your realfamily was far away and hidden. Perhaps you thought things around you weresomehow “not the way they should be,” and reminded you of life somewhere “faraway.” These beliefs may have caused you a great deal of pain and sorrow. Youfelt “out of place.” 3. You’ve had one or more vivid UFO experiences (in a dream or during wakinghours) which dramatically changed your life: they helped resolve doubts,inspired confidence and hope, and gave you meaning and greater purpose. Fromthen on, you knew you were a different person. Like a spiritual wake-up call, itchanged your life. 4. You are genuinely kind, gentle, harmless, peaceful, and nonaggressive (notjust sometimes, but almost always). You are not much interested in money andpossessions, so if “someone must do without,” it is usually you—such is yourhabitual self-sacrifice. Acts of human cruelty, violence and perpetual globalwarfare seem really strange (shall we say, alien?). You just can’t figure outall this anger, rage and competition. 5. You have a hard time recognizing evil and trickery: some people call younaive (and they’re right!). When you do perceive genuine negativity in yourmidst, you recoil in horror and may feel shocked that “some people really dothings like that.” In a subtle way, you actually feel confused. Perhaps youvaguely sense having known a world free of such disharmony. 6. The essence of your life is serving others (be they family, friends, or in aprofession), and you cherish great ideals, which may also be somewhat innocentand naive (in worldly terms). But you sincerely, deeply hope to improve theworld. A lot of disappointment and frustration comes when such hopes and dreamsdon’t materialize. 7. You completely embrace the scientific temperament, with a cool, reasonable,and measured approach to life. Human passion and red hot desire seem strange:you are baffled. Romance and the entire world of feelings are truly foreign toyour natural way. You always analyze experiences, and so people say you’realways in your head—which is true! (Note: This type of Wanderer is less common,and probably wouldn’t be reading this book—their skepticism would be too great!Such an “odd bird” is probably a brilliant scientist.) 8. You easily get lost in science fiction, medieval epic fantasy (like TheHobbit) and visionary art. Given a choice, you’d much prefer to live in yourdreams of the past or future than in the present. Sometimes you consider yourEarth life boring and meaningless, and wish you could go to a perfect, excitingworld. Such dreams have been with you a long time. 9. You have an insatiable interest in UFOs, life on other worlds or previousEarth civilizations such as Atlantis or Lemuria. Sometimes you feel like you’vereally been there, and may even go back someday. There may be quite a few ofsuch books on your bookshelves. (Actually, this question is a giveaway, sinceonly Wanderers and Walk-ins have profound, undying curiosity about worldsbeyond—and for good reason!) 10. You have a strong interest in mystic spirituality (East or West), boththeory and practice, with a deep sense that you used to have greater powers andsomehow lost them. You may feel it’s unnecessary to discipline yourself since“you’ve already been there,” but somehow forgot what you used to know. Peoplemay doubt your resolve, but you know it’s not that simple. 11. You have become a conscious channel for ETs or some other non-Earthsource—and you realize that the purpose of your life is to help others grow andevolve. (Most likely, you’re no longer sleeping, Wanderer!) 12. You feel, and perhaps all your life have felt tremendous alienation and asense of never quite fitting in. Maybe you hope to be like others, try your bestto be “normal,” or imagine yourself like everyone else—but the bottom line isthat you simply feel different and always have. There is a very real fear ofnever finding a place in this world. (Which you might not! Note: This is theclassic profile of Wanderers.)7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber63]The only No answers I had were that I had never had a waking UFO sighting, onlyin dreams, and I had not achieved “conscious contact” with extraterrestrialbeings—whatever that meant. I even identified strongly with Question 7, for Idid have an intensely scientific mind-set and had been a miserable failure atrelationships, not feeling confident enough to get a girlfriend until I was asenior in college, and then having significant problems once I finally did.At this point, I looked to see if any other books caught my eye. I reached outand grabbed The Mayan Factor by José Argüelles. I opened the book at random, andto my utter surprise, I arrived on page 100, which had a large image of theexact same shape I had carved into a piece of jewelry in an art class I took inmy senior year of high school. The symbol looked like a question mark with asquiggly tail. I had no idea that this symbol meant anything at the time Isculpted it. The Mayan version had a box that was drawn around this shape, andthat was really the only difference from the stylized version of it that I made.However, I was surprised by what Argüelles said this symbol meant—the captionread, “CIB: Ability to contact and commune with Galactic Consciousness.” Thatwas very intense. There were many clues in my life suggesting that I was indeedmoving toward some sort of Edgar Cayce–style telepathic contact with higherintelligence.Even better, I had carved this pin as part of a two-pin set. The other pin was aStar Trek communicator—what they would touch when they wanted to talk to theEnterprise. I now felt even more upset that my drug use and desire to escapehigh school had led me to abandon all the contents in my locker at the end ofthe year, since those two pins had been in it. At the time, I was so distractedthat I never even thought about it—I just had to get out of there. Myabandonment of these items would haunt me in nightmares for many yearsafterward.I took Scott Mandelker’s book home to my mother’s house and had already startedreading it before heading over to her parents’ house for Thanksgiving dinner. Itwas very difficult to tear myself away from the book for a family gathering, andmeeting my mother’s side of the family like this was always tense.GREAT STRESS AND TRANSFORMATIONMy maternal grandparents were intense fundamentalist Christians and my motherdefinitely was not. They had essentially adopted another family from theirchurch, and those boys had far larger and more prominent photographs in thechina cabinet than Michael and I did. During the dinner, things took a suddenturn from simmering, unspoken tension to maximum intensity. My grandmothersuddenly lost the ability to breathe comfortably. She started gasping, wheezing,and clutching her chest. For a brief moment, I wondered if she was pulling somesort of inappropriate and elaborate joke, but this was absolutely real. No onewas laughing. I could hardly believe what was happening, but all of a sudden, wehad to call an ambulance.The speed with which the medical personnel arrived was astonishing. It honestlyseemed like it was less than three minutes before my grandparents’ house wasoverrun with people wearing red jackets. If this had been a dream, it was as ifthe extraterrestrials had arrived at the exact moment of disaster, when weneeded them the most. They had flashlights on their heads. They had loudwalkie-talkies that beeped and barked out military-sounding communications inbetween loud hissing noises. They were suddenly putting my grandmother on astretcher and carrying her out in a matter of seconds. My grandfather collapsedinto my arms and sobbed uncontrollably, and I cried along with him. We hadbonded very nicely when he taught me how to drive in high school. The wholeexperience was extremely difficult to endure and process emotionally. Grandmasoon transitioned from the emergency room into a full-time nursing home, whereshe later passed away. She would never again see the interior of her house afterthat traumatic night.I knew that this whole event had dreamlike significance. Some part of me thatembraced traditional beliefs and resisted all the “weird, metaphysical stuff,”just like my grandmother, was now dying. The emergency personnel could easilyrepresent extraterrestrials in the dream world. In the dream where I had to facemy own UFO double, my mother told me that our beloved cat had passed away. Now Ihad a very bizarre experience with my grandmother nearly dying right after Istarted reading a book that was convincingly arguing that I was indeed anextraterrestrial soul. I had also seen many signs that my maternal grandfatherhad been dominated by his wife for many, many years, and on this very night, itstopped forever. Mom eventually had Grandpa move in with her and took care ofhim for several years. In the symbolism of the Tarot cards, the Death card onlysymbolized a transformation from one type of mind-set and lifestyle to another.The pain and angst of this chaotic family scene caused me to throw myself intoScott Mandelker’s book even more intensely. Starting the very next morning, Iread it cover to cover, and then started from the beginning and reread it onceagain over the course of two or three days. Mandelker had interviewed a varietyof people who had come to him for counseling services, and whom he had thenidentified as “extraterrestrial souls,” or Wanderers. Like the medical personnelI had just seen in action, the Wanderers were here to intervene in what theyconsidered to be a planetary spiritual emergency. In the questionnaire, he saidthat if you believed this is who and what you are, you needed to commit yourselfto finding the truth. If you ask the Universe for proof, the Universe willprovide you with some sort of answer—if you have properly prepared yourself toreceive it.SEEKING CONFIRMATIONAfter my second read through the book, I knew I had to try something. I went upand visited Jude, my best friend from high school, at a new rental house he andhis fiancée were repainting on the shore of Lake George. I described the entirebook to him as we looked at the lights on the opposite side of the lake. Iimagined we were standing on some alien world, looking out at futuristicbuildings in the distance. Jude revealed that he had been going through his oldstuff just two days ago in the course of preparing for this move, and found a“dream” he had written up from around the time he was in kindergarten, at agefive. He had been so excited about this dream that he wrote it up and presentedit to his kindergarten teacher. Again, with my background in UFO research, Istrongly suspected this was not a dream at all.In his dream, two men came to him in his bedroom and brought him outside hishouse. He could distinctly feel the cold of the nighttime air. To his amazement,there was a huge “submarine” floating in his backyard, and they brought himright into it! The door closed, and they sat him down and gave him a ride. Asthis ship traveled through space, he saw many wonderful things and got a nicetour of the solar system. The men finally brought him back to his room and puthim safely back in bed—and then the dream ended.For some reason, Jude had thrown away that old piece of paper, seeing it asnothing more than an old dream. However, as soon I told him of my ownexperiences with recent prophetic dreams, leading up to the discovery ofMandelker’s book, Jude wished he could have gotten the paper back. I read thepersonality descriptions to Jude right out of the book, and together we startedto realize that we both fit the Wanderer Questionnaire to a tee. Both of us weresensitive, dedicated to others, creative, and obsessed with UFOs, metaphysics,and fantasy. Both of us had an extremely powerful mystical experience at aroundage five, and we were both shocked to realize that this was part of the“pattern.” (The detail about having an experience around five years of age wasnot in the questionnaire itself, but it did appear in the main body of thebook’s text.) We both felt as if we were on a mission to save the planet. Wewere often taken advantage of by others, we were nonviolent, we engaged inhelping professions like counseling, and we were unable to understand negativityor evil. Since Jude had mentioned a cylinder-shaped “submarine,” I told himthere were numerous reports of cigar-shaped UFOs in the literature.I had nearly identical UFO dreams as a child, with identical-sounding craft, andthey often led to my having long conversations with the old man. Mandelkersuggested that one’s “ET Family” would reconnect with you once you were bornhere, and they would usually erase your memory of these events after theyhappened—but not always. Either way, some greater part of yourself wasabsolutely aware of all the ET contacts you had, and once you reached the end ofyour normal biological life, all those memories would come flooding back.The paint fumes in Jude’s house were too much, so we went back to his fiancée’sparents’ house in Queensbury, New York. We agreed that we needed to try someform of intuitive communication to get the answer to the question of whether ornot we were ET souls. I decided that we should try “automatic writing,” in whichyou try to get your nondominant hand to write on its own. The house was almostpitch-black, so to get started we had to turn on a few lights. As I reached forone light switch, I could hardly believe my eyes: There in the dining room,adjacent to the kitchen, was a table that was obviously from India. It wassquare, had a red stain, and lots of white tile inlays, and each table leglooked like a stylized elephant’s head and trunk.To my utter amazement, this was exactly the same table design that I had been sofond of at Angelica’s place. Angelica had all her sacred items on this sametable, and as soon as I saw them, I said they reminded me of Muktananda. Then Ihad learned that Angelica spent most of her childhood and adolescence inMuktananda’s ashram. The guys I met on the train were going out to that sameashram to stay, and one of them had experienced a true miracle of darshan fromMuktananda’s advanced “sidhi” powers. Now I was about to try to use my ownabilities, however small they might be, to try to determine if I was anextraterrestrial soul. The synchronicity of seeing the same table in both placeswas so powerful that I could feel a physical pressure on my head as I strove toput it all together. There was clearly something special about the place we werein, and what we were about to try.Each of us then taped a piece of paper down on the floor, blanked out our minds,went into a deep state of meditation, and allowed the pencil to move on its own.As I tuned in deeper and deeper, I could hear three words coming through that myhand wanted to turn into writing: “Chasten. Awareness. Hostile.” I let my handwrite each word. I meditated on these three words and realized that I did have asleazy side, and I could certainly be more chaste—as in pure and virtuous. Idefinitely needed to cultivate my awareness, and there was also a part of mypersonality that had become hostile after my dysfunctional relationship and astring of bad jobs. It was only a few weeks ago that I was screaming in anger atthe top of my lungs after crashing my car into a tree. So far, everything madesense. Now I felt I was too close to the work, for I shouldn’t be understandingor analyzing anything that my hand was writing. I tuned in deeper and felt myhand doing some slow, curving lines back and forth across the same space. I hadno idea what, if anything, I was writing.At this point, I decided to try concentrating even harder. I put all my focus onmy third-eye area, crossing both my eyes and looking up at it with my eyesclosed. I tried to pull myself as deeply into trance as I possibly could, reallyfocusing on the power of my breath. Suddenly and without warning, my hand jumpedto life and started doing a bunch of things all by itself. Very quickly, itscribbled something out. The only character I was distinctly aware of writingwas the letter X. Otherwise, I had no idea what it said or what had justhappened, but I knew exactly when it was over. I immediately threw the pencildown, and said, “Jude, turn on the lights! Something crazy just happened.”Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEPREPARING FOR CONTACTIt was November 1995. I had just lost my job at the mental hospital for being“too friendly to the patients,” and in despair, I tried “automatic writing” toask the burning question of whether I was an ET soul. Many different dreams hadalready been strongly suggesting that I would find the answer. As I was in adeep trance state, my left, non-writing hand had traced out legible words on thepaper taped to the floor. The first encoded message had appeared from acombination of slow, curving lines that my hand had drawn forward and backward.When you read the lines together, they clearly and undeniably said “ChristCometh.” This was quite surprising to me, since I was not at all raised to bereligious. My mother felt she had escaped from her fundamentalist Christianfamily and wanted nothing to do with it. I had just been through the upsettingevent of watching my grandmother being taken to the emergency room duringThanksgiving dinner, which of course caused me to think about mortality, theafterlife, and their intense Christian beliefs. My father’s parents would go tochurch for Christmas, funerals, and the occasional strawberry festival, but thatwas about it. Christianity had always felt like a dangerous and confused subjectthat I tried to avoid whenever possible.Now my own hand had written “Christ Cometh” when I asked the question aboutwhether or not I was an extraterrestrial/angelic soul. The answer was certainlydeeper than the question. Jude also noticed that the last two letters of Comethalso looked like the word Ra, written with a capital R and a lowercase A. Theword Ra was clearly smaller and on a lower level than the rest of the phrase,but it was legible. I didn’t think this was a genuine discovery at the time,although it did occur to me that Scott Mandelker had based most of his researchon the Law of One series. The name of the alleged entity speaking in those bookswas Ra—just like the word that had appeared in my automatic writing.Then, on the next line down, my hand had suddenly jumped to life and written ashort burst of letters and numbers very quickly. The lines were extra fine, butonce we saw them in the light, I could clearly read them. The writing was a verybizarre eleven-letter code sequence. The capitalizations and the spacing havebeen preserved exactly as they appeared:> EC 40 57 & oxenI have to say that, at this point, the excitement was almost overpowering. Thiscode had somehow come through me without my conscious awareness whatsoever. Itwas a mystery . . . a puzzle. And ciphers can be broken. It looked as if theentire room was vibrating with visible sparkles of light. It didn’t take us verylong in this state to figure out that EC 40 57 must be a Bible quote. Despitethe fact that Jude’s fiancée’s family were staunch Christians, we had a reallyhard time finding a Bible. We eventually located a black leather-bound copyinside a wooden chest, on top of some blankets. I had never felt so happy aboutseeing a Bible in my entire life. The smell of the leather, the feel of the softcover in my hands . . . in that moment, it was pure perfection. It had theanswers I was looking for.We immediately opened the book to Ecclesiastes, since the code started with EC,but there was no verse 40. Chapter 1 ended with verse 18. Jude was devastated;he was really hoping we would find something. “Wait a minute,” I said. Isuddenly remembered information I had read in one of the metaphysical books overthe last three years. The chapter markers were only added in later. In the earlyyears, Bible quotes were only counted by the verse number. I told Jude that weshould start reading at 40 verses after the beginning, and end on 57 versesafter the beginning. We quickly did the math and realized that this wouldgenerate a quote of Ecclesiastes 2:22–3:13. That was it! We had cracked thecode! Best of all, the passage began with 2:22. This was anotherrepeating-number synchronicity, just like the ones I had been seeing almostdaily ever since I had started doing my UFO research, most frequently on digitalclocks. The opening number 2:22 felt absolutely like a part of the message—as ifI was finally discovering the supernatural contact that all of thesesynchronicities had been leading me toward.My hands were trembling and I could barely hold back tears as I started readingthe words out loud. I do not remember which version of the Bible I was readingfrom, but this passage from the New International Version is about as close as Ican find online: “What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving withwhich they labor under the sun? All their days their work is grief and pain;even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.”1[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber64] I had to stop right there. I was devastatedabout losing my job at the mental hospital, and even more devastated about beingrejected by the only metaphysical graduate school I had applied to. I certainlyhad enough anxiety that it was causing me to suffer with insomnia, as thepassage described. Now it was as if some higher intelligence was sitting upthere with a Bible, and found the single most important quote that I could havepossibly heard at that time. The message was obvious: The mental ward was areally rough job, and it wasn’t anywhere near as important for my future as Ithought it would be. In fact, the whole thing was “meaningless.” That was quitea powerful statement, and not one I could easily ignore. To do that job, I wouldhave needed to violate the core of my being and treat people as a prison wardendoes. And I knew there was no way this quote could have been hiding somewhere inmy subconscious, for I had never read the Bible.Then, as the passage moved on into chapter 3, it went through a series of versesthat were made immortal by the Byrds in their classic hit song “Turn, Turn,Turn.” I honestly didn’t even know those lyrics had come out of the Bible, andyet here were these timeless rock and roll lyrics in Ecclesiastes—minus therepetition of the words turn, turn, turn. Out loud I read:> To every thing, there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven: A> time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up> that which is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break> down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to> mourn, and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather> stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; a> time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; a> time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;> a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.2> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber65]Now these words took on far greater significance. The passage was all aboutcycles of birth and death, metaphorically and literally. Clearly, it appearedthat some higher intelligence had picked out this quote for me. This was nodream—this was absolutely happening to me in real life. There was no way I couldhave consciously known about this passage in the Bible. Losing the graduateschool and then the mental health job felt like a death, and my grandmothernearly died just days later on Thanksgiving. There were multiple references todeath and mourning in this passage. With the constant repetition of themetaphors of new birth in it as well, I was clearly being shown, as it said atthe beginning, that the loss of this job and the graduate school education wasindeed “meaningless.” The last line in the coded passage was Ecclesiastes 3:13,and I will never forget the exact wording within whatever version of the Bible Iwas reading at the time, which I have not been able to relocate online. It said,“To eat and drink, and be happy in one’s toil: This is the grace of God.” Now Ifelt I understood the message even more. Right now, the main goal was to find ajob that I could be happy with—a job that could pay me enough to eat and drinkand have a place to live. My future was very likely going to involve some deeperlevel of the telepathic contact that I had just experienced. Now the challengewas to figure out how I could get additional results that were as good as whathad happened with automatic writing.THE BEAST OF BURDEN?My scribbled automatic writing ended with an ampersand, the “and” symbol,followed by the word oxen. I immediately understood what this meant, as it useddreamlike symbolism to convey a message. Earlier that summer, one of a varietyof my temp jobs was with ADT Home Security at the Altamont Fair. My job was toget people interested enough in a home alarm system to agree to be contacted bya sales representative. My booth was directly behind the chicken barn and it wasalways very noisy and smelly. Directly next to me was a woman from Kenya,selling gorgeous dark statues of wild African animals that her husband hadcarved out of ebony. We had long conversations between bursts of customers. Ifinally bought the ox sculpture for twenty-two dollars, which was a hugesacrifice for me at the time, nearly four hours’ worth of my pay. I felt thiswould be a good symbol for me now that I had finished college and needed toenter the working world and become a “beast of burden.” I had accepted my fate,and the sculpture would help me have a good laugh about it. I also knew I wasborn in the Year of the Ox in the Chinese Zodiac.When I asked the woman what the ox meant to people in her culture, she justlaughed and said, “You Americans always want these animals to mean something.” Ichuckled, and decided to rephrase the question. I wanted her to explain thisanimal’s role and behavior in Kenya, in order to tap into any dreamlikesymbolism it might hold. By this point, I had been analyzing my dreams on adaily basis for almost three years. I said, “This is an ox, right? A beast ofburden. You hitch up your plow to it, crack the whip, and get it to dig out yourcrops all day for you.” The woman laughed. “Oh no,” she said. “This is a waterbuffalo. One of the three most dangerous animals in all of Kenya. If you seethis animal and you are more than three hundred feet away, you run like crazy.If you see one closer than three hundred feet, you pray for a quick death.” Iwas quite surprised to hear this, and asked her what would happen. The waterbuffalo would run toward you at a very high speed, gut you with its horns, throwyou up into the air, and then trample you after you hit the ground. It wouldcontinue to repeat the process until you had stopped moving.At the time, I thought this was ironic. Perhaps I wasn’t going to become a“slave to the system” by having to get a real job. Perhaps I would actuallybecome a powerful force, in this case for good. Now this dreamlike metaphor hadbecome far more significant, because the word oxen was included at the end of aBible quote that had just told me my old job was meaningless, and I needed tofind something I could be happy with. The greater message was that I was notgoing to become a “beast of burden” at all. Instead, I had the potential tobecome a true warrior for the positive. I would never fully recover all thestupendous abilities I may have had in the higher densities, as the Law of Onesource had indicated, but I could still make a difference in the world. My quotealso featured the plural of the word ox, which suggested that I would help otherpeople become spiritual warriors as well.I had asked the Universe for an answer to the question “Am I a Wanderer?”Instead of giving me a simple yes, I had gotten the words Christ Cometh and anamazingly specific Bible quote that spoke directly to what I had justexperienced—complete with the numerical synchronicity of 2:22. I was deeplyfascinated by the whole thing. The extraterrestrials I was trying to get incontact with seemed to have a keen interest in Christianity, including anapparently encyclopedic knowledge of the Bible. The implications of all thiswere causing both of our minds to reel. In a surprising moment of clarity, Judeasked, “Well, do you think we should ask for more confirmation? Should we do itagain, or is this our proof here?” I stopped and thought for a moment. “No,” Isaid, pausing somberly, “I am pretty happy with what I got here.” At that exactsecond, the clock struck two, making two loud bonging noises that echoed throughthe room.Jude and I looked at each other in astonishment, realizing that yet anotherlayer of synchronicity around the number two had just been added to the mix.This was even further proof that something truly extraordinary had occurred, andI had gotten the necessary message. I now had Ecclesiastes 2:22, the ox statue Ibought for twenty-two dollars, and the clock striking two at the perfect momentto answer Jude’s question. In yet another astonishing synchronicity, without anyconscious planning on my part, the original hardcover American edition of thisbook is precisely at page 222 now as we reach this point in our story. I alsohad the elephant table appearing in the house, which linked this event to mymeeting with Angelica and the train ride. My greatest wish was to become atalented and beloved spiritual servant of the people like Muktananda, and allroads now seemed to be leading in that direction.At the same time, I was still living in a cramped little space in aboardinghouse with shared bathrooms and six other rooms of boarders, including acouple who were extremely disrespectful to the rest of us. I couldn’t stand tolive in a boardinghouse any longer. I called up my college buddy Eric, who hadgotten me the pizza delivery job on the first night I had arrived, and asked himif he wanted to go in together on a place. One housemate would be far easier todeal with than seven. I was only making two hundred dollars a week, and he wasearning about the same at the Godiva Chocolatier at the Poughkeepsie Mall.However, by pooling our income, we could get a much nicer place than either ofour current rooms, and we would definitely clean up after ourselves, unlike mycurrent roommates. Plus, we were already accustomed to hanging out and talkingevery day. Eric agreed with me that this was a terrific idea, and I immediatelybegan scouring the newspaper’s classified ads for our best option.GOIN’ TO ROSENDALE: BIRTHPLACE OF MODERN AMERICAEric and I both agreed that Rosendale was a great choice in which to find anapartment. About twelve minutes north of New Paltz on NY Route 32, it was asleepy little country town with original brownstone brick buildings from the1800s. And just like New Paltz and a few other neighboring towns, such as HighFalls, Stone Ridge, and Marbletown, Rosendale had some historic stone housesthat dated back to the 1700s and even the 1600s. Although most people talk onlyabout Jamestown or Plymouth Rock as the original colonies in the US, the NewPaltz area was also one of the very first American settlements, in this case bythe Dutch. Since Rosendale became the birthplace of my own spiritual contact,which would generate so many accurate future prophecies, I feel it is worth thetime to explore how the Rosendale area can be seen as the birthplace of modernAmerica and the Industrial Revolution.The Dutch had sailed across the Atlantic, found the mouth of the Hudson River,sailed north against the current for about ninety miles, and then stopped. Theybelieved they had found Paradise on Earth. They were members of a veryinteresting religious group known as the Huguenots, with an intensely spiritualfocus. They created a harmonious relationship with the native peoples. Theiroriginal wedding vows spoke with awe and reverence about the universe, and theyhad an immensely peaceful society, in harmony with their environment. They hadfled their own native country because of persecution for their beliefs. Theirstone houses are still standing, and it is common to see people taking historictours of them.Interestingly enough, the Huguenots had been drawn directly into an area with ageological anomaly—natural cement—that allowed the region to become the literalbirthplace of the Industrial Revolution. This helped to usher in the modernworld as we now know it. The Huguenots couldn’t have known about this at thetime, for this unique and highly valuable geological anomaly wasn’t discoveredfor nearly another two hundred years. This did suggest that some higher forcewas at work, guiding these spiritual pilgrims to an immensely beneficial area.Rosendale was the town that had the most of this precious natural resource.I had already toured Rosendale in a college class I had taken on the cementmining industry. Until the discovery of natural cement in 1818 by Canvass Whitein Fayetteville, New York, as the Erie Canal was under construction, allbuildings had to be made of wood, stone, adobe, or brick.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber66] It was very difficult, if not impossible, tomake a building of any impressive size. It could be done, such as with the steelbeams that made the Eiffel Tower in France or the grand old stone cathedrals ofEurope, but it was highly expensive and impractical for the world of business.Rosendale changed all that, having by far the largest quantity of natural cementthat had been found in the 1800s, and America got a jump start on the rest ofthe world as a result. Without Rosendale cement, the Industrial Revolution inAmerica might have been delayed well into the twentieth century.A soft material called dolostone had been found in the geological strata ofRosendale, creating a boom town as it became the largest single productionsource in the world for natural cement. The original discovery was made byaccident in 1818. Canvass White realized that if you heated up the dolostonewith fire and then got it wet, it would harden into a material that was strongerthan steel. You could grind up the kiln-fired rocks into a powder, and it wouldharden into stone when you added water. This was the world’s first cement, wellbefore someone discovered that you could add quick-lime to sand and gravel andmake concrete. Rosendale cement was of far higher quality than the concretediscovered later, and was of pivotal importance in the Industrial Revolution.Large buildings, factories, and structures that were never before possible couldbe made out of the cement. This began with the Delaware and Hudson Canal in1825, which revolutionized shipping in the Northeast even before the rise of therailroad system. By 1850, fully three hundred million pounds of this cement werebeing produced per year.4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber67] Rosendale cement alsobuilt the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State Building, the pedestal for theStatue of Liberty, Grand Central Station, the Pennsylvania railroad tunnels, andthe New York City sidewalks, to name only a few.There was also a horrific downside to this money machine. Almost all the treesin the area had been cut down by the cement mining industry, because they neededto feed massive kilns that were constantly hungry for fuel. Throughout thecountryside, there were gigantic wounds in the land where hundreds of thousandsof tons of dolostone had been blasted and chipped out. Dynamite explosionsconstantly echoed through the land, and the ground shook from the impact. Thelabor was very difficult for the workers, and injuries and deaths were all toocommon. Business was booming, and the people running the company weremultimillionaires. Then Portland cement began to be produced for sale in 1875,and it was significantly less expensive.5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber68]Rosendale Cement sales greatly weakened as the twentieth century moved along—andthe company finally stopped selling all cement in 1970.6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber69] All the massive kilns that had been used tofire the dolostone were left to rot, just like the buildings I had seen in myrailroad journey to Colorado. Gigantic caverns where the dolostone had beenmined were left abandoned and unmarked. Some of these caves were turned intopublic parks, the Widow Jane Mine being the most notable one.7[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber70]The largest of the former mining caves in the area had been taken over andsealed off by Iron Mountain, a facility supposedly designed for government andprivate records storage. The entire Iron Mountain facility was effectively anunderground base. Travelers could see the huge, bricked-up cave entrances righton Route 32 as they drove through town. In 2016, a photographer was finallyallowed limited access to the facility and found that apparently only ten peopleare still working at the location today.8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber71] Therewere local rumors that the guidance systems and launch codes for our nuclearmissile arsenal were stored there. Rosendale was therefore sitting on top of thebrain that could guide nuclear missiles to completely destroy all life on planetEarth, if we ever did have a nuclear war. I realized that the womb of theIndustrial Revolution might also contain the guidance systems for totalplanetary annihilation.There was also a rumor that an underground train connected Iron Mountain to anEG&G Rotron facility in Woodstock. I knew from reading Alien Contact by TimothyGood that EG&G Rotron was one of the military defense contractors directlyinvolved in reverse-engineering crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft—and thatthis technology, once declassified, could be humanity’s best hope.9[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber72] The UFOs had to be using a source of almostlimitless clean energy. They obviously didn’t need to stop off at the gasstation on their way to Earth. They had no wings, turbofans, or jet engines, andcould execute aeronautical maneuvers that showed they undoubtedly had conqueredgravity and inertia. If we could develop antigravity and free energy, our worldwould change in ways we can barely even conceive of. And my research now had mecompletely convinced that the military-industrial complex already had thistechnology, in great abundance, but were refusing to share it with the rest ofus. Even if Artie’s crystal gun was the one and only gift that we ever gotdeclassified, we would have antigravity and would be able to easily buildmassive pyramids once again.EARTHQUAKE!Just as I was writing the above section of the book, on July 4,2019—Independence Day—I had a major synchronicity that is definitely worthmentioning. I was writing about dynamite blasting huge holes in the ground inRosendale, and was envisioning all the shaking this would produce, when onlyminutes later, the ground under my feet here in Los Angeles began reeling,lasting about thirty seconds. The walls were swaying, I was hearing crackingnoises, and it felt as though I was taking a ride on a giant bowl of Jell-O. Itturned out to be a 6.4-magnitude earthquake up in the Searles Valley, a remotearea of Kern County roughly a hundred miles north of Los Angeles. As we willsee, this was by no means “in the middle of nowhere” but is actually a locationof major significance. This was the biggest quake we’ve had here in twenty-fiveyears—since all the way back to the 1994 Northridge quake, which was a 6.6.10[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber73]Thankfully, unlike Northridge, the current quake did not strike a populatedcivilian area. It instead hit a very large military base known as China Lake,which is the biggest Area 51–type facility that no one has ever heard of.Several insiders told me this facility housed some of the darkest aspects of themilitary-industrial complex and its relationships with negative, demonicextraterrestrials. I must admit that it was quite shocking to go through thebiggest earthquake I have ever felt, right after I was writing about the groundshaking from dynamite blasts. Nonetheless, after all the spectacularsynchronicities I have experienced, I shouldn’t be very surprised. It is alsointeresting that this quake was the largest in Los Angeles since 1994. That wasthe same year I got together with Yumi and began the sequence of events that arejust now culminating in the story for 1995. This sort of impressivesynchronicity is not at all uncommon.Another quake happened the next day, under China Lake, that was even larger, andthis one scared me even more. I will describe that incident later in our story.The combination of these two quakes completely and utterly destroyed the ChinaLake black-ops megabase, but the media never said a word about it. Variousinsiders suggested that nefarious covert aerosol spraying operations were beingrun out of the facility and poisoning our skies. On the very next day, July 6,2019, the notorious Jeffrey Epstein was indicted and arrested. I wrote a hugearticle about all this on July 7.11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber74] I do notsee the timing of these three major events as an accident. I believe this wasthe work of an alliance that had formed within the government, military, andintelligence communities around the world. Earthquake weapons were used to takeout a mission-critical base for the Deep State, and then Jeffrey Epstein, acriminal who could expose the ugliest secrets of this secretive organization,was arrested. This was a major combined attack that could lead up to massivearrests of Deep State/Illuminati/New World Order/Cabal operatives—which my ownsource has been predicting since at least 1999.THE SCHOOLHOUSE ART GALLERYGetting back to Rosendale, the main street had a popular brothel for the minersin the 1800s. The women would stand on the upper deck and wave at the workers asthey made their way home, either on horseback or by foot. The building was stillthere when Eric and I arrived in 1995, now transformed into the Rosendale Café,the go-to place for hippie vegan cuisine and quality live music. At the time,Eric and I were both vegans, so the café was very appealing. I had beengradually guided into eating a strict diet, which had started to happen after myexperience with the Tuvan shaman in my senior year. I avoided specificallydairy, processed foods, refined sugar, and meat products. I finally found an adin the local newspaper for an “artsy” brick apartment that was a remodeled oldschoolhouse, and I happily made the call and got an appointment. Eric and I wentto take a look.The landlady, Lauran, started out by impressing us with a tour of the artgallery on the property. The gallery had huge, twenty-foot-high ceilings andgorgeous exposed brick walls from the mid-1800s. The windows were seven feettall and reminded me of what you might see in an old church. There was tracklighting everywhere. The walls were filled with stunning, large paintings thatused bright lollipop colors. The paintings were whimsical and unique: one partPicasso, one part classic cartoons, and a generous dose of LSD. There was a manwith a duck’s beak instead of a nose, and with the body of a swan, wrappinghimself around a woman in a beautiful lily-green pond reminiscent of the worksof Vincent van Gogh. There were portraits that seared with unexpected color andemotional immediacy. There was a comical, Minotaur-like image of a half-man,half-bull creature that looked like it could easily have been a Picasso. Thepassion in these paintings was stunning. They were magnificent. We weredefinitely going to visit this gallery regularly, just to admire its works. “Theart gallery is really great,” I said, “but when do we get to see the apartment?”“This is it,” Lauran replied. “This is the apartment.” Eric and I wereabsolutely shocked into silence. There was a prolonged and awkward pause as welooked around in disbelief. This place was an epic paradise. It was a beautifulhistoric brick building, a sacred church, and an upscale psychedelic art galleryall merged into one. Lauran appeared to get a bit concerned at this point by oursilence. “I hope you won’t mind allowing us to store the paintings on thewalls.” I was flabbergasted. “Store the paintings? Are you kidding me? We needto hang up even more of them! This is a full-blown art gallery! Eric and I areboth artists and musicians! These are masterpieces! You’re not having anyshowings here?” Lauran replied, “No, we’re just renting out the space. Yourkitchen is over here, and . . .”I was now so excited that I couldn’t even hear what she was saying. Her voiceseemed to trail off as I realized that I would do whatever it took to land thisapartment. Lauran’s father was the renowned painter and videographer AllenEpstein, and he had lived and worked in this house with a community of friendsuntil his death in 1993, two years before our showing. Allen had gone to Yale ona full scholarship when he was only seventeen years old, and he was obviously atrue creative genius, who eventually became quite successful in the videoproduction business. Lauran needed to rent out all the rooms in order to pay themortgage, taxes, and utilities and have some basic income. Her father had namedthe house Chateau Bullshinski, complete with a funny plaque at the front thatenshrined the name in Old English calligraphy. The subtitle on this sign was THEMETAPHYSICAL RESORT. That same type of offbeat sense of humor was visibleeverywhere. We didn’t even need to see the bathroom or the loft. We weresurrounded by green trees, rolling hills, and sleepy suburban homes withgenerous plots of land, and an old mining canal with free-flowing creek waterdown by the main road. We found out later that there was a gorgeous, giganticcement-mining cave right up at the top of the hill. To be able to afford a placelike this with minimum-wage employment seemed like an impossible dream cometrue. “We’ll take it. Right now. PLEASE don’t show this place to anyone else!”The official Allen Epstein website has a listing for a gallery showing from2009, and Lauran’s flowery description of her father’s paintings captures theirglory in sensual language I could never hope to duplicate:> Whether a high-energy pastel or a deeply worked oil, the portraits tell of a> penetrating intimacy between the artist and sitter. It is as if Allen imbibed> the soul of his subject and then released on paper or canvas a material> residue of their character, pressed and worked into shape by his able hand and> the clarity and compassion with which he saw them. In each unique piece, deft> line, emotive color, gestures and material choices surprise, yet embedded in> every impasto or powdery surface is the afterglow of this very personal> exchange.12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber75]THE HAPPIEST TIME OF MY LIFEUntil I got together with my wife, Elizabeth, there was no question that the twoprecious years I spent in the Schoolhouse from 1995 to 1997 were the happiesttimes of my life, despite the extreme difficulty of the jobs I ended up taking,particularly during the first six months. This proved to be the ideal locationfor an angelic/spiritual contact to occur. The rent was $875 a month. Eric and Ineeded to work together to afford it, and once we got settled, we did. I wasunemployed when I first arrived and had quite the shocking karmic wake-up callbefore the end of December that convinced me to take a job working for $5.77 anhour, a mere two cents above minimum wage. We will discuss the whole sequence ofevents in the next chapter. I ended up making about two hundred dollars a week.Eric and I never had a TV, nor did we want one. I was able to set up my drum kitin the main gallery room, and I started improvising with a talented group ofmusicians from college, calling ourselves the Rosendale Jazz Project. We hadAndy on keyboards, Jason on the upright bass, Jim from upstairs on guitar, andyours truly on percussion. We would just start playing, with no agreed-upon keysignature, chords, or melodies—and as if by some supernatural force, amazingcompositions would start emanating from our instruments.Meanwhile, Eric was quickly mastering the Renaissance lute, a gorgeously carved,gut-stringed precursor to the guitar, which was a staple of high society in the1600s—right when the Huguenots first arrived in our area. Eric was a serioushistorian and was studying with Paul O’Dette, who was arguably the best luteplayer in the world. Eric’s right thumb plucked out agile basslines acrossmultiple, deep strings, while his remaining fingers revealed intricate chords,melodies, harmonies, and arpeggios. The music had a timeless quality thatinstantly transported me back to the golden age of the Renaissance, when sciencewas transforming the world, and spirit had just been liberated for the benefitof all. Eric practiced for at least two hours a day, and his delivery was nearlyflawless. He also would regularly play CDs of Gregorian chants, such as from theTallis Scholars, which only added to the sacred, mystical ambience of thespace—In fact, I am listening to Peter Phillips and the Tallis Scholars as Iwrite this.“HE IS ONE OF US”More and more, I was having powerful dreams about UFO contact. These dreams allseemed to be suggesting that positive extraterrestrials wanted to communicatewith me. I thought back to my experience with automatic writing, which alreadyfelt like ancient history by now. Things had gotten much, much better since Ihad moved into the Schoolhouse. The automatic writing was very real, and verypowerful . . . get a job and be happy . . . but now what? Nothing was happening.Everything went into overdrive when I got our latest phone bill in the mail thefollowing month, in January, soon after I had finally gotten a job. It was wellover two hundred dollars. Almost the entire amount I owed was from breakupconversations with Yumi, which would often descend into prolonged and veryexpensive bouts of silence. I didn’t have two hundred dollars. That wasbasically my food for the month. And my parents had hardly anything to share, soI didn’t dare ask them for a loan.I thought back to the messages I had received: Chasten, Awareness, Hostile;Christ Cometh; eat and drink and be happy in your work, for this is the grace ofGod. Let your work turn you into a nearly indestructible force for good. Thismessage clearly had emanated from a supernatural force outside of myself, butnow I felt terribly, horribly alone. I was sitting at the table in our apartmentwith one of our deep-blue-and-green Asian-style plates in front of me. My usednapkin was resting on the plate. At that moment I completely lost it and brokedown crying. I didn’t know what the hell to do. “If you guys are real, and Iknow you are, then you need to show yourselves! Right now! I can’t go on likethis. Please!” Then I just sobbed and sobbed for several minutes. I finallypulled myself together and started looking out the huge windows, wondering if aglowing craft would be waiting for me outside. Nothing. I put my hands togetherand tried to levitate the napkin on my plate. Nothing. Not even a little tickle.The beautiful paintings stared down at me with compassion, but I was truly lost.I started crying all over again.Finally, I realized that nothing was going to happen. I had to pull it together.I looked at the phone bill and remembered that I had ordered a speciallong-distance package for calling Japan at a deep discount. For some“convenient” reason, the phone company had never applied the discount. They hadbilled me for the full price of well over two dollars a minute. I grabbed ourfunny little phone, which stood up straight on its four rubber feet, and calledthe phone company. A woman answered and I very politely explained my situation.After an excruciating pause while she looked through her system, she revealedthat I was right, it was there in her notes, and they had made a mistake. I letout a huge sigh of relief. She then ran the numbers and came back with amanageable new bill of thirty-five dollars. That I could pay—and I did it bydebit card right over the phone to lock it in. I was overwhelmed with relief andthanked her profusely for her help. I put the phone down, put on some music, andwent to bed happy, well before Eric ever got home. By now, I had completelyforgotten about my urgent prayer . . . but THEY definitely had not. Little did Iknow that Eric would wake up the next morning with a dream in which a Jesus-likebeing came out of a UFO to tell him, “It is very important that you know that he[David] is one of us.” And Eric never knew a thing about the prayer I had made.This would just be the first of a series of ever-increasingly fascinatingphenomena that ultimately led up to my making conscious, telepathic contact withangelic extraterrestrials. They gave me beautiful guidance and inspiration, andalso displayed a mind-blowing ability to predict the future with shockingaccuracy. Their ultimate message was to ask us to prepare for a massivesolar-system-wide event that is very similar to the Christian idea of therapture. Namely, our entire planet is heading into a massive and irreversiblespiritual transformation."},{"pageContent":"PART TWO[../images/page_PO.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENRUN BEFORE YOU CAN FLYI first learned about the art of awakening in the dream when I was sixteen yearsold. Following the simple techniques of Dr. Stephen LaBerge, I could becomefully lucid and conscious in my dream space. From there, I had godlikeabilities. I could fly, walk through walls, manifest any objects I desired, andcompletely transform anything and everything around me. I stopped using allmind-altering drugs in September 1992 and soon began writing down my dreamsevery morning. In February 1993, I found out from an insider that UFOs werereal, Roswell really happened, and everyone in the higher echelons of NASA knewabout it. We had already built working antigravity craft from this technology,which was being used actively in highly classified programs. I ended up readingover three hundred books on the subject in the following three years. Mysenior-year college roommate, Artie, had a life that was littered with cluesthat his parents had somehow been involved in this mysterious world.Synchronicities were happening to me with greater and greater frequency, alongwith mind-blowingly wonderful dreams of UFOs, benevolent humanextraterrestrials, and advanced ancient civilizations.ALL THE DOTS ARE CONNECTINGAll this buildup had now culminated in a very intriguing discovery about myself.I was heavily guided to read From Elsewhere: Being E.T. in America, about “thesubculture of those who claim to be of non-earthly origins,” by Scott Mandelker.I found I could answer all twelve questions at the back of the book in theaffirmative, which strongly suggested I had an unusually advanced and benevolentextraterrestrial soul. This meant that I might be something called a Wanderer,in Mandelker’s terms. To fully remember that this was who I was, I would have to“penetrate the veil of forgetfulness,” which is a phrase used in the Law of Oneseries.Mandelker’s entire work was based on the Law of One, a mysterious body ofintuitively revealed teachings that began appearing in 1981. In Session 12,Question 27, of the Law of One series, it indicated that there were 65 millionwanderers on Earth at the time Mandelker estimated that the number should havebeen well in excess of 100 million in the 1990s, making it about one in 60people. To penetrate the veil, it was necessary to use meditation and intuitivemeans to seek an answer that could not be provided by any of our normal fivesenses. The Law of One is arguably the finest modern example of what can beachieved through this type of a process. In a sitting meditation with my friendJude, I then attempted to do “automatic writing” with my left hand. Five wordscame through, the first three of which I was semi-aware of. My hand then sprangto life and quickly scratched out a sequence of eleven characters that includeda Bible quote. The encoded quote turned out to be Ecclesiastes 2:22–3:13. Fromthe very beginning to the very end of the passage, it showed a preciseunderstanding of what I had been going through in my life. I had lost astressful job working in a mental hospital, which I had felt was necessary toearn a graduate degree and eventually transition into being a respectable UFOresearcher. The handwritten message told me that “Christ Cometh,” and I justneeded to eat and drink and be happy in my work in order to focus my spare timeon UFO research; I didn’t need to take on another stressful job to move forward.Clearly, there were far greater things ahead for me.My college friend Eric and I ended up going in together on an apartment, abeautiful remodeled 1800s schoolhouse, in Rosendale, New York, which producedthe natural cement that made the modern industrial revolution possible in theUS. Rosendale cement allowed for much larger and sturdier buildings to beconstructed at a much lower cost. Many huge caves dotted the landscape, wherecountless tons of dolostone were blown and chipped out to make newly discoveredRosendale cement. The largest of these caves had been converted into a strangeunderground base called Iron Mountain. Local legends said that this base wasconnected by an underground tunnel system to another base run by the defensecontractor EG&G Rotron in the Woodstock area. Our apartment was extremelybeautiful, with exposed brick walls, cathedral ceilings, and a wealth ofpaintings from the prodigious artist and videographer Allen Epstein.NO DESIRE TO ENTER THE “REAL WORLD”The sheer awesomeness of the idea that I had an extraterrestrial soul, and thatwe were all heading into a mass spiritual awakening event on Earth that manycalled Ascension, made the hunt for a “normal job” seem incredibly depressing.When Eric and I first decided to get the art-gallery apartment, I was working atthe mental hospital. Then after we signed the lease, I lost my job, found ScottMandelker’s book, and got the Bible quote telling me everything would be okay.Eric paid almost the entire $1,750 we needed to claim the space. I moved intoour new place unemployed, but I wasn’t really trying as hard as I should havebeen to find what was sure to be another low-paying job. I even admitted tomyself that I was being lazy and self-indulgent. There were any number of dayswhen I could have been looking for a job and decided instead to take my time,not go at all, or apply only to one place rather than four or five in a singleday. The new apartment was an incredibly relaxing paradise, and I did not wantto leave.Every day I had to walk into a corporate office with stark fluorescent lights,fill out a depressing summary of all the dead-end jobs I had endured, providenames and phone numbers for each of my former supervisors, and try to actexcited about taking on yet another low-paying and very humble job. This feltdegrading to me. I was new to adult living, having graduated from anall-expenses-paid college experience only six months before, and I knew thatEric had enough money to take care of both of us, at least for a while, inaddition to my parents, who had a little money, and my grandparents, who had alot of money. If I found myself in a dire emergency, I could ask my relativesfor a onetime grant or loan, but this was by no means a sustainable option. Mygrandfather was only interested in paying for graduate school, and otherwise hedid not intend to help me out. I was endangering my own life by not looking veryhard for work, but I still felt the need to have some “private space” to adjustto this new discovery about myself. After all, I now knew I was an awakenedVolunteer Extraterrestrial Ambassador to Earth. Did my angelic friends seriouslyexpect me to work for six bucks an hour?Little did I know that my lazy, self-indulgent attitude, where I expectedeveryone else to take care of my basic needs, was setting me up for a massiveblast of bad karma. The angelic extraterrestrials I had come into contact withwere not just there to give me synchronicities, insider disclosures, mysticalBible quotes, and friendly dream advice. They were equally responsible forcreating explosions of karmic justice that would knock me back on course if Ifell out of line. In this particular case, they decided that a terrifying carcrash in the snow was necessary to get my attention and shock me into gettinganother job. To show me that they had planned out the whole thing, they gave mea series of prophetic dreams about car accidents, leading right up to theterrifying moment itself. Then, even as the crash was happening, they gave me anundeniable synchronicity that let me know they were involved in planningit—every step of the way.I feel this is one interesting way in which my own story deviates from manyother accounts of alleged spiritual contact. In many of these cases, thecontactee seems to report nothing but light, love, positivity, ego-boostingcompliments, and comforts from their source. In my own case, I found myselfbeing heavily criticized and experiencing very frightening brushes with death ifI did not listen carefully, follow the guidance, and practice the highestpossible moral and ethical standards. Regardless of how difficult certainsuggestions were to follow, I was ultimately able to see that all theseguidelines were coming from a truly mature and benevolent place. I learned thehard way that I could not “get away” with anything. Karma was absolute,inevitable, and meticulously precise. I do believe these same rules apply toeveryone, whether they realize it or not. Sadly, some people have so muchbalancing to do that they will require multiple lifetimes to pay off theirdebts—and from the higher perspective, no one can cheat the system.PROPHETIC DREAMS OF AN IMMINENT CAR CRASHMy first prophetic car-crash dream was on December 10, 1995. In this case, I wasdriving in heavy snowfall. A huge snowplow truck was coming right at me as Idrove up the road. I had to swerve off to the side just in time to avoid beinghit. The mountain of snow that the plow was pushing was truly colossal. However,as soon as I was on the roadside, a massive, bloody war began. People werecreating lethal weapons out of snow, and fighting and dying in this battle. Iwas no longer in my car, and I had to jump and run and work hard to avoid beinghit by anything. A security guard from my job at the mental hospital was one ofthe people fighting, and he was in a total, violent rage. He spotted me andbegan running toward me at full speed with his weapon in hand, clearly with theintent to murder me. As he rushed up to me, I manifested my own sword out ofsnow and struck him with it.In retaliation, he bit down on my middle finger—and would not let go. I was interrible pain. I punched him again and again, but I could not get him to releasethe bite. Then all of a sudden, he stopped biting me and said, “It’s cold,” asif he was perplexed and had just woken up from a strange, violent trance. Weboth stopped fighting and sat down on the cold, snowy ground, looking at eachother. Then we looked over to our left and realized that we both had a commonenemy. Another guy was prancing around, acting like he was a star athlete, andwaving to people as if he was royalty. He was the one who had started this warby convincing everyone to fight each other. In truth, he was just like us. Weboth started laughing at his ridiculous narcissism.In dream-analysis terms, every character in this dream was a part of myself, asis usually the case. The security guard from the mental hospital was a part ofme that was still very angry about my former job and did not want another one.In the dream, that part of me was ready to fight to the death to get some freetime. Then that part of me finally realized that I was just too cold.Symbolically, this meant I felt emotionally unfulfilled and lonely. I wasworried that getting another job would make my loneliness even worse. The guywho was pretending to be a star athlete was the part of me that felt entitlednot to work. Once I realized how ridiculous this attitude was, I could getanother job, take care of my basic needs, form a new circle of friends at work,and stop this war raging inside myself. Since the war was being fought withsnow, this meant I had allowed my emotions to become very cold and hardened tothe concerns of others, including my new housemate Eric. I should not have beenliving off Eric, nor any potential emergency funds from my family—the dreamsclearly wanted me to take care of myself. I did not see all this at the time.The second prophetic dream was on December 13, 1995. In this one, I was with agroup of people who were looking at a car for sale that was being displayed in agarage. The car was extremely lightweight and therefore seemed quite unsafe todrive, particularly in the snow. Whoever was selling this car was up to no good.They were well aware that someone could crash in this car, and that it wouldcrumple up very easily and potentially kill the driver. Suddenly, a massive andfrightening-looking dinosaur appeared in the distance. He spotted us and startedsmashing his way over to where we were standing by the car. As I woke up, Ithought about how easily the dinosaur could stomp on the car and destroy it. Thepaper-thin car symbolized my overall physical wellness. By being unemployed, Iwas unable to take care of myself. The salesman was the part of me that wasn’tbeing honest about how much danger I was putting myself in by thinking that nothaving a job was a good idea. The dinosaur represented the inevitable negativekarma that would come crashing into my life if I refused to take care ofmyself—and the dinosaur ended up smashing a car.The next morning, on December 14, 1995, I saw my own car sitting in our newdriveway in Rosendale. Another dinosaur, this time a pterodactyl, was flying inthe air overhead. It had a triangular head, and as I kept looking, I realized itmight be some kind of artificial flying craft built to look like a dinosaur. Notsure whether or not it was a real dinosaur, I said, “It’s cool how you can stillsee those,” before realizing the impossibility of seeing a dinosaur in moderntimes. For whatever reason, I was not triggered into awakening in the dream,despite how strange this was. The craft flew down and landed, and I noticed thata newlywed couple was seated in the cockpit, flying it. The craft ended uptransforming into some sort of antique car. However, the car could fly, and itdid not have any wheels. The couple were terrible pilots, but there seemed to bea mechanism that prevented them from hitting anything or crashing into theground. I was very happy to see that safe and effective flying vehicles likethat were now available.The flying craft and the married couple piloting it again represented myextraterrestrial family. I may well have been seeing an actual visitation thathad taken place, translated into a symbolic form in my dream. According to CoreyGoode, it is common for both genuine ET contacts and military abductions, orMILABS, to introduce “screen memories” of an event after it happens. You willhave a dream similar to what actually happened, but it will also havemetaphorical and symbolic differences from the event itself. This is vastly morecommon than most of us could ever realize. By analyzing this sequence with themetaphorical language of dreams, the dinosaur craft suggested that these peoplehad been around on Earth for millions of years, just as the Anshar would laterreveal about themselves to Corey Goode.I have also heard from various insiders that our own reverse-engineeredantigravity spacecraft have very advanced systems called Flight Control. Thesesystems prevent crashing in the vast majority of cases, thus greatly increasingthe safety factor of traveling in them. Overall, this dream again stronglywarned me that I was going to have a car crash but that I would be safe, that nogreat damage would occur to me or to the car. This would be more akin to awake-up call, albeit a very dramatic one.As I was rereading all these dreams for the first time in August 2019, thetime-loop phenomenon happened again. On December 15, 1995, I had a dream about aromantic relationship with a blond woman who had stunning similarities with mywife, Elizabeth. This would prove to be only one of many dreams I found fromthat time that featured her so precisely, and went into a series of verypertinent personal issues that I could never have known twenty-four years inadvance. Then, on the sixteenth, I had another dream that perfectly described ablack woman my wife and I have been working with on developing movies andtelevision shows. The woman in the dream was a superhero who was levitating offthe ground, with a flowing cape and gleaming bluish-white beams of light comingfrom her eyes. She was using these beams to zap down evil men who had greatwealth and social influence. This was another interesting discovery, for thisfriend of ours is very well aware of the real problems we are facing in theworld, and of the media suppression we must move through to get the truth.Then, on December 17, 1995, I was back to having yet another prophetic dreamabout an upcoming car crash. In retrospect, it is interesting that I did notsuspect a thing when all these dreams were coming in. I was very depressed andhad no idea that my selfishness was causing me to require such a major blast ofbad karma. In this dream, I was about to receive a used car as a gift. I wasvery grateful to receive it. Just as I was about to take possession of thevehicle, a mean little boy came up and started cutting the glass. I asked him toplease not do that, but he didn’t seem to care. It was obvious that he felt thecar was abandoned, so he could do whatever he wanted. He then shattered theglass in the rearview mirror, right in front of me. I became so furious that Igrabbed him in a headlock and wanted to hurt him. At this exact moment, my alarmwoke me up. I realized this dream was saying I was only hurting myself, and thekid represented some part of me. What I did not see was that the kid representedthe part of me that didn’t want to get a job, because I was so angry and hostileabout my past experiences. In the process, I was destroying my own spiritualvehicle, symbolized by the car. The headlock I put the boy in could easily haverepresented the car crash that was about to happen to this maladaptive part ofmyself, in a symbolic form.POINT OF IMPACTOn the very next day, Monday, December 18, 1995, my accident happened in theearly afternoon. At the time, I never thought about how bad my marijuanaaddiction had gotten before I had quit, and how self-destructive I had becomewhile I was still using. I often tried to think and act as if it had never evenhappened. Now I was completely dodging my responsibility by not looking for ajob. Lack of responsibility was the exact same problem that had plagued me as amarijuana smoker. Even though I had cleaned up, the habit patterns themselvesstill remained. I still wanted to live in a fog, ignore my worldlyresponsibilities, and stay “high,” only now my drug of choice was UFO andmetaphysical research.I was driving down the road near our house, in the snow. The curving road rannext to an iced-over stream at the bottom of a deep ditch. Although I still hadover three and a half more hours to look for another job that day, I made theconscious decision that I would just give up and go home. Eric wouldn’t be therebecause he was working, so I could “get away” with it. I was weary and tired ofbeating my brains out, trying to find jobs that I was massively overqualifiedfor, and that I didn’t have any interest in performing except to pay for my foodand rent.I gripped the steering wheel in frustration as all these thoughts cascadedthrough my mind. No more ridiculous job searching for today. I’m tired of it.Suddenly, I rounded a left turn and the car started to slide—fast. This wasvery, very bad. I completely lost control of the vehicle as it began spinning ina clockwise circle, while I was going about thirty-five miles an hour. Imentally screamed, slammed on the brakes, and the spin only got worse. I wasn’texperienced enough yet to know that you are supposed to steer into the turn andpump the brakes, or that you had to drive more slowly as you headed around turnsin the snow. Time seemed to slow down to a crawl, and I honestly wondered if Iwas about to die. Neither steering nor braking did anything to stop the car’smotion. Thankfully, there was no oncoming traffic. Out loud, I started screamingthe S word in a percussive, rhythmic chant, two times per second, getting louderand louder the longer I slid.My car actually did a complete 360-degree revolution on the road. At the samemoment that I was swearing and sliding in this giant circle, which seemed tolast for an eternity, I felt compelled to look at my car’s digital clock. Theblue digits 1:11 burned at me from the dashboard. There it was again! Why in theworld was I seeing a clock synchronicity as I was about to die? I really didn’thave time to think about what it meant, yet I was aware even as it was happeningthat the higher forces were somehow involved in this. Repeating digits on clockswere one of the key signatures of my “ET family,” and here I was about to die inmy car. Then my front right tire suddenly slammed into a post on the side of theroad, and I came to an immediate, safe stop.I was very, very lucky, because if I hadn’t hit that post, my car could veryeasily have slid right off of the road, down the hill, and into the creek. Theice was thin enough that the car would have started sinking, and I may havedrowned from the shock of the cold water hitting my skin and flooding theinterior. Either way, I would have probably ended up in the hospital, surroundedby machines and concerned faces. The posts were spaced about thirty feet apart,and I was extremely lucky that I hit one. The sudden sound and force of theimpact was highly jarring. I had no idea how much damage there would be, or evenif I would ever be able to drive my car again. I had no money to get anothercar, and no job. On the verge of a total, helpless breakdown, both mentally andphysically, I quickly jumped out to take a look.My wheel and axle had absorbed the majority of the shock head-on, so there wasvery little damage. My hands were shaking as my body surged with adrenaline.Considering how frightening the accident itself was, and how, inevitably, Iwould have spun right into the creek at the speed I was going, the lack ofdamage to me or the car was literally miraculous. All I had was a dent in thesurface of the car around the tire, which I was able to pull out by hand when Igot home. The clock synchronicity was an obvious sign that the spiritual forcesI was in contact with had somehow set up and carried out this crash. They werethe Lords of Karma, and I had to be very careful not to get myself in trouble.This changed everything. I drove home and immediately went to my dream notebooksto see if anything had predicted this event. Sure enough, at least fourdifferent dreams in the past eight days had forecasted this event in advance. Iknew I was trying to take advantage of Eric and possibly my family to have thempay for my own lack of responsibility, while making up excuses and saying I wasdoing everything I could. I immediately made a full commitment to get anotherjob and stabilize myself.FACING MY RESPONSIBILITYAs it turned out, I had no trouble whatsoever getting another job. I just hadbeen resisting the option to do it. The very next day, I went back and reappliedto the UARC Day Treatment Center in Kingston. This was a facility fordevelopmentally disabled adults who ranged from moderate to severe/profound intheir levels of challenge. We had some students like this in our high school,and I was able to see them as human souls and not be frightened or upset by theway they looked. Jude had done this work on the residential side for years andhad encouraged me to pursue it, because it would still count toward graduateschool residency. I had originally worked a few days at the UARC job afterleaving the pizza place, but then quit politely after the mental hospital calledme back. Admittedly, part of the reason I left was that the UARC job paid only$5.77 an hour, literally two cents above minimum wage, whereas the mentalhospital paid a relatively substantial $7.50. Now I had returned, newly humbled.Since they were always in need of help, I got my job back with only a briefburst of ridicule from my Irish boss: “Sooo, ya got CANNED!”The Schoolhouse was such a sanctuary of healing and solace that I was able toglide through one of the toughest jobs imaginable. Thanks to my new psychologydegree, the UARC management quickly positioned me in what they unofficiallycalled the Behavior Rooms. The official term for them was ILR, which stood forIntensive Learning Rooms. These were two rooms in which the most disruptive“consumers,” as they called them, were kept together so they wouldn’t damage thepeace of the other classrooms. Somehow, they felt that with a degree inpsychology, I would be better trained in how to handle all this chaos. Some ofthe people could speak and others could not, and yelling and screaming wouldoccur almost hour by hour. Fights broke out almost every day. All of themreminded me of children, and I felt genuine love and respect for them. Everyday, I would see and hear utterly hilarious things, particularly from our twohighest-functioning people, who could speak fluently. I often used whimsicalcomedy to keep the peace, and the people responded very well to my efforts. Muchof my job was akin to being an umpire, breaking up inevitable fights whileconstantly watching both doors to make sure that our “runners” didn’t try toescape.My car crash was on Monday, December 18. Newly humbled, I went in and acceptedthe job offer on December 19. They wanted me to start right away, but instead, Iasked to wait a week until the following Tuesday, December 26, to breathe andprepare myself. I then decided to delay my family visit for Christmas; Idefinitely needed to focus on preparing myself for this very difficult job. Thenon December 20, I had a dream that gave me wonderful compliments for facing myresponsibility. In this dream, I drove to a small airport and parked in anoutdoor parking lot. When I got out of the car, I found cash lying on the groundthat added up to twenty dollars. I then found a wallet with traveler’s checks init that added up to another fifty-five dollars. The traveler’s checks needed tobe signed in order to be cashed. Now, a newlywed couple came up to me and askedif I had seen a wallet lying around.This was my big choice point. I knew I was dead broke. I could have lied to themand kept the money, but I couldn’t live with myself for doing that; I wasn’tthat kind of person. So I told them yes, I did find their wallet, and I handedit over. Although they said there had been only twenty dollars in the wallet, Igave them all the cash I had found. They were so happy, they burst into tears.They had no idea how they were going to survive without that money. I feltterrific about what I had done as I watched them walk away, with their armsaround each other. As soon as I opened the door to get back into the car, I wasshocked. There on the passenger seat was a mountain of cash—easily a milliondollars or more. I was overwhelmed with happiness. Even in the dream I felt likethis was a great synchronicity that had obviously happened because I chose to behonest. In symbolic terms, the dream was clearly showing me that by taking onthis very difficult job and facing my adult responsibility, instead of stealingfrom my new housemate and possibly my family, the rewards in the long term wouldbe terrific.At this point the dream shifted, as they often do. Now I was driving the car. Inthe place of the money, I now had a black man riding with me in the passengerseat. Two black women were riding in the back. We were talking, laughing, andhaving a great time together. Suddenly, flashing blue and red lights appeared inmy rearview mirror. We were getting pulled over! A Caucasian police officerwalked up and wanted to make sure I was okay, and that these people weren’tforcing me to do anything against my will. I told the policeman that everythingwas fine, we were having a great time, and it was perfectly normal for blackpeople and white people to be friends.In dream analysis, people of other races typically represent your unseen angelicguides and helpers in the higher realms. Although this dream exaggerated thefinancial rewards for doing this work, it is nonetheless true that I wouldeventually make a respectable living from my career as a UFOlogist. The policeofficer represents the mainstream view that has been conditioned to think of anynonterrestrial beings as evil and dangerous. Many other dreams during this timewere unambiguously talking about my wife—whom I got together with in 2016. It isdifficult to describe how amazing it feels to experience these sorts ofprophecies and realize that any skeptical explanations just fall apart under thesheer volume of evidence over the years. Many people feel they have to explainthese things away to maintain their view of reality. Otherwise they worry thatpeople will judge them as outcasts, mentally ill, or even insane. I can honestlysay that nothing feels quite as good as that first prophetic dream ormind-blowing synchronicity, where you really see that you yourself have all thepower you need to do this. You are awakening in the dream that we nowcollectively refer to as reality.A PROPHETIC DREAM OF SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATIONOn New Year’s Day 1996, I had just worked the first four days of my new job andwas earning $5.77 an hour, two cents above the minimum hourly amount of moneyyou could be paid to do any job in New York State. I was making just enough toafford to live in our beautiful new apartment, surrounded by trees, rollinggreen lawns, and natural boulder outcroppings. On this same morning at the birthof the new year, I had a truly remarkable dream that ended up being highlyprophetic of what would happen to me in November of that same year.In this dream, a cool musician I knew from college, named Vinnie, had died. Inreal life, we had performed and recorded some music together in which I playedNative American flute and he played hand drums. Somehow, I could see him andcommunicate with him perfectly clearly, even though he was in the afterlife. Atthe same time, I was aware that other people could not see or hear him—I was theonly one who could. Vinnie wanted to convey a personal message to a friend ofhis, named Ron, who was having either a birthday party or a wedding, and wasalive and well. Vinnie wanted to put his message on Ron’s answering machine.Vinnie had hoped that if I hit RECORD, his voice would then be recorded onto thetape, across the expanse of the afterlife. I did what he asked and he spoke themessage. When I played it back, all we got was a droning voice in thebackground—and it wasn’t audible enough to understand anything. I then got theidea that since I could hear Vinnie perfectly well, all he had to do was speakto me, and then I would repeat the words he said into the machine. This was avery precise prophecy of the work I would be led to do beginning on November 10.Another fascinating time-loop synchronicity has happened as I am editing thefinal hardcover version of the book, on February 12, 2020. Just three days ago,I found out that my insider Daniel, who passed away on February 3, 2020, hadrecorded a private message for me just before he died. His son reached out to meby email and sent the audio file to me. Events like these never cease to amazeme.As the dream continued, I kept trying to climb up into a part of the Schoolhousethat was very difficult to reach, and looked like an attic. I had frustratingand ongoing trouble with the stairs, and eventually I had to climb over a hugemetallic light fixture at the top to get where I wanted to go. In dreamsymbology, this seemed to indicate the trouble I was having in activating myhigher chakras, which would allow this Edgar Cayce–style “tuned trancetelepathy” communication to take place. I did finally reach the attic area ofthe Schoolhouse that I was looking for. At this point, I discovered that I couldfly with no effort whatsoever, and I soared into the air. My college friendChris was there, or at least a being that was projecting the image of Chris tome, and I told him I knew I was dreaming. The ground beneath me was twinklinglike a hologram, and it was exceptionally beautiful and rich with vibrant,surreal-looking colors.For whatever reason, I again found myself back at the Schoolhouse, even though Iwas still lucid. Once more, I felt the need to try to climb into the sameinaccessible space. Then, a stepladder came down that looked exactly like theone we used to reach the attic in the house I grew up in. Finally, I was able toclimb the stairs easily. As another very interesting time-loop synchronicity, asI now write this in November 2019, my mother was just back at this same house toget the heat turned on for the winter. I was fortunate enough to get my companyto reacquire the little house I grew up in when it came on the market. It was atleast ten times less expensive than a typical house in Los Angeles. I can neverremember living anywhere else but this house in my childhood, for my parents gotit when I was seven months old and my mother didn’t sell it until two yearsafter I graduated from college in 1997. Part of why my company reacquired it wasto shoot a movie there, where we would reenact various things that happened tome while I was growing up, like the bookshelf under the cellar stairs, thecloset where I drew a large sketch of my two-and-a-half-foot-tall “Friend” onthe wall, and the out-of-body experience in the upstairs hallway and stairwell.In November 2019, the original wooden attic staircase had since been replacedwith an aluminum one, and Mom could not get it to open. Let’s not forget that inthe dream from New Year’s Day 1996, I had exceptional difficulty with this exactsame stepladder. In real life, Mom was texting me, sending pictures of theextended ladder and asking me how to fix the problem. I sent her a PDF file ofthe installation manual for the Louisville Attic Ladder after she photographedthe label and sent it to me. The gas technician ended up effortlessly liftingthe stairs and closing the hatch, which caused my mother to laugh and text meback that everything was fine. Mom was amazed at how little the house hadchanged in the twenty-two years since she sold it in 1997. This was the firsttime she had seen it since she moved out. The house was very cold when shearrived, and she had spent almost an hour trying to figure out how to close theattic. Just today, I was taking care of various details to make sure the houseis ready for the winter. So again, the time-loop synchronicity between theevents that took place in this dream and the events of my present as I finishthis book is impressive.In the original dream from 1996, once I entered the attic, a remarkable seriesof visions began. I saw a landscape ablaze with brilliant, almost impossiblecolors. Everywhere I looked, there were fantastic, highly futuristic structuresthat looked like they must have been made by advanced extraterrestrial beings.This view was essentially identical to the illustrations of the undergroundcities of the Anshar that Corey Goode would end up commissioning after hiscontact experiences in 2016. It was so amazing that I had little I could compareit to at the time. I started running joyfully through this marvelous landscapeof colors and structures. Along the way, I kept finding lotus flowers that wereeverywhere, and picking them up. Just like a video game, each time I picked upone of the lotus flowers, my overall power level seemed to increase. It wasquite spectacular. Since I appear to be in a time loop here, I can read this asanother of many signs that my higher-density friends are very happy with me forfinally writing this up, after all these years, so I can share it with you.EG&G ROTRONNot long after I started my stressful new job, I was in Woodstock with anacquaintance, who I will call Karen. We passed by the EG&G facility in the area.Excitedly, I blurted out, “Oh, look, EG&G Rotron! That’s where theyreverse-engineer the UFOs.” Karen was suddenly overcome, visibly shaking, on thebrink of tears. “What. . . . Did. You. Just. Say?” I then repeated myself. “Iread about it in a book. Alien Contact by Timothy Good. According to hisinsiders, almost all of the military defense contractors are working on this.”She responded, “If I tell you something, you have to promise me that you willnever say a word about this to another soul.” Now you can see why I am not usingher real name or any identifying features. I promised, and she continued. “Myfather . . . used to work at EG&G. He could never tell us anything about what hewas doing, nor could he take us to work.” I did not interrupt her, but I hadheard stories like this before from my senior-year roommate, Artie, and myjunior high school friend Kevin. She began crying. “Finally, one day he told us.‘They’ll kill me,’ he said. ‘I need to tell you this, but you can never tellanother soul. If you do, they’ll kill me . . . and they’ll probably kill you aswell, and everyone else we love.’”She was shaking with fear and sobbing. I promised her I would keep this tomyself. I had no problem with confidentiality. “It was UFOs,” she said. “Myfather was working on UFOs. Top, top secret programs. And he was scared.Whatever they were working on was absolutely vital to our survival on planetEarth. It was our only hope. That’s all I know.”After she had calmed down a little more, I opened up to her. “Karen, I’ve knownthis stuff was true for three years now, ever since my buddy heard about it fromhis college physics professor, who worked for NASA in the 1970s. I’ve alreadyread over three hundred books on all of this, and my dream is to become afull-time, professional UFO researcher. There are several insiders who have comeforward and risked their lives to speak about the same things your dad refusedto talk about. So let me just say this . . . regardless of what they told yourdad, this is not just about ‘evil aliens.’ The real story is much deeper thanthat, and there are definitely good guys and bad guys out there. The whole storyis starting to look more and more like a biblical battle between angels anddemons. If your father only encountered or heard about the negative types, I canimagine he would be quite upset.”As I kept talking to her and addressing her concerns, I could see her visiblystart to relax. I gave her some of my most impressive stories of dreams,serendipitous “non-coincidences” and future prophecies, including the Biblequote I’d received through automatic writing—and she was truly amazed. I saidthe angelic, benevolent ETs were reaching out to us in dreams andsynchronicities, and were making sure that our individual and collectivedestinies were being steered toward the most positive outcome. The more westarted listening to them, the more they would be authorized to tell us. Thatwas the first and the last time she ever wanted to talk about what her fatherhad told her.ERIC’S DREAM OF THE OLD MANOn January 18, 1996, I got the two-hundred-dollar phone bill in the mail that Idescribed in the previous chapter. I was terrified that this one bill might ruinme financially. I had prayed for the ETs who gave me the Bible quote to showthemselves, but nothing happened. We had plenty of snow on the ground when Iwoke up the next morning, and it was quite cold outside. Even though my oldSubaru had a terrible habit of revving itself up way too high if it was leftrunning, I went out and started the car to warm it up. I had already showeredand was just going to stuff some breakfast in my face before I hurried off towork at the last minute, as usual. When I came back into the house, Eric wasawake and on the phone. This was highly unusual, since he worked the late shiftand would have had only about five or six hours of sleep by this point, comparedto his usual eight. Eric had reddish pillow creases all over his face, and hiseyes were barely open. I wondered who in the world would have called us thisearly, since everyone knew not to call us in the morning. It was one of hisbusiness associates who had been looking into getting a graduate degree inarchive and records management from SUNY Albany. Eric got off the phone right asI was about to head for the door. “I just had this crazy dream about you,” hesaid.“Eric, I can’t listen to your dream right now! I’ve got to go to work!” Hereplied, “David, you’re definitely going to want to hear this one. It had UFOsin it.” Now, as the Subaru continued roaring away at 5,000 revolutions perminute outside, everything came to a screeching halt. “Okay, you got me. Let’shave it.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENGATEWAY TO THE LAW OF ONEThe date was January 19, 1996. I had desperately prayed to know if I was anextraterrestrial soul the night before. The answer was now about to arrive inthe form of a dream my housemate was having—even though he had no idea that Ihad made the prayer, since he didn’t get home until after I went to sleep.Eric’s dream started with him and me walking around in public with a girl heliked from the Rosendale Café, named Lenore. (I later incorrectly remembered thewoman in the dream as being my ex-girlfriend Yumi, but my original notebookrevealed the character’s name.) We were all hanging out together in somethinglike an outdoor mall. In his dream, the mall had no ceiling—it was all open tothe outside air. Plenty of people were milling around, shopping and having fun.ERIC DREAMS OF THE MOMENT OF TRUTHSuddenly, IT happened. UFOs. Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. Maybe thousands.Who knows. They were everywhere. Flying through the skies. Flying in formation.Swooping, darting, and dancing around each other. It was the Big One. The momentwe all had either hoped or feared might happen one day, after seeing so manymovies about extraterrestrials. Everyone was gasping, staring up into theheavens, pointing their fingers, covering their mouths with their other hands,crying out, and in some cases screaming.One of the disc-shaped craft dropped in for a closer look. A three-foot-wideflat disc came down out of the craft on a beam of light. A man was standing onthe disc, surrounded by brilliant white light. He was wearing a white robe. Hehad sandals on his feet. He had gray hair and a gray beard. Eric said he had“very sensitive features.” Leaves and bits of debris were swirling around him ina vortex. Eric said he looked like our normal vision of Jesus, although he hadclearly gotten older than our typical illustrations of him—with gray instead ofbrown hair. He was also a picture-perfect description of the wise old man I hadbeen seeing in my own dreams ever since I was two years old.The old man began talking about the same kinds of Ascension prophecies that Ihad already been discussing with Eric, based on many dreams I was having andbooks I was reading:> My brothers and sisters. Do not be afraid. I am here with you. We are here> with you. Now. We always have been here with you. We are your angels, your> guardians and protectors. We are your elder brothers and sisters. We are your> family. We are you, and you are us. We have come to see you today because this> is the time of times. The Alpha and the Omega. You were always wondering.> Searching. Alone. Not sure. Never quite happy with the way things were.> > Now all of that has changed. An event is taking place, right now. A> Graduation. It is time for each of you to make a choice. You can come with us,> and live like we do, as true spiritual masters who tread lightly and are never> seen unless we choose to be. Or, you can decide not to come with us. And that> is fine. No harm will come to you. We will bring you to a safe place where you> can live on in peace. That place can no longer be the Earth. Not now.> Something is happening to the Earth.

If you> are ready, you can stretch forth your hand—and join us in the new tomorrow. A> future of unspeakable majesty, beauty, and splendor awaits you. The only limit> is your imagination. All the work we have ever done on your planet, for> countless millennia before time as you know it, has brought us to this very> moment. Here. Now. Today. Are you ready?At this point, Eric looked around and realized that everyone else had scatteredand run off in all directions. Now it was just Eric, Lenore, and me, in a hugeand barren outdoor mall. The gravity of the moment could not be underestimated.All three of us were standing there in gaping silence. The old man stoodsilently, as if he was waiting for us to make a decision. Finally, Lenore wasable to put words together. She turned to Eric and said, “Shouldn’t one of us gotalk to him?”Eric replied, “I’ll leave that to David. He’s the UFO guy. He’ll know what tosay!”Both of them turned to look at me, and I accepted the invitation. As I walkedtoward the old man, his platform gently glided down to ground level. I walkedup, stepped onto the platform, and suddenly, there was a spark of recognition. Iknew this man. I had met him before. And I even knew his language. I saidsomething to him that Eric could not understand, but sounded like a greeting.When Eric tried to verbalize what it sounded like, the word was Shezabah. I said“Shezabah” to the man as if it was a question, and then he said it back to me,with an even higher pitch and more of a questioning tone: “Shezabah?!” (I lookedup this word with translation software while writing this book, and ittranslates as “Laughing” in Arabic and “Story” in Zulu. Eric never studiedArabic. These beings do reside 0n a spiritual level that we would most easilyidentify with the emotions of joy and laughter.)Suddenly, full recognition flickered over both our faces. I knew who he was, andhe knew who I was. Memories arose from some forgotten time, long ago, but now itwas as if not a single minute had passed. We both burst into laughter and tears.The man reached out to embrace me, and I hugged him back for several seconds. Wethen turned to face Eric and Lenore, the old man’s arm still around myshoulders. Both of us were smiling widely and laughing. The man then looked intoEric’s eyes with great intensity, and began speaking. He spoke very slowly andcarefully, doing his best to make sure that Eric would remember what he said,word for word:“It is very important that you know that he is one of us.”He looked over to me while he said “he is one of us,” so there was no doubt theold man was saying that I was somehow a member of their lineage.IT ALL COMES CRASHING IN“Is that the end of your dream?” I asked Eric. “Yeah, that’s it,” he replied.“Okay, man, I have REALLY got to go. Right now!” I dashed out the door and theSubaru was redlining at over 5,000, as expected. I got in, slammed the door,drove off, and definitely was not going to be on time. My curly-haired Irishboss scolded me as I arrived, and I knew I was in trouble: “Deevid, we caan’thaave ya comin’ ta work leet. You’ve got ta pull it together! What is it thistime? Did ya decide ta stop off for a coffee? Cup’a joe? Come on, Deevid, let’sgo. Everyone heere’s dependin’ on ya.”That day the activity in the Behavior Rooms was literally nonstop. It was oneround of screaming, fighting, escape attempts, and chaos after another. I neverhad a split second to think or to relax. I was totally in the moment of doing myjob and maintaining order. A new girl had been hired who also had a BA inpsychology, whom I recognized from some of my classes. She had no idea how tokeep the peace, so everything was on my shoulders. She would just reel in horroras fights broke out, and she was not prepared to stop full-grown men fromrushing for the exits as soon as they saw the opportunity. If anyone made it outinto the hallway, I was in big trouble, as we were only fifty feet from thefront doors, which opened out into the parking lot from the inside, thanks tofire code requirements. If anyone escaped, it could shatter our already fragilerelationship with the surrounding community. I literally did not even have timeto think about Eric’s dream. My mind was incredibly focused on my most basicsurvival.Then, right after that day of work, I had to drive back up to Scotia to see mymother for a belated Christmas visit. I was now driving at full speed on the NewYork State Thruway through a horrific downpour. My windshield was fogging upfrom the inside. I had to wipe it with the edge of my sleeve to have a hole Icould see through. I kept hitting puddles that caused my car to suddenly slowdown and slide. The technical term for this is “hydroplaning,” and it isterrifying. I honestly felt that if I didn’t keep driving, and tried to pullover somewhere, someone would hit me. I had to keep going. I had the exact samefeeling of total panic, urgency, and terror that I had been enduring all day atwork.Suddenly, as my sweating hands gripped the steering wheel hard enough to leavefingernail marks behind, it hit me. My prayer. From the night before. It’s THEM.The beings. Whoever they are, they answered. It’s Eric’s Dream. Eric’s Dream isthe answer to the prayer! And the answer is YES! I am one of THEM! Oh. My. GOD!ASTONISHING CONFIRMATIONAt this point, with all the tension and fear and stress and pain and agony, notto mention a blinding migraine headache, I simply burst into tears. I could notcontrol it. I realized this was a very, very dangerous situation. I could notsafely drive a car when I was this emotional. It was far more dangerous for meto try to keep driving at this point than to pull over. I found the edge of theroad and pulled way, way off to the side, well into the grass. And then I justlet myself cry. I sobbed and sobbed and sobbed, for at least a half hour. By thetime I stopped, the clouds had all blown away and the rain was gone. I continuedon with the rest of my trip, enjoying great visibility and peace.Now that such a stunning confirmation had happened, I could hardly even imaginethe resources available to these beings. Somehow, they were able to send me amessage through a dazzling example of synchronicity, using someone else’s dreamsto prove this was not my imagination. I had had the urge to go start my car atthe perfect moment. A friend of Eric’s had called us at exactly the right time.Eric’s dream was timed to end precisely in conjunction with these events. Threecompletely different people had been triangulated on the same moment of spaceand time, but none of us had any conscious idea that this was all being guidedby an unseen, benevolent force.Wave after wave of thoughts went through my mind. “You said you wanted theanswer. Well, you got it. You are an Angelic Soul. And ‘this Ascension thing’you’ve been reading, thinking, and dreaming about? It IS going to happen. Youknow that now. What other answer could there be? Did you tell Eric about yourprayer? No. Had you read the Bible even once in your life before seeing thatquote from Ecclesiastes? No. This is real. This is happening. This is Now. Thisis your life, David!”REMARKABLE TIME LOOPS WHILE WRITING THIS CHAPTERImmediately after writing this last paragraph, I got up from my desk to go tothe bathroom for a much-needed break. I have been so “in the moment” of relivingthese memories that I have had tears streaming down my face and a wild headache.I looked out the window and there was a beautiful golden hawk, perched up on thehighest branch of the tallest tree. Then I looked over at the clock, and it wasat 4:44 P.M. Once again, right while I am putting this section together inwritten form on Independence Day 2019, just hours after the biggest earthquakewe’ve had in Los Angeles for twenty-five years, the appearance of this hawk wasanother noteworthy synchronicity.I knew the hawk was a very powerful symbol to have appeared at this point in thewriting process. In Egyptian mythology, Ra and Horus, the hawk-headed god, areoften seen as one and the same thing. As it says in the Ancient HistoryEncyclopedia:> There were many falcon gods (known as Avian Deities) in Egyptian religion who> were eventually absorbed into the god known as Horus. . . . In time, he became> combined with the sun god Ra to form a new deity, Ra-Harahkhte, god of the> sun, who sailed across the sky during the day and was depicted as a> falcon-headed man wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt with the> sun disk on it. His symbols are the Eye of Horus (one of the most famous> Egyptian symbols) and the falcon.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber76]The Law of One was authored by a group of three people who allegedlycommunicated with an entity known as Ra, asking questions and recording theresponses. Ra had first reached out to the ancient Egyptians—and claimed thattheir totem animal was the hawk. In Session 96, Question 11, the questionerasked, “Was there a significance with respect to the hawk that landed the otherday just outside of the kitchen window?” The answer was “This is correct. We maynote that we find it interesting that queries offered to us are often alreadyknown. We assume that our confirmation is appreciated.”2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber77] Additionally, the very last words thequestioner of the Law of One ever spoke in the entire series, in Session 106,Question 23, were “I would certainly appreciate the return of the golden hawk.It gave me great comfort.”3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber78] That only made thesynchronistic appearance of the golden hawk, along with a 4:44 clocksynchronicity, even more interesting as I was writing these words.When Ra eventually reached out to my friend and insider colleague Corey Goodethrough a member of its civilization in 2015, it appeared as an eight-foot-tallavian humanoid with blue feathers. This has caused many skeptics online to jeerat us with laughter, but the appearance of these “Blue Avians” is extremelyconsistent with the artistic renditions of Avian Deities from ancient Egypt,such as Horus. Ra’s remarks about the importance of the hawk symbol in the Lawof One are only some of the many confirmations they make of their true identityand appearance, since they also claim responsibility for building the GreatPyramid and working with the First Dynasty in Egypt.As I wrote this book, I went back and looked to see what dreams I had after thisstunningly coordinated three-person synchronicity had occurred. On January 20,1996, I found myself in a beautiful log home in a woodsy area, with highceilings like those of my grandparents’ vacation home in the Adirondacks. Italso looked like the cabin where I ran through the Discovery program fortroubled teens when I was in high school. Now I can see that this was a preciseviewing of my house in Colorado, where I was writing the book in 2019. In thisdream, my mother, my brother, my father, and some of my wife’s family werevacationing there together. This was another astonishing time-loopsynchronicity. Dad and Michael were attending their first-ever Wilcock familyreunion. There was a whole branch of the family from Dad’s side that we hadfallen out of contact with. I would have been there, but I had to finish thisbook. I had just been sent pictures of the reunion and then immediatelyafterward, I reread this dream from 1996 where all of us were together for thefirst time. The cabin in my dream seemed very similar to where they were allmeeting up in the Adirondacks.The next dream was from January 21, 1996, and this also had a direct time-loopconnection to the very moment I was writing the book. In this dream, I wasoutdoors and trying to work on my car. Inside the engine compartment was acurious round cylinder. I opened the container and noticed that there were toolsin it, as well as another, smaller cylinder. I could see that even though thetools appeared to be flat and flimsy, they could be very useful for fixing thevehicle. The problem was that the whole container was filled to the brim with anoxious, chemical-smelling clear liquid. I was quite afraid of plunging my handin to get these tools. Eric did it readily, and everything was fine. “Thosechemicals just keep it clean,” he said. Inside the other cylinder was money, andI realized that the cash was there just in case I needed to pay for emergencyrepairs.In the symbolic dream language, this was talking about my new job in January1996. I was indeed “fixing my spiritual vehicle” by taking this position at thetime. I didn’t like the job, and this was represented by the repair toolsseeming flat and flimsy, and being saturated in a smelly liquid. Then I foundout that it was nontoxic, and there was useful money in there for emergencies.This meant the job wasn’t as bad as I thought it was, and the money I wasearning was very helpful.However, in the present sense, I was now in another stunning time loop. Right asI was reviewing this dream for the first time in twenty-three and a half years,my wife, Elizabeth, called me because her car wouldn’t start. She had the hoodopen and was trying to figure out what to do, just as I was doing in my dream. Aman came by to help her in the parking lot, and he did a great job. She ended upgiving him forty dollars and a bag of chips for his time and trouble—which wasrepresented as the cylinder of emergency money that I saw in my dream. I wastruly amazed to discover yet another time loop of this nature. Never before inmy entire life have I experienced so many obvious time loops in such a shortperiod of time. Then again, this is the first time I have ever written aboutthese experiences in anywhere near this level of detail. Some higher part of meclearly seemed to know exactly when I would finally come around to complete thiscosmic homework assignment.THE LAW OF ONE AND COSMIC VOYAGELet’s now jump back to that pivotal day of January 19, 1996, when Eric’sgame-changing UFO dream came in. After surviving my trip up to my childhood homethrough the rain and breaking down in tears on the side of the road, I realizedI needed to take “this Wanderer thing” a lot more seriously. And that meant Ineeded to read the source text that Scott Mandelker had based all of hisresearch on—the Law of One series.I again stopped off at the now-magical Borders bookstore on Wolf Road in Albany.This was where I had found Mandelker’s book before Thanksgiving, which hadawakened me to the fact that I had an extraterrestrial angelic soul. I knew theyhad Book Three of the Law of One series there, and I bought it. I also picked upa colorful, brand-new hardcover release by another credible PhD UFOlogist, Dr.Courtney Brown, entitled Cosmic Voyage. The book had just been released onJanuary 1, 1996, so I was getting my hands on it less than three weeks after itwas published. Based on the description on the jacket, this book was utterlyirresistible to me.It was nice to see my mother for Christmas, even though it was technically inthe third week of January. Now that I had a bit of free time on my hands, Iagain tried to read Book Three of the Law of One, but it immediately becameclear that this was like walking into an advanced calculus class halfway throughthe semester. There were many different terms I did not understand. This was notat all “light reading,” and I would need to start with Book One and work my wayup from there. That meant special-ordering the other three volumes. I ended upcalling in the order to Ariel Booksellers in New Paltz. Little did I know thatmy initial foray into the Law of One material, by reading parts of Book Three onJanuary 19, 1996, was just four days after the fifteen-year anniversary of whenthe contact started on January 15, 1981. In hindsight, this looked more like asynchronicity than a coincidence. After a short and very relaxing break, where Icouldn’t stop thinking about Eric’s dream, I drove back to Rosendale andreturned to work. As I waited for the other volumes of the Law of One to arrive,I decided to throw myself into Dr. Brown’s Cosmic Voyage whenever I could findsome alone time after work—and I was very impressed with what I found.COSMIC VOYAGE WAS A GAME CHANGERCosmic Voyage triggered a profound shift in my consciousness. By this point, Ihad read just about every book on UFOlogy that I could find, either from thebookstore or the library, and I was becoming quite disillusioned. Almost everybook seemed to be saying the same things, over and over again in an endlessrepetition. Each “new” author just recombined various pieces of an overall bodyof data that was already available. Although this was a large body ofinformation, beyond the scope that anyone could fit into one book, it was alsovery finite in its size and depth.I could examine the entire body of UFO, metaphysics, and ancient civilizationsdata like a three-dimensional holographic puzzle with movable pieces. I couldsee many ways to connect its different areas, and I meta-analyzed how it allintegrated as a whole. I knew its strengths and was very aware of its manyweaknesses. Any one genuine insider could ignite and transform the entirestructure, but they were exceedingly rare marvels within the field. As anexample, no one had ever heard of Area 51 before Bob Lazar emerged on the scenein 1989. Almost every UFO book I read that was published since then wouldmention Lazar’s name, along with various aspects of his testimony. Lazar claimedto have been tasked to reverse-engineer the power system on a crashed UFO, anddiscovered that the source of its massive energy was a triangular lump of asuperheavy substance he called Element 115—a natural element with 115 protons inthe nucleus. At the time, it was theoretically possible that this element mightexist, but it hadn’t been discovered yet.I had memorized all the names of the people involved in the Roswell crash. Ibecame tired of always reading the same names from the original MJ-12 committeethat managed the UFO cover-up in America. I could expound on every theory ofalien abduction, cattle mutilations, missing time, government conspiracy, andthe like. I had read about so many different UFO sightings that they bored me totears at this point. I would skim through those sections of the books withoutreally reading them. “Lights in the sky” just didn’t cut it anymore.I also had familiarized myself with data various authors used to “prove” theformer existence of Atlantis. Even the incredible, epic work Fingerprints of theGods by Graham Hancock was predominantly repeated material for me, except hisstunning analysis of the work of the historians Giorgio de Santillana and Herthavon Dechend. Hancock had combined and refined a large body of the existing dataon ancient civilizations into one volume, with fully annotated scholasticaccuracy and power. In a way, it was a huge relief to see that someone else hadalready done this work. I considered Fingerprints to be a work of absolutegenius, truly worthy of a Nobel Prize. As a whole, I knew the maps, knew themonuments, knew the alignments, knew the Mayan Calendar, Sitchin’s Sumerians,the Vimana flying craft described in the ancient Hindu Vedic scriptures, and thesecrets of the Great Pyramid, Sphinx, and Stonehenge like the back of my hand.There was no question that we were being visited by extraterrestrials, in bothancient and modern times.Hardly anything I read was new. I had become totally saturated. Every time Ipicked up a new book, I felt I was wasting my time, reading the same materialonce again. I usually would just critique each author on how well theyintegrated various pieces of the puzzle. This was extremely disheartening,particularly since I was spending every extra dollar I made on books. TheInternet universe was just getting started, and the amount of content on UFOsand ancient civilizations was sparse. Everything good online would inevitablyorbit around Art Bell, the legendary talk-radio host of Coast to Coast AM. Artwas particularly fascinated with Richard C. Hoagland and the Face on Mars, Dr.Steven Greer and his mysterious top secret whistleblowers, a strange box ofbismuth alloys that apparently would levitate in an electrical field calledArt’s Parts, and Major Ed Dames with his fantastic stories of remote viewing inthe military.REMOTE VIEWING IS AN EXACT SCIENCECosmic Voyage, however, revealed many new truths about remote viewing andextraterrestrial life. With remote viewing, an ordinary person can be trained touse their innate psychic abilities to accurately describe target locations.Remote viewers also have a guide who tells them where to go and what to exploreon-site so they don’t have to engage their conscious mind in thinking, whichcould break the trance and ruin the quality of their information. Both theviewer and their guide would have nothing to work off of but a series ofrandom-number “coordinates” that someone else had assigned to the target—sothere was no possibility of either person influencing the outcome. Despite thisdouble-blind setup where one would expect that ordinary human beings wereguaranteed to fail, the best remote viewers could guarantee a nearly 99 percentsuccess rate in describing their targets. Electronic equipment would be used todetermine that a person had made a 180-degree shift in the polarity of voltagerunning through their bodies, and this signaled that accurate remote viewingcould begin. The initial research breakthroughs began in 1982 with the help oflegendary psychic Ingo Swann.According to Dr. Brown, author of the book Cosmic Voyage, our input from thefive senses, as well as logic and imagination, will eventually cease in deepmeditation. What remains is a “field of consciousness” that can be brimming withactivity. Dr. Brown and his colleagues believe this is a mass mind comprisingall individuals. The data from this greater field of consciousness is normallyoverwritten by our five senses as well as our thoughts, memories, and emotions.The remote viewing protocols give us a means of breaking through theseprotective layers—to “penetrate the veil of forgetting,” in Law of One terms.The trick is to enter into this unique state of consciousness and then carefullybring data out of it, without disrupting your trance state. Dr. Brown’s bookdescribed all the basics of these protocols as it went along.Dr. Brown, a highly credentialed and well-published social scientist with EmoryUniversity in Georgia, emerged with stunning findings that came entirely throughthe realms of consciousness. In his own words: “I have an enviable andhard-earned reputation for thoughtful and creative research, often involvingsophisticated nonlinear mathematical representations of social phenomena.”4[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber79] Dr. Brown got into Transcendental Meditationfrom reading about the Maharishi Effect in a social sciences journal back in1988.As I have discussed in previous volumes, it was discovered that a group of seventhousand trained meditators were somehow able to reduce global war, terrorism,crime, and fatalities by an astonishing 72 percent just by remaining in a stateof meditation. All other potential factors that could have influenced this data,such as weekends, weather, holidays, and the like, were ruled out. Thisdiscovery fundamentally changes what it means to be human, as well as ourunderstanding of the mind. It is therefore not surprising that an open-mindedsocial scientist would seek to learn more about this groundbreaking discoveryand actually experience the meditation training firsthand.Dr. Brown then secured a research grant from Emory University to take aTranscendental Meditation class and directly investigate the Maharishi Effect,while also participating in the process that was creating its stunningpeace-keeping results. He eventually made it all the way up to the Siddhi level.Dr. Brown was ultimately welcomed into a new remote-viewing training program in1993, because the military brass involved realized that a social scientist wouldhave a greater ability to understand the dynamics of extraterrestrial cultures.His prior history with Transcendental Meditation was also seen as useful to themin terms of the speed with which he could be trained.Dr. Brown put his career and reputation on the line to release Cosmic Voyage,where he shared the transcripts and results from a number of fascinatingremote-viewing sessions. Dr. Brown’s targets of choice wereextraterrestrial-related, beginning with a surprise session on September 29,1993. I did find it interesting that the timing of Dr. Brown’s awakening wassimilar to mine, since my NASA disclosure had occurred only about seven monthsbefore this. I didn’t start reading Hoagland’s The Monuments of Mars until thesummer of 1993, so Dr. Brown and I both discovered the secrets of Mars withinjust a few months of each other.Dr. Brown’s military trainers sent him to remote-view the Cydonia area of Mars,where the Face and pyramids Richard C. Hoagland had discussed were located. Theresults came as a total shock to Dr. Brown, who quickly had to adapt to a verynew reality. He saw a pyramid that was far more massive than anything he hadever seen on Earth, along with people who looked essentially the same as humansfrom here. Their civilization was being destroyed much like Pompeii, by avolcano erupting nearby. These people were rescued at the last minute by anextraterrestrial team, and we will explore that story later in the chapter.Extraterrestrial targets like these were regularly interspersed with mundaneordinary locations to keep Dr. Brown honest. One inside joke was that peoplewould be sent to the sewage treatment plant at Fort Meade, Maryland, as acontrol. To me, Dr. Brown’s findings were nothing short of spectacular. They fitin perfectly with everything I was already thinking, learning, dreaming, andreading about at the time. Finally we had some tangible data about what mighthave happened on Mars—data that was obtained through a scientific, repeatableprocess. Even better, the whole book was essentially a collection of mysteriouspuzzle pieces, laid out session by session. Dr. Brown handed you the raw dataand let you draw your own conclusions. In my case, this raw data correlated withhundreds of different things I had already been studying.As Dr. Brown said in his 1996 book,> The most significant discovery of the past fifteen years is that we do not> need to rely on gifted individuals to perform these feats [of remote viewing]> any longer. The talent can be taught, and anyone—including scientists—can> learn it and use it with great accuracy. Moreover, the reliability of trained> individuals is generally much greater than that of the best natural psychics.> Executed competently, studies employing remote viewing using trained viewers> can yield replicable results with nearly total accuracy, virtually all of the> time.5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber80]That was quite a claim for such a credentialed scientist to make, but the datadid support it. Whenever he viewed a conventional target, his accuracy waseffectively 100 percent. He was more than happy to allow his work to bescrutinized and audited to prove this basic fact. Had the media ever taken aninterest, they certainly could have supervised and monitored a session, filmedit, and proved that he was performing this task correctly. This was later donewith Joe McMoneagle on Japanese television, where he was able to reunite along-lost family on live TV.6 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber81] With thisverifiable accuracy for terrestrial targets in mind, if a skeptic were to thensay that everything ET-related that Dr. Brown viewed was false, that wouldviolate the basic protocols of science. At that point, the skeptic is simplyacting on biases and preconceptions they have been taught, to believe we arealone in the universe. As uncomfortable as it may be for people who are notaccustomed to thinking of UFOs and extraterrestrials as real, the most logicalexplanation for Dr. Brown’s findings is that he is seeing the truth, whether itis advanced ancient ruins on Mars or a sewage treatment plant in Fort Meade.According to Dr. Brown, most remote viewers would begin their training byattending the Monroe Institute in Virginia. The Monroe Institute had developed atechnology called Hemi-Sync, which utilized sound frequencies to induceout-of-body states of consciousness. This was brought about through playing atone of, say, 100 cycles per second in one ear and 104 cycles per second in theother ear. This apparently causes a natural “beat frequency” of four hertz toappear between the two hemispheres of the brain as they try to reconcile thedifference. By adjusting the difference between the two sound frequencies, wecan coerce the brain into frequency levels that would usually occur only insleep and dreaming. By doing all this with a guided meditation, the idea was tostay awake as the sounds guide you into a state where you would normally beasleep. This apparently makes it much easier to consciously enter into anout-of-body or lucid-dreaming state. People were apparently having phenomenalsuccess with this at the Monroe Institute, and this was still only atransitional step to learning remote viewing.Dr. Brown’s book also said that remote viewers had greatly debunked, if notcompletely deflated, the entire field of channeling, by scientifically provingthat their data was inaccurate. It was stated in the book that most channelerswere receiving a certain amount of psychic information, but it was tainted withthe “analytic overlays” that came from their conscious mind. Therefore, thestrict protocols of remote viewing were the only way to preserve the accuracy ofthe data.MAJOR ED DAMESMy dreams were making it clearer and clearer that I needed to somehow form abridge from the world of UFO research into the spiritual side of dreaming,lucidity, ancient spiritual teachings, and higher consciousness. Now, with theadvent of Dr. Brown’s Cosmic Voyage, it was starting to happen. Dr. Brown wasprofessionally trained in the same remote-viewing practices as some of ArtBell’s most prominent and favored guests, such as Joe McMoneagle. Not long afterthe release of Cosmic Voyage, it publicly emerged that the anonymous trainer inDr. Brown’s book was the legendary and controversial Major Ed Dames himself.Ed Dames invariably would get on the air and talk about the number one thing hisremote viewers would see in our future, above all else. Their data showed thatin the near future, our sun was going to release a massive blast of light,matter, and energy. It was very difficult, if not impossible to pin down exactlywhen this was going to happen, but the data suggested it was well within ourlifetimes, even if not very soon. Dames had a negative and sardonic view of whatthis event would do to all life on Earth, and he referred to it as the “KillShot.” Art’s morbid humor would kick in and he would say this event would turnus all into “hash browns,” shredded potato cakes that are baked to a goldenbrown. This is also why Art invariably referred to Dames as “Dr. Doom,” andthese stories helped him sell countless units of disaster supplies such asbattery-powered radios that would recharge with a hand crank.I did not know if this solar-event scenario was authentic at the time, but Icertainly was seeing something far more beautiful and amazing in our future thana mass catastrophe. Eric had just had a stunning UFO dream of mass ascension,answering my own prayers to find out about my possible ET identity, on the verysame day I picked up Cosmic Voyage. In Dr. Brown’s book, there were alsotantalizing clues that the intelligence community knew a lot more about UFOs andextraterrestrials than they had ever revealed to the public. That simple truthhad to be factored into any analysis of what may end up happening in thispotential solar event.THE MIDWAYERSThe most exciting example of Dr. Brown’s leaked intel about extraterrestrialswas in his chapter entitled “Subspace Helpers.” The data was acquired in aremote-viewing session from October 2, 1993. The military intelligence communityapparently had a name for the angelic human ETs I had seen in so many dreams,now including those of my housemate Eric. They called these human-looking ETsthe Midwayers. Although the term Midwayers came from a popular channeled workknown as The Urantia Book, Dr. Brown pointed out that his own remote-viewingresearch concluded that this book contained false and manipulative informationinterspersed with truthful information. An example of what Dr. Brown consideredto be false information was the idea that reincarnation is not a genuinephenomenon.7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber82] Dr. Brown had a wealth ofremote-viewing data, not published in the book, that unequivocally suggestedthat reincarnation was a basic fact of life. I would soon find that the Law ofOne series shared the same opinion about the Urantia Book as we see in Session14, Question 30. This would prove to be one of hundreds of differentcorrelations between the Law of One series, Dr. Brown’s material, and so manyother works I had studied.According to Brown, the Midwayers work with light and are very interested infurthering their own evolution. They have been called angels in our own past,but in Dr. Brown’s view, this is not an accurate assessment of who they reallyare—most likely due to the fact that we have so little knowledge of them fromour ancient traditions besides a few surviving written accounts. A bit later on,Dr. Brown said the Midwayers never assume physical form in our own wakingreality, “although their density is close to human physical density and theirbodies are just out of range of our physical abilities to perceive them.”8[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber83] He also said the Midwayers have a criticalassignment to work here on Earth and promote our physical and spiritualevolution.Near the end of his book, these same beings are described when Dr. Brown says,“Remote viewers now know that Earth is also being visited by what appears to befuture humans who also have the technological ability to move through time.”9[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber84] This and other passages made it clear that eventhough these beings exist in a spiritual realm that Dr. Brown chose to call“subspace,” they are still very human. In fact, they are you and me—human beingsfrom our own Earth future, having been activated into a higher level of humanevolution, and then traveling back in time to help us out. The Midwayers lookprecisely the same as the group calling themselves the Anshar, which contactedCorey Goode beginning in 2016. The Anshar also said they were humans fromEarth’s own future who had traveled back in time to help us. I was utterlyfascinated as I reread these details in Dr. Brown’s book, knowing what I knownow. I have seen very similar beings in my dreams on many occasions, and theydefinitely appear to have the ability to move through time. The Law of One hasmany references to beings of this sort and how they work with us. Dr. Brown alsostates, “Linear time does not exist outside of the physical world. All eventshappen simultaneously. . . . Remote viewers can pierce time as easily asspace.”10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber85] Although this may seem very hard tobelieve for most of us, it was a well-established fact within the classifiedworld of the remote viewing community.Another key clue that these people are very human in nature came in chapter 17,from a session done on September 11, 1994. Dr. Brown remote-viewed the creationof various TV episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He saw informationbeing planted into the mind of a writer on the show through his dreams. Theinformation was coming to this man through an implant he had received from aGray-type extraterrestrial. This certainly indicated that the story of the Grayswas far more complex than the malevolent evil they were usually portrayed ashaving in the movies. It mirrored what I had read in The Watchers while I was onthe train to Colorado and back. Dr. Brown ended up exploring this particulargroup in quite some detail throughout the book. We will discuss these particularfindings a bit later.The implant monitored this writer’s thoughts and introduced new ideas to him ona regular basis, particularly while he was asleep. The man happily credited hisown creativity and imagination for these novel ideas. Dr. Brown’s remote viewingindicated that beings we see in Star Trek and other such shows are not portrayedstrictly accurately in terms of how they look. The greater purpose of theseshows is simply to acclimate us to new ideas over time.Dr. Brown also observed that the producers of the initial Star Trek series inthe 1960s were being directly assisted, outside their immediate, visible 3-Dspace, by ten or more human-looking beings who were wearing white, luminousrobes. He then said, “The subspace beings in [this] structure are former humanbeings. I am [also] seeing that they are closely working with the Grays on anEarth project relating to physical humans.” We will return to this intriguingconcept about the Earth project a bit later on. The key that jumped out at me atthis point, once again, was the idea that these angelic Midwayers were in factformer human beings.Brown said the discovery of the Midwayers ricocheted through the remote-viewingcommunity for many years. They learned that these beings have extreme importanceto our lives, but it was very difficult to explain their existence and agenda tomilitary generals worried about defense. At one point early in the book, Dr.Brown said, “I was told of one instance in which a very high-ranking civilianpolitical appointee serving directly under the secretary of defense began toobject strenuously during a top secret briefing on the subject of UFOs when thematters of alien technology and psychic information were raised. The officialasserted that this information was not supposed to be known by any humans untilwe died and learned it from heavenly sources.”11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber86] This quote reveals that even when people have a“need to know” clearance and absolute proof that certain intel is authentic,they might still have a negative reaction to it and completely shut it down.Another key quote about these people from earlier in the book could lead topotential misunderstandings: “The Midwayers are themselves notextraterrestrials, since they apparently are rather permanently based here onEarth. Yet they are not human, nor do they assume human form in a physicalsense. They are subspace beings who live and work in a human environment. TheMidwayers work here, but their command structure does not originate on thisplanet.”12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber87] This one passage could be confusingwhen seen by itself, for elsewhere his data showed that these people are indeedfuture humans who simply do not have physical bodies as we now think of our own,but still look like us. In this same quote, Dr. Brown went on to say that thesepeople are working to promote our human evolutionary potential. They have a goalthat is very important to them, which Dr. Brown admits in the book he doesn’tfully understand. To me, with all the dreams I was having, the answer seemedobvious. Regardless of what you choose to call them, these angelic beings arehere to help guide us through life, in the hope that we will graduate in theupcoming Ascension."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENCOSMIC VOYAGE AND INSIGHTS INTO ASCENSIONIronically, there is no mention of Ascension anywhere in Cosmic Voyage. Dr.Brown and his people were apparently not having the same dreams,synchronicities, and intuitive flashes that I was receiving so frequently.However, Dr. Brown did have a highly intriguing set of data regarding the ideathat human beings from our own time frame, such as Americans, would soon end upbeing relocated to a new planet in the nearby Pleiades star cluster. If wecorrelate this with his trainer Major Ed Dames’s oft-cited reports of a comingsolar flash, this relocation could be seen as some type of cosmic Noah’s arkplan. Advanced future humans could end up moving Earth people to a new planetjust before the solar flash takes place, for our own safety. This vision of ourfuture came from a session Dr. Brown conducted on February 9, 1994.THE GALACTIC FEDERATION AND PLANETARY TRANSFERSTo understand the context of this session, it is important to know that Dr.Brown had created a collection of possible interesting ET-related choices forhis research. These were randomly interspersed with normal targets. One of theinteresting choices was the concept of a “Galactic Federation.” This isapparently a greater spiritual governing body, comprising a variety of advancedextraterrestrial groups working harmoniously together. This concept had appearedin many different channeled books, which Dr. Brown’s data did not conclude werecredible, but he wanted to explore the concept nonetheless. On February 9, 1994,without knowing the target, Dr. Brown got his first intuitive look at thisGalactic Federation.In his remote viewing session, he perceived himself entering a toweringstructure that had energetic, bright white, blue, and yellow lights. He noticedan energy vortex encircling a round object in the center of the room, which hefeels may have been a planet, or at least a holographic projection of such animage. He could smell ammonia in the air. The many beings in this facility wereall bald, humanoid, and wore white gowns. It felt like a Zen monastery, and theycommunicated both verbally and telepathically. Dr. Brown was welcomed by apresident or prime minister of this group, and felt this was a highlycompetitive job. Dr. Brown was told that Earth human representation on thecouncil was beginning now. The head being was wearing a bluish-white gown andwas a bit heavyset. He was somber, but had a definite sense of humor, whichtogether made him appear like Buddha. The identification of this being as Buddhawas introduced into Dr. Brown’s mind, apparently to help facilitate greatercommunication. This does not necessarily mean that this being actually wasBuddha, merely that it took that form to help Dr. Brown feel more comfortable.Dr. Brown was shown an image of our Milky Way galaxy divided up into sectionswith dotted lines. He was told that this Federation did need our help in agalactic sense. Specifically, Dr. Brown said,> I am being told that there will be a movement off the planet in the future for> humans. . . . Earth humans are violent and troublesome currently. They need> shaping before a later merger. Definitely humans need to undergo some sort of> change before extending far off the planet. . . . There definitely will be a> planetary disaster, or perhaps I should say disasters. There will be political> chaos, turbulence, an unraveling of the current political order. . . . He is> telling me very directly that consciousness must become a focal concern of> humans in order for us to proceed further. . . . We [in the Federation] are> not saviors, just initial representatives.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber88]Dr. Brown’s words from 1996 are certainly prophetic as I write these words in2019. We are most definitely seeing “political chaos, turbulence, [and] anunraveling of the current political order” in a way that would have seemedunimaginable back when his words were written.Nothing about this idea of an upcoming catastrophe was upsetting or frighteningto me, because by this point, I had experienced over three years’ worth ofdreams encouraging me to see such an event as a multidimensional evolution ofwhat it means to be human. Regarding the idea of being a human representativefor the Galactic Federation, Dr. Brown was also told not to let this work go tohis head, but just to do his job: “I am told in no uncertain terms that I am tocomplete this book project. Others will play their parts. There are manyinvolved. Many species, representatives, groups.”2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber89] Reading this passage in 1996 encouraged me thatI might have my own role to play in the process, as so many of my dreams hadbeen suggesting. The Federation was described as a galactic governmentalorganization, where Earth humans are now being prepared for full membership.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber90]ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATION OF EARTH HUMAN TRANSFERThe idea of Earth humans being transferred elsewhere in an expected near-termfuture event was given far more detail in a session from March 10, 1994. Thisdata appears in Dr. Brown’s book in a chapter entitled “The Human Repository.”Here, Dr. Brown remote-viewed a planet in the Pleiades star system. He noticedsomething very bright in the sky. He was able to perceive that there were beingsnear the light who were more advanced than the beings he was seeing on theground of this world. Once he looked at the people on the surface, he said thefollowing: “Focusing on the ground for now, there is dirt, grass, and humanswearing normal American-type casual clothing. Let me check that out. Yep. Pants,socks, shoes, the works. The humans are quite upset. There is a lot of fearhere, plus crying.”4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber91] He said the beings in thesky seemed like Grays. When he tried to tap into the timeline for when thisevent took place, he saw that it was sometime slightly later than the year 2000.This fit in with countless speculations of a change surrounding the end date ofthe Mayan Calendar, namely December 21, 2012, or sometime not too longthereafter. I do believe that even though the 2012 “end date” came and went, weare still very much heading toward a solar-system wide multidimensional shift inour near future. Quoting Dr. Brown again, “It seems that humans migrated here”to this new world in the Pleiades star cluster.As he delved into this vision even deeper, he noticed how familiar these peoplewere. It wasn’t that they were extraterrestrials who had a surprising similarityto people from Earth. They very clearly were from Earth. According to Dr. Brown,“[these people] really seemed like Americans. They appeared to be farming peoplewho perhaps lived in or visited a nearby city or village. The Gray ET beingswere doing what was a fairly routine mission for them.”5[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber92] This raised the intriguing idea that the Grayswere here, at least in part, to help facilitate transfers of people from oneplanet to another, such as for a protective measure. This mirrored BettyAndreasson’s testimony in The Watchers, where the Grays told her they protectthe seed of humanity as well as the biosphere of the Earth. They could use thisliving genetic material to terraform a new planet for us as needed. If atransfer like this had once happened to our ancestors, and they got dropped offhere on Earth, the story would quickly turn into ancient mythology. Soon, no onewould believe we had originated on another planet in the past.As the session went on, the Grays contacted Dr. Brown directly, and startedtrying to feed him information faster than he could handle. As he tried toprocess all the information, he said the following: “The people on this [new]world are from Earth. The Grays brought them here. They have been transplanted.The humans do not know everything. They do not even know where they are.”6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber93] When Dr. Brown asked the reason for why thishappened, the response was “Human survival is at stake. A new location is neededaway from Earth’s climatic disasters.”7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber94] TheGrays went on to tell him that they were transplanting our genetic material toensure our survival with a better, more advanced gene pool. They added new ormodified genes to increase the connections between our spirits and physicalbodies.As the session continued, Dr. Brown discovered that this new place was a Class Mplanet orbiting a binary star system, sometime shortly after 2000 AD. Bear inmind that a date range of 2030 would still be considered “shortly after 2000AD.” The post-2000 time frame fit with many other prophecies I had encounteredover the years. Dr. Brown also said, “It seems that some humans will be‘space-lifted’ to a safe haven while the rest of humanity slugs it out backhome.”8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber95] This was literally identical to theAscension scenario I had already been studying and meditating on. It was quitesurprising that Dr. Brown was presenting this as “raw data” without seeming tounderstand any of the backstory behind it that I had already been researching.The transfer Dr. Brown was seeing may well have been describing what wouldhappen to those people who were not really Ascending but just needed to be movedto a safe place once the Earth went through its upheavals. This exact sameconcept would appear only weeks later when I read the Law of One. The people whograduate into fourth density in this apparently multidimensional event do get toremain on Earth as it transforms into a fourth-density planet.Dr. Brown now revealed that other remote-viewing data showed Grays collectingplant and animal specimens from the Earth, apparently to help transfer it to thenew world. I had seen similar reports of ETs scooping up trees and water in anumber of UFO books, and again this was precisely the same thing that BettyAndreasson heard from the Grays in The Watchers. Yet, Dr. Brown never referencedthis material at any point in the book. In Dr. Brown’s next session, he had anon-ET-related calibration target: He viewed President Clinton accurately. EdDames immediately pulled him out once he recognized Clinton.9[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber96]GRAYS ARE CHILDREN OF THE LOGOSAnother interesting piece of information occurred when Dr. Brown was apparentlyable to connect with a being he identified as Jesus. In a session from June 14,1994, Dr. Brown admitted that he felt very disturbed about the idea that therecould be anything good about the Grays. Once he got the opportunity to meet thisJesus-like being, the question of the Grays was very much on his mind. Accordingto Dr. Brown, “[the being identifying as Jesus said] there is no being thathumans will interact with that is not of his design. He then stated that we areto help his children however they come to us.”10[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber97] Brown did not understand what this means. Forstarters, the passage suggests that the identity of Jesus is actually a galacticconsciousness. The Law of One, which I would begin reading immediately after Dr.Brown’s book, very clearly revealed this same concept, albeit with a slightlyveiled code.What if Jesus became the full embodiment on Earth of a galactic superidentitythat makes humanlike beings in its image across countless millions of planetswithin this galaxy? It would stand to reason that Jesus would then see any andall life within our galaxy as his own children. “God the Father” could thenrepresent the universe as a whole, whereas “God the Son” would be our own nativegalaxy. This is precisely what the Law of One hints at by referring to ourgalaxy as the Logos, which translates as “word” in Greek. This is also where thecommon term logo, such as a stylized design for the name of a business, isderived from. The Collins English Dictionary defines Logos as a term fromChristian theology that means “the divine Word; the second person of the Trinityincarnate in the person of Jesus.”11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber98] The Law ofOne does not constrain the meaning of Logos as this dictionary definition does.Everything in the universe is a projection of the Logos within the Law of Onesystem.The term logos appears throughout 146 different Law of One passages, and is alsosaid to be equivalent to the word love.12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber99] InSession 13, Question 7, the term Logos clearly refers to the consciousness ofthe entire manifest universe: “Awareness led to the focus of infinity intoinfinite energy. You have called this by various vibrational sound complexes,the most common to your ears being ‘Logos’ or ‘Love.’ The Creator is thefocusing of infinity as an aware or conscious principle, called by us as closelyas we can create understanding/learning in your language, intelligentinfinity.”13 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber100] In Session 28, Question 7, theLaw of One says, “There are many different Logos entities or creations, and wewould call each, using your sound vibration complexes, a galaxy.”14[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber101]In the classic Bible verse at the very beginning of the book of John, namely1:1, it says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and theWord was God.”15 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber102] If we modify this seeminglymysterious verse by using the original Greek word Logos, the passage would readas: “In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logoswas God.” Shortly thereafter in John 1:14, again swapping the term Logos forword, we have, “And the Logos was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”16[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber103]By using the term Logos for the galactic mind as well as the embodiment of theentire universe, as well as the definition of love itself, the Law of Oneclearly seems to be hinting that we should read and meditate on these Biblepassages. This may not satisfy fundamentalist views that want to see Earthhumans as the only “Chosen Ones” out there, but as we acclimate to thewidespread presence of extraterrestrial life, the Law of One series provides uswith a way in which our own traditional religions can easily adapt—and still beseen as highly relevant in a much greater galactic context. The Jesus thatChristians pray to may well be an embodiment of the same creator that all lifein our galaxy emanates from.Again, in Law of One philosophical terms, the One Infinite Creator that made allthe universe is the Logos, or “God,” and our galaxy is also a Logos, or the “sonof God” that is “with God,” as it said in John 1:1: “The Logos was with God, andthe Logos was God.” This also ties back in with Genesis 1:27, where if wereplace the word God with Logos and make it gender-neutral, we get, “The Logoscreated human beings in its own image.”17 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber104]Every insider I have spoken to has said that all extraterrestrial life in ourgalaxy has a humanlike appearance. The human form is therefore the image of howthe mind of our galaxy chooses to express itself as intelligent life.Therefore, instead of contradicting Christian thought, the Law of One seriespresents a new idea where the mind of the galaxy is available to all on Earth,as well as all others throughout our galaxy. All intelligent life in this galaxywould then be an embodiment of the mind of the galactic Logos. Dr. Brown’sresults clearly supported this concept, and again he never read the Law of Oneseries. I confirmed this in a written interview with him while writing thisbook. He was very excited to hear about some of the connections I had found.Later in Dr. Brown’s book, the being identifying as Jesus was asked ifnon-Christians would still need to call on the name of Jesus to reach their fullevolutionary potential. The being seemed genuinely upset and frustrated by thisquestion. “Quite forcefully, he stated that a name is nothing. Everythingdepends on personality development, and this includes the development of a deepability to both perceive and love beyond the self.”18[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber105] This was a comfortable answer that I couldcertainly agree with, particularly in light of how much difficulty my own motherhad with mainstream fundamentalist Christian religious views. The Law of Oneseries frequently speaks about the development and disciplines of thepersonality as being of paramount importance, such as in Session 74, Question10. The three-part formula for the discipline of the personality is given inSession 74, Question 11, as follows: “One, know yourself. Two, accept yourself.Three, become the Creator. The third step is that step that, when accomplished,renders one the most humble servant of all, transparent in personality andcompletely able to know and accept other selves. . . . To become the Creator isto become all that there is. There is then no personality in the sense withwhich the adept begins its learn/teaching.”19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber106]It is very common for people to assume that all Grays must be evil, if they evenbelieve in this UFO subject whatsoever. My research has certainly concluded thatsome types of Grays are negative, and many insiders have revealed that there area large number of varieties. You can definitely have intelligent life within ourgalaxy, or Logos, that is negatively polarized. In Law of One terms, this simplymeans that the being is “confused”—a word that is used in 101 differentpassages.20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber107] Eventually all beings will awakenin the dream and reunite with Oneness, no matter how “confused” they may be. TheGray type of form is simply one of the ways in which the human body can evolve,where the eyes and head grow larger relative to the rest of the body. Or, justas Raymond Fowler described in The Watchers, you could grow a neonate—a beingthat looked just like a Gray—from a normal human fetus if its head was notcompressed by the pressure of a womb as it grew.When I then thought back to my original NASA disclosure, the insider said theyhad identified three types of beings. The tallest was a human type that lookedvery similar, but not identical to us. The next tallest of them was aphysiologically authentic Gray. The shortest of the three types was a beingwearing a sophisticated helmet that made it look like it was a Gray, butunderneath the helmet, its actual face was “a monstrosity.” This stronglysuggested that the facial features were of a reptilian appearance instead. Thatwas the intuitive flash I got when I first received this information in 1993.Dr. Brown’s own research also revealed at least three different races of Grays.The idea that not all Gray-type ETs visiting us are evil also fits with theprodigious research of Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack in his epic classicfrom 1994, Abduction.21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber108] Dr. Mack cataloged andsummarized dozens of UFO contactee reports, where he brought people under deephypnosis and helped them retrieve memories that would otherwise have been lost.Many Gray-style beings were encountered in these regressions, and most of theinteractions were remarkably uplifting and positive. The mainstream media neversaid a word about the conclusions of Dr. Mack’s book, and he died a tragic anduntimely death in 2004, when he was struck by a driver suspected of beingdrunk.22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber109] I was very sad that I never got tomeet him or discuss his findings with him in any capacity.Perhaps the closest we ever got in the mainstream media to an admission of Dr.Mack’s research was a quote from his obituary in the New York Times. Regardinghis abduction research, it said, “In the 1990s, Dr. Mack studied dozens ofpeople who said they had had such contact with aliens, culminating in his bookAbduction: Human Encounters with Aliens in 1994. In it, he focused less onwhether aliens were real than on the spiritual effects of perceived encounters,arguing that “the abduction phenomenon has important philosophical, spiritualand social implications for everyone.”23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber110]When I considered all this data as a whole, I speculated that if a certain typeof future humans who now looked like Grays were conducting vital, planet-savingoperations, their negative and demonic ET opponents would most definitely wantto interfere with their mission. By actually impersonating these Grays andconducting terrifying and traumatic abductions, Earth people could be confusedbeyond any hope of seeing good in Gray-type extraterrestrials. Christians andother religious people may come to see Grays and all other extraterrestrial lifeas strictly demonic, and some of them definitely do. Once again, this could beanother example of “divide and conquer,” where people who look different from usare demonized as “the other,” so we will eventually have no trouble in agreeingto their mass slaughter. We will explore much more on this in an upcomingchapter on the Watchers, as the Grays referred to themselves in the BettyAndreasson case.In Dr. Brown’s session from June 14, 1994, the being appearing as Jesus alsosaid there should be no limits to our desire to help others, whether Grays orpeople from Mars or whoever. If we want to elevate ourselves to the next stageof our evolution, prejudice cannot coexist with these higher forms of life. Thebeing identifying as Jesus also said it is not that we should work with the ETs,it is that we must. Our situation here on Earth has been deliberately designedso that both groups need each other for their individual and mutual well-being.EXPLORING THE LOST CIVILIZATION OF MARSIn my initial read, perhaps the single most invigorating thing about Dr. Brown’sCosmic Voyage was that he put a name and a face to the civilization that wasresponsible for constructing the Martian monuments. I had read about this lostcivilization with amazement in Richard C. Hoagland’s book The Monuments of Marsafter my NASA disclosure in 1993, and I never missed a single appearance of hison the air with Art Bell. Now, three years later, I felt we were finally gettingsome deeper insights into what the heck these monuments were, and who builtthem. Unless an insider came out with stunning new intel on Mars, which didhappen later in my career, the only viable means of gathering information aboutsomething like this would be through a verifiable intuitive process such asremote viewing or Edgar Cayce–quality psychic readings, which are extremelyrare, to say the least.If Dr. Brown was right, then the people from Mars were our own long-lostbrothers and sisters. They were very close to being human like us, only taller.Dr. Brown’s first-ever ET-related remote-viewing session revealed that largenumbers of the Martian civilization went through a series of Gray abduction-typegenetic procedures prior to the destruction of their planet, and that theirgenetic materials and souls were later transferred into new bodies on Earth.Again, Dr. Brown’s first visit to Mars was on September 29, 1993. At the time,he had no idea that extraterrestrial targets like this could even exist. As thesession went on, he struggled to understand the wonders and horrors he wasseeing, but the protocols require us not to analyze or attempt to interpretanything. We just continue performing the procedure. In this case, Dr. Brownfound himself looking at a gigantic pyramid, vastly larger than anything he hadever known to exist on Earth. He knew that this massive structure had to do withworship. He determined that it was solid but hollow inside, and very tall. Astime went on, he realized that many people had died to build it. At a certainpoint, a volcano began erupting near the pyramid. It was a scene very much likePompeii. Lots of people were dying, and there was a terrible feeling of completehopelessness. Those who survived the catastrophe were thrown into desperatepoverty.PACKAGED AND TRANSFERRED TO EARTHDr. Brown’s data showed that a new group of people “from very far away” thencame in to help the survivors and to rebuild. When Major Ed Dames told him whatthe target was at the end of the session, Dr. Brown was completely astonished.On October 2, 1993, he conducted a Type Six session, where both the viewer andthe guide knew what the target was: to go back to Mars. Although this is not asreliable as the double-blind method, many experiments have proven that viabledata can still be gathered this way. Dr. Brown noted that the people of Mars hadno hair and larger eyes than humans. They also had some telepathic ability. Thefeel of their culture and architecture reminded Dr. Brown of places he hadstudied in Africa. The peak of Martian society could specifically be compared tothat of ancient Egypt. The women stayed at home with their children, for themost part.At a certain point in their history, the people of Mars experienced an extremelyrapid advancement in technology. Not long after this, their civilizationcollapsed. Many of the people died in this catastrophe and some were rescued,but they did not necessarily like the terms. Dr. Brown again observed that arace of smaller, shorter beings arrived, and they were on a mission. Highlymotivated, they worked with speed and urgency. Dr. Brown said the short beings“are here as the first stage of a larger project. I get the sense that they arepackaging everything.”24 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber111] He observed thatthese beings were Grays, with short bodies and milky white skin. Before thesurvivors of Mars left their planet, they saw these beings as godlike entities.Dr. Brown then went on to say, “Somehow the Martians are getting packed up inpreparation for some change. . . . It feels like the short beings are planningon the Martians getting a physical change in their bodies, and they’re being putin cold storage for a while. These little short folks look like Grays.”25[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber112]As the session went on, Dr. Brown got even more specific details:> The rescuers were the beings that we now know as Grays. They arrived at the> last moments of the collapse of the Martian civilization. With great speed,> they somehow “stored” the Martians. Apparently this was necessary to preserve> what could be saved of Martian life. I cannot provide a technical explanation,> but the essential focus of the rescue was the preservation of Martian genetic> material. All of this happened millions of years ago.26> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber113]This data would later prove to correlate almost perfectly with what I gatheredfrom the Law of One series as well as from insiders like Corey Goode. The onlydifference is that the apparent time of this catastrophe was 500,000 years ago,whereas Dr. Brown had initially felt it was millions of years ago. This type ofvariance in time accuracy is perfectly understandable if it wasn’t the mainfocus of Dr. Brown’s remote-viewing target. In addition, in the Law of Oneseries, the source reported having problems with our system of time measurementas a general rule.While speaking in summary about this fascinating planet-to-planet transferwithin our own solar system, Dr. Brown said, “Virtually all remote-viewing datashow that the Martians seem to have been genetically altered to enable them tolive in the heavier gravity and different conditions on Earth. The actualalteration occurred recently, following a period of preservation, and is not yetcomplete.”27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber114]This became one of the most astonishing correlations for me when I began readingthe Law of One. In Session 9, Question 6, Ra said:> The first of those to come here [to Earth] were brought from another planet in> your solar system called by you the Red Planet, Mars. This planet’s> environment became inhospitable to third-density beings. The first entities,> therefore, were of this race, as you may call it, manipulated somewhat by> those who were guardians at that time.28 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber115]The answer continued after Question 7:> These entities arrived, or were preserved, for the experience upon your sphere> by a type of birthing which is non-reproductive, but consists of preparing> genetic material for the incarnation of the mind/body/spirit complexes of> those entities from the Red Planet.29 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber116]The source went on to confirm that this planet-to-planet transfer happened afterthe race had died from the physical world as we know it on Mars.The correlation between Dr. Brown’s results and the Law of One were absolutelyastonishing to me. Dr. Brown repeatedly used the word packaged to describe howthis process took place. Ra said the people of Mars were “manipulated somewhat,”where they were “preserved . . . by a type of birthing which isnon-reproductive, but consists of preparing genetic material for . . .incarnation.” This therefore gives us much greater insight into the phenomenonof abduction and the sampling of genetic material. We are seeing how an entireplanet worth of beings can be preserved and re-introduced on a new planet if theworld they are living on is damaged in some way. This is not the same as simplycloning human beings, because in this case, genetic modifications can also bemade in order to adapt people to different atmosphere, gravitational strength,height, sunlight intensity, et cetera. Any one person can be cloned from a DNAsample, such as from the scoop marks that so many abductees had visible signsof, where a small circular area of their skin was removed. The more benevolentaspects of the typical abduction phenomenon we read about in books, such asAbduction by Dr. John Mack, could simply be an example of this “packaging”taking place on Earth. Therefore, if something were to happen to our own planet,our civilization and genetic diversity would not perish.In chapter 16 of Cosmic Voyage, Dr. Brown remote-viewed the collapse of theearly Gray civilization he was studying. He once again noticed that they werebeing genetically packaged before a coming collapse.30[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber117] Their civilization was seduced on a collectivelevel by “an arrogant, rebellious, and very powerful leader. They later feltbetrayed, but the damage was too far gone. They had to recover from scratch.”31[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber118] This arrogant leader had a spiritualconnection to a being that Dr. Brown identified as Lucifer. He tuned in toLucifer as a very insecure, fearful being, afraid of its own inevitable deathand the punishment that it knew would then result. Dr. Brown’s results indicatedthat the Grays may have voluntarily eliminated their sexuality and emotions toavoid the damage that had been caused by the influence of this nonphysicalbeing.TUNING IN TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF JESUS AND GODIn chapter 18, Dr. Brown used a method called Solo Type 1 to tune in to theconsciousness of Jesus without the use of his guide. In this session, the beingidentifying as Jesus thanked him for showing up on his own. The being said thatthe Grays are God’s children, and no less valuable than those we call human. Thegreater evolutionary goal for Earth humans working with them involves mergingwith the Creator in some way.32 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber119] In anothersession from July 14, 1994, Dr. Brown tuned in to this group of Grays in the farfuture. By this point, they had become more human-looking and had learned tolove once again. They all now had a type of spiritual energy similar to what hehad seen in other positive beings. Dr. Brown said the being he felt was Jesushad a sense of command or authority, whereas these beings just radiated lovewithout the other component.33 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber120]After this, Dr. Brown began to contemplate God. The results echoed veryprecisely what I was about to start reading in the Law of One series. He saw howall the universe was created from a single awareness: “from [God’s] ownsubstance.” Later, he said, “One can love oneself, and all others, because onesees that all of everything is created from the same fabric. Somehow, love isthe theme of God, the glue that keeps the universe together.”34[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber121] This is precisely what we see in the Law ofOne series, where the terms Logos and love are seen as interchangeable.Closer to the end of the book, Dr. Brown conducted a session on God once again.I found the following quote to be particularly beautiful:> God spent an eternity as a point source. His evolution reached a point of> change in which he could not bear the loneliness of isolation. His only> recourse was to re-create himself throughout an infinitude, thereby initiating> a sequence of creating new gods, new hims, beings to care for him, and for him> to care for. He loves us because we ended a loneliness that was beyond any> ability to describe in words. He will never allow the demise of his creations,> since it would send him back to the point-source past, and that was his> prison. The future is forever to expand.35 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber122]Dr. Brown saw that there was great joy in God’s new creation. He also saw thatour emotions are not as difficult as we may think. Instead, they provide us witha very effective connection back to our truest identity as God. Additionally, herealized that we all have a deep subconscious fear of the isolation andloneliness that we once felt as God. Fundamentally, we are interconnected withthis source, and have never really left. When we become deeply inspired, we arefilled with the joy and bliss and wonderment that this core identity always has.We can spend our entire lives wandering through materialism and attachmentdisorders without ever realizing that the true source of this love and power iswithin ourselves.NO WAY FOR ME TO REPLICATE DR. BROWN’S RESEARCHAccording to Dr. Brown, the only way that one could continue in this type ofwork and become a representative for the Galactic Federation was to engage andcomplete a study of remote viewing—in exactly the same way he had done. Andunfortunately, in order to carry out this study in the way Dr. Brown required,it would necessitate an investment of at least eight to ten thousand dollars.There was a three-step process that he said was vital to developing thisability, which was a description of how he himself had gotten there. Step onewas to take Transcendental Meditation all the way through to the most advancedlevel, called the “Siddhi” stage. Step two was to go to the Monroe Institute inFaber, Virginia, and take the Farsight Voyager course. Step three was to then goto Brown’s own university in Atlanta, Georgia, and pay five thousand dollars fora one-week course in remote viewing.According to Brown, no method of spiritual information gathering was valid otherthan remote viewing. I almost believed Dr. Brown and other remote viewers whenthey said remote viewing was the only game in town. However, I was all toofamiliar with the legacy of Edgar Cayce, since his work appeared in many books Ihad found on Atlantis, Egypt, ancient civilizations, extraterrestrials, andUFOs. Many authors saw the Cayce Readings as their most valuable asset whentrying to understand how these mysterious, lost secrets all fit together. Thoughthe verbiage of the Cayce Readings was often almost exasperating, with run-onsentences that would extend through entire paragraphs, it was truly amazingmaterial. There is simply no way that the “Sleeping Prophet” could haveaccurately diagnosed the medical problems of fourteen thousand people, indocumented “psychic readings,” having only their name and address as a resource,unless he had a genuine ability to access higher consciousness.Cayce’s process was obviously very similar to remote viewing. Instead of using apair of random numbers as “coordinates,” Cayce’s sleeping mind used the name andaddress of a person, and nothing else. I realized that it is all too common forhighly intelligent people to form cliques, thinking their group has all theanswers, and everyone else is too unsophisticated to understand or appreciatewhat they are doing. They build up a world of jargon and gradually becomeelitist, to the point where any outsiders who attempt to enter that world mightbe unfairly judged. You can see this in fine art, ballet, theater, classicalmusic, jazz music, classic rock, professional sports, yoga, tai chi, martialarts, the financial sector, corporate management, government, the military, and,yes, even the shadowy world of the Illuminati or Cabal. This is essentiallyhuman nature. My guides have always encouraged me to be more inclusive andappreciative of others, even if I did not agree with them. So although theremote viewers felt that no one else had ever accessed psychic consciousnessproperly, it was easy to see that the Cayce Readings proved them wrong.As I noted previously, I would soon find out that the explanation in the Law ofOne series for the demise of the Martian civilization, their genetic “storage,”and subsequent transfer to Earth was virtually identical to Dr. Brown’sscenario. The people of Mars went through a comprehensive genetic storage and“packaging” that led to their being transplanted to Earth with bodies that weremodified to handle our biosphere. This was one of the greatest shocks I wentthrough in my initial reading of the Law of One.Furthermore, the Law of One gives additional information that Dr. Brown did notobtain in his remote-viewing sessions, by revealing that the same“planet-hopping” transfer process happened with a world known as Maldek, whichexploded through an act of war and became the Asteroid Belt. The formerinhabitants of Maldek had greater karma to work off than the people of Mars, andthus they incarnated here as Bigfoot-type creatures. These bodies had“self-imposed limitations of form,” as it said in Session 59, Question 4, whichallowed them to work off the karma of having destroyed their planet.36[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber123] This again may cause some people to laugh indisbelief, and that is fine. Many people have had encounters with Bigfoot-typecreatures, and if our governments were consistently telling the truth, one ofmany significant questions the public would want answers to would be to explorewhat these beings are and where they originated from.Earlier, in Session 10, Question 1, we read, “The group decision [for the peopleof Maldek] was to place upon itself a type of what you may call karmaalleviation. For this purpose they came into incarnation within your planetarysphere, in what were not acceptable human forms.” Then in Session 10, Question3, a more technical-sounding description of this karmic choice was given, whenit said, “The [karmic] alleviation mechanism [for the people of Maldek] wasdesigned by the placement of this consciousness in second-dimensional physicalchemical complexes which are not able to be dexterous or manipulative to theextent which is appropriate to the workings of the third-density distortions ofthe mind complex.”37 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber124] Put more simply, theBigfoot body is more apelike than humanlike, and it therefore does not allowthem to work with tools and develop advanced technology.In Session 59, Question 5, it was revealed that fully two billion souls have nowtransferred to Earth from Maldek through this process.38[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber125] If it seems hard to believe that we could havesuch a large Bigfoot population, we must remember that multiple insiders haveindependently disclosed the “honeycomb earth” model, where there are vastnumbers of habitable passages inside the Earth. There are various cave entrancesthat allow direct access to these inner worlds, which the Bigfoot creaturesapparently know very well. By reading Session 9, Question 18, we get moreinformation on this, where it says that “these [Maldek] entities are workingtheir understanding complexes through a series of what you would call karmicrestitutions. They dwell within your deeper underground passageways, and areknown to you as ‘Bigfoot.’”39 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber126]This idea of the descendants of Maldek incarnating within the Earth was alsoindicated in Session 6, Questions 10 and 13, where it read, “These entities,destroying their planetary sphere, thus were forced to find room for themselvesupon this third density, which is the only one in your solar system at theirtime/space present which was hospitable and capable of offering the lessonsnecessary to decrease their mind/body/spirit distortions with respect to the Lawof One. . . . The ones who were harvested to your sphere from the sphere knownbefore its dissolution as other names, but to your peoples as Maldek,incarnated, many within your Earth’s surface rather than upon it.”40[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber127] Apparently many of these people laterreincarnated as normal humans on the surface, after a sufficient degree of theirkarmic alleviation had been paid out. Reincarnation is discussed in the nextchapter.Dr. Brown’s material regarding the Galactic Federation was also in many waysliterally identical to what I soon found in the Law of One. This type ofconnection was far too specific to be a product of chance. It seemed obviousthat Dr. Brown wasn’t lying, and he certainly had not read the Law of One seriesgoing in, as it was quite obscure and practically unknown in the UFO field. Hehad a picture-perfect description of the Mars genetic transfer, but had neverdone a session on the idea of the Asteroid Belt also having been an inhabitedworld that underwent a similar incarnative process. In fact, when I emailed himwhile writing this book, he was still unaware that the Law of One had conveyedsimilar information. Dr. Brown admittedly had no previous interest in UFOlogy,and could hardly even have imagined the data that was being generated. Each newsession was a shocking new discovery to both himself and his guide.How could Dr. Brown have been repeatedly starting with absolutely nothing but aset of coordinates and ending up with findings identical to those in the Law ofOne series? Once I dug into the Law of One, there were just so many connectionspopping out between the two that the most logical conclusion was that both ofthem were accurately describing a greater body of authentic information. The Lawof One, however, went leaps and bounds further in its informational content thanDr. Brown’s findings had done in Cosmic Voyage. The connections between Dr.Brown’s work and the Law of One were actually just a few small points comparedto the vastly greater worldview that the series as a whole was communicating."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE LAW OF ONE PUTS ALL THE PIECES TOGETHERDr. Scott Mandelker’s book From Elsewhere triggered a series of experiences thatconvinced me that I was indeed a Wanderer, or extraterrestrial soul. The mostpowerful of these experiences was my housemate Eric’s dream on January 19, 1996,where a being that looked like Jesus threw his arm around my shoulders and said,“It is very important that you know that he is one of us.” Just as inremote-viewing research, Eric’s dream was “blind,” in that he had no consciousway of knowing that I had prayed for an answer to this very question just hoursbefore he came home. That same night after Eric’s dream came in, I began readingCosmic Voyage by Dr. Courtney Brown. I ordered the remaining books of the Law ofOne series, and they arrived at my local bookstore soon afterward. Dr.Mandelker’s endorsement of the Law of One series was quite a powerful statementfor me at the time, considering his background.AN EXPERT ON BUDDHISM SAYS THE LAW OF ONE IS THE BESTDr. Mandelker had earned a PhD in East-West psychology and was an expert scholarin Buddhism who had actually traveled to various temples in Southeast Asia tomeditate for weeks on end in silence. He painted a dramatic picture of trying tofind God through meditation while gigantic “tree roaches” slammed themselvesagainst the screens of the hut where he was staying. Dr. Mandelker said that theLaw of One series had all the very highest and deepest secret wisdom of thegreat masters in one book. He claimed that the knowledge within the Law of Oneseries had superseded the entire weight of his Naropa Institute PhD educationand all his private studies before then. Never before had he read a singlesource so rich with wisdom, spirituality, and insight. The Law of One had becomehis Source Text, as he had never before found a single written work that offeredsuch profound new insights each and every time he opened it. The source of theLaw of One explained that it was the highest-level extraterrestrialconsciousness to ever directly deal with human beings like us. At sixth density,Ra was fully two quantum leaps in evolution ahead of the typical fourth-densityextraterrestrials we would see flying in craft in our skies. Ra was operating atthe same level as the Higher Self that was apparently orchestrating the dreamsand synchronicities that I and others like me were having. If there was any onerecommendation that Dr. Mandelker gave in From Elsewhere, it was a very simpleone: Read the Law of One.Now I was ready to accept the challenge. I had to. All roads were leading me tothe Law of One. Dr. Mandelker was the expert, and he had just revealed that if Ihad achieved my dream and actually gone to Naropa and gotten a PhD, I would haveconcluded that the Law of One was the most advanced postgraduate spiritual workI could possibly be studying. And there was no Law of One university. It was allindependent study. I would soon find out that the Law of One strongly endorsedthe value of reading inspirational books and meditating on their contents, as Ihad been doing heavily in the preceding years. This is seen in Session 49,Question 8: “Contemplation or the consideration in a meditative state of aninspiring image or text is extremely useful also among your peoples.”1[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber128] The practice of remembering and analyzingone’s dreams was also said to be of the highest spiritual value.In Session 85, Question 19, it read, “The so-called dreaming contains a greatdeal which, if made available to the conscious mind and used, shall aid it in[positive] polarization to a great extent.”2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber129]In Session 86, Question 7, it read, “In all cases it is useful to amind/body/spirit complex [person] to ponder the content and emotive resonance ofdreams.”3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber130] Also interesting is Session 95,Question 18, where it read, “There is what might be called a partial vocabularyof the dreams, due to the common heritage of all mind/body/spirit complexes. Dueto each entity’s unique incarnational experiences, there is an overlay whichgrows to be a larger and larger proportion of the dream vocabulary as the entitygains experience.”4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber131] This was exactly what Ihad experienced. Certain symbols were unique to me, such as the idea of drums,which I had studied academically in a college jazz program, representing mygreater spiritual work. I also would see people I knew at various times in mylife and be able to analyze the dream based on who they were and what I hadexperienced with them at the time we were in contact.I had grabbed my copy of The Law of One: Book Three at Borders the same night Ibought Cosmic Voyage, but for some reason the bookstore did not carry any of theother three volumes. I had already looked through Book Three on the shelvesbefore, and had admittedly put it back. The language was incredibly dense,almost impenetrable. Ra was using all sorts of elaborate and mysterious jargon,just as we see in many different intelligent subcultures throughout our society.One obviously needed to have read the first book to be able to understand thethird. The writing was very much like “scientific poetry,” written from such alevel of “higher intelligence” that it might actually be beyond our own humanintellectual capacity to understand it. The questioner, Dr. Don Elkins, oftenstruggled to understand and respond to what he was being told. He almost alwaysmade mistakes in his questions that then had to be corrected.I quickly decided that I was better off waiting until the other three volumeshad arrived in the mail, and Cosmic Voyage was more than enough to keep mesatisfied while I waited. This Law of One study was nothing to take lightly, andstarting on Book Three was definitely not the right idea. Somewhere just beforethe end of January 1996, while struggling to make a living at two cents aboveminimum wage in a highly stressful job, I opened my new copy of Book One of TheLaw of One and began reading. My life would never be the same.A SOCRATIC DIALOGUEThankfully, Book One did open with an extensive overview of the UFO researchthat the group had been conducting for over twenty years before their contactbegan. I found that the source did not want to just deliver information—it wasimportant that the group ask questions that would then be responded to. This wassimilar but not identical in style to how the wise old philosopher Socratesworked, in what scholars call a Socratic dialogue.As it says on the Filosophia Prática website:> Socratic dialogue is a formal method by which a small group (5–15 people),> guided by a facilitator, finds a precise answer to a universal question (e.g.,> “What is happiness?”, “What is integrity?”, “Can conflict be fruitful?”,> etc.). . . . The method of the Socratic dialogue is as rewarding as its goal.> It involves group decision-making by consensus, which is distinctly unlike> most other modalities of group function. To begin with, since the Socratic> dialogue is neither a debate nor any other kind of competition, there are no> winners and losers. . . . You need not be a philosopher, nor have> philosophical qualifications, to participate in a Socratic dialogue. An> appealing presupposition of the dialogue is that universal truths are grounded> in our particular experiences. The purpose of the dialogue is to reach the> universal from the particular. . . . Reference to published works is not> admissible in a Socratic dialogue; reference to concrete personal experience> is what counts and suffices for the purpose.5> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber132]This, again, relates to the idea that “Ageless Wisdom” is ultimately availableto each of us in a state of contemplative meditation.The main person asking all the questions, Dr. Don Elkins, happened to have a PhDin physics and brought all that advanced knowledge into hisquestions—particularly in Book Two. This added a strong professional element tothe dialogue that would never have happened without someone so highly trained inthe sciences. Dr. Elkins worked as a commercial airline pilot to make as much“money per unit of time” as possible to help support the group, which includedCarla Rueckert, a well-read librarian and devout Christian who spoke the wordsin an unconscious trance state. Her extensive vocabulary allowed the source touse advanced words that were unfamiliar to most people, including myself, so Ialso needed to have a dictionary handy as I read The Law of One. Also part ofthe group was Jim McCarty, the highly athletic “scribe” who typed it all up fromthe original cassette tapes. Eventually, after living with Carla and Jim for twoyears, I realized that Jim had anchored in the body, Don the mind, and Carla theloving spirit. Thus, with the three of them combined, they were able to secure ahigh-level contact. Don and Carla had been researching and experimenting withchanneling for over twenty years before the Law of One contact began, and feltthat if it was done properly, it was the best way to gain a deeper understandingof the truth behind the UFO phenomenon.THE LAW OF ONE PHILOSOPHYIt’s hard even to know where to begin in describing what it was like to read TheLaw of One for the first time. It was described as a work of philosophy, and Iwas already familiar with the history and various branches of philosophy from afew of my college classes. The terms philosophy or philosophical appear in atotal of forty-nine different passages throughout the material.6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber133] In Session 1, Question 10, we read:> We are not available to many of your peoples, for this is not an easily> understood way of communication or type of philosophy. However, our very being> is hopefully a poignant example of both the necessity and the> near-hopelessness of attempting to teach. . . . The few whom you will> illuminate by sharing your light are far more than enough reason for the> greatest possible effort. To serve one is to serve all. Therefore, we offer> the question back to you to state that indeed it is the only activity worth> doing: to learn/teach or teach/learn.7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber134]As we see in the above passage, Ra felt they had a “necessity” to teach throughthis channeling method, which is “not an easily understood way ofcommunication.” They also considered it to be an act of “near-hopelessness,”since very few people would ever find out about this incredible materialcompared to the total number of Earth’s population. Yet, due to the power of theLaw of One, “to serve one is to serve all.”This principle of Oneness was explained earlier in the same answer with a mostfascinating statement:> You must understand that the distinction between yourself and others is not> visible to us. We do not consider that a separation exists between the> consciousness-raising efforts of the distortion which you project as a> personality and the distortion which you project as an other personality.> Thus, to learn is the same as to teach unless you are not teaching what you> are learning; in which case you have done you/they little or no good.8> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber135]It was quite mind-expanding for me to consider the idea of an extraterrestrialgroup that cannot see us as separate beings. At their level, it is literallyimpossible for them to perceive us as individuals. Years later, I would discoverthe Meditation Effect, where we see that a group of seven thousand peoplemeditating on Pure Consciousness were able to reduce crime, war, terrorism,accidents, and fatalities worldwide by an astonishing 72 percent, while healthand quality of life notably increased.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber136] Allother variables such as cycles, trends, weather, weekends, and holidays had beenruled out. By 1993, this effect had been proven in fifty different scientificstudies over the preceding thirty years.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber137]This became a major point that I returned to throughout my book The Source FieldInvestigations, and it also formed the Inciting Incident that led Dr. CourtneyBrown into his own sacred quest for Truth, as we have seen.Another example of scientific data that helps to prove this unique claim in TheLaw of One is known as the Multiples Effect. By the year 1922, William Ogburnand Dorothy Thomas had compiled a list of fully 148 major scientific discoveriesthat appeared in at least two different people’s minds simultaneously. In somecases, multiple individuals got the same ideas at the exact same times, withouthaving any idea that someone else was working on the same concept. This includedthe mathematics of calculus, the theory of evolution, decimal fractions, theoxygen molecule, color photography, and logarithms. Four scientistsindependently discovered sunspots in 1611. The law of conservation of energy wassimultaneously formulated by four different scientists in 1847. At least sixpeople independently invented the thermometer. Nine scientists simultaneouslydeveloped the telescope, without knowing anything about each other or what theywere working on. Several people in England and America developed the typewriterat the same time. Five scientists “exclusively” discovered the steamboat at thesame time: Fulton, Jouffroy, Rumsey, Stevens, and Symmington.11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber138]In Law of One terms, these mass effects happen because we all ultimately shareone mind. We have the illusion that our thoughts are our own, when in fact manyof them are emerging from a greater collective consciousness—just as Carl Junghad postulated. As we think about and meditate on certain problems we are tryingto solve, we are actually accessing a greater collective mind that we all sharehere on Earth. The information will start appearing to us in dreams andspontaneous intuitive flashes. For this same reason, if I ever think of an ideafor a great dot-com website address, I immediately go and register the nameright then.The value of reaching just a few people was further explained in one of my mostfavorite passages, from Session 17, Question 2:> It is impossible to help another being directly. It is only possible to make> catalyst available in whatever form, the most important being the radiation of> realization of oneness with the Creator from the self, less important being> information such as we share with you. We, ourselves, do not feel an urgency> for this information to be widely disseminated. It is enough that we have made> it available to three, four, or five. This is extremely ample reward, for if> one of these obtains fourth-density understanding due to this catalyst, then> we shall have fulfilled the Law of One in the distortion of service.> > We encourage a dispassionate attempt to share information without concern for> numbers or quick growth among others. That you attempt to make this> information available is, in your term, your service. The attempt, if it> reaches one, reaches all. We cannot offer shortcuts to enlightenment.> Enlightenment is of the moment—[it] is an opening to intelligent infinity. It> can only be accomplished by the self, for the self. Another self cannot> teach/learn enlightenment, but only teach/learn information, inspiration, or a> sharing of love, of mystery, of the unknown that makes the other-self reach> out and begin the seeking process that ends in a moment—but who can know when> an entity will open the gate to the present?12> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber139]This idea of fully opening “the gateway to the present” is another example of adirect linkage between The Law of One and Buddhism.The source wasn’t that interested in talking about themselves, as we see inSession 2, Question 2:> We are aware that you find our incarnate, as you call it, state of interest.> We waited for a second query so as to emphasize that the time/space of several> thousand of your years creates a spurious type of interest. Thus in giving> this information, we ask the proper lack of stress be placed upon our> experiences in your local space/time. The teach/learning which is our> responsibility is philosophical rather than historical.13> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber140]This was a follow-up to a statement made in Session 1, Question 1: “We are not apart of time and, thus, are able to be with you in any of your times.”14[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber141] This time-travel capability of beings in thehigher realms had already been proven to me in a number of prophetic dreams. Dr.Courtney Brown’s own research strongly supported this concept as well. When myown contact started eleven months later, I soon had dozens of fantastic examplesof prophecy taking place. I couldn’t understand how this was happening, but itquickly became very obvious that prophecy was no joke.The source often reiterated that their main interest was in communicatingphilosophical teachings. Ra was so concerned about free will that questions werean absolute necessity, as we see in Session 2, Question 6: “It is not ourunderstanding that we have the right/duty to share our perceptions on anysubject but philosophy without direct question.”15[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber142]ONENESS AND REINCARNATIONEven though it was very difficult to get started in this material, I realizedthat its philosophy was consistent and logical. Ultimately, like a Socraticdialogue, the truths in the work would become self-evident from one’s ownpersonal experience and study. The source was continually explaining the samephilosophical concepts in different words, since the underlying message wasextremely simple. The real difficulty was in simply hearing it on a deep enoughlevel that you began actually applying it to your everyday life. The mostimportant, overarching principle in the work was that we are all One. Weultimately all share the same awareness, and awareness is what created theuniverse—just as many different philosophers have theorized. Once we understandthat basic principle, we then realize that if we harm others, we are onlyharming ourselves. Therefore, the core teaching is for us to learn to be moreloving with ourselves and others.The great choice we face in third-density life, as they call it, is between loveand control. One example of this teaching is in Session 46, Question 16: “Thisexperience in your density may be loved and accepted, or it may be controlled.These are the two paths. When neither path is chosen, the catalyst fails in itsdesign, and the entity proceeds until catalyst strikes it, which causes it toform a bias toward acceptance and love, or separation and control.”16[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber143] The term catalyst simply refers to somethingwe use for our own growth.In Session 46, Questions 9-12, it reads, “Control is the key to negativelypolarized use of catalyst. Acceptance is the key to positively polarized use ofcatalyst. . . . The first acceptance, or control depending upon polarity, is ofthe self. Anger is one of many things to be accepted and loved as a part ofself, or controlled as a part of self. . . . The negative polarization containsa great requirement for control and repression. . . . Thus you may find, forinstance, negatively polarized entities controlling and repressing such basicbodily complex needs as the sexual desire in order that in the practice thereof,the will may be used to enforce itself upon the other-self with greaterefficiency when the sexual behavior is allowed.”17[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber144]I certainly have had many experiences with people who are very controlling,while still believing they are on a positive spiritual path. This is a classicexample of “confusion,” in Law of One terms. The most important principle in theLaw of One after the idea of Oneness itself is free will. By manipulating andcontrolling others, and violating their free will, you may gain money and power,but in the process you are creating debilitating karma that could make it nearlyimpossible for you to be ready for Ascension at the end of this particular cycleon Earth.Another key point in the material is that we are multi-incarnational beings. Wedo not live just one lifetime and then dissolve into an eternal nothingness, asmany people may secretly fear. The suffering we cause through manipulating,dominating, and controlling others can necessitate lifetimes of reincarnation toproperly balance out. I had already noticed that the Cayce Readings haddiscussed reincarnation in extensive detail, based on other books I had read.Reincarnation is also a key element of most major world religions, and there isextensive evidence that reincarnation was originally a teaching of Jesus, as Idiscuss in my book The Synchronicity Key.Here is one key excerpt from The Synchronicity Key that helps to make the pointabout reincarnation. In this case, I use the spelling of the name Jesus that theLaw of One series recommends as being the most accurate—Jehoshua:> Further historic evidence [for the Christian teaching of reincarnation] comes> from Origen (AD 185–254), who is considered the first great father of the> Christian church after Paul. Origen had extensive instruction from Clement of> Alexandria. Clement, in turn, had studied directly with Peter, one of the> original twelve apostles who traveled with Jehoshua. Origen inherited the> direct, oral tradition of the teachings of Jehoshua and built a spiritual> theology out of this knowledge. Reincarnation was a crucial aspect of Origen’s> theology. Both Origen and his teacher, Clement of Alexandria, wrote about> receiving secret teachings from Jehoshua that were passed to them through the> apostles. They ardently insisted that reincarnation and preexistence were one> of Jehoshua’s most important secret teachings. This quote from Origen> summarizes his perspective nicely: “The soul has neither beginning nor> end. . . . [Souls] come into this world strengthened by the victories or> weakened by the defeats of their previous lives.”18> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber145]It is interesting and tragic to contemplate how teachings like this wereintended to reach us, only to be lost in the sands of time. Reincarnation isdiscussed repeatedly in the Law of One, and Session 26, Question 36, is a goodstarting point: “Why then be concerned with the grass that blooms, withers anddies in its season, only to grow once again due to the infinite love and lightof the One Creator? This is the message we bring. Each entity is onlysuperficially that which blooms and dies. In the deeper sense there is no end tobeingness.”19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber146]THE 25,000-YEAR CYCLEAt times, the material became deeply scientific in nature, and made manyassertions that could be proven either right or wrong. There was no gray area.This was quite different from the Nostradamus prophecies from the 1500s, derivedfrom a collection of 942 poetic quatrains that were often so vaguely worded thatthey could be interpreted to mean many different things. I had read a variety ofNostradamus books that analyzed his legendary writings from his book LesProphéties, and on many occasions the authors seemed to try to force-fit hiswords into the “accurate prophecies” they wanted to see.One of the things The Law of One talked about was the same “25,000-year cycle” Ihad recently read about in Fingerprints of Gods, which revealed that the mysteryof this cycle was encoded into thirty-five ancient traditions around the world.The Law of One mentions the 25,000-year cycle in seventy-six passages throughoutthe series.20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber147] The term major cycle means thesame thing as “25,000-year cycle” in the Law of One series, and the term majorcycle appears in an additional twenty-two passages, for a total of ninety-eightreferences.21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber148] Dr. Don Elkins had no idea thatthis 25,000-year cycle was called The Precession of the Equinoxes, and The Lawof One never mentioned that it had anything to do with an alleged wobble in theEarth’s axis. That only convinced me even more of the authenticity of The Law ofOne. If either Don or Carla was aware of this connection, it very likely wouldhave emerged in the words themselves.The Law of One said that our Earth goes through an amazing transformation at theend of each 25,000-year cycle, in which its human inhabitants have theopportunity to Ascend into the fourth density. They chose the unique andmysterious word harvest to describe this mass Ascension process. This term isagain derived from the Bible, and most specifically from the book of Matthew,chapter 13, regarding “the Parable of the Weeds.” Most significant is thedescription in Matthew 13:36–43. Negatively oriented people are presented asbeing akin to weeds in a garden, and the weeds are plucked out one by one at thetime of harvest. The exact use of the term harvest can be seen in Matthew 13:39,where it says, “The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are theangels.” The light-body activation prophecy appears in Matthew 13:43, where itsays, “Then [after the harvest] shall the righteous shine forth as the sun inthe kingdom of their father.”22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber149]Before the planet-hopping of Mars and Maldek that we discussed in the lastchapter is one aspect of the harvest process. Life in this new fourth-densityEarth was revealed to be at least one hundred times more harmonious than thethird. This next passage from Session 20, Question 24 is admittedly dense, andincludes jargon that is unique to the Law of One material, but as we go on, thewords will make more sense:> The mind/body/spirit complex of third density [i.e., a human being such as we> now see on Earth] has perhaps one hundred times as intensive a program of> catalytic action from which to distill distortions and learn/teachings than> any other of the densities. Thus the learn/teachings are most confusing to the> mind/body/spirit complex which is, shall we say, inundated by the ocean of> experience.23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber150]The phrase catalytic action is a slightly different wording of one of theirfavorite terms, catalyst. The word catalyst refers to any experiences that causeus to grow spiritually—and many but not all of these experiences are difficult.The word catalyst is similar to how we use the word karma, and it appears in astunning 189 passages throughout the Law of One series.24[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber151] So, in short, this quote was a verytechnical-sounding prophecy informing us that once we made it into fourthdensity, the level of happiness, bliss, peace, and harmony was so high that wecould barely even imagine what that would feel like in today’s world. Life onEarth is a hundred times worse, a hundred times more depressing and sad,irritating and frustrating, shocking and upsetting, than your everyday lifeafter Ascension.How do you visualize a life where you are consistently one hundred times happierthan you could ever be now? Karma, or “catalyst,” is so intense in our ownthird-density world that it is easy for us to be “inundated by the ocean ofexperience” and not realize that the negative things that happen to us in ourlives—the “learn/teachings” we experience—are the direct result of our ownthoughts and actions. I already had experienced dozens of Ascension dreams bythis point, where some gigantic event happened on Earth that transformed me intoa light-body form—as well as many others. The idea of this next level ofexistence being a hundred times more harmonious was very appealing to me, andstill is. Both The Source Field Investigations and The Synchronicity Key go intofar more detail about the 25,000-year cycle than in this volume, and it is atruly vast subject to study.SACRED GEOMETRY AND THE GLOBAL GRIDAs I dove into this material, I was very excited to learn more about theHyperdimensional Model from a direct extraterrestrial source, which addedgreatly to the secret message of the crop circles telling us to study sacredgeometry. The Schoolhouse had a series of apartments in one larger building, andone of our housemates was a computer genius named Jack. He taught me how to useEric’s intimidating desktop computer—and how to log on to the Internet throughour dial-up telephone modem. By the time I started reading The Law of One, I hadalready spent about a month and a half looking around online. There reallywasn’t very much of this kind of paranormal material online at the time, but Idid find nuggets of gold. As I said, Art Bell had a highly popular radio show,Coast to Coast AM, with a variety of UFO researchers appearing regularly.Richard C. Hoagland was his top guest, and there were many new articles toexplore on Hoagland’s website, enterprisemission.com. Hoagland had a forum onhis website that was very popular, and seemed to be the front line of the battlefor disclosure at the time.I already felt I had made serious breakthroughs in the Hyperdimensional Model.Although the crop circles were obviously promoting sacred geometry, I believed Ihad made some genuinely original discoveries. I had taken the planetary energyfields well beyond the tetrahedral vortexes appearing at the 19.5-degreelatitude in Hoagland’s initial model. I had now “discovered” the icosa-dodecaGlobal Grid, upon which all 3,300 of the world’s great stone monuments werelocated. I wasn’t sure if anyone besides the Russians were even aware of this. Icertainly didn’t think the Russians had ever linked it back to Hoagland and TomBearden’s Hyperdimensional Model, since the Russians had published way back in1972, long before Hoagland’s work had appeared. I felt as if I had stumbled overa truly lost science from ancient times.I was absolutely astonished when I got up to Session 14, Question 7, and readthe following response when the questioner simply asked what they meant by theterm balancing pyramid. Here was the answer:> Imagine, if you will, the many force fields of the Earth in their> geometrically precise web. Energies stream into the Earth planes, as you would> call them, from magnetically determined points. Due to growing thought-form> distortions in understanding of the Law of One, the planet itself was seen to> have the potential for imbalance. The balancing pyramidal structures were> charged with crystals which drew the appropriate balance from the energy> forces streaming into the various geometrical centers of electromagnetic> energy, which surround—and shape—the planetary sphere.25> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber152]This was a picture-perfect description of the Global Grid. I thought that hardlyanyone besides Ivan T. Sanderson, the obscure Russian group from the early1970s, and the team of William Becker and Bethe Hagens even knew about the Grid.I felt that I had made an original discovery about how the lines on theBecker-Hagens Grid were shaping the continents, since they themselves had notwritten about it in the book. Now I had the Law of One series describing how the“force fields of the earth in their geometrically precise web . . . surround andshape the planetary sphere.” I was absolutely astonished to see this in The Lawof One, and couldn’t believe that I was apparently the first person to see howthese statements correlated with real-world scientific research. It was alsomade clear that the pyramids were built on the global grid to stabilize theEarth on its axis after the last major catastrophe that destroyed the highlyadvanced civilization of Atlantis.DELIBERATELY PLANTED SYNCHRONICITYThe source made it clear to L/L Research that many seemingly random connectionsthat were happening in their lives were actually being directly orchestratedfrom higher realms. This came early along, in Session 8, Question 1: “Consider,if you will, the path your life-experience complex has taken. Consider thecoincidences and odd circumstances by which one thing flowed to the next.Consider this well. Each entity will receive the opportunity that each needs.”26[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber153] I couldn’t help but notice that this quoteapplied perfectly to what was happening to me. My three-year, three-hundred-bookpath of study was now paying off on almost every page I read. This includedreading Dr. Brown’s book immediately before beginning my study of the Law ofOne.This quote about “coincidences and odd circumstances” also seemed to bereferring back to a great synchronicity story for Dr. Don Elkins and CarlaRueckert, the two original members of the group that channeled The Law of One.This story appeared in the introduction to Book One, as follows:> Don and I, who had officially gone into partnership as L/L Research in 1970,> had written an unpublished book titled The Crucifixion of Esmeralda Sweetwater> in 1968. In 1974, Andrija Puharich published a book with Doubleday titled URI.> The book is the narrative of Dr. Puharich’s investigation of Uri Geller and> their unexpected communication with extraterrestrial intelligences. The form> of contact was quite novel in that first some object like an ashtray would> levitate, signaling Dr. Puharich to load his cassette tape recorder. The> recorder’s buttons would then be depressed by some invisible force and the> machine would record. On playback, a message from an extraterrestrial source> would be present.27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber154]Right there, I was absolutely stunned. Not even a month before, on New Year’sDay 1996, I had the dream I shared previously, where my musician friend Vinniehad transitioned into the afterlife. He was trying to convey a message to hisfriend Ron by having me press RECORD on a cassette player and speak onto thetape. Some background noises were heard, but I could not make out what they weresaying. Now I was reading the Law of One series, where the exact same proceduredocumented in my dream was being used successfully. The synchronicity wasabsolutely astonishing. Seeing this same dream time loop into my mother’sproblems with the new attic door at the house I grew up in only makes this evenmore poignant as I write this book. Let’s continue with this same quote fromBook One of the Law of One series.> Don was impressed by the large number of correlations between these messages> and our own research. The book is fascinating in its own right, but it was> especially fascinating to us because of the incredible number of distinct and> compelling similarities between the characters in the real-life journal of Dr.> Puharich’s work with Uri and the supposedly fictional characters in our book.> > We went to New York to meet Andrija after phoning him, sharing our> long-standing research with him and comparing notes. As our genial host came> out onto his front verandah to welcome us, I stopped, amazed, to look at the> house. Even the house in which he lived in the country north of New York City> was a dead ringer for the house his fictional counterpart had owned in our> book. The identity was so close that I could not help but ask, “Andrija, what> happened to your peonies? When I wrote about your house I saw your driveway> circled with peony bushes.” Puharich laughed, “Oh, those. I had those cut down> three years ago.”28 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber155]PYRAMID TECHNOLOGY TO STABILIZE EARTH’S AXISIn the Law of One quote I shared that revealed our Global Grid of geometry, Rawas clearly saying that pyramids were being deliberately built on this Grid tohelp keep the Earth “balanced,” so it was less likely to have another poleshift. We are about to review the hard science that suggests this really couldwork. The Law of One source had already confirmed that the Earth had gonethrough previous cataclysms, including the sinking of the legendary Atlantis. Ihad a great deal of research to support the idea of an Atlantean catastrophe,including When the Sky Fell by Rand and Rose Flem-Ath, Fingerprints of the Godsby Graham Hancock, and many other books with similar information. Atlantis isreferred to in a total of nineteen passages throughout the Law of Onematerial.29 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber156]In 2001, I discovered research headed by Dr. Alexander Golod from the RussianNational Academy of Sciences that confirmed that large pyramids built of PVCpipes and fiberglass were able to reduce the severity of earthquakes and extremeweather—in a statistically significant fashion: “Areas near the pyramids seem tohave diminished seismic activity. Instead of one large powerful earthquakeoccurring, there are hundreds of tiny ones. Also violent weather seems todecrease in the area of the pyramids.”30 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber157] Tofully explain how this works is time-consuming, but for now let’s just reflecton the fact that Dr. Golod’s research confirmed exactly what the Law of Oneseries said: Pyramids can and do have a balancing effect upon the “rhythms” ofthe Earth.Many other mind-blowing discoveries were made with Dr. Golod’s pyramids,including the reduction of radioactivity, the spontaneous charging of electricalcapacitors, the purification of water and oil, a significant increase in thesize of plants grown from pyramid-charged seeds, and a notable improvement inthe behavior of prisoners in selected Russian jail cells built withpyramid-charged granite rocks. Additionally, the scientists observed themeasurable killing of pathogenic viruses and bacteria, the miraculous rescuingof premature babies that were otherwise written off for dead, and the healing ofa variety of diseases, including cancer.31 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber158] Thescience behind how this works is explained in great detail in The Source FieldInvestigations. It is a logical extension of the Hyperdimensional Model. Thebasic idea is that there is a fluidlike, living energy that gives rise to matterand life itself, and I decided to call this energy the Source Field. In the Lawof One, this same phenomenon is termed intelligent energy, and this phraseappears sixty-five times throughout the material.32[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber159] The pyramid shape seems to work like a funnelto capture this fluidlike energy and cause it to begin spinning, much like atorpedo or whirlpool inside. Hence the word pyramid is derived from “pyre-amid,”or “fire in the middle.”It was also very fascinating to hear the source tell us that humans are the mainforce that is destabilizing the Earth’s axis. We have caused this instability byhaving “growing thought-form distortions in understanding of the Law of One.” Incontext, what they are saying is that the universe has an agenda. There is onlyExistence—one mind, one thought, one Creator. The universe, including the Earthwe live on, is an “illusion” that the Creator built to teach us the Law of One.Our job is to discover the Law of One for ourselves and begin living, breathing,and walking that truth—“to radiate the realization of Oneness with theCreator”33 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber160] to others. If enough of us fall outof alignment with the Law of One in our thoughts and actions, then the Earthitself begins to destabilize under our feet.This is akin to an immune-system reaction. As long as we are loving andpositive, the Earth will remain a safe place to live. Once enough of us startslipping into selfishness, materialism, suspicion, jealousy, greed, and despair,manipulating and controlling others for our own benefit, the Earth can become adanger zone. A giant earthquake or volcanic eruption is a wake-up call thatcauses us to pull together, rely on each other, and set aside our differences.People who are ordinarily walking around angry will now perform heroic acts,sharing food, water, and shelter with each other, and realize that we all have acommon bond, regardless of race, creed, color, or nationality. Karma canmanifest on mass levels, through things like Earth changes, as well as on thepersonal level. The positive ETs built the pyramids for us as a way to helpreduce the stress we were causing—as if the pyramids were needles of stoneworking the acupuncture meridians of the Earth, which is a living being in itsown right. Without these balancing pyramids, things would have been far worse.Despite how amazing this material was, it quickly became clear that Ra hadgotten themselves in a great deal of trouble in the karmic sense. In trying togive us the highest-level teachings possible, they discovered that “the greaterpreponderance of your entities find themselves in what may be considered aperpetual childhood,” as they said in Session 20, Question 25.34[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber161] One of their most important objectives inproducing the Law of One series in 1981 to 1983 was to pay out a form ofrestitution to the mass consciousness of Earth and its people by offering ussuch advanced spiritual material. Why would such a karmic payback be necessary?In short, Ra built the Great Pyramid as a positive symbol of the comingAscension—but this magnificent stone edifice was then taken over by negativelyinclined priests and peoples. Even to this day, many people consider the pyramidand All-Seeing Eye on the back of the US dollar bill to be an Illuminati symbol.This was never the intention, as we will see."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENA MISSION OF RESTITUTIONEarlier in Session 4, Question 20, Ra had defined this mysterious Law of One bysaying, “There is . . . only identity.” The complete quote was as follows:> The Law of One, though beyond the limitations of name, as you call vibratory> sound complexes, may be approximated by stating that all things are one, that> there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All> is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. One of> the primal distortions of the Law of One is that of healing. Healing occurs> when a mind/body/spirit complex realizes, deep within itself, the Law of One;> that is, that there is no disharmony, no imperfection; that all is complete> and whole and perfect. Thus, the intelligent infinity within this> mind/body/spirit complex re-forms the illusion of body, mind, or spirit to a> form congruent with the Law of One. The healer acts as energizer or catalyst> for this completely individual process.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber162]DEFINING THE LAW OF ONE AND THE MIND/BODY/SPIRIT COMPLEXThe term mind/body/spirit complex is their unique way of defining what we wouldthink of as a person. They see the mind, the body, and the spirit as separateand distinct entities that come together in a “complex” form to make a humanbeing. You might immediately balk at the idea that, in the grandest sense,“there is . . . no right or wrong.” The Law of One series makes it very clearthat the universe we think we know is an “illusion.” Part of that illusion isgalaxies, stars, planets, and the idea of an apparently separate self in bodieslike ours. Since we are truly One with all others, anything we say, think about,or do to someone else will be returned back to us in our seemingly physicalexperience. This is the Law of Karma, which is referred to as the FirstDistortion of the Law of One. As I said in the last chapter, this is the mostimportant teaching in the Law of One series after the concept of Oneness itself.KARMA, HEALING, AND RESTITUTIONAnother one of the “distortions” they referred to in the above quote is the“distortion of healing,” but the First Distortion is a term that shows up in atotal of sixty passages throughout the series.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber163] As I read The Law of One, I had to keepreminding myself that “First Distortion” means “Karma.” They indicated thatKarma was indeed a universal law, which had existed from the very beginning ofspace and time itself. Karma was the first and most important “distortion” ofthe Law of One. This Oneness, or “intelligent infinity,” was compared to purewhite light. Anything within our “illusion” of a physical universe was thereforeseen to be a “distortion” of this light. The word distortion appears in a totalof 597 different passages, often in the most unlikely sounding places.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber164] If you subtract the 60 passages thatspecifically say First Distortion, that still leaves 537 other instances of theterm distortion. First distortion translates as “karma,” but the word distortionby itself can mean just about anything we might normally think of as being goodor bad.Let’s talk about that contentious statement where the source says “there is noright or wrong” in the ultimate sense. There certainly are plenty of negativethings we can do to ourselves and others in this “illusion” that will bebalanced out by karma. To harm others is to absolutely guarantee that you areharming yourself. Ultimately, there is nothing “wrong” that happens outside oflinear time, because the balance is preserved. You get your karma. You payeverything back, down to the tiniest amount. The Universe moves forward. Again,once you have achieved what the Law of One calls “healing,” you consciouslyrecognize that there is no disharmony, no imperfection: All is complete andwhole and perfect.To achieve this state of healing, you must also go through what is called“restitution” in the physical illusion. This term appears only three times inthe material, but it is of key importance. Two of the three instances ofrestitution arose in Session 26, in response to questions about the nuclearattacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The following excerpt is combined fromQuestions 27 through 31 in Session 26:> Such actions as nuclear destruction affect the entire planet. There are no> differences at this level of destruction, and the planet will need to be> healed. . . . Once the healing has taken place, the harvest [Ascension] may go> forth unimpeded. However, the entire planet will undergo healing for this> action, no distinction being made betwixt victim and aggressor, this due to> damage done to the planet. . . . Healing is a process of acceptance,> forgiveness, and, if possible, restitution. The restitution not being> available in time/space, there are many among your peoples now attempting> restitution while in the physical. . . . These [people do this by]> attempt[ing] feelings of love towards the planetary sphere and comfort and> healing of the scars and the imbalances of these actions.4> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber165]Of particular importance in this passage is Question 30: “Healing is a processof acceptance, forgiveness, and, if possible, restitution.” My own experiencewith karma proved that every experience we have ever delivered to others,regardless of whether it was in this lifetime or prior ones, must be paid backin full through restitution. That means that you must physically experience theexact nature of suffering that you caused others to feel. You can then trustthat perfect balance has been restored, since you paid your restitution—and thusin the grander sense, all is good and whole and perfect. After first meditatingon this Hiroshima quote in 1996, I would go to various huge cement-mining cavesthroughout Rosendale and send love to the Earth in these areas as a form ofrestitution, to comfort the Earth and heal the scars of these massive dynamiteexplosions. I also thanked the Earth for the use of the dolostone in helpingbuild our current civilization, wherein the opportunity to awaken within thedream and access intelligent infinity becomes possible.Our earlier quote from Session 4, Question 20, also said that once this healingprocess occurs where we see all as whole, complete, and perfect, we “re-form theillusion of body, mind, or spirit to a form congruent with the Law of One.” Thisappears to be a technical-sounding way of describing a light-body activation—andyou get there only by paying off your debts through restitution. The light bodyis a form that is more “congruent with the Law of One.” In Session 34, Question2, the source also told us what we could expect to feel if we were able toconnect with this “intelligent infinity” on a conscious level:> The experience of each entity is unique in perception of intelligent infinity.> Perceptions range from a limitless joy to a strong dedication to service to> others while in the incarnated state. The entity which reaches intelligent> infinity most often will perceive this experience as one of unspeakable> profundity. However, it is not usual for the entity to immediately desire the> cessation of the incarnation. Rather the desire to communicate or use this> experience to aid others is extremely strong.5> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber166]When I read this, I thought about the many reports of people seeing and feeling“The Light” in near-death experiences. In Law of One terms, anything other thanthat pure light is a distortion.THE SEVEN DENSITIESAccording to the Law of One, in order for us to reach the highest spirituallevel, we have to work through each of the seven densities—which they refer toas “true color” red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—beforereturning to the Oneness. Each density is akin to a separate plane of existencethat we work through in our evolution. We are connected to these densitiesthrough our seven energy centers, or chakras. Again, these chakras appear on thesoul level as a series of round vortexes that rise through the middle of thebody, from the base of the spine through to the top of the head. They alsodisplay the colors of the rainbow along the way: red, orange, yellow, green,blue, indigo, and violet. Apparently, some people can see into the spirit worldand are thus able to visually perceive these energy centers. The ancient Hinduscriptures talk about the chakras quite extensively. The Law of One says thateach of our seven chakras are directly connected to each of the seven densities.In that sense, we are already fully multidimensional beings—perfect holographicimages of the whole.In Session 49, Question 6, Ra gives a short summary of the lessons for eachdensity, and I will add in the numbers here to make it easier to read. I havefound that these explanations for each color also translate directly into whatthey symbolize in dreams, as I shared in chapter 3, “Dream Analysis 101”:> Each experience will be sequentially understood by the growing and seeking> mind/body/spirit complex in terms of 1) survival [red], then in terms of 2)> personal identity [orange], then in terms of 3) social relations [yellow],> then in terms of 4) universal love [green], then in terms of 5) how the> experience may beget free communication [light blue], then in terms of 6) how> the experience may be linked to universal energies [indigo], and finally in> terms of 7) the sacramental nature of each experience [violet]. Meanwhile, the> Creator lies within. In the north pole, the crown is already upon the head,> and the entity is potentially a god. This energy is brought into being by the> humble and trusting acceptance of this energy, through meditation and> contemplation of the self and of the Creator.6> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber167]There again, if you read this carefully, it clearly says that theseventh-density teaching is to “embrace the sacramental nature of eachexperience.” The Tibetan monk Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche advocates a similar practicein his book Rainbow Painting.7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber168] He said that ifwe can remember to recognize the true essence of mind while in the midst ofgreat conflict, such as while we are running for our lives from a pack ofvicious dogs, we will gain a much greater level of insight than in normalmeditation practice. The degree of conflict in our world today makes it possiblefor exceptional spiritual insights to be realized. To be at peace with whateverhappens to you, no matter how physically difficult it may be, is to embrace thesacramental nature of each experience. You have then experienced “the distortionof healing” as defined in the Law of One series, where “there is no disharmony,no imperfection; that all is complete and whole and perfect.”8[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber169] Therefore, when you see the term healingappear in the Law of One series, it carries far more weight than you may havenormally placed upon the word. Healing appears in a total of 180 different Lawof One passages.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber170]The Law of One also teaches us that it is very important to set sacredboundaries as well. Part of the sacramental nature of each experience is topreserve your own well-being if it serves the greater good to do so. One placewhere this was explained was in Session 42, Question 6. The fourth density isthe plane of existence that our Earth is moving into now, but it is by no meansthe end of the road for what we will learn:> The fourth density, as we have said, abounds in compassion. This compassion is> folly [ignorance] when seen through the eyes of wisdom. It is the salvation of> third density, but creates a mismatch in the ultimate balance of the entity.> Thus we, as a social memory complex of fourth density, had the tendency> towards compassion even to martyrdom in aid of other-selves. When the> fifth-density harvest was achieved, we found that in this vibratory level> flaws could be seen in the efficacy of such unrelieved compassion. We spent> much time/space in contemplation of those ways of the Creator which imbue love> with wisdom.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber171]The most important discussion of “sacred boundaries” in the Law of One appearsin Session 67, Question 11. Carla Rueckert, the “instrument,” was beingconstantly attacked by a negative entity that wished to stop the Law of Onemessage from getting through, such as by trying to telepathically influence herto step in front of an oncoming car or causing massive flare-ups of herarthritic pains. Dr. Elkins asked how they could simultaneously send love tothis entity, which the Law of One requires that you do on the positive path,while not allowing it to hurt or kill Carla. This was the answer:> Upon the many other planes of existence there are those whose every fiber> rejoices at your service, and those such as the entity of whom you have been> speaking, which wish only to terminate the life upon the third-density plane> of this instrument. All are the Creator. There is one vast panoply of biases> and distortions, colors and hues, in an unending pattern. In the case of those> with whom you, as entities and as a group, are not in resonance, you wish them> love, light, peace, joy, and bid them well. No more than this can you do for> your portion of the Creator is as it is, and your experience and offering of> experience, to be valuable, needs be more and more a perfect representation of> who you truly are. Could you, then, serve a negative entity by offering the> instrument’s life? It is unlikely that you would find this a true service.> Thus you may see in many cases the loving balance being achieved, the love> being offered, light being sent, and the service of the service-to-self> oriented entity gratefully acknowledged, while being rejected as not being> useful in your journey at this time. Thus you serve One Creator without> paradox.11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber172]THE LAW OF FOREVERNESSAnother critical aspect of the seventh-density teaching is the followingconcept: “The seventh density is a density of completion, and the turning towardtimelessness or foreverness.”12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber173] This idea of“foreverness” was further developed in Session 3, Question 10. Dr. Don Elkins,the questioner, asked whether a single person who was fully awakened to the Lawof One could “build a pyramid by direct mental effort.” Here was part of theanswer:> There is a distinction between the individual power through the Law of One and> the combined, or societal memory complex mind/body/spirit understanding of the> Law of One. In the first case only the one individual, purified of all flaws,> could move a mountain. In the case of mass understanding of unity, each> individual may contain an acceptable amount of distortion, and yet the mass> mind could move mountains. The progress is normally from the understanding> which you now seek to a dimension of understanding which is governed by the> laws of love, and which seeks the laws of light. Those who are vibrating with> the Law of Light seek the Law of One. Those who vibrate with the Law of One> seek the Law of Foreverness.Each density from the fourth on up was associated with a law or a set of laws.The fourth is the Law of Love; the fifth density is the Law of Light, which theyalso define as wisdom; the sixth density where Ra is speaking from is the Law ofOne, hence the title of the series; and the seventh density is the Law ofForeverness. Dr. Scott Mandelker explained in his book that it is asixth-density understanding to see self and other as One. Once you reach seventhdensity, you realize there is no self. There is no other. There is onlyTimelessness and Foreverness. Buddhist texts presented this same concept, and itwas often translated into English with the term The Void. This is the finalrealization we will all eventually have before we reunite with what is called“intelligent infinity.”Intelligent infinity is how the universe began, if you want to call it abeginning, since there really is no such thing as Time. However, within theillusion, there was what appeared to be the formation of a visible universe witha duration of time that passes. The first thing that intelligent infinity neededto “do” to create the universe was to generate something called intelligentenergy—the Logos—which is also labeled infinite energy. This was described inSession 13, Question 7, among many other places. This quote, as it turns out, isone of the most critical passages in the entire series, since it contains someencoded information that took me years to properly decipher:> Awareness led to the focus of infinity into infinite energy. You have called> this by various vibrational sound complexes, the most common to your ears> being “Logos” or “Love.” The Creator is the focusing of infinity as an aware> or conscious principle, called by us as closely as we can create> understanding/learning in your language, intelligent infinity.13> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber174]If you pay close attention to what was said in this quote, we hear that theuniverse is indeed made out of Love. More specifically, we have an “intelligentinfinity” that focuses itself into an “aware or conscious principle,” whichbecomes what we would normally think of as God—the Creator of the universe. Whatwe call “God” is often called “Logos” or “Love” in the Law of One series. The“infinite . . . intelligent energy” is directed to create form out offormlessness. That infinite energy that makes the universe is Love—the Logos. Aswe discussed in the previous chapter, the Law of One gave us a very importanthidden clue by using the term Logos here. The Greek translation of the termLogos is “Word.” This is one of a few key phrases, like Harvest, that directlyconnect the Law of One to the Christian Bible. There is nothing obvious aboutthis, and in fact it took me many years to figure out that the source wanted usto make this connection. As I said, the word Logos appears in fully 146 Law ofOne passages.14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber175]Another important point here is that the words Logos and Love are presented asbeing interchangeable. This is another confusing thing in the Law of One. Whenthey say “Logos,” they can be referring to the Creator itself, a galaxy, or astar like our sun, which exists in a state of oneness with the galaxy we see itin. A planet like Earth is defined as a “sub-Logos,”15[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber176] and then a person like you or me is consideredto be a “sub-sub-Logos.”16 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber177] You can see howeasily this could get confusing. The basic idea, again, is that all is One. Youand I are holographic images of the One Infinite Creator, and we are onlydistorted to appear as a human form within the illusion.If you want to get a bit more technical about the term sub-sub-Logos, check thisout from Session 54, Question 5: “The sub-sub-Logos resides, not indimensionalities, but only in co-Creators, or mind/body/spirit complexes.”17[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber178] This means that we are truly co-Creators withthe entire universe itself. There is no “dimension” where you will find asub-sub-Logos—instead, each of us is a “co-Creator or sub-sub-Logos, [which] youcall so carelessly a person.”18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber179] Anotherexample that gives us additional new insights is in Session 29, Question 8,where Dr. Elkins asked, “Then every entity that exists would be some type ofsub- or sub-sub-Logos. Is this correct?” The answer was “This is correct down tothe limits of any observation, for the entire creation is alive.”19[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber180] This quote may be almost singularlyresponsible for why I soon chose to name my website Divine Cosmos. If you beginstudying the universe as a single, vast living being, many scientific mysteriessuddenly become much clearer. I went to great pains to explain this in TheSource Field Investigations.EXPERIENCE ALL THINGS DESIREDAnother quote that really jumped out at me from my very first reading is afurther explanation of how we apply this Law of One philosophy to our everydaylives and thoughts. It appears in Session 18, Question 5, and is one of my veryfavorites:> The proper role of the entity is, in this density, to experience all things> desired—to then analyze, understand, and accept these experiences, distilling> from them the love/light within them. Nothing shall be overcome. That which is> not needed falls away. . . .> > We have found it to be inappropriate in the extreme to encourage the> overcoming of any desires, except to suggest the imagination rather than the> carrying out in the physical plane, as you call it, of those desires not> consonant with the Law of One; this preserving the primal distortion of free> will . . . All things are acceptable in the proper time for each entity, and> in experiencing, in understanding, in accepting, in then sharing with> other-selves, the appropriate description shall be moving away from> distortions of one kind to distortions of another which may be more consonant> with the Law of One. It is, shall we say, a shortcut to simply ignore or> overcome any desire. It must instead be understood and accepted. This takes> patience and experience, which can be analyzed with care, with compassion for> self and for other-self.20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber181]This is a fascinating philosophical statement that is certainly far more openand inclusive than most other religious or spiritual teachings. In the simplestterms, the source is saying: “Do what you want, and please learn from it—so youdon’t keep repeating the negative stuff and suffering from bad karma. If youwant to actually hurt someone, try to act this out in your imagination insteadof in physical form, so you don’t create additional karma by violating the Lawof One and have to pay restitutions.” If you keep repeating lessons withoutlearning anything from them, you are in a state the Law of One refers to as“True Helplessness.” This was defined in Session 19, Question 18: “Those trulyhelpless are those who have not consciously chosen [the positive or negativepath], but who repeat patterns without knowledge of the repetition or themeaning of the pattern.”21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber182]THE CONFEDERATION OF PLANETSMy immersion into the Law of One was as profound and complete as I could getaway with. The fascination I felt with Cosmic Voyage quickly got swept away inan ocean of vastly greater size and complexity. Any time I wasn’t at my jobkeeping the peace, I was up in the loft or down on the couch, reading the Law ofOne with intense focus. If I had a day off, I might spend twelve to fourteenhours happily reading the books. I could easily spend forty-five minutes withthe book open to one particular page, reading and meditating on its philosophythe entire time. This was nothing I could rush. I needed to take it slow, godeep within myself, and toss each of these powerful statements around in my minduntil they finally made sense. I would only turn the page once I felt that I atleast had a reasonable level of understanding about what I was reading.Early along in Session 6, things got very cosmic when Ra explained the largergroup that they were working with:> I am one of the members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the> Infinite Creator. There are approximately fifty-three civilizations,> comprising approximately five hundred planetary consciousness complexes in> this Confederation. This Confederation contains those from your own planet who> have attained dimensions beyond your third. It contains planetary entities> within your solar system, and it contains planetary entities from other> galaxies. It is a true Confederation in that its members are not alike, but> allied in service according to the Law of One.22> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber183]The term galaxies was very confusing. Ra saw a single planetary system asindistinguishable from a larger galaxy like the Milky Way. They apparently hadobserved that a single solar system could grow into what we would think of as agalaxy with many stars. Dr. Elkins had to create the term major galaxy todifferentiate the two. In Session 16, Question 33, Ra clarified that they werehelping people from seven different solar systems within our Milky Way galaxy:“This Confederation works with the planetary spheres of seven of your galaxies,if you will, and is responsible for the callings of the densities of thesegalaxies. . . . We use that term [galaxy] in this sense as you would use starsystems.”23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber184]This was further explained in Session 28, Question 7, as follows:> A Logos may create what you call a star system or it may be the Logos creating> billions of star systems. This is the cause of the confusion in the term> galaxy, for there are many different Logos entities or creations and we would> call each, using your sound vibration complexes, a galaxy.24> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber185]Then it was confirmed that these smaller Logos systems can grow a larger numberof stars over time in Session 82, Question 8:> In the case of the galactic systems, the first manifestation of the Logos is a> cluster of central systems which generate the outward swirling energies> producing, in their turn, further energy centers for the Logos, or what you> would call stars.25 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber186]RECENT HISTORY OF RA AND THE CONFEDERATIONIn the very first statement from the very first session, Ra said, “TheConfederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator has only oneimportant statement. That statement, my friends, as you know, is ‘All things,all of life, all of the creation is part of one original thought.’”26[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber187] As this discussion continued into Question 1,we read the following:> We are old upon your planet and have served with varying degrees of success in> transmitting the Law of One, of Unity, of Singleness to your peoples. We have> walked your earth. We have seen the faces of your peoples. This is not so with> many of the entities of the Confederation. We found it was not efficacious.> However, we then felt the great responsibility of staying, in the capacity of> removing the distortions and powers that had been given to the Law of One. We> will continue in this until your, shall we say, cycle is appropriately ended.> If not this one, then the next. We are not a part of time and, thus, are able> to be with you in any of your times.27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber188]Ra clearly indicated in this passage that some kind of damage had occurred tothe people of Earth from their arrival here, and that they were bound to theirown form of restitution to heal it. This was further explained in Session 2, aswe will see. Dr. Elkins then asked about the name Ra, and got a surprisinganswer in response:> The identity of the vibration Ra is our identity. We as a group, or what you> would call a social memory complex, made contact with a race of your planetary> kind which you call Egyptians. Others from our density made contact at the> same time in South America, and the so-called “lost cities” were their> attempts to contribute to the Law of One. We spoke to one who heard and> understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One. However, the> priests and peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of> the, shall we say, compassion with which unity is informed by its very nature.> Since it contains all, it cannot abhor any. When we were no longer able to> have appropriate channels through which to enunciate the Law of One, we> removed ourselves from the now-hypocritical position which we had allowed> ourselves to be placed in. And other myths, shall we say, other understandings> having more to do with polarity and the things of your vibrational complex,> again took over in that particular society complex.28> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber189]This quote immediately captured my imagination. Clearly, Ra was saying that theycontacted ancient Egypt and were directly involved in the building of the GreatPyramid. They further indicated that they “spoke to one who heard and understoodand was in a position to decree the Law of One.” This was very obviously thesame character that Edgar Cayce’s source was referring to as Ra-Ptah. The CayceReadings had indicated that Ra-Ptah had fallen prey to his lower instincts andultimately had multiple wives, and that this and other actions negativelyaffected the future course of religion as we know it. Ra was confirming thisexact same idea by saying that “the priests and peoples of that era quicklydistorted our message,” creating “other understandings having more to do withpolarity.” In this sense, polarity only occurs when we see and experience evilas something separate from the unity and loving consciousness of pure Oneness.THE PYRAMIDS INADVERTENTLY CREATED DAMAGEAs we head into Session 2, Question 2, we get far more detail about Ra’sinvolvement with building pyramids, and how this in turn created damage to thepeople of Earth that they are still working to repair:> We are those of the Confederation who eleven thousand of your years ago came> to two of your planetary cultures which were at that time closely in touch> with the creation of the One Creator. It was our naïve belief that we could> teach/learn by direct contact, and the free will distortions of individual> feeling or personality were in no danger, we thought, of being disturbed—as> these cultures were already closely aligned with an all-embracing belief in> the live-ness or consciousness of all. We came and were welcomed by the> peoples whom we wished to serve. We attempted to aid them in technical ways> having to do with the healing of mind/body/spirit complex distortions through> the use of the crystal, appropriate to the distortion, placed within a certain> appropriate series of ratios of time/space material. Thus were the pyramids> created. [Emphasis added]> > We found that the technology was reserved largely for those with the effectual> mind/body distortion of power. This was not intended by the Law of One. We> left your peoples. The group that was to work with those in the area of South> America, as you call that portion of your sphere, gave up not so easily. They> returned. We did not. However, we have never left your vibration due to our> responsibility for the changes in consciousness we had first caused and then> found distorted in ways not relegated to the Law of One.29> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber190]Ra also explained in Session 23, Question 6, that for a period of time, theyphysically materialized in forms that “closely resembled their true natures”among the Egyptians. This very much appears to be the image of Horus, theavian-headed deity, as we have previously explored. Ra identified themselvesstrongly with the hawk as their totem animal. We also see in the myth of Osirisand Isis that their child was apparently Horus, though this could have arisen asa misunderstanding, where Ra was appearing in this form after being invoked byOsiris and Isis, thus appearing to be their direct offspring.Other quotes reveal that Ra materialized in this form while the pyramids werebeing built. This ended up creating a great deal of confusion and forced them towithdraw from view fairly quickly:> Thus we emerged, or materialized, in physical-chemical complexes representing> as closely as possible our natures, this effort being to appear as brothers> and spend a limited amount of time as teachers of the Law of One, for there> was an ever-stronger interest in the sun body, and this vibrates in> concordance with our particular distortions. We discovered that for each word> we could utter, there were thirty impressions we gave by our very being, which> confused those entities we had come to serve. After a short period we removed> ourselves from these entities and spent much time attempting to understand how> best to serve those to whom we had offered ourselves in love/light.30> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber191]We are certainly witnessing this same problem in modern times with the stridentdifficulty that some people online have with the concept of Blue Avians and thecontact that Corey Goode has received. Corey had no idea of the connection toHorus or the Law of One when the Blue Avians allegedly began contacting him.This contact began regularly occurring only four months after he and I beganspeaking on a daily basis.TEMPLES OF HUMAN SACRIFICERa became far more specific in Session 23 about how their original positiveintent to create pyramids that could heal people and balance the Earth on itsnew axis, after the fall of Atlantis, had become distorted. In both SouthAmerica and Egypt, the “priests and peoples of the era” began using thesepyramids for human sacrifices—which was exactly the opposite of the extremelypositive purposes they were originally built to fulfill. Also remember that thesun is at the Octave or Logos level, and therefore is indeed a visiblemanifestation of universal consciousness within our local area. Take a look:> The [Confederation] entities who walked among those in your South American> continent were called by a similar desire upon the part of the entities> therein to learn of the manifestations of the sun. They worshiped this source> of light and life. Thus, these entities were visited by light beings not> unlike ourselves. Instructions were given, and they were more accepted and> less distorted than ours. The entities themselves began to construct a series> of underground and hidden cities, including pyramid structures.> > These pyramids were somewhat at variance from the design that we had> promulgated. However, the original ideas were the same, with the addition of a> desire or intention of creating places of meditation and rest, a feeling of> the presence of the One Creator; these pyramids then being for all people, not> only initiates and those to be healed. They left this density when it was> discovered that their plans were solidly in motion and, in fact, had been> recorded. During the next approximately three thousand five hundred [3,500]> years these plans became, though somewhat distorted, in a state of> near-completion in many aspects.31 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber192]As this quote continues, it will be helpful to explain two new terms. The Earthwas put under “quarantine” by the Confederation at a certain point in our pasthistory, because our people had so many spiritual problems. Once the quarantinewas established, it was impossible for random extraterrestrial groups to flyinto our atmosphere and land on the Earth. In addition, even the positive groupshad to request permission to appear on Earth and perform a given mission—theycouldn’t just show up. This and other administrative Confederation decisionswere made in a local governing body called the Council of Saturn, which residesin the full eighth-density octave level within the rings of Saturn.32[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber193],33 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber194] Eighthdensity is the ultimate goal that we are all working toward.In Session 52, Question 12, it said:> This octave density of which we have spoken is both omega and alpha, the> spiritual mass of the infinite universes becoming one central sun or Creator> once again. Then is born a new universe, a new infinity, a new Logos which> incorporates all that the Creator has experienced of Itself. In this new> octave there are also those who wander. We know very little across the> boundary of octave except that these beings come to aid our octave in its> Logos completion.34 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber195]With all that said, let us continue in this quote from Session 23 about whathappened in South America:> Therefore, as is the case in all breakings of the quarantine, the> [Confederation] entity who was helping the South American entities along the> South American ways you call in part the Amazon River, went before the Council> of Saturn to request a second attempt to correct, in person, the distortions> which had occurred in their plans. This having been granted, this entity or> social memory complex returned—and the entity chosen as messenger came among> the peoples once more to correct the errors. [This was likely a historical> South American figure such as Viracocha or Quetzalcoatl.] Again, all was> recorded and the entity rejoined its social memory complex and left your> skies. As in our experience, the teachings were, for the most part, greatly> and grossly perverted to the extent in later times of actual human sacrifice> rather than healing of humans. Thus, this social memory complex is also given> the honor/duty of remaining until those distortions are worked out of the> distortion complexes of your peoples.35 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber196]Notice that the source said “as in our experience,” human sacrifice occurredwith the South American pyramids. Sadly, this indicates that similar practicesdid occur inside structures such as the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. This iscertainly not commonly known, but the Law of One source does operate from aneffectively omniscient perspective. Although the Great Pyramid was ultimatelyused for these negative practices, the original intent was highly positive—topresent us with one of the most magnificent spiritual gifts imaginable. As wehead into the next chapter, we will explore the mysteries of the Great Pyramid.Until you truly understand just how impossible the Pyramid is from anyconventional technological standpoint, you cannot truly appreciate the level ofsophistication that went into its construction. Once we fully understand thisdata, it will become much easier to contemplate how this structure could havebeen built by the most advanced, benevolent extraterrestrial life ever to appearon Earth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENMYSTERIES OF THE GREAT PYRAMIDThe Law of One series was transforming everything I thought I knew about realityand my place within the greater universe we live in. Each volume of the Law ofOne series had Egyptian hieroglyphics on the cover. It became clear as I readthe books that Ra was a highly positive group that existed outside of time. Theywere doing their best to give us teachings that would help transformconsciousness on planet Earth, and prepare us for a mass Ascension event theycalled harvest. Yet, thanks initially to the misdeeds of Ra-Ptah, this plan wasthrown off course. Mistakes were made with ramifications far greater than anyonecould possibly have imagined at the time. The ultimate result of these mistakeswas the formation of what many now call the Illuminati.THE ILLUMINATI AND THE NEGATIVE POLARITYIt is a well-known historical fact that people were being beheaded andsacrificed on the tops of the South American pyramids. However, there is nocommon understanding that the same thing was happening within the Great Pyramid,such as in the King’s Chamber sarcophagus—but here Ra clearly indicates that itwas indeed what happened, “as in our [Ra’s] experience.” As I was first readingthis, I realized it was revealing a far more significant point than the Law ofOne had directly explained. By the time I found the Law of One series, I hadalready read New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies by William T.Still.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber197] The book was jam-packed withinformation about the history and ongoing presence of the so-called Illuminatiin our society—and was the main source for literally thousands of articles inthe conspiracy genre from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. It had a tremendouseffect on me when I read it somewhere in approximately 1994 or 1995, and Ididn’t have the courage to share this information publicly, under my real name,until 2007.“Illuminati” never appears in the Law of One, although there is a great degreeof discussion regarding the negative polarity or “service to self” path, as wellas what they call the “elite.” The term elite appears twelve different times inthe Law of One series. In the modern Internet conspiracy culture, the symbol ofthe pyramid with the All-Seeing Eye is widely considered to be an Illuminatisymbol, and therefore associated with extreme negativity for most people who areaware of it. This was by no means the original intent behind the pyramid’sconstruction, according to the Law of One series.Dr. Elkins asked why some people choose to pursue the service-to-self path, inSession 19, Question 17, and the answer he received was quite poignant:> We can speak only in metaphor. Some love the light. Some love the darkness. It> is a matter of the unique and infinitely various Creator choosing and playing> among its experiences, as a child upon a picnic. Some enjoy the picnic and> find the sun beautiful, the food delicious, the games refreshing, and glow> with the joy of creation. Some find the night delicious, their picnic being> pain, difficulty, sufferings of others, and the examination of the> perversities of nature. These enjoy a different picnic. All these experiences> are available. It is free will of each entity which chooses the form of play,> the form of pleasure.2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber198]It is still quite common to see certain people on the Internet get very upsetabout the name Ra, believing that this must be some evil and negative group.However, if you actually read the Law of One series, it is a beautifulphilosophy that emphasizes the importance of positive spiritual virtues likelove, forgiveness, and service to others. Ra have done their best to heal thedamage that was created by their arrival, and hopefully, this book can furtherassist in that healing process. Initially positive symbols like the Masonicsquare and compass, which are used to draw images of sacred geometry, are nowoften associated with a worldwide satanic cult that has been variously calledthe Illuminati, the Cabal, the New World Order, or, in more recent times, theDeep State. As you delve into this disturbing material, you find that at leastsome within this group do indeed enjoy “pain, difficulty, sufferings of others,and the examination of the perversities of nature.”3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber199]GRIEVOUS NAÏVETÉThere are multiple occasions where Ra explains how their own extreme level ofharmony caused them to be very naïve in dealing with a third-density world likeEarth—and particularly by building the Great Pyramid. In Session 41, Question26, they say, “Our harmony, however, has been a grievous source of naïveté asregards working with your planet.”4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber200] In Session57, Question 17, we hear about the misuse of the King’s Chamber, which couldapparently create a light-body activation if properly used. The statement thatthis chamber was used for “grossly distorted” purposes is another indicationthat the human sacrifices they spoke about previously in Session 23 had at leastpartly taken place in this area:> However, we found that your peoples are not distorted towards the desire for> purity to a great enough extent to be given this powerful and potentially> dangerous gift. We, therefore, would suggest it not be used for healing in the> traditional, shall we say, King’s Chamber configuration which we naïvely gave> to your peoples only to see its use grossly distorted and our teachings lost.5> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber201]Then consider the words of Session 60, Question 16:> It is our honor/duty to attempt to remove the distortions that the use of this> [pyramid] shape has caused in the thinking of your peoples and in the> activities of some of your entities. We do not deny that such shapes are> efficacious, nor do we withhold the general gist of this efficacy. However, we> wish to offer our understanding, limited though it is, that contrary to our> naïve beliefs many thousands of your years ago, the optimum shape for> initiation does not exist.6 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber202]Then, in Session 22, Question 26, we read:> We remind you that we are one of the naïve members of that Confederation, and> are still attempting to recoup the damage for which we feel responsibility. It> is our duty as well as honor to continue with your peoples, therefore, until> all traces of the distortions of our teach/learnings have been embraced by> their opposite distortions, and balance achieved.7> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber203]In Session 71, Questions 19 and 20, Dr. Elkins was told that one of the reasonshis group was selected for this contact was to help make thesereparations—though a full restitution was very unlikely:> We . . . have . . . wished to attempt to make reparation for distortions of> this law [the Law of One] set in motion by our naïve actions of your> past. . . . We mean no disrespect for your service, but we do not expect to> make full reparations for these distortions. We may, however, offer our> thoughts in the attempt. The attempt is far more important to us than the> completeness of the result. The nature of your language is such that what is> distorted cannot, to our knowledge, be fully undistorted but only illuminated> somewhat.8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber204]That last phrase is particularly interesting, because the use of the wordilluminated may be a hint that the damage that was inadvertently done to theEarth included the creation of the so-called Illuminati. According to insiderssuch as Svali, this term was widely used by the group long before the Law of Oneseries originated in 1981.Another example of Ra’s focus on restitution is in Session 14, Question 18,where Dr. Elkins asked why this group hoped to increase the number of people whowould make it to fourth density by as many as possible at the end of our cycle:> I speak for the social memory complex termed Ra. We came among you to aid you.> Our efforts in service were perverted. Our desire then is to eliminate as far> as possible the distortions caused by those misreading our information and> guidance. The general cause of service such as the Confederation offers is> that of the primal distortion of the Law of One, which is service. The One> Being of the creation is like unto a body, if you will accept this> third-density analogy. Would we ignore a pain in the leg? A bruise upon the> skin? A cut which is festering? No. There is no ignoring a call. We, the> entities of sorrow, choose as our service the attempt to heal the sorrow,> which we are calling analogous to the pains of a physical body complex> distortion.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber205]EVERLASTING ROCKThe most interesting quotes about the actual building of the Great Pyramidappear in Session 3 of the Law of One, which was almost entirely dedicated tothis one topic. Though their discussion can get very technical, Question 11makes it clear that this was done by a massive telekinetic manifestationprocess: “The pyramids which we thought/built were constructed fromthought-forms created by our social memory complex.”10[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber206] When Dr. Elkins reiterated this statement as aquestion, trying to confirm that the pyramid was built by thought, theirresponse was “We built with everlasting rock the Great Pyramid, as you call it.Other of the pyramids were built with stone moved from one place to another.”11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber207] Therefore, the Great Pyramid was clearly notbuilt with typical stones, but through some mysterious process involving whatthey chose to call “everlasting rock.”This is a surprisingly nontechnical term for Ra to have used, compared to theirnormal semantic complexity. This suggests that they may have been using thisterm to provide a clue to a greater series of concepts. The answer may be foundin Isaiah 26:4, where it says “Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is aneverlasting rock.”12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber208] In other translations,the term everlasting rock appears as the rock of ages.13[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber209] The Law of One series therefore appears to bemaking a direct connection between the Great Pyramid and the Old and NewTestaments. There are other references in the Bible that suggest an intimatefamiliarity with the Great Pyramid, such as in Psalms 118:22: “The stone whichthe builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.”14[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber210] Normally a building has four differentcornerstones, but the Great Pyramid’s capstone, which symbolizes the comingAscension event, could be considered as the single “chief cornerstone.” In theOld Testament, this also appears in Isaiah 28:16: “Behold, I am the one who haslaid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone,of a sure foundation.”15 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber211]Jesus ended up borrowing this Old Testament scripture and defined himself as“the chief cornerstone” in Mark 12:10, Matthew 21:42, and Luke 20:17, and isfurther quoted saying this in Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, and 1 Peter 2:7. Jesusis also referred to as “the rock,” such as in 1 Corinthians 10:4. And in Matthew16:18, Jesus said, “Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hellshall not prevail against it.”16 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber212] This may alsobe a parable that gives the reader another clue to look at the Great Pyramid.The Law of One series made these biblical references in the language ofmetaphor, thus preserving the free will of the reader to either follow up on theresearch leads they presented or ignore them, as I myself did for many years.When Dr. Elkins asked for clarification as to what “everlasting rock” meant, theresponse was, “If you can understand the concept of thought-forms, you willrealize that the thought-form is more regular in its distortion than the energyfields created by the materials in the rock, which has been created throughthought-form from thought to finite energy and beingness in your, shall we say,distorted reflection of the level of the thought-form.”17[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber213] This explained why certain pyramid researchershad found bits of hair, insects, and other organic materials inside the pyramidblocks. To me, this meant that sand was collected and combined into alimestone-type material, and a certain degree of extra materials were blendedinto the finished product from the original sand.Dr. Elkins wanted to know why they didn’t just build the pyramid as one giganticsolid mass of stone if they had the ability to do so. The response was quiteinteresting:> There is a law which we believe to be one of the more significant primal> distortions of the Law of One. That is the Law of Confusion. You have called> this the Law of Free Will. We wished to make a healing machine, or time/space> ratio complex which was as efficacious as possible. However, we did not desire> to allow the mystery to be penetrated by the peoples in such a way that we> became worshipped as builders of a miraculous pyramid. Thus it appears to be> made, not thought.18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber214]Despite their efforts not to be worshipped, their presence clearly caused agreat deal of confusion and forced them to withdraw. Some people saw them asgods, while others saw them as demons, and it caused a great deal ofinfighting—which apparently led to wars and the loss of human life. With Ra’sunique focus on the importance of free will, their own presence was seen toviolate the free will of people on Earth, and the rules they must abide byforced them to withdraw.It is very difficult, if not impossible, for us to currently visualize a mentaland telekinetic power of sufficient strength to take materials like desert sandand transform it into stone blocks. However, throughout the Law of One series,Ra makes it clear that they are the highest-level ETs that would ever directlyinteract with a planet like ours. If the pyramid could indeed be manifesteddirectly with consciousness, there would be no limit to the degree of precisionand perfection with which it could be realized. As is, the pyramid can revealmany secrets for those who take a deeper look—secrets that prove it would bequite impossible for the pyramid to be built without some form of super-advancedtechnology. This is exactly what we see when we analyze the monument itself.THE PROPHECY IN STONEBy the time I read the Law of One series, I already had spent three yearsstudying The Great Pyramid Decoded by Peter Lemesurier. This was one of the veryfirst books I picked up after hearing from my friend’s professor that UFOs werereal. In fact, I bought a copy of the book and brought it home on the very sameday that I went to pick up my special-ordered copy of The Monuments of Mars byRichard C. Hoagland. The material in Great Pyramid Decoded was astonishinglycomplex, but that didn’t scare me in the least. Lemesurier built off the worksof other scholars to make an irrefutable case that the Great Pyramid had a“Prophecy in Stone” built into it. In short, the actual passageways, corridors,and chambers inside the Great Pyramid had very precise prophecies of futureevents, right down to the year when they would occur. And despite modernconspiracy theorists thinking the Great Pyramid is somehow connected to theIlluminati and would therefore convey negative information, it will be veryclear when we study the Great Pyramid Timeline that the birth, crucifixion, andascension of Jesus—or Jehoshua in the Law of One—was of absolutely criticalimportance in our own progress toward Ascension at the end of our current25,000-year cycle.To properly cover the fascinating material in Great Pyramid Decoded, I willinitially bring back a few of the same pages that were originally shared in TheSource Field Investigations. This provides the critical backstory forunderstanding how the Great Pyramid absolutely could not have been built withoutthe use of a very highly advanced technology—vastly exceeding anything availableto us even in today’s world. Then we will continue on to explore the mysteriesof the Great Pyramid Timeline before returning to our discussion of the Law ofOne and the Confederation’s efforts to assist in our global Ascension process.As you read this excerpt, bear in mind that my goal in Source Field was topresent a fully developed overview of the science that was presented in the Lawof One series, without actually needing to refer to it as a reference except inthe appendix. This proved that the Law of One scientific model could stand onits own, without my having to say “take my word for it that this material istrue.” These scientific extrapolations went well beyond anything that CarlaRueckert, whose voice spoke the words, had been able to understand herself—and Ilived with her in her home for nearly two years, in 2003 and 2004.Most people are unaware of how amazing the Great Pyramid looked when it wasfirst built, and how this stunning design continued to be visible up until the1300s. There are many surprises in store for us once we delve into the historyof the Great Pyramid and its precise measurements. Most specifically, I want youto pay very close attention to the discussion of the so-called Egyptian Inch orPyramid Inch, as this becomes the main tool we will use to decipher the PyramidTimeline and its prophecies—both those that have already happened and those thatare still to come. It would have been fun to add some of the Law of One quotesthat we have already shared, but I was shooting for a more mainstream approachat this time. Here we go:FASCINATING SCIENTIFIC FACTS ABOUT THE GREAT PYRAMID> The Great Pyramid is considered the largest stone building on Earth, covering> some thirteen acres at its base—the equivalent of seven Midtown city blocks in> Manhattan—and it rises to the height of a forty-story building. Approximately> 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks were used to build it, each of them> weighing 2.5 to 70 tons apiece—for a total mass of about 6.3 million tons. No> crane ever built in modern times is strong enough to lift stones this heavy—it> would simply tumble over. The bedrock underneath the Great Pyramid was leveled> out so perfectly that no corner of the pyramid’s base is more than a half-inch> higher or lower than the others.19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber215] Such> precise leveling goes significantly beyond even the finest architectural> standards of today.20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber216]> > Strangely, the pyramid is also located at the exact center of the Earth’s> landmass—the one true axis mundi. Its east-west axis sits precisely on the> longest land parallel, covering the greatest amount of land and the least> amount of water on Earth—passing through Africa, Asia, and America along the> way. The longest land meridian, crossing over Asia, Africa, Europe, and> Antarctica, also passes right through the pyramid.21> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber217] The likelihood of finding this “perfect> location” by accident is 1 in 3 billion.22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber218] I> didn’t understand why this location was so important until years later, as we> will see—but it has to do with the flow and positioning of natural energy> fields from the Earth that have remained unknown to mainstream scientists in> our own modern times.> > The sides of the pyramid line up so well with true rotational north that they> only deviate by 3 minutes of arc in any one direction—less than 0.06> percent.23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber219] Another “coincidence” is that if> you calculate the average height of land above sea level, with Miami as the> low and the Himalayas as the high, you come out with 5,449 inches—which is the> exact height of the Great Pyramid.24 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber220]> > To me, the most surprising fact of all was that when the Great Pyramid was> first built, it was covered with twenty-one acres of gleaming, brightly> polished white casing stones—a total of about 115,000 blocks of pure white> limestone25 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber221] averaging 100 inches, or 8.3> feet, in thickness. If you caught the glint of the sun’s reflection off of> these stones in the daytime, it would be blindingly bright—thus earning it the> name Ta Khut, or “the Light.” The reflections could apparently be seen from> the mountains of Israel hundreds of miles away.26> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber222] Despite the fact that some of these casing> stones weighed sixteen tons, all six sides were carved to fit together so> perfectly that the cracks between them were only one-fiftieth of an inch> wide27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber223]—which is narrower than a human> fingernail. Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie described this in the late 1800s as “the> finest opticians’ work on the scale of acres,” comparing it to the precision> used to grind lenses for a telescope. Richard C. Hoagland has pointed out that> even the tiles on a NASA space shuttle do not fit together this closely. Even> more surprisingly, these cracks are not empty—they are filled with a cement> that is incredibly strong. There is no known way you could fit a mortar into> cracks one-fiftieth of an inch wide, and evenly cover areas as large as five> feet by seven feet wide in the vertical, with any known methods. And if you> were foolhardy enough to smash the casing stones with a sledgehammer, you> would find that the limestone itself breaks before the cement does.28> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber224]> > I’m well aware of how fantastic this must sound. It’s one thing to see the> pyramid sitting there as it is today—a giant mass of decaying stone blocks.

His colleagues assumed these writings were the graffiti of> ancient tourists.32 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber228] William of Baldensal> visited the pyramid in the early 1300s and described these strange> inscriptions as being all arranged in long, careful rows of strange symbols.33> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber229] When the casing stones eventually were lost,> so went any hope of documenting these mysterious writings for future> codebreaking analysis and study.> > Diodorus Siclus, who lived soon after the time of Christ, wrote that the> casing stones were “complete and without the least decay.”34> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber230] The Roman naturalist Pliny witnessed native> boys running up the polished sides, to the delight of tourists.

There is strong evidence that Isaiah spoke of the pyramidin chapter 19, verses 19 and 20: “In that day there shall be an altar to theLord in the midst of the Land of Egypt, and a monument at the border thereof tothe Lord, and it shall be for a sign, and for a witness unto the Lord of Hostsin the Land of Egypt.” The Great Pyramid certainly is in the midst of the landof Egypt, and could definitely be seen as a monumental altar.On page 293 of Great Pyramid Decoded, Lemesurier reveals that themirror-polished white casing stones cast triangular reflections of light on thedesert surface, and during the Summer Solstice, this would appear as a perfect,starlike Christian crucifix shape from overhead. The top, left, and rightreflections are about the same length, and the bottom reflection is about threetimes longer.Another intriguing fact is that if you draw a diagonal line to the northeastfrom the Great Pyramid, where you use the east-west meridian as your X axis anduse the angle of the pyramid’s Ascending Passage at 26 degrees, 18 minutes, and9.7 seconds, that line happens to cross directly through Bethlehem, thebirthplace of Jesus. The precision of this alignment is so exact that it isalmost certainly not a coincidence.An additional enigma I described on page 470 of The Ascension Mysteries is thefact that the measured size of the Granite Coffer in the King’s Chamber isprecisely identical to the dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant in the OldTestament, at 2.5 by 1.5 by 1.5 cubits, even though the coffin in the Pyramidallegedly was not discovered until much later.Lastly, the number 153 is of key importance in the Bible and in the GreatPyramid alike. In the Old Testament, the number of builders of Solomon’s firsttemple, a symbol of the light-body, was said to be about 153,000,56[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber252] and the Tetragrammaton, or name of God,happens to appear exactly 153 times in the Book of Genesis.57[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber253] In John 21:11, it says that Simon Peterbrought in a net with exactly 153 large fishes after Jesus’ arrival. The net didnot break even though they caught “so many.” The number 153 is thereforeconsidered to symbolize the people who will be Ascending at the end of thecycle, as the fish-catch is another harvest metaphor.The number 153 also has interesting numerological characteristics, as it is thesum of the integers from 1 to 17. This makes it a triangular number, where ifyou visualize each number like a coin and you arrange the coins into triangleshapes as you place them down one by one, the seventeenth row of the triangleends in the number 153. The numbers 1 and 15 are also triangular numbers.In the Great Pyramid, the roof of the Grand Gallery is exactly 153 units oftwelve Pyramid Inches in length. The top of the Great Step, which is also thefloor of the King’s Chamber complex, is exactly 153 horizontal layers of stoneblocks below the existing flat top of the pyramid. And lastly, the two lowsections of the King’s Chamber Passage together measure 153.057 P\" in length.58[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber254]These connections again establish a very direct linkage between the exactdimensions of the Great Pyramid and the numerology in the Bible. This is anotherproof that the pyramid was intended to be a prophecy of the coming Messiah andthe mass Ascension that would later occur."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENTHE PYRAMID TIMELINEThe Edgar Cayce Readings gave us a direct and undeniable indication that thepyramid itself was built to encode a Message in Stone. In reading 294–151, whilethe Great Pyramid is being discussed as a temple, we hear, “As the changes cameabout in the earth, the rise and fall of nations were to be depicted in thissame temple, that was to act as an interpreter for that which had been, thatwhich is, and that which is to be in the material plane.”1[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber255] This clearly validated the existing work ofPyramidologists who had suggested that past, present, and future historicalevents were very neatly encoded into the stonework of the Great Pyramid. Once welook at the full story, it is obviously a message about our collectiveAscension. The reading also said the Pyramid Timeline described “the rise andfall of nations,” and we will certainly see that with prophecies of events suchas World War I, World War II, 9/11, and the 2007–08 economic collapse.THE RETURN OF THE CAPSTONE SYMBOLIZES PLANETARY AWAKENINGIf the Great Pyramid does have a symbolic story to tell, another obvious part ofthe message would be that it was deliberately left unfinished on the outside.There is a flat, square area at the top where a pyramid-shaped capstone can befitted. When we remember how well the Great Pyramid preserves the Earth’s exactmeasurements, it is no surprise that Peter Lemesurier, the author of GreatPyramid Decoded, suggested the flattened top meant the Earth itself, like theGreat Pyramid, is somehow unfinished. It could be that the folks who built thepyramid intended to return at some point to finish the job they started, perhapsthe end of the Great Year that they built into its measurements. The Law of Oneseries does predict a “harvest” at the end of the 25,000-year cycle, with areturn of positive confederation ET groups to assist us. My own dreams said thesame thing, particularly beginning in 1995, and Corey Goode’s contacteeexperiences gave us additional detail as of 2015. The return of the capstonealso transforms the pyramid from a six-sided object—with a base, four sides, anda top—to a five-sided object. According to Lemesurier, in Egyptian numerology,six means “imperfection” and five means “Divine Initiation.” Given that we seethe exact length of an Earth year in the perimeter, as well as the exact lengthof the great precession cycle in the diagonals, this suggests that theconclusion of our current cycle of precession will heal and transform theimperfections of humanity—by moving us through a Divine Initiation of some kind.The concept of a Pyramid Timeline is discussed by Peter Tompkins in Secrets ofthe Great Pyramid as follows: “To make things worse [for pioneering pyramidresearcher Piazzi Smyth], another Scot, a religious enthusiast called RobertMenzies, advanced the theory that the passage system in the Great Pyramid wasnothing less than a chronological representation of prophecy, corroborating theBible, built on a scale of one pyramid inch to the solar year.” [Emphasis added]This was in 1865.2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber256] The researcher Piazzi Smythbelieved that the Pyramid should have a stellar alignment that was encoded to anexact year in the BC era, and this would represent the starting point for anyprophetic timeline written into the stonework of its inner passageways. RobertMenzies believed Smyth’s proposed alignment should be clearly marked in theDescending Passage, such as through a pair of vertical lines on either side ofthe tunnel. Menzies already had a good idea of where this inscription should bebased on the passages and their relationships to each other. Menzies wasthrilled to find out that Smyth discovered two Scored Lines in the same area heexpected the markers should be!3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber257]AN ENCODED ALIGNMENTThe actual start-date alignment had already been discovered a year before, in1864, when Piazzi Smyth, who had worked as Scotland’s Astronomer Royal fortwenty years,4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber258] visited the Great Pyramid andconducted careful measurements. Smyth concluded that at midnight during theequinox of about 2170 BC (it was later corrected to 2141 BC), the pole star ofthe time, Alpha Draconis, would be visible all the way down at the very bottomof the Descending Passage, at the same time that n-Tauri, or Alcyone of thePleiades, would be precisely overhead.5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber259] Smythbelieved this alignment could not be an accident. He felt it encoded the exacttime the pyramid was constructed, using the slow, 25,920-year wobble of theEarth’s axis known as the precession of the equinoxes. This no longer appears tobe the case, thanks to the far older alignment discovered by Robert Bauvaldating back to 10,490 BC, but this alignment would prove to be of extreme valuein studying the deeper message of the Pyramid Timeline. It fixes the exactmoment we are supposed to begin counting time.Several prominent pyramid scholars concluded that this rare alignment of thePleiades and Pole Star was apparently not accidental nor random. By using theScored Lines as the beginning of a timeline, where you start counting your waythrough the passages with one Pyramid Inch equaling one year, you can look forany changes in direction, structure, measurements, stone composition, orotherwise, and note what year that change corresponds to. Many of the changes inthe pyramid’s passageways correspond with very noteworthy events in our ownhistory when you use this system, including 9/11, the so-called Great Recession,and the Edward Snowden NSA revelations. Skeptics will invariably argue that thePyramid Timeline must be a “hoax” or a “coincidence.” Others will balk at howimportant Christianity is to the events depicted in the timeline. Nonetheless,the sheer number of highly significant dates that are clearly encoded in thetimeline, based on this simple, repetitive, and logical system, makes theseskeptical positions very difficult to defend.Smyth also theorized that the pyramid’s perimeter would reveal the precisenumber of days in an Earth year, expressed in Pyramid Inches, once properlymeasured. Although Smyth received a gold medal from the Royal Society ofEdinburgh for his work, the skeptics were predictably savage—particularlybecause Smyth believed these astonishing results could only be the result ofDivine Intervention, where the God of the Bible guided the hand of the pyramid’searthly architect. Sir James Y. Simpson, a prominent member of the Royal Societyof Edinburgh, said “the whole of Professor Smyth’s theory about the GreatPyramid is a series of strange hallucinations, which only a few weak womenbelieve, and perhaps a few womanly men, but no more.”6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber260] Ouch! I think Sir James must have reincarnatedin the form of an army of YouTube video commenters and Twitter enthusiasts.CALIPH AL-MAMOUN’S TREASURE HUNTAbdullah Al-Mamoun came into power in Alexandria in 813 AD—the son of caliphHarun Al-Rashid, who was immortalized in the classic Arabian Nights. Al-Mamounheard the Great Pyramid contained a secret chamber that held maps and tables ofthe Earth’s measurements, as well as those of the Solar System. These recordswere allegedly very accurate, even though they dated from long, long ago. Thischamber was also believed to have great treasures and strange items, including“arms [swords, knives, etc.] which would not rust” and “glass which can be bentbut does not break.”7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber261] Of course, even a clearplastic water bottle from today’s world would be seen by someone in Al-Mamoun’stime as being made of bendable “glass,” but this could also be a legend ofsomething far more impressive. In November 2017, a new and previouslyundiscovered chamber was found with the use of muon particles, massive quantumparticles that are similar to electrons and can penetrate through rock to revealinconsistencies—such as an empty chamber. Researchers discovered athirty-meter-long hidden chamber above the Grand Gallery that is quite largeenough to be a treasure room, and the results were published in the prestigiousNature science journal.8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber262]Al-Mamoun brought a huge team of engineers, stonemasons, architects, andbuilders to the pyramid in 820 AD to search for the glorious treasure room. Theywere unable to find the allegedly secret entrance, so they smashed their way inwith brute force. This was done by lighting fires on the stones, then throwingcold vinegar on them until they cracked.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber263] Theybored in over 100 feet without finding anything but solid rock. In totalfrustration, they were just about ready to give up when a worker heard somethingheavy fall inside the pyramid—to the east of where they were tunneling. Theyeventually hacked their way into a narrow, claustrophobic Descending Passage,which is about 350 feet long, slicing its way directly through the solid bedrockafter about the first quarter of the way down. The Descending Passage is carvedout with such astonishing precision that it never deviates by more than aquarter of an inch from left to right, and a tenth of an inch from top tobottom! The only way we could even hope to duplicate this feat with moderntechnology is by the use of our very best laser-controlled drillingtechniques.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber264]This is a very important point, for this fact can be easily discovered with aminimum amount of research, but no one has any idea how it could have been done.And remember that if it could be done underneath the pyramid, boring directlythrough solid rock, the technology existed for it to be replicated elsewhere—asthe Cayce Readings and other sources have asserted regarding the so-called Hallof Records that Ra-Ptah and his associates left for us to rediscover. The Hallof Records is expected to be an amazing treasure room filled with some of thebest Atlantean technology there is to offer. This appears to include holographicprojectors that will reveal our true history, including the fact that Earthhumans are descended from multiple different extraterrestrial human races thatemigrated here.Al-Mamoun’s men soon discovered that the loud sound they heard was a squarestone that had fallen from the ceiling of the Descending Passage. This stonerevealed the existence of granite behind it, rather than limestone. This wasvery mysterious, and eventually proved to be the location of the AscendingPassage that they then smashed their way through in their hunt for treasure. Atthis point, they continued heading down to the bottom of the dark, stuffypassage and found what is now called the Subterranean Chamber. This is a roomwith a perfectly flat ceiling, but the floor appears unfinished—covered with avariety of smooth, irregularly curving bumps, much like the frothing surface ofan angry sea. An ominous Pit appears in this room that you could easily fallinto, and in the Pyramid Timeline, the Pit may well begin as of 2001—preciselymarking the time of 9/11, and also reaching “rock bottom” in the exact timeframe of the 2008 economic collapse, as we will see. The Pyramid Timeline givesus two possible choices as to what this date could be, and 2001 is one of them.World Wars I and II are both clearly marked in the Timeline as we head towardthe Pit.Torch marks on the ceiling of the Subterranean Chamber convinced them someonehad been there before, and must have taken out anything interesting in the room.They then headed back up the tunnel, trying not to breathe too much since theirtorches were consuming much of the oxygen, and studied the ceiling where thestone had fallen. They realized the red-and-black-granite square in the wallmight be the end of a stone plug. This suggested another passageway might bebehind it, and that it had been deliberately blocked off.11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber265] The granite was too hard to break, so they hadto tunnel around it. This proved to be a great deal of work, as they found twomore huge blocks after the first one. They next encountered an additional seriesof limestone plugs that they were able to smash out with chisels, bit by bit.12[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber266]Soon after they passed the last of the limestone plugs, the height of theAscending Passage suddenly rose considerably—to more than twenty-three feet, at286.1 Egyptian inches. This was the beginning of the Grand Gallery, a longhallway that continued sloping upward at the same angle as the AscendingPassage. In the Pyramid Timeline, the exact moment in our history where theceiling rises this dramatically happens to correspond with the arrival of Jesus.In fact, the exact thirty-three-year period of time between his birth and hisultimate Ascension is very neatly recorded in a triangular area within themeasurements of the passage, as Lemesurier’s book reveals. This was exciting topyramid researchers who were open to Christianity, and provided an equal degreeof controversy and scorn for those who did not want to see the Great Pyramid asa “Bible in Stone.”The walls of the Grand Gallery had seven horizontal layers that tapered inwardas they reached the ceiling. Each layer was narrower than the one below it,creating a curious, ratcheting-inward pattern as it went up—like an extra-steepversion of a Mayan step-pyramid, only flipped inside out. As we will see, byinferring this meaning from the Law of One series, this structure seems tosymbolically indicate that Jesus had activated all seven chakras as part of theAscension process.Once you reach this point inside the pyramid, you have two choices—you can gostraight, or climb up a vertical wall. The easier path involves crouching downand walking straight ahead through another narrow passageway that leads you intoa small room—which came to be called the Queen’s Chamber. Peter Lemesurier andother researchers interpreted this chamber as symbolically representing the pathof traditional religion. The Queen’s Chamber featured a fifteen-foot-tall carvedniche inside the wall on the left, which cut in deep enough for a person tostand in. The niche also had seven steplike layers—just like the Grand Gallery.This again seems to show the potential for someone to reach Ascension throughconventional religion, if they stay true to the core teachings of service toothers that it espouses. There are a variety of legends of levitating Christiansaints, as one example. Al-Mamoun’s men tunneled into this recessed area, hopingto find another passageway, but found nothing. In terms of the Pyramid Timeline,authors like Lemesurier are not exactly sure how to interpret the Queen’sChamber. The Descending Passage encodes by far the greatest number of specificdates, as we will see, but the Ascending Passage has all of the crown-jewelprophecies regarding the end of our 25,000-year cycle and the anticipatedresults.THE PATH TO ASCENSIONAlternatively, if you are standing at the beginning of the Grand Gallery and donot choose to head into the Queen’s Chamber, you can instead climb up a perilousseries of square holes on either the left or the right wall. Now you will find aladder in this location for tourists. After several feet of climbing, this willbring you up to the steeply ascending main floor of the Grand Gallery. Then youwill see the impressive seven-layered walls tapering up to a high ceiling aboveyou. According to the Pyramid Timeline researchers, this room symbolizes thepath of Ascension—where you are going through the initiation that activatesdormant psychic abilities within you. I learned about these symbolic meanings in1993, and they soon became very frequent elements in my dreams.If you climbed all the way up the Grand Gallery, which was a good distance, youwould come to a sudden, three-foot-tall stone wall called the Great Step. Youwould have to perilously pull yourself up and over this vertical wall to keepgoing. If you read Lemesurier’s book, the exact year that we hit the Great Step,based upon the original pole-star and Pleiades alignment of 2141 BC, is the year1845. This appears to represent a sudden wall that we hit, as a planet, which wethen have to climb up and over in order to continue moving forward. One couldalso say it represents a sudden, vertical increase in our progress. As peoplehiking up through the pyramid, we have to risk serious, if not fatal bodilyinjury to pull ourselves up and over the Great Step. Once we do it successfully,we enter into the most visually stunning part of the pyramid’s inner passages.What exactly happens in 1845 that could match such a massive vertical leapdepicted within the Pyramid? One very significant historical point to consideris the invention of the telegraph. This was the first time humanity everattained instantaneous communication at a distance. Symbolically, this may beseen as a precursor to a time where we are all able to regain the ability to dothis telepathically, which is one key element of how we will change in fourthdensity, according to the Law of One series. So much of our modern technologicalage centers around instantaneous, worldwide communication, such as with theInternet—and indeed, it all began in 1845.Samuel Morse didn’t obtain government support for his groundbreaking newinvention until 1843, and he then built a smaller-scale telegraph system betweenWashington, DC, and Baltimore, Maryland, along a railroad line. However, thefirst long-distance telegraph message wasn’t transmitted along this line untilMay 24, 1844,13 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber267] between Samuel Morse and hisassociate Alfred Vail. The message, tapped out in the simple code Morse devised,was “What hath God wrought!”14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber268] Why not havethe Great Step start in 1844, then? Here’s the key: the first commercialtelegraph line, where ordinary people could actually communicate for business orpersonal reasons, began along this same Washington-Baltimore corridor as ofApril 1, 1845—exactly where we reach the Great Step in the Timeline! Both theMagnetic Telegraph Company in the United States and the Electrical TelegraphCompany in Britain were formed as of May 1845, and the first public codes fortelegraph were introduced this year as well.15 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber269]Even the Internet could be traced back to the telegraph as the first majorbreakthrough of its kind, and the Internet again could be a foreshadowing of thefourth-density Earth, where we apparently will have instantaneous access to allknowledge and information in the universe just by thought. This access to ourcollective body of human information gives us the ability to liberate ourselvesfrom fear and ignorance, which is a very important aspect of our own spiritualawakening.Given the significance of the Great Step, we appear to be invited to considerother historical events in addition to the invention of the telegraph, and we doindeed find them. Some of these events center on United States history, but theyseem to reflect the overall movement toward a more unified world—thanks toadvances in technology bringing all of us closer together. At the same time, theconsolidation of the United States as a technologically superior nation wouldpave the way for much human suffering as well. The duality of these changes canbe seen very nicely in the historical events that occur in 1845.The United States Congress authorized contracts for overseas mail delivery toforeign countries as of March 3, 1845,16 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber270] thusallowing the US to become a truly international society. This form ofcommunication again mirrors the invention of the telegraph in terms of bringingus together as a planet. Macon B. Allen was the first black lawyer to beadmitted to the bar in America as of May 3, 1845,17[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber271] which was a major step forward in civilrights. The first issue of Scientific American magazine was published on August28, 1845, helping to advance our collective understanding and make advanced,cutting-edge knowledge available to everyday people without needing to access auniversity.18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber272]Charles Darwin published his first investigations of the Galapagos Islands in1845, which was the precursor to his theory of evolution in 1859.19[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber273] Darwin’s detailed observations of theGalapagos were only one section of a major journal he published in 1845,regarding his worldwide sailing trip on the HMS Beagle.20[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber274] Though I have argued in The Source FieldInvestigations that the theory of evolution appears to have flaws, as theprocess is not strictly random but has an intelligent design behind it, Darwin’stheory still represented a substantial leap forward in human scientificunderstanding. We finally gained the idea that life moves forward in aprogression, transforming from one species to another over time. The end of the25,000-year cycle, or Great Year, appears to represent yet another importantevolutionary transformation in what it means to be human. Darwin’s theory in1845 paved the way for us to imagine ourselves evolving into something far moreadvanced than we are now.Additionally, in September 1845 a fungus brought over on ships from NorthAmerica began frighteningly wiping out all the potato crops in Ireland. Thiscaused the Great Potato Famine, since many Irish people relied almost entirelyon the potato for survival.21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber275] This soon led tonearly a million Irish emigrating to the United States alone.22[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber276] Many others traveled to the developing landsof Canada and Australia. According to the BBC, although this famine appeared tobe a tragedy, history could have turned out very differently if it had nothappened: “These dispossessed Irish played a major part in shaping the greatdemocracies of the 20th Century, and helped ensure that America joined World WarI on the side of Britain rather than Germany.”23[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber277]Incidentally, the Mormons began migrating from the East to Utah in 1845.24[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber278] The first nationally observed, uniformelection day in the United States was on November 4, 1845,25[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber279] again bringing America together as a unifiednation. And on December 2, 1845, President James K. Polk officially put forwardthe controversial idea of Manifest Destiny to Congress—namely that the US shouldaggressively expand into the West, believing it to be part of a greater DivinePlan.26 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber280] This perfectly encapsulates theduality of our modern world. On the one hand, this westward expansion allowedthe United States to eventually become the main scientific and industrial engineof society for many years. On the other hand, it also created a great toll ofhuman suffering, in the name of religion and the apparent “Will of God.”Given all the above, 1845 was obviously a key turning point in modern history,with multiple reasons why it was an excellent year to have chosen for such amajor symbolic milestone. We have the commercial debut of the telegraph, theconsolidation of America as an international entity, the beginning of somesignificant world migrations, and the publication of the precursor to the theoryof Evolution. In the Pyramid Timeline, 1845 does represent a sudden change. Itis a painful process, but it paves the way for many other events yet to come.According to Lemesurier, the next significant date pops out if we continuemeasuring the slope underneath the Great Step by one inch equals one year, whilewe still follow the underlying slope angle of the Grand Gallery. In this case,we hit the stone wall on the opposite side as of June 22, 1914—the SummerSolstice. This is the beginning of World War I, and we will see that this datealso appears precisely in the Descending Passage, where more difficult eventsare apt to be portrayed. Since this same date shows up again in the AscendingPassage, it clearly indicates that 1914 is another year of very significantduality, with both negative and positive events occurring.We are now heading directly into the most interesting and beautiful part of theTimeline—the full spiritual awakening into a Golden Age, rather than remainingin doom, gloom, and destruction. Einstein’s general relativity theory appearedsoon after this date in 1916, potentially giving us one of our biggest clues tothe science we needed for the Golden Age. Medical, technological, and scientificadvances abounded in the time window of 1914 and thereafter. Furthermore, WorldWar I was deemed “the war to end all wars.” Disasters of this scale eventuallyawaken us from the “dream of hell,” where we no longer feel the need to attackand kill each other over petty religious and political differences. World War IIwas the last major war of its kind, but the great lesson was originally conveyedbeginning in 1914. It is only through seeing war, chaos, and destruction on thisscale that we finally awaken in the dream and realize that we no longer need tolash out at one another with hatred, fear, and violence.The Great Step area also proves to be one of the most challenging andcontentious parts of the Pyramid Timeline, since Lemesurier believed that thetime scale of “one inch equals one year” needed to be changed at this point,causing one inch to last multiple years. However, Lemesurier’s own words revealthat if we do not apply this conversion and keep it at the normal scale, theyear 2012 is flagged as being of key importance. Lemesurier apparently never sawhow beautifully this aligned with the end date of the Mayan Calendar.Again, 2012 was the mathematical end date of the 25,000-year cycle, but itappears that we have been granted a bit of an extension for the finalshift-point, because we were simply not ready yet as a planet for the fullweight of prophesied events to occur as of 2012. This message was communicatedto me through a variety of different means, including my own dreams andreadings, as well as the visionary experiences of Corey Goode. So many eventshappen so quickly in the timeline after you pass the Great Step, if you’reallowing one inch to be one year, that Lemesurier felt the need to dramaticallyslow down the speed of time’s passage. He couldn’t understand how such anintense cluster of Ascension-type events could happen in such a narrow timeframe. This is the exact time frame we now find ourselves within.Once you make it up and over the Great Step, after only a few more feet, youhave to crouch down to enter the Antechamber, whose floor and ceiling are madeof granite, not limestone. Some of the blocks in this and the following chamberwere estimated to weigh as much as fifty tons. It was later discovered that thisgranite had been transported all the way from a quarry in Aswan, some sixhundred miles away.27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber281] No one has provided asatisfactory explanation of how these stones could have been transported oversuch a long distance, and more important, why these particular stones would bechosen rather than many others that would have been much, much closer and easierto get. If we accept Ra’s explanation in the Law of One series that the GreatPyramid was constructed with thought, and only appears to have been built byhumans, it may very well be that they needed granite from six hundred miles awayto get the proper resonant qualities for the technology to work as theyintended.It is also very interesting that if you draw a sphere into the Antechamber,where the front of the sphere touches the front of the stone making the chamber,the back of the sphere touches the back of the chamber, and the bottom of thesphere touches the floor, that sphere is 365.242 Pyramid Inches incircumference. This is the exact number of days in a year, down to thedecimal-point level of accuracy. The entire Antechamber therefore symbolizes theEarth, on a smaller scale than the exterior of the Great Pyramid itself. Thesphere’s outside circumference adds up to exactly one Earth year in PyramidInches. This allows us to safely assume that the events occurring in theAntechamber are predicted to affect the entire Earth—in a very significant way.It also strongly suggests that we should not drop the timing convention of “onePyramid Inch equals one year,” as Lemesurier chose to do.The left and right walls of the Antechamber feature a series of four verticalgrooves running from floor to ceiling, as if intended to hold four large blocksof stone in place. Each of these hypothetical stone blocks could be lowered downto prevent you from moving forward—or potentially from moving backward as well,if they were dropped in place behind you. In dreamlike symbolic terms, thisclearly seems to indicate that these are massive “points of no return” forhumanity. The first of these four sockets did have a large, rectangular slab ofgranite wedged into it, which you would again have to crouch under to continuemoving forward. I did this myself when I took a tour of the Great Pyramid with agroup, and I made sure to stand up in that crevice and get a good look at theGranite Slab and the symbol that raises off of it, which Pyramid researcherscall the Boss or the Seal.The top of the block was curiously rough, as if it had been broken off from alarger piece of stone and was never fully finished off. Lemesurier interpretsthis as a sign that whatever massive spiritual force impacts the Earth at thistime is coming in from the heavens, since the stone appears to have been brokenoff from some higher place and then appeared in our reality. The first part ofthe slab that sticks out is the small symbol called the Boss or the Seal, as wewill explore in just a minute, and then an inch later, the timeline reaches themuch larger mass of the slab’s surface. This means that the main body of theslab appears in the timeline as of the year 2013. On June 6, 2013, the first ofmany Edward Snowden revelations about the NSA and mass surveillance entered intomass consciousness.28 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber282]This was most definitely another “point of no return” for humanity, which neatlyaligned with prophecies of a mass awakening after the year 2012. Up until the“Global Surveillance Disclosures” of Snowden in June 2013, we were living in acollective state of ignorance. Anyone who spoke about global surveillance wasdeemed a “conspiracy theorist,” and this very massive aspect of modern life onEarth was ignored and denied. The Law of One series explains that as we headinto a fourth-density Earth, all thoughts are known to all people, and there areno secrets. Therefore, just six months after the Mayan Calendar end date ofDecember 21, 2012, we became far more aware of this principle of the “glassceiling,” where all our thoughts are interconnected on a collective level. Thisis another direct stepping-stone to Ascension. Everyone thinks differently nowthat they realize their thoughts and activities online are essentially public.It is also very important to point out that the slab is not perfectly flat, leftto right. It has a very distinctive wave shape embedded in it. If we do nottamper with the one-inch-equals-one-year measurement system, the Boss at thefront of the stone slab appears at the all-important Mayan Calendar end date of2012. On page 109 of Great Pyramid Decoded, Lemesurier said, “It might still beargued that the scale of 1” per year should apply throughout the King’s ChamberPassage. . . . [The] application of such a thesis would date the first Messianicadvent at A.D. 2012, the second at 2030, the third at 2057, and the fourth at2084. But in this case it seems fairly obvious that the dates are too closetogether to make sense.”29 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber283] Here I respectfullydisagree. The date of 2030 has been popping up in my own dreams as well as CoreyGoode’s visions as the exact time for when we can expect the first of a seriesof “solar flashes” to occur. The year 2030 is the exact date when we hit thespace that would hold the second slab. It is possible that the other dates, 2057and 2084, will represent additional solar-flash moments that various sourceshave told us to expect. The wave-like shape of the visible slab in the first setof grooves could symbolize the wave of hyperdimensional energy that is coming inas we move through this epic transition into what the Law of One series refersto as “fourth density.”As I saw for myself when I toured the Great Pyramid, there is just enough roombetween the inside front wall of the Antechamber and this slab of granite tostand up in the crack, and inspect the front of the slab. There you find afive-inch-wide, three-inch-tall, stylized half circle that rises up from thesurrounding stone by one inch, again called the Boss. The symbol features ahorizontal line at the bottom, with a half circle that rises above it and isconnected to it. This shape neatly resembles a sunrise or a rainbow, and it alsolooks like the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for a loaf of bread. The entiregranite slab also approximately resembles the shape of a slice of bread, and thefour grooves have symbolic similarity to a four-slice toaster oven.This again has a variety of biblical connections, and it is the only small-sizevisual symbol in the entire pyramid. Bread is a symbol of spiritual “food” beingbrought to the Earth in a form we can directly consume and digest, hence its usein communion ceremonies and the like. In the book of John, chapter 6, we havewhat may be the most dramatic and public miracle of Jesus, where he apparentlyfed five thousand people by duplicating a single loaf of bread and a single fishinto multiple copies through some sort of telekinetic manifestation process.This event occurs in John 6:11. The next day, Jesus took the opportunity tospeak to the people with a variety of parables regarding bread. This includedhis claim to being an embodiment of the Logos in John 6:35, where he said, “I amthe bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he thatbelieveth on me shall never thirst.”30 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber284] Then inJohn 6:51, he said, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if anyman eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give ismy flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”31[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber285]These references to bread are obviously dreamlike metaphors rather than beingliteral statements of bread raining down from the heavens and causingimmortality once you eat it. The bread represents a spiritual type of food thatsustains the soul rather than a physically edible substance. In Session 73,Question 13, of the Law of One series, the source explained why Jesus usedparables: “You may have read some of this entity’s workings. It offered itselfas teacher to those mind/body/spirit complexes which gathered to hear, and eventhen spoke as through a veil so as to leave room for those not wishing to hear.When this entity was asked to heal, it oft times did so, always ending theworking with two admonitions: first, that the entity healed had been healed byits faith, that is, its ability to allow and accept changes through the violetray into the gateway of intelligent energy; second, saying always, “Tell noone.” These are the workings which attempt a maximal quality of free will whilemaintaining fidelity to the positive purity of the working.”32[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber286]The Snowden revelations of 2013 certainly could be categorized as a type ofspiritual “bread,” since the revelation of global surveillance greatlyaccelerated our mass awakening. It is also humorous to point out that theconstruction base we use to prototype new computer electronic circuits is calleda breadboard.33 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber287] Additionally, the Boss isstylized to look like the rainbow that might arrive after a prolonged ordeal ofstorm clouds. The rainbow represents that burst of color that lets us all knowthere is something divine and mystical and magical in our lives. It is thebreakthrough of a higher reality that we can so often forget about, and it is athing of beauty, nonthreatening, that everyone loves to see. The rainbow istherefore a very fitting metaphor of Ascension.The Boss also represents the new sunrise—the promise of a Golden Age finallymade manifest and visible. The sunrise is the beginning of a new cycle onEarth—the time that the long, dark night turns into the bright new day.Symbolically it is very appropriate to associate this sunrise symbol with theend of our 25,920-year precession cycle as well. Lemesurier has a detaileddiscussion of all this that begins on page 107 of Great Pyramid Decoded. Heexplains that the Granite Leaf is the only part of the entire Great Pyramid thatsimultaneously encodes the three different measurement systems of the PyramidInch, Sacred Cubit, and Royal Cubit that he discusses. Therefore, we can safelysee it as the “Rosetta stone” of the Pyramid. If you focus your attention juston this stone, and study its measurements, you can unlock all the othermysteries hidden within the Pyramid; it is the key geometric event. This alsoimplies that it represents the key symbolic event as well, linking theperfection and Ascension of each human being with the perfection of the Earth.With the position of the Boss precisely corresponding to the year 2012 in thePyramid Timeline, it suggests the harbinger of a solar event that also activatesall seven “rays,” or densities, in Law of One terms. This is precisely what theLaw of One tells us will happen in the “quantum leap” they anticipate will occurin our future.The Law of One calibrated the timing of the fourth-density shift as sometimeapproximately thirty years after 1981 in Session 6, Questions 16, 17, and 18.34[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber288] Specifically, it said, “This [Earth] sphere isat this time in fourth-dimension vibration. Its material is quite confused dueto the society memory complexes embedded in its consciousness. It has not madean easy transition to the vibrations which beckon. Therefore, it will be fetchedwith some inconvenience. . . . This inconvenience, or disharmonious vibratorycomplex, has begun several of your years in the past. It shall continue unabatedfor a period of approximately three oh, thirty [30], of your years.” Dr. Elkinsthen asked if the Earth would be a fourth-density planet after this thirty-yeartime period, and the source answered, “This is so.”35[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber289] These passages were spoken in 1981, and whenyou add on thirty years, you get 2011. Dr. Elkins then asked if the harvestwould occur in the year 2011 in Session 17, Question 29, or whether it would bespread out over a longer period of time. The answer was, “This [year 2011] is anapproximation. We have stated we have difficulty with your time/space. This isan appropriate probable/possible time/space nexus for harvest. Those who are notin incarnation at this time will be included in the harvest.”36[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber290] These passages were one key reason why I wasso excited about the 2012 Mayan calendar end date in the years leading up to itsarrival. Then once I started hearing about the year 2030 for the solar flashfrom my own dreams as well as Corey Goode’s visionary experiences, I found thatthis date was also in the Pyramid Timeline as well, appearing as the date thatthe grooves to hold the second slab appear. Clearly the Law of One indicatedthat the “harvest” process does not occur all at once—it begins with thiscollective awakening before we get to the final stage where the multidimensionalactivation takes place.Again, 2011 was only one year away from 2012, and the shift event itself hasapparently since been moved forward in order to give us more time. This was akey aspect of what Corey Goode’s contacts revealed to us beginning in 2015. Iremember being greatly concerned in the run-up to December 21, 2012, that thechanges I was expecting to see in our society, based on the Law of One materialas well as my own dreams and intuitive readings, simply had not come to pass.Now at the time of this book being written, these changes are far more obvious.We will discuss more of these prophecies in later chapters.After you move through the Antechamber, with its four grooves ending as of 2084,you head directly into the King’s Chamber, which features an open sarcophagus.Pyramidologists invariably see this as a representation of a time where wetranscend our mortal bodies, and the death that comes along with them, as a keypart of light-body activation. The sarcophagus is loose, and can be moved aroundthe room, so any attempt to pin it down to a particular moment in time seemsbeside the point. Such a mystical event may happen at different times fordifferent people, and so attempting to define specific prophetic dates at thispoint may be unnecessary.However, let’s not forget that the Antechamber presents a spherical shape with acircumference of 365.242 Pyramid Inches, symbolically indicating the Earth. Oncewe reach the floor of the King’s Chamber, we see twenty different stones thatencode various dimensions of the planets, all the way through toSaturn—according to the work of Bernard Pietsch. This, of course, is a verysubstantial change, and suggests that humanity becomes a truly interplanetary,space-faring culture—which may be a return to our true history.Furthermore, in the 1940s, Professor F. J. Dick found that the shape of theKing’s Chamber secretly encodes a twenty-sided geometry known as theicosahedron, where each side is a perfect equilateral triangle, and the overallshape resembles a soccer ball. I was very excited when I first learned aboutthis, as these geometries show up at every level of the universe in the newscientific model that the Law of One series inspired me to pursue. We see anouter icosahedron as well as an inner one that can be drawn from the exact sizeand shape of the King’s Chamber. According to Matila Ghyka in The Geometry ofArt and Life, when you draw these hidden shapes into the King’s Chamber onpaper, you get an unexpected surprise: They line up with “the ‘symmetry’ . . .of the ideal or average . . . human body and face.” To see this connection, youneed to use Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, or another diagram like it, torepresent the body. The smaller icosahedron captures the navel, the mouth, theedges of the limbs, and the height of the face—whereas the larger icosahedroncaptures the face in more detail, including the horizontal line you can drawbetween the two eyes, the tip of the nose, and the location of the mouth.37[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber291] These proportions are not coincidentaleither—they suggest there is a deep, hidden truth about biological life we havenot yet recovered in modern times. This is precisely what we hear in the Law ofOne series, and is one of many arguments that I was later able to validatescientifically. The icosahedron also appears in the arrangement of vortex pointson the Earth—one of which the Great Pyramid was built directly upon—as well asin the spacing of the planets. The science behind all this was thoroughlydiscussed in my first book, The Source Field Investigations. Thus, these twogeometries together suggest, again, that the human form will be energeticallytransfigured in some remarkable way, since this geometry has the power to portus through space and time itself, such as with the Bermuda Triangle.Lastly, in the King’s Chamber we also encounter airshafts that again are reallystar-shafts, pointing us into a whole new cosmic direction: the south shaftpoints directly at the star Al Nitak, or Zeta Orionis, and the north shaftpoints at Alpha Draconis, which again used to be the pole star—the anchor—in thethird millennium BC. Lemesurier also points out that the entrance to thestar-shaft on the far side of the King’s Chamber has a curious and undeniableresemblance to a pregnant mother’s stomach. This again symbolizes a new birthfor humanity that is taking place at this time as our Ascended light bodiesactivate. So, we see a progression from events happening on Earth, in theAntechamber, to events affecting the entire Solar System, in the King’s Chamber,to events bringing us outside the solar system through the star-shafts. Ofcourse, no one knows for sure what these alleged prophecies really mean, but itis certainly interesting to speculate, and the Law of One series certainly givesus many clues. It may be that Earth humanity becomes a galactic species as aresult of the changes that are predicted to occur. This is directly implied inthe Law of One series. Once we become fourth density, we quickly regain contactwith the greater community of intelligent life that surrounds us.Getting back to the original discovery of the King’s Chamber, Al-Mamoun’s menworked very hard to find the precious ancient treasure, but the giant, lidlesscoffin didn’t even offer up a mummy. The tired, broken men went into a rage,ripping up part of the floor and hacking at the immaculately sculpted granitewalls. Nowadays the guard won’t even let you hum in there or stay near thesarcophagus for very long during normal hours, as I discovered from personalexperience.DISCOVERIES OF THE REMAINING PASSAGESFor hundreds of years after Al-Mamoun’s time, no new discoveries were made andthe glorious casing stones remained pristine and undamaged. Lieutenant ColonelHoward-Vyse was definitely not the first to carefully scrutinize and explore theGreat Pyramid in recent times. Nearly three hundred years after the destructionof the casing stones, in 1638, the thirty-six-year-old Oxford-trainedmathematician and astronomer John Greaves visited the pyramid on a sponsorshipfrom the Archbishop of Canterbury. He believed, just as Al-Mamoun had eightcenturies before, that the pyramid preserved the exact dimensions of ourplanet—which at this point no one knew.38 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber292]Greaves had already been to Italy and measured ancient buildings to determinewhat measuring unit the Romans were using—and he concluded it was similar to aBritish foot, only twenty-eight thousandths shorter.39[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber293] He had assumed the pyramid might use similarmeasurements. When Greaves first entered the pyramid, he could not access theDescending Passage because Al-Mamoun’s men had left behind a significant amountof debris from smashing through the limestone plugs in the Ascending Passage.40[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber294]Greaves was the first to discover that there was a third way you could go onceyou reached the Grand Gallery. One of the stones on the floor against the wallon the right was loose, and when you moved it away, you exposed the Well-Shaft—apassageway that went straight down, starting out as a nice and symmetricalshaft, but then quickly appearing to have been smashed through the masonry ofthe Pyramid with brute force. As we will see, in the Pyramid Timeline thisrepresents the vertical path we can make toward Ascension as we dig ourselvesout of the dark pit of materialism in the Descending Passage. Greaves tried tolower himself through the Well-Shaft on a rope, but there was an incrediblenumber of bats in there. The smell was so oppressive, and the passageway so darkand tight, that he just couldn’t make it all the way down. Other intrepidexplorers completed the journey later on.About a third of the way down the Well-Shaft was a curiously irregular-shapedroom that allowed you to rest for a minute; it came to be called the Grotto. Itwas all built of smooth, flowing curves—no straight lines at all. This suggestedthat the entire passageway was likely intended to be built this way for symbolicreasons, the Pyramid Timeline researchers concluded. The rough, jaggedWell-Shaft passageway then continued on down from there, finally feeding intothe Descending Passage—some 23.8 feet before it reached the entrance to theSubterranean Chamber.41 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber295]Strangely, the Well-Shaft’s entrance was not visible in the DescendingPassage—it blended right into the stone wall, and appeared never to have beenbroken or disturbed until it was first discovered. If there was a secret way toopen the portal without breaking it, like a hidden door, no one had found it. Aswe will see, this also has symbolic meaning, for once you go through your “darknight of the soul,” you start looking much harder for a way out and will tryjust about anything to turn your life around. Anyone trying to access the King’sor Queen’s Chamber in ancient times would have had to crawl up through thisWell-Shaft to get there, since there were granite and limestone plugs in theAscending Passage that stopped you from moving through it. The hidden doortherefore was likely used by the Egyptian priesthood to access the King’sChamber and hide secrets from people who were not initiates. The granite plugsin the Ascending Passage had been tapered in such a way that they must have beenbuilt into the pyramid from the beginning. They could not have been insertedafterward, as they were wider on the far side and fit the Ascending Passage verysnugly.Greaves also estimated that the outside of the pyramid had 207 differentlevels.42 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber296] He was soon followed by Tito LivioBurattini, who took careful measurements for four years with the sameinstruments Greaves used, and sent the results to his sponsor, Jesuit FatherAthanasius Kirchner. Burattini was robbed by bandits on the way home and lostall his notes on the pyramid along with all his money, but, thankfully, theresults he sent to Kirchner survived.Nathaniel Davison, who later became British consul general in Algeria, madeadditional significant discoveries in 1765.43 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber297]Davison discovered the first of a series of “relieving chambers” stacked abovethe King’s Chamber. This was a narrow room you could barely even squeeze into,but which encompassed the entire perimeter of the King’s Chamber beneath it.Davison believed it was built to relieve the pressure on the King’s Chamber fromthe surrounding weight of stones.44 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber298] LieutenantColonel Howard-Vyse, again beginning in 1836, eventually discovered additionalrelieving chambers above Davison’s first. The relieving chambers do notnecessarily mean anything in the Pyramid Timeline, but they do appear to helpharness and concentrate energy within the pyramid. The idea of pyramidsharnessing an energy unknown to Western scientists is another discussion Ithoroughly cover in The Source Field Investigations.Howard-Vyse was running out of money, his workers’ morale was very low, and thepressure was on, as he hadn’t found anything terribly new or noteworthy. Therewas a major push to associate the Great Pyramid with the pharaoh Cheops. Thoughup until this point, no written inscriptions had ever been found inside theGreat Pyramid, Howard-Vyse fortuitously “discovered” roughly painted redhieroglyphics in these relieving chambers, which appeared to say the Pyramid hadindeed been built by Cheops. Howard-Vyse called them “quarry marks,” as if theoriginal builders needed to scribble graffiti on the stones for buildinginstructions while otherwise accomplishing such flawless perfection. Thesescrawls of red paint happened to be at just the right angle for Howard-Vyse tohave painted them from the direction he got into the chambers. According toZecharia Sitchin, the quarry marks had mistakes that were consistent with thedefinitive book on Egyptian hieroglyphics that Howard-Vyse was using at thetime, by E. A. Wallis-Budge.45 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber299] Skeptics havesince attacked Sitchin’s data, some believe conclusively—perhaps in a desperatebid to prevent the demise of orthodox Egyptology’s dating of the GreatPyramid.46 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber300] To me, Sitchin’s data is extremelyconvincing, and conventional scholars simply do not want to let go of theirprized belief systems.EARTH PROPORTIONS IN PYRAMID MEASUREMENTSSir Isaac Newton had heard of ancient legends suggesting the Great Pyramid’smeasurements revealed the exact proportions of the Earth. It is entirelypossible that this information came to him through secret societies that werewidely popular in his time. Newton was very interested in this idea, as withoutan exact measurement of the Earth’s circumference, he wouldn’t have the rightinformation to properly create his new theory of gravitation. All Newton had togo on was Eratosthenes’s measurements from Greek times, which did not fit histheory accurately enough.After studying the best-available pyramid measurements very closely, Newtonconcluded the Great Pyramid had been built using two different measuringlengths, which he called cubits, honoring the old traditions—and he dubbed themthe “profane” cubit and the “sacred” cubit.47 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber301]Newton believed the King’s Chamber was based on a profane cubit of 20.63 Britishinches, which would then make it exactly 20 by 10 cubits in size. This measuringunit is what researchers like Lemesurier call the Royal Cubit. The longer, morearcane sacred cubit he found elsewhere was about 25 British inches in length.One twenty-fifth of this distance was naturally very close to the British inch,and Newton felt this might also be significant. Again, let’s not forget that theGranite Slab in the Antechamber, encoding the 2012 and 2013 prophetic dates soprecisely, is a “Rosetta stone” that reveals the Royal Cubit, Sacred Cubit, andEgyptian Inch. Unfortunately for Newton, all the debris piled up around theoutside base of the pyramid made the earlier measurements incorrect, so he neverfound the precise figures for the Earth’s measurements that he was lookingfor.48 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber302] Newton eventually used Frenchastronomer Jean Picard’s measurements to formulate his theory of gravitation.49[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber303] And yes . . . it seems likely that Jean Picardwas the inspiration for the name of the captain in Star Trek: The NextGeneration."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYHISTORIC EVENTS ENCODED IN THE GREAT PYRAMIDAccording to Lemesurier in The Great Pyramid Decoded, perhaps:> the Pyramid’s designer wished to show that his predictions were “based” on a> cyclic view of history . . . derived from the precession of the> equinoxes. . . .

One of the most prominent cycles in which history isrepeating itself is the 2,160-year Age of the Zodiac, of which there are exactlytwelve in the “Great Year” or precession. This bizarre time-loop phenomenon mayhelp explain how the Pyramid Timeline could have such prophetic accuracy, as wewill explore in this chapter with far more detail. The idea that the pyramid’sinterior passageways contained a Prophecy in Stone was not openly explored untilRobert Menzies proposed it in 1865, but the Founding Fathers clearly appeared tobe aware that the Great Pyramid foretold a coming Golden Age. A lot of peopleare disturbed by this connection now, and invoke the dreaded Illuminati in anydiscussion about it—but I think it’s important to remain objective and considerthe available facts. We’ll discuss this more later on. For now, I’ll wrap up ourGreat Pyramid history lesson from the last chapter with the most recentinvestigations. Each of these pioneers made significant contributions—eitherwittingly or unwittingly—to the concept of a Pyramid Timeline.A TOP SKEPTIC PROVES HIMSELF WRONG WITH SCIENCEIn 1881, Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie published incredibly precise surveyingmeasurements he’d made in his epic book Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. He hadhoped to completely demolish the idea of a Pyramid Timeline with the facts,probably because his father was a devout Pyramidologist. The level of precisionPetrie used to make his measurements was so extreme that it bordered on theridiculous. Petrie was also innovative enough to walk around outside the GreatPyramid in nothing but his pink underwear, so he wouldn’t be bothered by drunk,disorderly Victorian tourists.5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber308] In today’ssociety I don’t think that would work—there would be images and video of him allover social media. To my own surprise, questionable sites like Wikipedia stillassert that Petrie proved there is “no scientific support” to the “allegednumerical coincidences” of the Great Pyramid6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber309]—even while they openly admit that the PyramidInch is precisely one five-hundred-millionth of the Earth’s diameter from poleto pole, a fact proven by Petrie’s own measurements. Of course, no mention ismade of the many engineering feats that are simply not possible to duplicatewith any technology available in our own time—like the stunningly perfectleveling of the base of the pyramid, which is never off by more than half aninch.Here’s the funny part: According to Peter Lemesurier:> Petrie . . . was blissfully unaware . . . that his own data actually validated> up to the very hilt the Pyramidologists’ earlier mathematical claims> concerning the Pyramid’s dimensions. . . .

Two years later, D. Davidsonand H. Aldersmith published their own influential work entitled The GreatPyramid: Its Divine Message. Dr. Adam Rutherford released his enormousfive-volume Pyramidology in 1957, and twenty years later, Peter Lemesurierpublished The Great Pyramid Decoded, having worked with Rutherford in detail.Lemesurier summarized and updated all these prior works, and continued revisinghis conclusions with the graphically rich Decoding the Great Pyramid, as well asGods of the Dawn in 1999. Lemesurier’s estate was very helpful when I approachedthem about the writing of this book. I thank them for their cooperation and lookforward to discussing the Pyramid Timeline in this and other works.The Pyramid Timeline is such a technical subject that it does take an entirebook to explain it in full detail. Although Lemesurier’s book is highlytechnical, it contains everything you need to know for an advanced study. Itdoes appear that the source of the Law of One series designed this propheticsystem with the Atlantean priest-king Ra-Ptah, “hiding the message in plainsight” so as to avoid violating the Law of Free Will. As explained in theprevious chapter, Piazzi Smyth’s star alignment gives us the year we begincounting from—now corrected to 2141 BC—and the Scored Lines, which appear aboutforty feet after the entrance into the Descending Passage, represent thelocation we use for the year 2141 BC within the masonry of the Great Pyramid.Then, we simply move through the passageways, counting one Pyramid Inch forevery year. The idea that a Pyramid Inch could indeed represent a year was wellestablished on the exterior, since we find the exact length of the precession ofthe equinoxes in the diagonals—for a total of 25,826.4 Pyramid Inches.If we accept that Ra built the Great Pyramid, this again flags the importance ofthe 25,000-year cycle they mention so repeatedly in the Law of One series. Bythe time I read the Law of One series, I already had been deeply studying GreatPyramid Decoded for two and a half years, and was working hard to understand theAscension prophecies encoded in the Pyramid Timeline. Lemesurier’s take on itwas admittedly Christian, in that he was expecting to see a physicalmanifestation of the Second Coming of Christ at the time symbolized by the Bossand Granite Leaf in the Antechamber. In his unique, recalibrated interpretationof the timeline, the first sign of the Messiah would appear in late 2034, with aphysical appearance by the autumn of 2039.8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber311] Byleaving the timescale at “one inch equals one year,” we instead have the datesof 2012 and 2013, and obviously no such Messianic appearance has occurred.The Law of One series did give their perspective on the interesting idea of apossible Messianic return in Session 17, Question 22: “I will attempt to sortout this question. It is difficult. This entity [Jesus] became aware that it wasnot an entity of itself, but operated as a messenger of the One Creator, whomthis entity saw as love. This entity was aware that this cycle was in its lastportion and spoke to the effect that those of its consciousness would return atthe harvest. The particular mind/body/spirit complex you call Jesus is, as whatyou would call an entity, not to return except as a member of the Confederationoccasionally speaking through a channel. However, there are others of theidentical congruency of consciousness that will welcome those to the fourthdensity. This is the meaning of the returning.”9[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber312]I picked up Decoded at the same bookstore, on the same day that I received mycopy of Richard C. Hoagland’s The Monuments of Mars. The Law of One materialmade the entire discussion of the Pyramid Timeline far more understandable, anddefinitely verified that the author of the Pyramid Timeline was able to “liveoutside of time” and see future events with stunning clarity.So, once we know the starting location and accept the basic premise that onePyramid Inch equals one year, we then look for any changes in direction, shape,stone composition, or measurements. We also want to check the level or course ofstone any given position corresponds to, when seen from the outside. The key isto study the potential symbolism of these changes, and then look at our ownhistory and see if anything noteworthy happened during these times. The resultsare very interesting, and again it heavily ties in with Christian concepts.Everything points back to a very clear and unambiguous Ascension prophecy. I dofind it truly tragic that none of my colleagues have ever even touched thePyramid Timeline information at the time of this writing, for it is so rich withdetail, complexity, and prophecy.DREAM ANALYSIS 101 RETURNSThink back to our chapter “Dream Analysis 101” (chapter 3), where I talked abouthow the direction you travel in a dream can have symbolic meanings. Let’s assumethat this symbolism is essentially a universal feature of the collectivesubconscious, and that in a society of dream interpreters, everyone woulddiscover this for themselves. The same exact logic applies within the GreatPyramid. If a passageway is heading down, the Pyramid Timeline researchers seethis as representing a decrease in the overall quality of life on Earth, andtherefore a greater amount of difficulty, strife, and challenge. Similarly, if apassageway heads upward, this could represent an improvement in our lives—aprogressive movement forward. It may still be difficult to climb, but we arecontinually making progress all along the way.Another important point Peter Lemesurier made is that the pyramid’s designer didapparently intend to have it tell a story. This story does seem to have all theessential elements of the Hero’s Journey, which the Law of One indicates is aGalactic template that all of us must go through in a series of individualarchetypes. When we look at the image of the Pyramid’s passages and chambersfrom a side view, where they all appear in a straight, vertical line, we seethat it creates a stylized stick-man figure inside the pyramid. The SubterraneanChamber looks like feet, the Grotto looks like male genitalia, the Queen’sChamber would be the heart, the King’s Chamber is the head, and the narrowrelieving chambers and A-shaped granite slabs above them form a kinglike crownfor the head to wear. Thus, the Pyramid Timeline is the story of the Hero—theLogos that all of us are in the process of awakening into embodying.To stay within the logic of the collective Hero’s Journey story apparently toldby the pyramid’s designer, we must begin by going through the DescendingPassage. There would be no visible sign of the Ascending Passage if you walkedinto the pyramid before Caliph Al-Mamoun smashed his way through it. The onlything you could see is the pathway going down. This seems to indicate how we allmust go through a phase of materialism and selfishness in the awakening process.As we go farther and farther down this passage in time, we head intomaterialism, world hunger, devastating wars, and Earth changes, which brings usto the global difficulties we are now facing. Although this journey isassociated with ever-increasing selfishness and materialism, our desire forgreater and greater worldly comforts fuels many advances in technology as well.It isn’t until the end of the 25,000-year cycle, or Great Year, that ourtechnology finally turns on us and reveals that it can potentially destroy theentire Earth. This shows us the dark side of all the progress we’ve made. WorldWar I, World War II, 9/11, and the “Great Recession” all appear very prominentlyin this sense.THE FIRST ENCODED HISTORIC EVENT IS THE EXODUSThe Pyramid Timeline shows us important historical events through changes in thestructure and measurements of a passageway as it goes along. Without gettinginto the exact mathematical codes for each measurement, which takes an entirebook to properly explain, this simple system of noting whatever changes occurduring the “one inch equals one year” scale at least allows us to understandwhat years are being flagged by the Pyramid Timeline. The first significantchange in the Descending Passage is the moment when we discover that the GranitePlug blocked off the Ascending Passage. In the timeline, this apparentlycorresponds to March 30, 1453 BC. According to Lemesurier, his mentor Dr. AdamRutherford cites an impressive body of evidence that this is the exact time whenMoses led the Exodus from Egypt.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber313] Also, as wediscover on page 51 of Decoded, the red rock of the granite plug we pass in thisarea is virtually identical with the stone we find on Mount Horeb. Mosesallegedly received the Ten Commandments on two blocks of stone taken from thissame mountain. So it appears that this granite was deliberately installed intothe pyramid in advance, to further reveal that the timeline would be referringto Moses in this area.This is a pivotal event in the history of Judaism, and therefore of Westernsociety as a whole. It also would have occurred in the future from when theGreat Pyramid is now believed to have been built—starting in 10,490 BC,according to both the Cayce Readings and Robert Bauval’s precession-encodedmeasurement. The idea that the Pyramid Timeline signaled such an importantJudeo-Christian event is offensive to pyramid researchers who do not want to seeany connection between the Great Pyramid and Christianity, but if you can remainopen-minded to this idea, it is highly interesting. Dr. Rutherford felt theExodus also provides a great deal of symbolism about our collective struggle toreach the purported Golden Age. Spiritual people are often forced to confrontthe elites of their day and form their own movement away from conventionalstructures in order to embrace freedom. Whether the Exodus story is literallytrue or not, the symbolic meaning of this legend is worth considering as thefirst significant part of the pyramid’s internal message—once we’ve spotted theexact length of the 25,000-year cycle on the outside of the pyramid, andinterpreted the Ascension symbolism of its yet-to-be finished capstone.In the Exodus, the Hebrew people in Egypt were fleeing a cruel and unjust worldwhere they were held as slaves. When the pharaoh would not let them leave thecountry, the angel of death killed all the firstborn Egyptian children, passingover the Hebrew households. The pharaoh was then convinced by this highlydisturbing event to allow the Hebrews to leave. The arrival of Moses representedan early manifestation of powerful spiritual forces on Earth, helping lead theway to freedom and liberation. None of these people ever thought they’d be ableto break the bonds of their cruel enslavement, but Moses spoke for all of themwhen he said, “Let my people go.”It is important to point out that the Law of One series does indicate that theYahweh that Moses was in contact with originated as a positive entity, but thenwas replaced by a negative entity masquerading as positive due to Moses’s owninability to avoid temptations from others. This was partly explained in Session16, Question 19: “The one called Moishe was open to impression and received theLaw of One in its most simple form. However, the information became negativelyoriented due to his people’s pressure to do specific physical things in thethird-density planes. This left the entity open for the type of information andphilosophy of a self-service nature.”11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber314]The trip taken by Moses and his supporters was not without difficulty. Theyseemed cornered when they reached the Red Sea, but Moses miraculously parted thewaters and continued to go forward. This is a perfect example of the Hero’sJourney story line, where an All Is Lost point is reached, but then a miraculousevent allows them to survive. Moses and his people spent forty years wanderingthrough the desert. This could symbolize how even those with a strong spiritualpath will still have to endure many hardships. However, there were blessings aswell, including edible food, or manna, that would appear in the mornings, aswell as water that spurted up from a rock. The symbolic lesson here could bethat even in the worst of times, the pilgrims were always taken care of bymysterious spiritual forces. Jordan Maxwell is one of a series of researcherswho now have concluded that the descriptions of manna are consistent withmushrooms, which these people may have been unfamiliar with until they requiredthem for basic survival.The Israelites did eventually reach the Promised Land, thus giving the story ahappy ending. The Golden Age prophecies suggest that everyone will experiencethe Ascension event and get where they need to go—whether that means they repeatthe cycle or graduate. Therefore, the story of the Exodus could represent a“hologram,” or a foreshadowing, of the greater message the pyramid is ultimatelyintended to convey for all of humanity. Either way, it is the very firsthistoric event we are alerted to after the start date of the timeline itself.THE NEXT ASCENSION TURNING POINT IS AD 1223Nothing else changes in the Descending Passage until AD 1223, where we reach thehidden entrance to the Well-Shaft. Again, the Well-Shaft appears to symbolizethe path we all must take when we begin having a spiritual awakening. Weliterally have to smash our way through the obstacles and difficulties in life,much like the idea of spending forty days in the desert, before we can reach aplace of stability, balance, and true happiness. Peter Lemesurier associates AD1223 with the teachings of Saint Francis of Assisi, who helped create theopportunity to reform Christian thought back to its original mystical core.Saint Francis wrote the guidelines that governed all monastic life thereafter,and these writings were officially confirmed by the Pope on November 29, 1223.12[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber315] The first Franciscan monastery was founded inEngland this same year.13 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber316] Saint Francis isalso documented as having created the first nativity scene on December 25,1223.14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber317] This fascinated the people, bringingthem closer to the story of Jesus’s birth, and triggered a renewed interest intheir spirituality. Now we have the first and second dates in the PyramidTimeline having direct Christian correlations.The following year, Saint Francis was the first to develop stigmata—the psychicmanifestation of wounds on his own body that mirrored those of Jesus.15[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber318] This is another very significant event inWestern history, perhaps representing the earliest manifestation, in a Christiansaint, of the type of supernatural abilities that many more of us may develop aswe move through the Ascension process.Lemesurier also refers to 1223 as the time period when humanity began “coming ofage”—when our thought processes began taking us out of the Dark Ages and movingus into the modern scientific era. Since he did not go into detail, I continueddoing more research myself, and found other interesting new leads. As oneexample, the Smithsonian Institution officially certified the year 1223 as theyear glazed pottery first appeared in the world—a new technology brought toJapan from China.16 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber319] As another example, duringthe birth of the nation of Spain, they founded their prestigious university inSalamanca in this exact same year. Salamanca “was the source of the artistic,educational and cultural enlightenment that fueled Spain’s Golden Age.”17[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber320] Universities were not very common in the1200s. Other than in Arabic lands, this school was one of the first of itskind—and Spain was leading the way in those early years.Spain had an important role in sailing the world’s oceans and discovering newlands—significantly expanding the scope of Western civilization—and it all beganin AD 1223 with the founding of Salamanca. With the dawning of scientificknowledge, humanity now had the opportunity to become a worldwide civilization,paving the way for our eventual Ascension. Thus, it seems perfectly appropriatethat in the year 1223, the spiritual seekers of humanity began blasting theirway up through the Well-Shaft to the spiritual heights in the upper chambers.PROPHECY OF THE RENAISSANCE AND A GLOBAL DARK NIGHT OF THE SOULThe next significant year in the Descending Passage, as revealed in PeterLemesurier’s Great Pyramid Decoded, is AD 1440. This is the exact year theRenaissance began, which is widely accepted as having originated with anartistic debate between Ghiberti and Brunelleschi. The year 1440 is also whenJohn Gutenberg invented the first movable-type printing press, though he’d madenonmoving prototypes since 1436.18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber321] If you readThe Synchronicity Key and have studied my conclusions about the science ofcycles of repeating time, you’ll recall that the year 1440 is also two exact720-year cycles after Jesus’s birth. The 720-year cycle is precisely one-thirdof the 2,160-year Age of the Zodiac. In Synchronicity, I study this and avariety of other interrelated and fascinating cycles. The printing press wasanother critical discovery that directly helped usher in the modern age oftechnology and worldwide travel, communication, and knowledge. Again, this pavedthe way for our Ascension by allowing us the freedom to communicate and educateourselves about the various pathways to higher consciousness.Soon after this point in the timeline, the Descending Passage stops slopingdownward on a diagonal, and instead begins moving forward on a flat, horizontalplane, leading into the Subterranean Chamber—which becomes humanity’s greatestmoment of challenge and initiation. If we draw a line out from the ceiling ofthe horizontal part of the Descending Passage and extend it back over to thediagonal, that year is AD 1440. Furthermore, if you draw a line out from thebottom of the tunnel the same way, it crosses the diagonal of the DescendingPassage in 1521—the significance of which I’ll explain below. The pyramid’sdesigner had to deliberately narrow the width of the passageway once it shiftedinto the horizontal area to make these two alignments fit properly. This alsomeans that any movement through the tunnel after this point becomes even moreclaustrophobic, literally forcing you down on your hands and knees. This shoulddefinitely be considered a key part of any intended symbolic message.The year 1521 is highly significant in our history. As one example, Spain is onrecord as conquering the Aztecs in 1521. The Spanish tragically burned entirelibraries of precious ancient records, claiming they contained nothing butsuperstitious beliefs.19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber322] In addition, 1521 isconsidered to be the exact year the Reformation started, which gave commonpeople access to the Bible and made possible the birth of Protestantdenominations of Christianity. Although Martin Luther first nailed his list ofninety-five grievances against the Roman church on the door at Wittenberg onOctober 31, 1517, it wasn’t until April 18, 1521, that he stood before the Popeand his leadership at the Diet of Worms and refused to renounce the books he hadwritten on Christianity.20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber323] According to onescholar, Luther’s bravery in the face of the empire’s greatest power in 1521 was“the moment in the world’s history to which Christendom has been lookingforward. . . . So great is the rejoicing in Germany that for a moment it mayseem that the Emperor’s power is in danger rather than Luther and hisadherents.”21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber324] So yet again, we are seeing howneatly the pyramid’s hidden message ties in with the development of theChristian faith. No special tricks or inappropriate changes are required . . .you simply keep counting with the system of one inch equals one year.During the time window of 1440 to 1521, we also have the fall of Constantinoplein 1453, which effectively ended the Roman Empire. This clearly represents theend of a major era in the movement of human history, opening the way for newcycles to take place. Columbus “discovered” America in 1492, as one key part ofthe circumnavigation of the Earth by European civilization during this time. Theconquering of the Aztecs and the burning of their precious ancient libraries in1521 revealed the wanton disrespect and destruction of traditional cultures thatoccurred as a result of these Western expansions. This trend has unfortunatelyoften continued ever since.Another key measurement Lemesurier identifies in this area of the timeline,where there is a distinct “bend” between the diagonal and the horizontal sectionof the passageway, points to the year 1506. Christopher Columbus died on May 20,1506, which the higher forces may have seen as a relief.22[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber325] The greatest and most famous Islamicuniversity, the Nizamiyah, was fully restored in 1506, showing a key stepforward in our overall education.23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber326] This isalso the year that Nicholas V began renovating St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, the“great architectural symbol of the power and universality of the papacy,”24[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber327] directly over the foundations of Constantine’soriginal site from AD 324, which was now in decaying ruins.25[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber328]The building of St. Peter’s in 1506 required a huge amount of money from theentire Christian world to finance,26 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber329] and itremains the seat of Vatican power to this very day. Nicholas V also built it tohouse the Vatican Library—consolidating the many literary treasures of the RomanEmpire in a single location. These treasures included ancient documents from theLibrary of Alexandria that multiple insiders have told me date back toextraterrestrial civilizations before they ever even arrived on Earth. Theburning of the library was allegedly just a cover operation, and apparently allthe important ancient records were relocated to the Vatican before the fireswere set. The only records that actually burned in the fire were things like taxand census documents, according to multiple insiders.Emery Smith is another insider who revealed that the “Library” of Alexandria isalso a wonderland of advanced ancient technology that has all been hidden awayfrom us, while it continues to be developed in secret. Therefore, theconstruction of St. Peter’s effectively sealed off many ancient secrets from theWestern world in a heavily fortified area.27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber330]That makes the year 1506 very significant in light of the designers of thePyramid, who appear to have known that the truth of our ancient history would behidden away from the public by powerful forces—thus requiring that they write itin stone.Using the same logic that reveals the 1506 date in the bend between the diagonaland the horizontal sections of the Descending Passage, Lemesurier also usesstraightforward geometry to reveal that the year 1510 is of significance. It isthe year Martin Luther first visited Rome and witnessed the extravagances of thePope and the Cardinals. This shook his belief in the infallibility of thepapacy, and he soon discovered numerous places in the Bible that contradictedthe idea of having a pope.28 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber331] This led to thecreation of his list of ninety-five grievances, which he finished seven yearsafter his initial trip to Rome in 1510.Hence, all the precursors to Luther’s triggering of the Reformation in 1521, asrevealed in the timeline, began in 1510—which was also flagged by the timeline!Already, it should be obvious that the “coincidences” are stacking up. These aredefinitely not just random years in our history, but represent critical turningpoints that historians could look back upon—or in this case look forward into,since even the most mainstream interpretation of when the Great Pyramid wasconstructed is thousands of years before these events transpired.A CRITICAL HISTORICAL PERIOD FROM 1767 TO 1848After 1521, there are no new changes in the Descending Passage until we reachwhat is known as the Recess, or Lesser Chamber. This is an area where theceiling of the passage suddenly rises for a period of time, and becomes allrough and ragged, looking like it’s been smashed out. This foreshadows the bumpyfloor of the Subterranean Chamber itself. There is a clear indication indreamlike symbolic language that the tortured look of the ceiling indicates thatthis is meant to symbolize a time of great ordeal for humanity. The Recessbegins in 1767 and ends in 1848. As it turns out, 1767 is the year the Britishimposed a tax on all tea in the American colonies. This was the direct IncitingIncident that triggered the American Revolution just nine years later, in 1776.Regardless of your opinions about America, it did become a dominant world power,and the Pyramid Timeline indicates that these events did lead to our collectivedark night of the soul—as well as providing the fuel for us to discover a wayout.As we travel through this rough period from 1767 to 1848, we have the bloodyFrench Revolution of 1789. This ushered in Napoleon’s reign, which led to manyviolent wars as he attempted to build a huge empire. The carnage didn’t enduntil the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. All the early struggles of the foundationof America occurred during this time, including the War of 1812. Anotherrevolution occurred in France in 1830. Belgium seceded from the Netherlands thatsame year. The year 1845 was given critical significance by the position of theGreat Step in the Ascending Passage, as we revealed in the previous chapter. Itcorrelates with the first commercial availability of instant communication at adistance through the telegraph, as well as the theory of evolution and otheradvances. Karl Marx wrote his Communist Manifesto in 1847, just one year beforethe Pyramid’s Recess comes to an end in 1848.29[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber332]Though many of us have now forgotten this moment in the sands of time, thepyramid’s designer couldn’t have possibly picked a better year for the Recess toend. An incredible number of countries all over Europe revolted in 1848—eventhough there appeared to be no common cause. It was as if some sort of greatermovement was taking place, which some historians call a “revolutionary wave.”Something as peculiar as a wave of angry uprisings, happening in so manycountries at once for different reasons, may well be showing us “energetic”fingerprints of some kind—influencing humanity on a mass scale.According to Wikipedia as of 2009, when I first compiled notes on this subject:> The European Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Spring of> Nations, Springtime of the Peoples or the Year of Revolution, were a series of> political upheavals throughout the European continent.

This seemed to predict a period of great social upheaval,foreshadowing the chaos that would come later on. In 1914 is when the smooth,flat floor of the passage drops into the churning rage of the SubterraneanChamber. This is the year that World War I began like a sudden rushing collapseof dominoes—with country after country declaring war against one another, all inthe same year. Let’s also not forget that this same date appears prominentlyunderneath the Great Step, when the Ascending Passage slope finally “hits thewall.”When we read through the history ourselves, it almost appears as if a sort ofmass insanity was taking place all over the world. This was not just somethingthat was discovered after the fact. In 1893, Dr. Adam Rutherford’s Egyptologistfather predicted “an ominous event of great magnitude” in 1914, based on asimilar alignment he found in the Grand Gallery—as we discussed.31[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber334] This is an example where the timeline wassuccessfully used to predict future events—though Rutherford was wrong aboutother things, and did not succeed in his own attempts to prognosticate ourimmediate future destiny.32 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber335]According to Peter Lemesurier, in 1914 the traditional world, and all itsnegativity, really became exposed and turned upon by the people—in America,Europe, and the Far East. Major revolutions took place in Russia and China.Another critical element that Lemesurier overlooked, because the awareness ofthe importance of this situation did not largely exist back in 1977, was thatthe Federal Reserve began operating in the United States this very same year—onNovember 26, 1914. The American financial system was handed over to a privatizedcorporation of international bankers who could potentially manipulate thecurrency supply for their own ends. One classic reference work for thisdiscussion is The Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin.33[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber336]However, the events of 1914 weren’t all negative: Albert Einstein becamedirector of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and emigrated to Germany,publishing his General Relativity Theory two years later.34[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber337] Relativity gave us breathtaking new insightsinto space and time—revealing that everything is ultimately created by a unifiedsource of energy, where space and time work together in a greater whole. Also in1914, there was a massive expansion of scientific, military, and commercialtechnology, as well as significant advances in the field of medicine thatallowed world population numbers to substantially increase.35[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber338] These events dealt fatal blows to theentrenched powers and negative elements of the materialistic world—and we arestill experiencing their positive repercussions today. Lemesurier cites multiplesymbolic clues, in the form of measurements in this area and their greaterapparent meanings, that 1914 represented a time of significant spiritual rebirthfor humanity.It is not precisely correct to state that 1914 is the next significant year inthe timeline after 1848. The ceiling of the Subterranean Chamber starts in1911—three years before the floor drops out in 1914. This suggests that manyprecursors to the events of 1914 should be found in 1911, and the evidence doessupport this idea. For example, Italy declared war on Turkey in 1911, andalthough every other nation in Europe opposed it, no one took action.36[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber339] There was also a revolution in central China.Germany created a crisis throughout Europe by sending a gunship into a closedport of Morocco to challenge French dominance of the area, causing greatupset—but no action.37 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber340]The first aircraft landing on a United States naval battleship was accomplishedin 1911, as well as the first coast-to-coast flight across the US. This directlyset the stage for the mechanized warfare of the twentieth century and beyond,which would so soon come into play in 1914. And most interestingly, on May 15,1911, Standard Oil was ordered to break up its thirty-seven interlocking firms,demolishing its legendary industrial monopoly. Their appeal to the Supreme Courtwas turned down.38 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber341] The owners of Standard Oilthen reorganized and combined their wealth and influence with otherinternational bankers to create the Federal Reserve, which, as noted earlier,took control of the American financial system on November 16, 1914.39[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber342] Nonetheless, the breakup of Standard Oil maywell be a harbinger of much greater global disclosures and anti-trust maneuversthat many are eagerly anticipating at the time I finish writing this book. Themore we look at how well these pieces fit together, the more impossible it is toimagine that all this is somehow a coincidence. I believe skeptics simply rejectthe whole thing rather than taking the time required to explain how so manyhistorically significant events could have been encoded into the Great Pyramid.Whether or not you study the numerological significance of the measurements inthese areas, simply counting one inch as one year, and looking for obviouschanges, generates these results.THE AGE OF HELL ON EARTHFrom this point forward, the pyramid’s floor is a mess. Humanity undergoesseemingly unending challenges and difficulties—which is an apt description ofthe twentieth century. It should come as little surprise that the nextsignificant point, as we move through the uncertainty of the SubterraneanChamber, appears in 1945. This, of course, is when World War II finally ended.40[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber343] It is literally astonishing that the GreatPyramid so precisely flags the beginning of World War I as well as the end ofWorld War II. Structurally, the date of 1945 appears in the exact center of asymmetrical area in the pyramid, as viewed from the side. (See the next imagefor reference.)From the side view, we see what look like two pillars coming up from the floor.This is a classical symbolic representation of duality, which very much fitsthis period of time. Between these two pillars, it appears that a half circlecomes down from the ceiling. This very likely symbolizes the promise of peace,spiritual renewal, and Ascension. It may even represent a direct interventionfrom a higher reality. Very interestingly, the first widely known modern UFOsightings began shortly after this point, with the Roswell crash in 1947.The floor of the Subterranean Chamber continues to violently fluctuate in heightfrom this point. Most pyramid researchers consider this floor to be“unfinished,” as if such a marvelously perfected monument in the desert wouldsomehow have been left abandoned. This is almost certainly not the case. Thegrotesquely distorted floor is using dream symbolism to indicate that thisentire period of history is replete with wars, peril, mass death, stress, andchaos. Furthermore, the overall quality of life shows a slow, gradual downtrend,as seen in the height of the floor, right up until a year that Lemesurierbelieves is 2004. As we will see in just a moment, he also revealed that thereis a rare three-year period of “wiggle room” on this measurement. On page 132 ofmy edition of Great Pyramid Decoded, he said, “Moreover, there are indicationsthat the datings for the whole Chamber may be adjustable to the extent of somethree years.” Then on page 134, he clarified this by saying, “the Chamber seemsto have what we have described as an ‘adjustable join’ with the passage leadinginto it. . . . Consequently a tolerance of at least +/- three years should beapplied to all datings given.” The date Lemesurier indicates as 2004 istherefore almost certainly intended by the Pyramid’s designer to be 2001, whichis when 9/11 took place. At this point in the Pyramid Timeline, which Lemesurieradmits could be 2001, there is a sudden, massive drop in the height of thefloor. This leads us into what the pyramid researchers called the Pit of Ordeal.Although Lemesurier wrote his book in 1977, and most prophecy books of his timewere betting all their money on the year 2000, in The Great Pyramid Decoded, wesee 2001 as the year where “the bottom will fall out of the world.”[../images/Image-005-012420.jpg]Lemesurier’s Original Diagram of Subterranean Chamber and Dates (WithoutThree-Year Back-date Adjustment)Again, Lemesurier speculated in 1977 that there was indeed a three-year windowof error throughout the Subterranean Chamber. On page 124 of The Great PyramidDecoded, he got more specific by indicating that since the ceiling of thechamber begins in 1911, but the floor doesn’t drop out until 1914, everything inthis section could thus be backdated by three years. That makes 9/11 happen atthe exact time we drop into the Pit of Ordeal in the Pyramid Timeline.The Pit then reaches its deepest point just a few years later. If we scale bothof the following dates back by three years and then otherwise reciteLemesurier’s decoding of the prophecy exactly as it was written, this is what wesee on page 135: “Then, in around 2001, ‘the bottom will fall out of the world.’Both world-civilization and its technologies will quickly collapse torock-bottom by 2007, and will remain at that level for at least fifteen years.”The year 2007 is certainly an interesting date. The great economic collapse of2008 really began with what scholars call the 2007 Financial Crisis. This waswhen the Federal Reserve responded to the massive subprime mortgage crisis bydoing their first mega-bailout, where they added 24 billion dollars into thebanking system as of August 2007.41 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber344] Accordingto The Balance, this was a response to “the breakdown of trust that occurredbetween banks the year before the 2008 financial crisis.”42[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber345] The US Treasury created a 75-billion-dollarsuperfund in an attempt to bail out subprime mortgages on November 21, 2007, andhome foreclosures in December 2007 were 97 percent higher than in December 2006,increasing by a total of 75 percent for the year 2007.43[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber346] All these events were the direct precursors ofthe full meltdown that happened in 2008.The further and further we go in this investigation, the more impossible itbecomes that these dates in the Great Pyramid Timeline could be a product ofrandom coincidence. The Pyramid designers even politely remind us here that thegreat 2008 economic collapse truthfully began in 2007. I remember reading thisprophecy back in 1993 and wondering what would cause our world to collapse to“rock-bottom” in the time interval of 2007 to 2010—and now we know.It is also interesting to read Lemesurier’s prophecy of what will happen topeople on the Ascension path during this time frame. On page 157, if we adjustthe 2004 date to 2001 as permitted and change the language to be gender-neutral,we have the following: “As for the initiates of the upper path, rebirth duringthe present era is foreseen as an essential preliminary to their entry into theFinal Age of rebirth into the spirit-planes, destined to lead ultimately tounion with the Divine. . . . These efforts will be aided, if not precipitated,by a period of terrible physical upheaval starting in 1914 and reaching its peakin AD 2001. All people, including the enlightened, will have to undergo thisperiod of ordeal, but it is those who place the greatest value on physicalthings who, inevitably, will suffer most acutely from it. By many, however, theneed for a complete re-orientation of values will be seen and fully acted upon,and a civilization of extraordinary vigour and achievement will ensue. A smallminority . . . will none the less persist right to the end in their rejection ofanything resembling true enlightenment, and for them a path of non-escape isprojected by the Pyramid’s designer, possibly leading to experience of a furthercycle of physical existence.”44 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber347]This concept of mass rebirth in a further cycle of physical, third-densityexistence is revealed in the Law of One within Session 17, Question 24: “Thegreat majority of your peoples will repeat third density.”45[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber348] However, we do have a ray of hope in Session65, Question 12, where it reads, “Could your planet polarize towards harmony inone fine, strong moment of inspiration? Yes, my friends. It is not probable; butit is ever possible.”46 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber349]Since we do have a three-year “sliding scale” in the time window we are nowdiscussing, allowing the first “bottom” of the Pit to be either 2001 or 2004, wedo want to investigate both of these dates. By 2004, the Iraq War was raging,even though there was already significant public opposition. George W. Bush wona second term despite soaring unpopularity, and almost immediately signed theIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Act of 2004 in an attempt to consolidate thevarious intelligence agencies into the Department of Homeland Security and putall competing agencies under the control of a single national intelligencedirector.47 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber350]Then, on December 26, 2004, the greatest earthquake in over forty years struckthe Pacific Ocean near Sumatra. This created a massive tsunami that killed asmany as 266,000 people in the coastal regions of Indonesia and Africa.48[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber351] This epic catastrophe was the first of the“mega-earth changes” that we are now seeing at the end of the Age. It obviouslydwarfed September 11, 2001, in the number of its fatalities and the scope ofdestruction. The Indonesian tsunami was soon followed by Hurricane Katrina inAugust 2005, which was another example that our climate was changing in verypowerful and dangerous ways. This seemingly validates many of the mostdistressing prophecies that the bottom would indeed fall out of the world inthis time frame.It is also significant to note that the great financial crisis is commonlymapped out by scientists like Jin Wook Choi as having occurred precisely between2007 and 2010. Choi wrote a paper entitled “The 2007–2010 US financial crisis”for The Journal of Economic Asymmetries in 2013.49[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber352] The paper indicates that this was only one ofmany studies on the 2007–2010 financial crisis.50[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber353] This period of 2007 to 2010 is the exactthree-year time window where “the bottom will fall out of the world” and “hitrock-bottom” in Lemesurier’s interpretation of the Pyramid Timeline. The year2010 is seen as the administrative end of the financial crisis, because USpresident Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010. This created the mostsubstantial government reform of the financial system since the Glass-SteagallAct, which was implemented after the 1929 stock market crash that triggered theGreat Depression.51 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber354] The Dodd-Frank Act made itfar more difficult for mortgage companies and lenders to take advantage ofconsumers.1942, THE BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES, AND ASCENSIONWe can use this same three-year “slide” and also apply it to the end of WorldWar II, which the Timeline dates at 1945. Let’s remember that 1945 appears insymbolic terms as the first sign of hope for the coming Ascension. Thisthree-year window backdates us to 1942, where we have the infamous Battle of LosAngeles, a favorite topic among UFO researchers. This massive UFO sighting tookplace over Los Angeles less than three months after Japan attacked the US atPearl Harbor. From 3:16 to 4:14 A.M. on February 25, 1942, soldiers fired over1,400 massive, 12.8-pound explosive antiaircraft shells at a series of brightlylit, nonmoving targets that hovered silently in the California night sky.52[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber355] According to one eyewitness, a former chair ofthe Department of Anthropology at Occidental College in Los Angeles, this“official estimate” of the number of shots fired is way, way too low.53[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber356] The main object was described as looking like“a surreal, hanging magic lantern”54 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber357] and a“silvery, lozenge-shaped ‘bug.’”55 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber358] Severalbuildings were damaged by the friendly fire, three civilians were killed, andanother three died from heart attacks owing to the extreme stress of thehour-long bombardment.56 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber359]In 1983, the Office of Air Force History reported that the “unidentifiedobjects” (their words) were only, uh, weather balloons—yet the classicfront-page newspaper photograph of the event clearly shows a flyingsaucer–shaped bright area being lit up by at least nine different spotlights asthe “weather balloon” was being shot at.57 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber360]None of the explosive rounds had any effect on it. Some researchers estimate itwas roughly eight hundred feet in diameter.58 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber361]The object moved directly over MGM Studios in Culver City—arguably the mediacapital of the world during this time frame.59 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber362]Over one million people saw it at the time, due to the incredible volume of thechaos of gunfire in the middle of the night.60 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber363]According to a female air-raid warden quoted on About.com:> It was huge! It was just enormous! And it was practically right over my house.> I had never seen anything like it in my life! . . . It was just hovering there> in the sky and hardly moving at all.

And what a gorgeous color!61> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber364]The Long Beach Independent wrote an editorial that said, “There is a mysteriousreticence about the whole affair, and it appears that some form of censorship istrying to halt discussion on the matter.”62 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber365]This definitely fits the Pyramid Timeline symbolism of an “intervention fromabove,” showing that even in the depths of World War II, and the fear of realdefeat at the hands of Hitler and the Japanese, there were higher powerssurrounding the Earth that could not be touched by any of the weapons we nowpossess. Since the term flying saucer wasn’t invented until 1947, and theacronym UFO wasn’t coined until even later, the Battle of Los Angeles hassomehow remained overlooked by the majority of the public. The whole event didappear to symbolize that our problems in the world would resolve peacefully. Avery clear message was sent that these Visitors are not hostile, and that theyhave technology significantly more advanced than our own. In 1945, three yearsafter the Battle of Los Angeles, the war was over—as the Pyramid Timelineimplies.Lemesurier’s original date of 2010, when the floor of the Pit of Ordeal plummetsto its deepest level, may have more to offer us than just a marker for theDodd-Frank Act. On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded andsoon sank, creating what is now seen as the greatest ecological disaster inhuman history.63 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber366] For at least several weeksafter this event, the mood worldwide about it was quite apocalyptic. Twothousand ten was also the year that the European Union began collapsing,beginning with the economy of Greece in the spring of 2010.64[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber367]On January 13, 2010, a massive earthquake devastated Haiti and was considered bygeologists to be “quite strange,” as it was the worst they had seen in over twohundred years.65 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber368] Chile then had a massive 8.8earthquake the following month, on February 27, 2010, which was the fifthlargest ever recorded.66 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber369],67[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber370] The Chile quake was so powerful it actuallyshifted the tilt of the Earth’s axis and shortened its length of day.68[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber371] Mexico had a massive 7.2 quake in Baja,California, on April 4, 2010, causing tremors all the way to Arizona andSouthern California.69 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber372] An unprecedentederuption of volcanic fog from Iceland halted all European air traffic in Apriland May, stranding millions.70 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber373] Indonesia hadanother massive tsunami on October 25, 2010,71 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber374]which was very unusual as it seemed out of proportion to the quakes that createdit, since a series of slow, mild quakes led to a massive tsunami wave.72[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber375] Iran also had a devastating 6.5 quake onDecember 20, 2010.73 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber376] This ongoing globalupheaval, both in geological and financial terms with the European economiccollapse, perfectly fits the obvious symbolism of the Pyramid Timeline.With the Mayan Calendar end date of 2012 appearing precisely in the pyramid’sAntechamber, and the year 2013 corresponding to the world-changing Snowden NSArevelations, we can deduce that these events are all part of the Ascensionprocess. By going through mass initiation, we also end up experiencing the muchgreater likelihood of a mass spiritual awakening. I am already seeing thishappen, for the darkest aspects of the negative elite used to be “fringe”subjects, but now they are essentially common knowledge. Events taking place asI write this book in the end of 2019 suggest that we are on the verge of a massexposure of horrific conspiracies, and I will share some readings that I did onthis subject from 1999 in later chapters.From here on out, we are heading into future events and there is no way to knowwhat will happen, if anything, although things could look pretty bleak as wecontinue along through the Pit of Ordeal. About the only positive is that thelevel of the floor never sinks any lower than it does in 2007–2010. Lemesurierindicates that the year 2032 is a significant turning point, and thanks to thethree-year variance, this also should be backdated to 2029. This is only oneyear away from the date of 2030, where the second set of grooves appear in theAntechamber to signal the next time window where an Ascension-related mega-eventcould occur.The Pit therefore gives us the second reinforcement of the prophetic date thatCorey Goode, his insiders, and my own dreams have been giving as a possible timewindow for when the actual “solar flash” will finally occur. In Session 40,Questions 10 and 11, in the Law of One series, it says there will be a “finalmovement of vibratory matter, shall we say, through the quantum leap, as youwould call it” at the end of the cycle. It goes on to say that “the nature ofquanta is such that the movement over the boundary is that of discrete placementof vibratory level.”74 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber377] I have often used thispassage in my lectures to explain that there will apparently be a “final . . .quantum leap” where the energy that makes up our basic reality “moves over theboundary” and has a “discrete placement of vibratory level” into fourth density.The dictionary definition of “discrete” is “apart or detached from others;separate; distinct.”75 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber378] Session 40, Question11, therefore indicates that we will move into a completely separate anddistinct new vibratory and dimensional level once we go through this event.The Law of One series also directly informs us that the Earth will shift by 20degrees on its axis as we go through this “quantum leap.” One of the passagesthat explains this is Session 59, Question 24. The question was a follow-up topreviously disclosed information: “When the planetary axes realign, will theyrealign 20° east of north to conform to the green vibration?” The answer was, inpart, “There is every indication that this [pole shift] will occur. We cannotspeak of certainties, but are aware that the grosser or less dense materialswill be pulled into conformation with the denser and lighter energies which giveyour Logos its proceedings through the realms of experience.”76[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber379]The source repeatedly stresses that this is not a catastrophic event for humans,despite us being told in Session 17, Question 1, that this event “will causeyour planetary sphere to have some ruptures in its outer garment while makingitself appropriately magnetized for fourth density. This is the planetaryadjustment.”77 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber380] If you are on the Ascensionpath, you seemingly get a multidimensional light-body activation at this time,whereas if you are going to repeat the third-density cycle, you apparently willhave a planet-hopping relocation event—like what Dr. Courtney Brown saw in hisremote-viewing sessions. That relocation would still be akin to anAscension-style event, filled with awe and mystery. Only the darkest and mostnegatively polarized people will actually stay on Earth to experience this shiftin physical form, as my own source has repeatedly stressed.This scenario was hinted at in Session 16, Questions 11 and 12, when it saidthere is only one harvest event that we will all go through in our own way:“Questioner: Is there a harvest of entities oriented towards service to selflike there is a harvest here of entities oriented towards service to others? Ra:I am Ra. There is one harvest. Those able to enter fourth density throughvibrational complex levels may choose the manner of their further seeking of theOne Creator. Questioner: Then as we enter the fourth density there will be asplit, shall we say, and part of the individuals who go into the fourth densitywill go to planets or places where there is service to others, and the otherpart will go into places where there is service to self. Is this correct?Ra: . . . This is correct.”THE END OF THE DESCENDING PASSAGE TIMELINEThe floor height in the Subterranean Chamber still remains the same in the pituntil a sudden vertical jump, going straight up, in about 2055. This, asLemesurier indicates, represents the timeline for “materialist humanity,” notthose who are set to experience Ascension. Something positive will apparentlyhappen in or around 2055 that digs everyone on this timeline out of the pit.There is another, even greater vertical jump in about 2075, and another verticaljump in about 2100, which is almost as big as the one in 2055. Only then do wesee the people on this timeline finally elevated out of the last of the pit.Then we have a slow, gradual increase in height until 2132, when we finally exitthe Subterranean Chamber and again end up in a tunnel that is carved like therest of the Descending Passage. The floor becomes flat and level once more, asit had remained up until 1911–1914. However, I should also point out that, bythis point, the height of the floor is now lower than it was when going in. Thepassage then continues along, experiences a brief “kink” to the west, whichPeter Lemesurier interprets as a possibility of new spiritual seeking, andeventually reaches a dead end. Lemesurier believes this means the pyramid is notbuilt to track this phase of humanity’s evolution any further, even though itcontinues moving along.When we go through the same timeline for the Ascending Passage and the King’sChamber, we really see only two clusters of events, as we discussed in theprevious chapter. The birth, life, and resurrection of Jesus is depicted in avery precise and undeniable way, in the moment where the “roof” gets blown offand the passage becomes much, much taller and more beautiful. Then we have theGreat Step, which again indicates a major shift-point for humanity that pavesthe final path to Ascension, providing particular focus on the dates of 1845 and1914, right at the beginning of World War I.Once we get into the Antechamber, we have the inset granite slab with thehalf-circle Boss symbol on it. As we discussed, this is interpreted as aprophecy of Ascension, which Lemesurier directly associates with the SecondComing of Christ. If you do not change the timescale at the Great Step, thisAscension harbinger was expected to happen in 2012—which was a perfect fit withthe Mayan Calendar. Again, one of the main aspects of Corey Goode’s contact wasto explain that the time window for this event had to be moved forward, since wewere not yet ready as a planet for this to happen.Just as a reminder, I had first picked up The Great Pyramid Decoded on the sametrip to the bookstore when I picked up my copy of Richard C. Hoagland’sMonuments of Mars, back in 1993. It was therefore one of the very first books Iread on my quest, after finding out from the professor that UFOs really exist.Now in retrospect it is obvious that I was guided to read The Great PyramidDecoded right at the beginning of my epic three-hundred-volume research periodin college. The specific, corroborating details in the Law of One series were awelcome relief after struggling with The Great Pyramid Decoded for two and ahalf years. I was very impressed by the incredible accuracy of this Prophecy inStone. There were far too many prophecy hits on very specific dates in ourhistory for this to be any type of coincidence, and this has continued to be thecase in our own recent history.Since Ra said they existed outside of time, the Pyramid Timeline was anexcellent proof of that same concept. Best of all, the timeline gave additionalproof of an Ascension event that was anticipated in the exact same time windowas the Mayan Calendar end date, even though Lemesurier himself did not appear tosee this. I had already observed incredible synchronicity events and futureprophecies in my own life.In the Law of One series, they explain that there are people on Earth who arepart of a “negative elite,” guided and manipulated by negative, demonicextraterrestrials they refer to as the Orion Confederation. The Law of Onefurther indicates and this negative group can only disrupt life on Earth andfeed on the energy of our fear until we, as a planet, reach a certain state ofcollective evolution. This is explained in Session 11, Question 16, as follows:“The crusaders move in their chariots to conquer planetary mind/body/spiritsocial complexes before they reach the stage of achieving social memory.”78[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber381] When the questioner then asks “At what stagedoes a planet achieve social memory,” the answer was “A mind/body/spirit socialcomplex becomes a social memory complex when its entire group of entities are ofone orientation or seeking. The group memory lost to the individuals in theroots of the tree of mind then become[s] known to the social complex, thuscreating a social memory complex. The advantages of this complex are therelative lack of distortion in understanding the social beingness and therelative lack of distortion in pursuing the direction of seeking, for allunderstanding/ distortions are available to the entities of the society.”79[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber382]This is clearly describing a world in which everyone has become telepathic, in atype of group mind. Once this happens, the negative can no longer maintaincontrol, and the “quantum leap” is then activated. Ultimately, this means thatwe are in control of when the great shift will occur, and any exact estimates ofwhen this will happen are impossible. The Internet clearly seems to be theprecursor that helps usher in this mass telepathic synergy. The free flow ofcommunication has allowed for many previously suppressed truths to finally seethe light of day. The Pyramid Timeline seems to flag the coming of the Internetby stressing the importance of 1845. This again was the year we first beganhaving instant communication at a distance via telegraph.As I was putting all this together while reading the Law of One in 1996, a newcharacter arrived at the Schoolhouse at just the right time to add even moreintrigue to everything that was happening to me. Antonio would soon reveal thathis godfather was allegedly one of the top ninety directing members of aworldwide secret organization called the Illuminati. I had previouslyencountered this name while reading New World Order: The Ancient Plan of SecretSocieties by William T. Still, sometime in 1994 or 1995.80[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber383] I had already shown the book to my housemateEric, and had him read through the whole thing. Eric didn’t believe there wasany such thing as the Illuminati, but now our new housemate was saying he wasfriends with the top members of this same organization. The information I gotfrom Antonio was extremely interesting—to say the least."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONETHE FIRST ILLUMINATI INSIDERThe connections I was seeing between the Law of One series, Cosmic Voyage by Dr.Courtney Brown, The Watchers by Raymond Fowler, the prophecies of the PyramidTimeline, and so many other pieces of my research were absolutely astonishing tome. It was somewhat hilarious to be making all of these potentiallyworld-changing discoveries while working a really tough job for barely aboveminimum wage, but I was so thrilled by the discoveries I was making that ithardly seemed to matter. My friend Eric and I were living in the Schoolhouse—thebeautifully remodeled 1800s brick building and art gallery in Rosendale, NewYork, which had four other apartments where our potential friends could live. Myjob allowed me to afford rent, food, and basic expenses, and I was happy. Therewas one woman who had been there long before the rest of us arrived and wouldnever speak a word to any of us. Other than that, we all had quite a sense ofcommunity.ANTONIO AND THE ILLUMINATII began reading the Law of One series as of approximately February 1, 1996. Icouldn’t go terribly fast, for I might end up spending forty-five minutesmeditating on one two-page spread before ever turning to the next one. I wasnonetheless completely fascinated, and spent as many hours in the books as Ipossibly could. Almost every page had stunning correlations to things I hadstudied in the past, such as the Pyramid Timeline. I also found countlessconnections to information that essentially rewrote many of our most belovedbranches of science, and would become the foundation of much of my life’s work.The one-to-one correlation between Dr. Brown’s research and statements in theLaw of One will be more fully explored in the next chapter. To rest my mind, Iwould read other things, such as websites on the newly emerging Internet orother books.Both Eric and I were getting almost an inundation of synchronicity during thistime. It was happening so often that it could literally be hour by hour. On theInternet, I discovered the work of Terrence McKenna, who was very stronglypushing the Mayan Calendar end date of 2012 as representing some sort of cosmicdimensional shift for humanity. When I tuned in on his work with my dreams,intuition, and synchronicities, I felt he had aspects of truth, but his overallmodel was still flawed. One obvious synchronicity was that the first time Itried to read McKenna’s stuff, the computer powered itself down to a blackscreen, even though we did not lose power in the rest of the house. Then ithappened again when I tried to read McKenna once more. By combining this withother pieces of data that were coming in, I saw it as a sign not to get tooinvolved—and I didn’t.Then, on February 10, 1996, I awoke with an extremely strong dream message. Iwas told that I needed to take the things I was learning about and write them upin a book of my own. I certainly had not been thinking of anything like this atthe time, but I even got the title that I was supposed to give this newmaterial: Convergence. I did end up releasing a trilogy of free books on my ownwebsite under that title, but I didn’t start this until three years later, in1999. The best aspects of that material appeared in The Source FieldInvestigations, by which time my writing skills had improved enough that I coulddefinitely notice a difference. Right as I was bursting with inspiration andcharting out what would become my future spiritual and career path, a newinsider appeared in my life who took the mystery and intrigue factor to an evenhigher level.A young, athletic, and charismatic man from Spain I will call Antonio first cameto visit us at the Schoolhouse around February 16, 1996, according to my writtenjournal notes from February 20 of that year.Within a few minutes of meeting each other, Antonio and I got into a high-levelconversation about subjects that my housemate Eric knew almost nothing about.This included pyramids, Atlantis, sunken architecture, the Freemasons,extraterrestrials, reverse-engineered technology, and Ascension. Antonio wasadmittedly impressed with how much I had discovered over the course of myresearch, but he had a curiously dismissive attitude. He felt I still didn’treally know very much, since everything I had obtained was from books. He, onthe other hand, claimed to have had direct access to a group he called theIlluminati. I had already read about this group in William T. Still’s book NewWorld Order, which certainly did not paint a positive portrait of thisorganization. However, Antonio was absolutely convinced that Still had it allwrong, and the Illuminati were the good guys in our planetary story line—eventhough he was never formally brought in by them as a member. He had worked in abar where top-level members gathered, and he got to hear stories about them fromhis godfather. My opinions on the Illuminati were nowhere near as solid in 1996as they would become later—particularly after reading the highly disturbingwhistleblower testimony of Svali, beginning in 2000.The full story of Antonio unfolded over the course of multiple conversationsafter he moved into an upstairs apartment in the Schoolhouse, which occurredabout a month later. Rather than attempting to reconstruct piece by piece how Ilearned all this, I will just share the overview. Antonio’s father had worked,if you want to call it that, as a jewel smuggler. He would buy various preciousgemstones, including diamonds, at low prices, circumvent taxes and other dutyfees by smuggling them through airports and customs stops, and then sell them atconventional prices in Spain. Antonio’s father died under suspiciouscircumstances before Antonio was a teenager, but I never got the details. Afterhis father’s tragic death, Antonio was placed under the guardianship of hisgodfather, a medical doctor who lived on a massive Spanish estate—and was one ofthe wealthiest people in the country. Antonio finally ended up going to anall-boys’ boarding school, but while he still lived at the mansion, he eitherhad to stay in his room or be out in the gardens, digging rocks out of the soil.He was so heavily overworked that the only time he had to himself was at night,so he would stay up late trying to read books. Then he would be forced to get upvery early the next morning, and he was therefore in constant need of extrasleep.Antonio described how he was not allowed to sleep during the day, and there wasa butler who was assigned to do a regular patrol and make sure he was awake andworking when he was in his room. Antonio said the only way he could get enoughsleep was to put towels down on the cold tile floor in his bathroom. He wouldalways be half listening if the butler showed up, so he would just appear to beusing the toilet. He did feel that the butler became aware of what he was doing,and decided to allow him to sleep anyway. He finally escaped by getting placedin a boarding school, which was much better. At some point, his godfatherfinally began speaking to him and took Antonio under his wing. Antonioeventually found out that his godfather was apparently one of the top ninetyhighest-ranking members of a group they called the Illuminati, and Antonio’slate father had also been a member. Once Antonio became a teenager, hisgodfather granted him a job working in a Masonic bar in Spain to which only thehighest-level members of this secret order were invited. There were interestingcryptic symbols on the wall outside the bar, one of which was triangular. Thesesymbols indicated how high your rank must be in order to be welcomed inside.AN ANCIENT AND HIGHLY POWERFUL SECRET SOCIETYAntonio was told that the Illuminati were the secret rulers and controllers ofthe world. They had people in just about every country, from the highest levelson down. They were fabulously wealthy, and involved in just abouteverything—governments, militaries, corporations, religions, you name it. Theyhad a very complex and elaborate set of spiritual philosophies and practices,and everything they were doing was part of a greater, secret spiritualtradition, which they believed to be very ancient, from far before Christianitystarted. More than once, Antonio spoke ominously about “leather aprons,” whichare worn in Masonic lodges, and strongly implied that he had seen these peoplewearing them. He also felt, or was told, that this tradition went directly backto ancient Egypt. Luckily, he was apparently never initiated into theorganization. He remained a friend of very high-level people, but he was stilltechnically an outsider.The Illuminati believed in Atlantis, which I could easily accept, given all theresearch I had done. They also felt they were the surviving descendants of themighty civilization, and had retained many of its secrets that were lost to thegeneral public. That, to me, was very exciting. They taught Antonio that heshould never have a sexual release unless it was with a woman, as otherwise hewould be depleting his own supply of spiritual energy. They felt this spiritualenergy must be preserved, such as for magical work of various sorts that Antoniohad never been trained in, as well as for all-around vitality. This type ofstrict celibacy code is generally not found in positive spiritual teachings likethe Law of One, and it can easily create stress, frustration, and pent-upaggression. As we already discussed, the Law of One said in Session 46, Question12, that the deliberate repression of sexual desire magnifies the behavior ofnegatively polarized individuals in their violation of the free will of otherswhen the sexual activity is then allowed.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber384]Antonio started bringing in a new woman almost every week after he moved in withus. Any time I went out to a store with him, if he met a cute girl, he wouldtell her she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. This naturally couldnot be true for each woman he met, and was obviously a game he was playing tosee who was interested. He was incredibly smooth and unflinchingly confident,although Eric ended up being embarrassed by this and asked him not to do it whenthey were on an outing together. Whenever he got a new girl, we would never seethe former one again. Finally, one particularly attractive woman became hisgirlfriend—and she also befriended the rest of us. She had recovered from aheroin addiction when she was still a teenager, and she and I connected nicelyas two people who had successfully kicked a drug habit.Antonio’s godfather told him the Illuminati was an ancient secret society thatwas making sure humanity did not destroy itself. As an introduction, Antoniostrongly encouraged me to read a book from 1983 called The People of the Secret,by a man with the obvious pseudonym Ernest Scott. This was clearly a code name,indicating that the author considered himself to be an earnest Scottish RiteMason. The book was incredibly dense and hard to follow, though at times itcould be quite fascinating. Much of it, honestly, went well over my head, and Ifelt I wouldn’t be able to truly appreciate all its contents unless I had a PhDin European history. The cover features an image of planet Earth surrounded byan octagon, made out of what looks like thin, straight-lined comets, and thepublishing company called itself Octagon Press, Limited. The octagon is verylikely meant to indicate the shield symbol. Many whistleblowers have said thetop Illuminati family is the Rothschilds, and their last name translates as “RedShield” in German.2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber385]The core premise of The People of the Secret is that a Hidden Directorate ofnonterrestrial intelligence is secretly running our planet. I eventuallyrealized that in the Law of One series, this corresponded to the so-called OrionConfederation, which is discussed in 131 different passages.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber386] The first detailed response about the OrionConfederation as a source of some of the UFO sightings we are seeing in ourskies was given in Session 7, Questions 14 and 15:> Consider, if you will, a simple example of intentions which are bad/good. This> example is Adolf. This is your vibratory sound complex. The intention is to> presumably unify by choosing the distortion complex called elite from a social> memory complex, and then enslaving, by various effects, those who are seen as> the distortion of not-elite . . . [creating] a distortion thought of by the> so-called Orion group as an empire. The problem facing them is that they face> a great deal of random energy released by the concept of separation. This> causes them to be vulnerable as the distortions amongst their own members are> not harmonized. . . . Like the Confederation, the densities of the mass> consciousnesses which comprise that group are varied. There are a very few> third density, a larger number of fourth density, a similarly large number of> fifth density, and very few sixth-density entities comprising this> organization. Their numbers are perhaps one-tenth ours at any point in the> space/time continuum as the problem of spiritual entropy causes them to> experience constant disintegration of their social memory complexes.4> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber387]The People of the Secret goes on to say that this “Hidden Directorate”nonterrestrial intelligence communicates to a group of elite humans on Earthwhom the book calls the Hidden Executive. These elite humans have been throughmagical training and apparently can perform feats that most of us would considerto be superhuman. By the context, it would appear that Antonio’s godfather was aHidden Executive member, though I didn’t hear about him having any unusualabilities. The Hidden Executive in turn gives instructions to subordinates whohad to go through initiation, apparently into secret mystery schools and othersuch orders. Quite surprisingly, these so-called subordinates are people weidentify as kings, queens, presidents, prime ministers, and other top leaders invarious aspects of our society, who “take part in the ordinary life of nations,”usually without being detected by anyone. Notice that, in the above Law of Onequote, it says there are “a very few third density” members of the OrionConfederation, and that specifically refers to humans on Earth who arecooperating with this agenda. The People of the Secret also speaks of anelaborate and highly secret coordination that is occurring between religious andpolitical factions that are outwardly in violent, murderous conflict with eachother, such as the Vatican and Islam.Chapter 1 is entitled “The Hidden Tradition.” Chapter 2 is “A SecretDirectorate?” And chapter 3 is “The Inner Alliance: Rome, Christianity andIslam.” The covert alliance between Islam and the Vatican is a key themereappearing throughout the book. Special attention is also paid throughout tomystical Sufism as well as the Order of the Assassins, such as in chapter 9,“Freemasons, Sufis, (and) Initiatory Societies”; chapter 10, “Assassins,Kali-Worshippers, (and) Dervishes”; and chapter 12, “Sufi Discourses, Rituals(and) Initiation.” If the reader isn’t really paying attention, the book wouldsimply appear to be talking about these really cool Sufi spiritual teachingsthat this hidden group of people had brought in and apparently perfected.The highest-level Freemasons, from 32nd degree and upward, can become Shriners,and at this level they all wear red Sufi-style caps. The red is supposed tosymbolize that the fez, as the cap is called, has been “soaked in the blood ofthe infidel.” I remember seeing Shriners driving around in tiny, silly cars,wearing these same hats, in our local parades where I grew up in Scotia, NewYork. I found out only many years later from top insiders that a strong part ofthe Illuminati secret teachings were born of a hidden alliance between the RomanKnight Templars and the Islamic Order of the Assassins. This secret allianceapparently began during the Crusades. Many of the covert techniques still usedin the spy trade today were originally developed by the Assassins. The deeperIslamic philosophies and practices were later combined with Celtic, Egyptian,and Babylonian mysticism that the Roman Empire had researched and aggregated.INSTANCES OF THE WORD ILLUMINATII of course wanted to look for the word Illuminati and certain other variants ofit as I read the book, since Antonio had told me this was the name of hisgodfather’s group. One mention of the term appeared in a discussion of RogerBacon, who was born in 1214 and died in 1292. Bacon wore Arab clothing at Oxfordand had a controversial reputation, where people joked that he was able to “makewomen of devils and juggle cats into costermongers.” A costermonger is a personwho sells groceries in the streets. Bacon generated a large degree ofcontroversy by simultaneously appearing to support Christianity, while alsoasserting that there were far deeper mysteries to be explored that mostChristians knew nothing about, which he was bringing in from Arab traditions.The People of the Secret referred to Roger Bacon as “one of the greatest of theEuropean intellects and one of the most outstanding figures of all time.”5[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber388]On the next page, we see a word closely related to Illuminati, where it readsthat Bacon> cited the Wisdom of Illumination by the Sufi master (and martyr) Suhrawardi,> [who] had declared that his philosophy was that of the inner teaching of all> the ancients, Greek, Persian and Egyptian. It was the science of Light and> through it, man could attain to a state about which he could not normally even> dream. Bacon . . . declared that the same secret had been held by Noah,> Abraham, the Chaldean and Egyptian masters, Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Socrates> and the Sufis.6 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber389]Once I started reading more books on the subject and meeting certainwhistleblowers firsthand, I found out that the Illuminati like to take pieces ofinformation from all different spiritual traditions and combine them. However,there are some very clear, overarching themes that emerge, with which almosteveryone else would have a major problem. I will get to what Antonio ended uptelling me about this in his own words in a minute.Another quote that used similar words from earlier in the book was“‘Illuminism’ . . . injected into the European consciousness from the school of[the Islamic teacher] Ibn Masarra (883–931) in Cordoba, [Spain,] traced byProfessor Asin. From the experiences to which Masarra’s pupils were givenaccess, they were able to glimpse the heights to which human consciousness couldaspire.”7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber390] Other parts of the book do talkabout seemingly superhuman feats that various mystics were able to perform,including telekinesis. Again, all this might sound very interesting until youfind out the deeper levels of what the Illuminati have since gotten themselvesinto.On page 179, the word Illuminati actually appeared, as follows:> Afghanistan is therefore linked in the tradition of the “witches,” the> Anthroposophists, the Theosophists, the Buddhist Lamaists of Tibet, the> Vedantists, the Masons and the “Illuminati.” The single common factor is a> Sufic impulse emanating from Afghanistan. Roger Bacon, who lectured at Oxford> on the Illuminist philosophy . . . was careful to call it merely “Eastern.”8> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber391]The idea that Bacon had to be careful not to use the term Illuminati shows thateven in the 1200s, they were aware that this group had to be very covert aboutwhat they were really doing. This also demonstrates that the term illuminati wassecretly being used some five hundred years before Adam Weishaupt founded asociety of the same name in Bavaria. Most modern scholars argue that the termoriginated with Weishaupt’s group.THE WITCHCRAFT CONNECTIONThe reason for this secrecy becomes clear as you head into chapter 10,“Assassins, Kali-Worshippers [and] Dervishes.” I did not find it until I waswriting this book, and if I had found it back then, I would have been asking alot more questions. The author speaks with a seemingly inappropriate degree ofexcitement about a particular Assassin sect from India called Thuggee. Theorigin of the term thug in the English language comes from the Hindi word for“thief.” These people would find extraordinary pleasure in making friends with agroup of travelers whom they intended to murder and then burglarize. They wereso friendly that they were immediately trusted, no matter how suspicious theyappeared to be. They typically killed people by strangling them to death, andsaid that the murders caused an ecstasy that made everything else in life seemunimportant. British major general Sir William Sleeman nearly stamped them outand exposed many of their practices.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber392]From here, The People of the Secret becomes even more disturbing as it discussesthe overwhelming parallels between Sufism and witchcraft. I do understand thatsome people in today’s world are practitioners of Wicca, and might see it as anessentially positive practice. As we read through the book, it becomes veryclear that the type of witchcraft they are talking about is obviously related toblack magic and practices most people would immediately identify as being evil.The term Saracen is used frequently, and this is simply another name for anyonein the Middle Ages who practiced the religion of Islam.10[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber393] The author explains that witchcraft developedmost thoroughly in areas of Europe occupied by Saracens. This especiallyincluded Spain from the years 711 until 1492, after which time it was“Christianized.” This certainly does not imply that all Islam is negative innature, merely that a sect developed within these areas of Spain that beganpracticing what we would think of as black magic. The Law of One mentions Islamonce in Session 2, Question 2, where it said that “the one known as Muhammaddelivered the peoples into a more intelligible distortion of mind/body/spiritrelationships.”11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber394] Since Antonio’srecommendation for reading this book apparently came from top Illuminati membersbased in Spain, this connection between the Illuminati and certain Islamic sectsis definitely worthy of being pointed out.The book speaks with great reverence about “The Saracen Two-Horned Cult,”referring to the costumes they wear, featuring headdresses with two horns and alit flame between them. The author explains that witches use a ritual knifecalled an athame. He does not say what this knife would be used for, but lateron, we see that it almost certainly is a sacrificial dagger. The SaracenTwo-Horned Cult has a similar weapon called Adh-dhamme. The sound of the wordfor “ritual knife” in witchcraft, athame, is almost exactly the same asAdh-dhamme. Two-Horned Cult members ceremonially dance in a sheet they call akafan, which is very similar to the word coven, used to describe a group ofwitches. Two-Horned meetings are called Az-Zabat, which means “powerfuloccasion,” and this is very like the same word as Sabbat in witchcraft. Theauthor points out that the Sufi master Jalaluddin Rumi wrote about the idea ofriding on a stick, a theme very common in witchcraft.12[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber395]The author goes on to explain that the Two-Horned were a division of a Bedouintribe called the Aniza. The Two-Horned Cult migrated to Spain beginning in theyear 1460. The Arabic word for “goat” has the same consonant roots as Aniza, andthus the Two-Horned Cult adopted the goat as a symbol for their clan.As the chapter goes on, we learn about a leader of the Spanish Jews named RabbiIshaq Toledano, who welcomed the Two-Horned Cult and teamed up with them.13[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber396] He was specifically working with their magicalspells to see if he could use them to defeat their mutual Christian enemies.Rabbi Ishaq knew that if any of the specifics of the magic spells they wereusing against the Christian enemy emerged, they would all very likely betortured and killed. As a result, Rabbi Ishaq created loyalty and secrecy in thegroup by getting its members to do the most horrific crimes imaginable. There isa direct through line between what this group of people started doing and whatwe now hear from many Illuminati whistleblowers, including Svali.The group had levels of rank that became increasingly more difficult to achieve,with greater and greater levels of trust and secrecy. As a test to see who waswilling to advance in the community, the members were forced to torture and killpeople, particularly Christians. The group also created rituals involving sexualperversions and forcing people to eat “abominable material” that is notspecified. This appears to be a thinly veiled reference to cannibalism. Poisonsand drugs were also deployed to further bond the members. The sect worshipped anidol that the author says is “unspecified,” but very likely is goat-related,based upon the context. They would whip each other and trade “obscene kisses”while possessed by the idol’s apparent force.The Muslim writer Abdus Salam ibn Zumairi wrote, 130 years later, a verythorough description of the Two-Horned Cult in Spain. His words implied that itwas still alive and well during the time he was there, before getting deported.He also claimed that the cult members could fly,14[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber397] However, this was likely a myth perpetuated tocreate fear and awe in the people who heard about them.READ THE FINAL CHAPTER TO GET THE MESSAGEThe final chapter of The People of the Secret is very short, and says someprovocative things. It summarizes clues that have been dropped throughout thebook, to reveal that this Illuminati group was being guided and influenced bysome sort of extraterrestrial or otherwise non-Earth human intelligence. Thename the author gives for this mysterious intelligence is the HiddenDirectorate. I did read this final chapter and eventually saw its obvioussimilarities to what the Law of One series was referring to as the OrionConfederation.The passage you are about to read is preceded by a discussion in which theauthor asserts that the Earth is at a low level of consciousness, and thatEarth’s people have to be directed, behind the scenes, to make choices that thishidden, nonphysical intelligence feels are in its best interests. The authorthen says, on page 251:> Responsibility for this process [of guiding people to make certain choices] on> Earth lies with an Intelligence which has been called The Hidden Directorate.> This may correspond to the level symbolized in occult legend as an Individual> (e.g., “The Regent” [which translates as “The Ruler”] or “The Ancient of Days”> [an apparent term for God that appears in the Book of Daniel], etc.). It is to> be equated either with the Demi-Urgic level or with the level immediately> below. No grounds exist for an opinion as to whether this Intelligence is, in> any sense, comprehensible to man, a single or a composite Intelligence, or> whether it is discarnate or corporeal.> > Below this level, certain levels of ordinary humanity, in whom qualitative> changes have taken place, are in touch with the Directorate and may at> intervals share its consciousness. This group of advanced human individuals is> what has been referred to as the Hidden Executive. It is the reality behind> all legends of “masters” and “initiates” from earliest historical times to the> present. There may be several Centres on earth from which the Executive> operates, corresponding to the division of responsibility for humanity> assigned before the Withdrawal of 12,000 years ago.

The> executive also operates at the level of ordinary life through a descending> order of initiated subordinates. These take part in the ordinary life of> nations and are almost wholly, but not quite, unsuspected. These are the> Secret People.There is much to explore in this section alone. “The Ancient of Days” is a nameusually associated with God in the Old Testament Book of Daniel. The concept ofthe Demiurge comes out of Gnosticism,15 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber398] and asthe years went by and I encountered more and more insider information, Idiscovered that the Illuminati believe that the God of the Abrahamictraditions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—is a false god. The term Demiurgeliterally translates as “Worker for the People,”16[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber399] and Gnostics also call it the “Half-God,”which is how they see the God most people identify with. They actually seeLucifer as the misunderstood good guy who authored the ancient mystery schoolteachings.In the Illuminati religious view, Lucifer apparently wishes to free us from the“encumbrances” of ethics and morality—which they believe restrict our freedom.You can see this on Gnosis.org, a major Gnostic website, where it says, “If thewords ‘ethics’ or ‘morality’ are taken to mean a system of rules, thenGnosticism is opposed to them both. Such systems usually originate with theDemiurge and are covertly designed to serve his purposes.”17[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber400]This is where everything starts to take a serious turn for the worse. Although Isupport religious freedom, if you use spirituality as an excuse to rape,torture, and kill people, that can no longer be ignored. The writers ofGnosis.org probably would never take it this far, but multiple insiders haveassured me that this is the basis of the secret religion of the elite. Lucifer,in this case, could be the ultimate identity of what this book is calling theHidden Directorate, since in their religion, Lucifer is greatly superior to theDemiurge. The Illuminati further believe that karma applies only to people whofollow the “Slave Religions,” and that their group operates more like a naturalforce, such as a wildfire—without any karmic repercussions whatsoever.Then, in the above passage from Secret, we also notice this strange, offhandedmention of “the Withdrawal of 12,000 years ago.” This does not appear to beexplained elsewhere in the book, but it is a clear and obvious reference to thefall of Atlantis. As the years went by, I found that the secret Illuminatireligion absolutely believes Atlantis is real and that there were gods on theEarth in those days who withdrew and abandoned them. The people were then forcedto endure the Great Flood. Many of them perished, and their survivors collectedwhat little remained of their advanced, technological civilization and preservedit in secret. Many of these records ultimately ended up in the Vatican Library.The survivors hoped to regain control of the Earth and usher in the “New WorldOrder,” as they called it. The end of the above passage also makes it clear thatthe title of the book, The People of the Secret, refers to this same Illuminatigroup of terrestrial power brokers.Notice also that they keep steering the reader back to Afghanistan. Althoughthis may well be the origin of key Islamic traditions they use, they alsomention that there are “other Centres corresponding to various ethnic groups” aswell. The most important centers for their organization are never mentioned.Based on extensive research, these centers would obviously include Vatican Cityin Rome, which is considered the spiritual capital of the organization, and theCity of London in England, which is considered its financial capital. As I haveoften said in my lectures, Washington, DC, was historically considered itsmilitary capital, though that definitely appears to have changed as of the timeof this writing. Each of these cities is labeled as a major Illuminati center byhaving a prominent obelisk statue on display. Overall, these people arecertainly not “unsuspected” in today’s age, thanks to a much larger publicawakening that has occurred—predominantly owing to the liberating power of theInternet. I was definitely getting information well ahead of the curve byhearing all of this back in 1996, just as the Internet was getting started. Ihave definitely played an important part in helping to foster this overallawakening, having written and spoken about this well ahead of many others.Now we will continue with this same quote from right where we left off in ThePeople of the Secret. Once again, it features an encoded reference that does notappear to be mentioned elsewhere in the book. In this case, it is talking aboutthe same solar event that we keep hearing about in so many Ascension prophecies.However, here the story has been twisted around and remixed into a new,Luciferian version of Ascension, which they here call “soul-making” and “TheGreat Work.” The passage reads as follows:> When “the solar wind blows,” a major operation of soul-making is begun by the> Directorate. As a result, a relatively large number of human individuals may> complete a significant part of The Great Work in a single generation. A small> number may reach completion. Both categories will serve the evolutionary> process of mankind thereafter, but their postmortem situations may be> different.18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber401]THE RABBIT HOLE GETS EVEN DEEPERI couldn’t really make it through The People of the Secret at the time, so Icontinued to ask Antonio as many questions as I could. Along the way, I keptlearning a variety of strange and at times disturbing things. First of all,Antonio told me that the Illuminati would deliberately create destructive warsfor various purposes, which they felt were ultimately benevolent. The onlyexample he could give me was that he was told they might start a war along aborder between two countries. The violence along this border preventsimmigration from occurring. They feel this is a positive thing, because itprevents certain groups from intermingling, which apparently they did not want,for whatever reason. They felt that certain poorer groups would create violenceand humanitarian crises, and in various cases, they wanted to keep these groupsseparate from one another.Antonio often said there was a terrible amount of information that he knew butdid not want to say. This could easily include information about highlyunethical sexual practices and ritual magic. One of the things he did admit towas that he was quite certain that AIDS was of artificial origin. More thananything else he ever told me, he felt that this was the deadliest thing heknew. He would not go into very much detail, and said that other people withthis information whom he personally knew had already been killed. The obviousimplication was that the Illuminati had manufactured this disease themselves,and one of their main goals was to sizably reduce Earth’s population. As theyears went by, many other insiders would tell me exactly the same thing. Then,in 2019, the movie Cold Case Hammarskjöld featured Alexander Jones, an insiderwho testified to his personal involvement in spreading AIDS throughout theAfrican continent on an industrial scale.19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber402],20[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber403] This mass depopulation agenda appears to beone of the main “terrible secrets” that Antonio was too afraid to go into anydetail about, beyond his disclosure about AIDS.Antonio also revealed that the Illuminati were directly involved in the UFOarena on the highest of high levels. This fit in very nicely with what my friendArtie had told me. When I told Antonio about the stories of the photographingegg and the crystal antigravity gun, he again acted like they were no big deal,and just a small part of what there was to know. From the various things Antoniotold me, it became obvious that the Illuminati were hiding incredible secrets.As an example, Antonio was quite certain that a small number of human-lookingextraterrestrial beings were living on Earth now. He said they would appearhuman in almost every way, and could blend right in with the rest of us withoutdetection. He wouldn’t give me any other information, which was frustrating,including how he’d even found out about it in the first place. Many otherinsiders would end up telling me the same thing as the years went by. The SecretSpace Program apparently has these ETs under very tight surveillance, and theyhave earned trust after many years of behaving themselves.Antonio was frequently obsessed with talking about the megalithic stonearchitecture of a site in the Pacific Islands of Micronesia, called Nan Madol.He felt this was one of the best and most overlooked megalithic architecturalsites on Earth. Somewhere in this same general vicinity, he spoke of an islandwhere the natives had an extraterrestrial artifact they were carefully guarding.He said you would have to risk your own death to go and see it. The rumor wasthat if these natives let you in to see this purported extraterrestrialartifact, the site had some weird technology that would shrink your head sizesomehow when you went in, but you could still think. I literally laughed in hisface when he said that, but he claimed it was absolutely true. That is still notsomething I have ever heard any other insider tell me about after all theseyears, though very bizarre and quirky details like this do frequently appearwhen you are interviewing real insiders. More than one insider has told me aboutislands on Earth that have holographic cloaking, hidden advanced technology, orother mysterious and publicly unknown secrets.Antonio then said that after World War II, the Japanese sailed into the harborof this same island and found large, flat sheets of platinum under the sand nearthe shoreline. The Japanese saw this as a useful metal and pulled out theplatinum sheets for their own industrial use. That made me far more interestedand intrigued by this otherwise silly-sounding story, since the platinum wasobviously a tangible artifact. When I asked him to please tell me what in theworld was so important inside this island that the natives were hiding, hefinally came out with it. He told me that they had a sarcophagus with somethingin it that would “make the Roswell alien autopsy look like nothing.” Twentyyears later, Corey Goode would tell me about “Stasis Beings” that have beenfound around the world in various secret locations. These beings are people whoused some sort of very ancient time-accelerating technology to put themselvesinto a protective bubble. They program the stasis field to fast-forward themthrough time, and not to deactivate itself until we are right on the verge ofAscension. These beings are apparently interesting to see, as they are insuspended animation.At the time, I was also excited by the public release of the alleged alienautopsy film that was found by Ray Santilli. Antonio dismissed it out of hand,and said he was told that if you did the research, it would ultimately traceback to Steven Spielberg’s own company, Amblin Entertainment. He never told meexactly how he learned this, but he was quite certain about it. He did say,though, that the film was almost an exact duplicate of the actual originalfootage, so much so that there was hardly any difference at all between the two.He implied that if the Illuminati ever had a need to discredit UFOs, they couldfirst promote this film and then reveal exactly how it was all faked. This wouldinclude showing us behind-the-scenes footage of the set and the props that wereused.THE TWENTY-SIX BOXESAntonio’s weirdest story of all dealt with the Masonic bar. One night, one ofhis godfather’s high-level friends had a dire emergency, and required animmediate team of trusted individuals to help. The consequences of this missioncould easily be deadly. The insider had twenty-six boxes of highly classifieddocuments stored in his attic, and somehow his security cover had been blown.Apparently, there were warring factions within the Illuminati and the insiderwas on the losing side in this particular case. He apparently had smuggled thesedocuments out of a secure facility somewhere and kept them in a privatecollection, which was considered to be an unacceptable risk. The boxes now hadto be moved very quickly. Although Antonio was extremely terrified, he joined upwith this team and ensured that the boxes were moved to a safe location.Once they completed the frantic movement of the twenty-six boxes, Antonio wasgiven a reward for risking his life to help them. They allowed him to pick oneof the boxes, open it, and inspect its contents. Up until then, none of them hadtold him anything about ETs or UFOs, nor had he ever been initiated into theirorder. Antonio excitedly opened a box and was amazed by what he saw. The firstdocument resting on top was from the United States government, and was secretlycirculated to the leadership of every country in the world. It was a documentoutlining the protocols for what they should do if a UFO crash-landed in theircountry. The document cast a veil of incredible fear around the whole idea. Theyclaimed threats could be in these UFOs that could include viruses that couldwipe out all life on Earth, or hostile aliens with hyper-advanced weaponry. Thedocument said the United States had experience handling these various incidentssuccessfully, and therefore any such crash should be reported to the US militaryfor immediate “disposal.” This way, the military wing of the Illuminatiattempted to ensure that no other countries got any new technology to playaround with and back-engineer.Antonio also saw a photograph of a triangular-shaped UFO coming up out of thejungle, where you could actually see plants draping over its sides. He said hehas never seen any UFO photograph in the everyday world that was anywhere nearas amazing-looking as this one. Then he saw a photo that looked like the arm ofan extraterrestrial being. It was clearly humanlike, but had distinctivedifferences. It was only at this point, he said, that he started to have agenuine panic attack. The weirdest thing he found in the box, however, was adescription of something that they called “The Spirit of the Rock.” Variousphotographs of rock outcroppings were taken where you could see what appeared tobe a humanlike face. They apparently believed this was not just an opticalillusion but an actual manifestation of a spiritual consciousness that hadformed in the rock. The document said that once this entity occupied the rock,it would naturally erode the surface in a way that formed a noticeable face forthose who knew what they were looking for. They also claimed to be able toconnect with these spirits. I wasn’t sure if I believed any of that, other thansomething you could easily come up with while you were on LSD or otherpsychedelics, but it was certainly an interesting story.Once the story of the twenty-six boxes came in, it became very clear to me thatthe Illuminati had to be controlling the military-industrial complex, and weretherefore ultimately responsible for the UFO cover-up. Clearly, they were deadlyserious about these secrets never leaking out to the public. Even theirhighest-level members could be killed for attempting to hold any privatecollection of these sorts of documents. This data was connecting very preciselywith everything Artie had told me, and now I was gaining information about thehighest levels of this same group. I did see this as another manifestation ofsynchronicity. Information was coming at me from every direction and I had topiece it all together.Antonio insisted that these were the good guys, but I had a very hard timeaccepting how deliberately creating false wars and releasing the AIDS virus intoour society could ever be seen as a good thing. I became increasingly skepticalabout this hyperwealthy group and their intentions as I kept listening. The Lawof One was speaking extensively about the “negative elite,” and thesedescriptions sounded precisely similar to Antonio’s Illuminati. The Law of Onealso said the negative elite were ultimately being run by a malevolentextraterrestrial group that had a local headquarters in the constellation Orion.They were therefore called the “Orion Crusaders” or other similar variants inthe Law of One. This negative extraterrestrial intelligence closely aligned withthe concept of the Hidden Directorate in The People of the Secret. The very endof this book also implied that you might be invited into the organization onceyou learned of it.As time went on and our friendship grew, Antonio ended up really blasting meabout my UFO research. He felt that the vast majority of all UFO researchers didnot actually believe in what they were talking about. Instead, the reason theywork so hard, for so many years, is that they secretly are trying to convincethemselves that it is all really true. Something in them is never satisfied withthe answers they uncover, and they keep trying to find more and more informationto ease this hunger for truth. Antonio certainly had learned the truth, beyondany shadow of a doubt, and he felt that this had completely transformed him. Hetold me that I would never really be anything significant as a UFO researcherunless I allowed myself to accept that UFOs really did exist. Once I no longerfelt the need to try to convince myself of something this obvious, it would bemuch easier to make progress in the work. I wouldn’t be plagued with theself-doubt of researchers who are really doing it only to try to ease their ownpervasive skepticism.I urged Antonio to go out into the world and share what he had heard withothers, as he might be able to help people get a greater view of reality. He didnot feel this would do any good. His main goal was to write a book aboutspiritual growth, because he felt that nothing we do with this information willbe any good if people do not learn to become more caring and loving first. Thatwas an interesting perspective that I certainly could agree with, and it showedthat in spite of his insistence that they were “the good guys,” he had notactually bought into the ideology of his godfather’s elite friends.Furthermore, Antonio told me that Zecharia Sitchin, the author of GenesisRevisited, was a good friend of his godfather’s, and ultimately became friendswith Antonio as well. I had already disagreed with many of Sitchin’s conclusionson my own, and we talked about this at some length. I felt that Sitchin wastaking a very complex subject, where multiple, different extraterrestrial raceswere involved, and trying to boil it all down to one race of Anunnaki that couldbe traced back to Sumer and then on to every other country and culture on Earth.To me, it was all far too reductive. There are obviously a wide variety ofextraterrestrial civilizations that have interacted with Earth over time.Antonio revealed that the Illuminati were telling Sitchin what to say, with adefinite agenda behind it. Some of the things that Sitchin had purported totranscribe were simply things they had told him they wanted him to say, and theway they wanted him to say them. All this was apparently being done to set thestage for a future event where they intended to reveal far more of themselvesand their agenda to the public. I would hear much more about this from insiderssuch as Svali as the years went by, and they referred to this anticipated eventas “The Revealing.” Ironically, I ended up alone with Sitchin in an elevator ata conference a year or so before his death. I had already publicized whatAntonio had told me by this point. Sitchin was completely terrified of me, andbacked up against the wall of the elevator with his eyes wide. I made eyecontact with him but did not engage. He knew that I knew, and that was more thanenough.HIPPIE HOUSEMATE’S STRANGE ADVENTURENot long after Antonio moved into his apartment in the Schoolhouse, ourhousemate Jack moved out. In Jack’s place, we got a tall hippie guy with longred hair and John Lennon Coke-bottle glasses, whom I will call Ron. He had acontract to work as a caretaker for our landlady and pay off part of his rentthat way. Ron loved to find abandoned houses and walk into them. In many cases,memorabilia would be left in the houses that provided a stunning window throughtime. Ron also taught us that when people threw all their garbage into thebackyard, and then decades went by, everything would rot away except the glass.Ron therefore found places where you could go “bottle digging” and unearth veryinteresting glass bottles that were far more dynamic than what we typically seetoday. Eric and I did this at one of Ron’s sites near the house, and we did findsome really nice collectible stuff.Ron loved to walk around in the woods, in places no one else would ever go. Onetime, he was walking alongside a creek, and he saw a drainage culvert that waslarge enough for him to walk into. It was mostly covered over by plant growth.Once he went inside, he was quite surprised, as he was able to keep walking forquite some distance. He always kept a flashlight with him in case he found anabandoned house he wanted to go into. Eventually, Ron came up to a set of closedblast doors, with a red LED light and a camera at the top. He had no idea whatmight happen, but he fearlessly kept walking toward the doors. Once he gotclose, the doors suddenly opened and two men in military fatigues were standingthere. Both of them were carrying machine guns. They told him to turn around,walk away, and never tell anyone what he saw or where he went, and this would behis only warning. I told him about the legends of underground bases that I hadheard about in our area, and he had apparently found one of their secretentrances. Antonio said he was “very stupid” and could easily have gottenhimself killed.This curious event that happened to Ron, coupled with the ongoing stories fromAntonio, made me soon realize that I did not like or trust the Illuminati. Itseemed clear that this was the group at the epicenter of the UFO cover-up. Theywere hiding technologies from us that could save the planet. If they were indeedtrying to greatly reduce Earth’s population, it was quite hard to imagine howthey could think of themselves as working on behalf of our greater good. Ifoverpopulation is a genuine problem, it is Nature’s job to solve the matter. Itis not our place to step in, think we have all the answers, and decide to act asif we are akin to God. We have more than enough support from extraterrestrialsin the higher realms who guard over and watch our planet to ensure our safety.It is completely inappropriate for any group of human beings to take it uponthemselves to try to “solve the problem” by attempting to kill billions ofpeople. Yet, this is exactly what the negative extraterrestrials want—to createas much misery and pain and suffering on Earth as possible. In so doing, theycreate energy they feed upon for their survival, which insiders in classifiedprograms refer to as “loosh.” Hence they apparently have a saying, “Give Luciushis Loosh.”In Session 43, Questions 6 and 7, of the Law of One, it says, “The thought-formentities feed upon fear. . . . These entities are, shall we say, creatures ofthe Orion group.” Then earlier in Session 16, Question 45, in describing onetype of Orion being that causes cattle mutilations, it says, “These entities maytake any thought-form associated with an emotion of fear or terror.”21[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber404] This could obviously include areptilian/demonic-looking form, as many insiders have reported with theso-called Draco Reptilian negative ETs. Importantly, in the next passage,Question 46, it also said that these entities cannot directly attackthird-density beings like us.22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber405] In passagessuch as Session 11, Question 18, it is explained that they must trick our ownpeople into doing their bidding: “Contact is made [by the negative ETs] withthose who call. Those then upon the planetary sphere act much as do you todisseminate the attitudes and philosophy of their particular understanding ofthe Law of One, which is service to self. These become the elite. Through these,the attempt begins to create a condition whereby the remainder of the planetaryentities are enslaved by their own free will.”23[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber406]ANOTHER PROPHETIC DREAM ENCOURAGES WRITINGDuring this same time frame, another powerful dream came in on April 13, 1996. Iwas still reading the Law of One series as much as I could, and with Antonio’sinformation, I was connecting even more dots. In this dream, everyone seemedlike they were on the run from a hideous creature. It was a huge, spindly spiderwith a stylized, robotic-looking Gray-type alien head that had glowing eyes.They were all trying to keep one step ahead of it, and this continued throughmany small subplots. I felt dread, knowing that this entity was getting closerand closer. Finally, at the end of the dream the monster caught up with me. Icould not find any escape, nor could I even move. I was very afraid.At this point, the head suddenly sprouted upward, and the spider legstransformed into a thin, standing extraterrestrial humanoid form. Its entirebody now seemed to be glowing with a luminescent green energy, and the eyes werevery prominent, burning with light. Suddenly, the creature shot some form ofthought wave at me, which I could physically feel and see. At this point, a windtunnel of books started flying at me from behind the creature. Each book waseither whizzing past my body or was actually crashing into me. As each of themwent by, I realized that these were all the different books about metaphysicsand extraterrestrials that I had been reading over the last three years! Whatwas even more remarkable was that I became aware of the complete range ofknowledge that each book contained as it zipped past.So much information was coming into my mind all at once that I could hardlybelieve it. I should have been completely overwhelmed by this, but somehow I wasable to take it all in. The contents of these books were fusing together likenever before. I was catching my first real glimpse of some kind of Grand UnifiedTheory of Metaphysics. This was a concept that would somehow synthesize all myresearch into one body of work. I woke up from the dream truly stunned. Irealized that no one else had put together a worldview like the one I was nowseeing, and it very much needed to be heard and appreciated. Although I had seenin my mind holographic constructs of how my research fit together for a longtime, this dream suddenly caused it to become far more ornate and complex, whileat the same time being much easier to understand as a meta-message. Theinitially fearsome appearance of the being showed that people have to face allsorts of fears of the unknown just to begin a study of this subject, no matterhow positive it turns out to be. Our fear-based conditioning from the negativeelite runs very deep.The next day, I had a dream in which the logo of the place I was working for wasemblazoned onto a football helmet that also looked exactly like the hat of aSpanish conquistador. On one level, it seemed to be saying I wasn’t getting paidenough and I should look for another job. As I wrote this thought in my notebookthat morning, the furnace made a loud bang, which seemed to provide furthersynchronistic support to the message. On another level, it could be read assaying that Antonio’s elite Spanish friends were indeed planetary conquerors,just as they were described in the Law of One. Since the place where I workedwas caring for developmentally disabled people, there was also the obviousimplication that the elite organization Antonio had been exposed to had someserious blind spots in their philosophy. A week after this dream, on April 21, Ihad the epic event where I went to Robin’s Food Warehouse, had all thesesynchronicities in the weight and price of the items, and then reached aparticular country intersection on North Ohioville Road where I had asynchronicity on my odometer and my clock at the same time.Then, six days later, on April 27, I had another very powerful dream, which hasstayed with me for the rest of my life. I was walking down a street fromdowntown Schenectady that I recognized from my youth. I noticed a slightlyUFO-shaped cloud in the sky at first, and then another one that looked verysimilar. Suddenly, two silver UFO craft clearly appeared in the sky. They almostseemed to be in a dogfight with each other. I kept saying over and over again,“What the hell is that?” Then I grabbed a passerby, pointed at the craft, andsaid, “Do you think that is a helicopter?” I was very excited and wanted to makesure I had a second opinion, and a witness for my sighting. They didn’t saymuch, and were just staring at the event like I was. The craft kept changingbetween UFOs and helicopters as the dream progressed. At times they flew veryclose to me, almost directly over my head, but there was no wind like therewould be with a helicopter.I raised my arms in a gesture of peace and walked toward them, even though I wasfeeling very strange about the whole thing. As I approached, the craft beganspinning at the middle quite wildly. They compressed and then merged into onesingle form that was only about two feet wide. This extremely fast-rotatingobject slammed down into the Earth in a massive, spinning vortex, causing theground to shake as it crashed. Once it made a landing, it finally became still.As I approached the object, I realized that it was an angular, aircraft-shaped,sharp-edged telephone. The phone then started ringing, and the dream endedbefore I had decided whether or not to pick it up. I somehow knew that thepositive extraterrestrials were telling me they wanted me to contact them as aresult of this dream message. I was astonished to go back and review this dreamwith what I know now. The drawing I made of the UFOs in the dream looked almostprecisely identical to the “Anshar Bus Craft” that Corey Goode had been seeingsince 2016, and had commissioned artwork for. I knew this dream was clearlytelling me that one way or another, the extraterrestrials wanted to speak withme.Then, on May 1, I attended a basketball game and ate French fries while I wasthere. This was not at all something I would normally do. When I got into mycar, the odometer said 126664. Now, 666 is not a positive number synchronicityas a general rule, and I interpreted it as a major statement against the idea ofeating fries. As I continued thinking this was a definite no, I looked up andsaw a phone number on a billboard that ended in 666. Then I immediately lookedback at the odometer, and it was now 126666. Even the tenths was almost exactlyat 6 as I passed the sign. Clearly, I was being guided to improve my diet.Combined with the other messages, this seemed to be another key element toestablishing contact with positive extraterrestrials.Things were getting very, very interesting . . . to say the least. These andmany other synchronicities led up to my discovering the true meaning andidentity of the Watchers in the Betty Andreasson case, and seeing howbeautifully this material integrated with the Law of One series. This was whereI really became convinced that we were in a spiritual battle with darkness, andthat each of us was faced with choices that would determine where we end upgoing as this Ascension event finally comes to pass."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOTHE WATCHERSAlthough my memory and notes are not specific enough to be exactly certain ofthe timing, I believe that it was in April or May of 1996 that I first foundWatchers II by Raymond Fowler. This was a follow-up to the Betty Andreassoncase, and provided a wealth of additional details that had not appeared in hisprevious books. While writing this book, I had admittedly forgotten many of thespecific details of Betty’s strange and wonderful ET-related adventures in thetwenty-three years since I last read about them. Once I went back and reviewedWatchers II while finalizing my book, I was stunned to discover that certainspecific aspects of Corey Goode’s experiences were almost precisely identical towhat happened to Betty Andreasson Luca. In fact, the biggest problem we arelikely to have now is people thinking that Corey must have based his testimonyon Watchers II to begin with. Nothing could be further from the truth. I feelthe only logical explanation for these pieces fitting together so well isbecause we are dealing with truthful information. It’s as simple as that.A GLOWING ENDORSEMENTOnce I got to Session 53 of the Law of One series, I was quite surprised to seethat the Betty Andreasson material was given a positive, if not glowingendorsement, as follows:> The entities in this [Betty Andreasson contact] and some other vividly> remembered cases are those who, feeling the need to plant Confederation> imagery in such a way as not to abrogate free will, use the symbols of death,> resurrection, love, and peace as a means of creating, upon the thought level,> the time/space illusion of a systematic train of events which give the message> of love and hope. This type of contact is chosen by careful consideration of> Confederation members which are contacting an entity of like home vibration,> if you will. This project then goes before the Council of Saturn and, if> approved, is completed. The characteristics of this type of contact include> the nonpainful nature of thoughts experienced and the message content which> speaks not of doom but of the new dawning age.1> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber407]As we can see, this contact was given “careful consideration” by members of theConfederation, including our own local governing body that the highest-leveldecisions apparently must pass through, the Council of Saturn. Ra also indicatesthat these messages are intended to help us understand that we are heading intoAscension, and that this process is not doom and gloom in nature. Fowler’soriginal book, The Andreasson Affair, came out in February 1980, so this was afresh, hot topic in UFOlogy at the time the session was conducted in 1981. Mostimportant, Betty had remembered contact only with Gray-style extraterrestrialsat the time The Andreasson Affair was written. Ra’s statement in the Law of Oneseries clearly suggests that Betty’s recollections are accurate, and that thereis indeed a positive aspect to the contactee phenomenon.THE GRAYS ARE THE EYES AND EARS OF THE ELDERSAs I said earlier, in the book I read on the train in 1995, the Grays contactingBetty referred to themselves as The Watchers. They said they were caretakers ofthe Earth and all life upon it—carefully and systematically storing a vastdiversity of genetic codes for humans as well as plants and animals. This againfit very nicely with Dr. Courtney Brown’s data showing Gray ETs being involvedin transferring life from one planet to another. Once I read Watchers II, thestory became far more interesting. In this volume, it was revealed that theGrays were akin to biological robots, and Betty got to meet the beings who wereworking with the Grays and really running the show. These beings calledthemselves Elders.Betty’s description of the Elders fit precisely with the Midwayers that Dr.Brown had reported, the Anshar that Corey Goode would encounter in 2016, and thebeings I had been seeing in my dreams throughout my entire life. Betty’shusband, Bob Luca, was actually the first one to have seen them in the narrativeof Watchers II, during a regression he was having that was reported on page 30.Betty’s own encounter with them begins on page 89, after she visited acigar-shaped mothership. She saw a man who looked human like us but was abouttwo feet taller than usual. He had whitish-colored hair, pale white skin, and along white robe. Betty then remembered having seen people who looked like himbefore. This is a perfect description of one type of what various high-levelinsiders have called “Tall Whites.”MILLIONS OF CONTACTEE EXPERIENCESBefore we go into the fascinating details that Betty obtained from the Elders, Iwant to synergize the data in Watchers and Watchers II pertaining to theabduction phenomenon. Until I read this, I had no idea how far-reaching in scopethis situation really was, and how many people it seemed to be affecting. Earlyin the book, we learn that the Roper Organization conducted three major nationalsurveys on cases of possible ET abduction in 1991.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber408] The Bigelow Holding Corporation published ananalysis of the results, which was then sent to nearly 100,000 mental healthprofessionals, including psychiatrists and psychologists. The Roper reportindicated that a stunning 2 percent of American adults had a constellation ofexperiences that strongly suggested they had gone through an ET abduction.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber409] With an American population of roughly 300million, that would indicate that 6 million people in America alone may haveexperienced abduction. That number was honestly much higher than what I wasexpecting to hear.Equally significant was a 1987 study by Dr. Thomas E. Bullard on UFO abductioncases.4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber410] The study was commissioned by the Fundfor UFO Research, and added up to 642 pages in two volumes. Dr. Bullard analyzeda total of over three hundred different independent reports and concluded thatthey had far too many similarities to be hoaxes or random fantasies.5[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber411] Since this data was analyzed back in 1987, itwas well before the concept of abduction had become anywhere near as mainstreamas it is today. Most interestingly, on page 242 of Watchers II, we find that theBullard study concluded that the abduction experience usually had very positivespiritual aspects within it. This is quite different from the massive propagandacampaign the negative elite have mounted ever since, such as through countless“alien invasion” movies. These positive, spiritual events would occur over thecourse of an eight-stage contact process that everyone seemed to go through, asfollows: 1. Capture. Witness is caught and taken aboard a UFO. 2. Examination. Witness experiences an examination. 3. Conference. Witness talks with ETs for a period of time. 4. Tour. ETs allow witness to see parts of their ship. 5. Otherworldly Journey. Witness visits a strange, mystical place. 6. Theophany. Witness has a beautiful religious experience. 7. Return. Witness returns and departs from ship. 8. Aftermath. Aftereffects and other unusual events.6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber412]This pattern of events certainly matched up nicely with the research of Harvardpsychiatrist Dr. John Mack. In his classic book Abduction, we find that thecontactees remembered having volunteered to participate in this process beforethey were born. Though they might have some anxiety in the initial stages, atsome point, their deeper memories kick in. Everything we see in Dr. Bullard’slist, from stage 3 and onward, is a very positive and uplifting experience, andagain it is quite amazing that these stages remained consistent across more thanthree hundred independent reports.Then when we consider that six million or more Americans alone may have beenthrough this process, with their memories of these events being almost entirelyobscured by deliberately induced amnesia, this becomes an extremely fascinatingphenomenon to study in more detail. We also hear in the introduction to TheWatchers that contactees are often given white gowns to wear, and they see otherhuman-looking people in similar clothing. In the 1970s and early ’80s, it wasalso common for black, unmarked helicopters to appear on these people’s propertyafter the fact, flying well below regulation airspace. A fair number of photosof these have been taken, and they are usually unmarked versions of variousconventional types of helicopters.7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber413] Theoriginal book on Betty, The Andreasson Affair, has some of these pictures. Thetechnology used by the negative elite has since become far more advanced thanhelicopters and flies with a cloaking system known as “masking” that makes thecrafts almost 100 percent invisible.WHO ARE THE WATCHERS?Since the Law of One strongly endorsed the Andreasson material as being credibleand positive in nature, the question then becomes who these Watchers really are,and whether or not they show up in history. Some readers might want to jump tothe conclusion that all Watchers must be evil. There is indeed a negative groupidentified as Watchers in the apocryphal Book of Enoch. However, there areundeniable references to positive Watchers in the Book of Enoch as well. InEnoch 12:4–7, we read:> And behold the Watchers called me Enoch the scribe. Then the Lord said to me:> Enoch, scribe of righteousness, go tell the Watchers of heaven, who have> deserted the lofty sky . . . who have been polluted with women and have done> as the sons of men do, by taking to themselves wives, and who have been> greatly corrupted on the earth, that on the earth, they shall never obtain> peace and remission of sin.What we see in the above passage is that the name Watchers appears to refer toextraterrestrial angelic groups. It was only once one of these groups decided to“desert the lofty sky” and mate with people of Earth that they became fallenWatchers, or Nephilim. Another example of a positive mention of Watchers comesin the Old Testament of the Bible, in chapter 4 of Daniel. Consider thefollowing passages from the original King James Version of the Bible. Danielactually receives his classic prophetic vision from two beings, one called aWatcher and the other called a “holy one,” which is probably one of the angelic,human-looking Elders:4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and anholy one came down from heaven . . .4:17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word ofthe holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rulethin the kingdom of men . . .4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down fromheaven . . .8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber414]In the original Watchers book, we read that the earliest church fathers believedthat celestial beings could be physical and sexual in nature. This was onlylater rejected.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber415] The Chaldeans also believedin beings who would look over the affairs of humankind on Earth. Their name forthis class of celestial entity is Ir, which is pronounced the same as Ur andtranslates as “Watcher.”10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber416],11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber417]THE LAW OF ONE, THE GUARDIANS, AND THE WATCHERSAs I was finishing this book, I went back to the Law of One series to see if theterm watcher ever appears there. I found five separate instances in the Law ofOne where the words guard and watch are used together in the same passage. Guardis a clear reference to another term, guardians, which appears in twentydifferent passages throughout the series.12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber418]The guardians are described as highly benevolent extraterrestrials who ensurethat we are guarded and protected, and that no harm comes to us over and abovewhat we have directly authorized through our own karma. Therefore, when we seethese five instances of guard and watch being used together, the clearimplication is that Guardians are one key type of Watchers. The first instanceof this pairing of the two terms is in Session 6, Question 14, where Ra wasanswering a question about the Ascension process. Part of their answer was “This[Ascension] process is guarded or watched by those nurturing beings who, beingvery close to the Law of One in their distortions, nevertheless have thedistortion towards active service.”The second time we see the terms paired is in Session 7, Question 9. Ra isspeaking about the Council of Saturn, and says the following:> The members of the Council are representatives from the Confederation and from> those vibratory levels of your inner planes bearing responsibility for your> third density. . . . In number, the Council that sits in constant session,> though varying in its members by means of balancing, which takes place, what> you would call irregularly, is nine. That is the Session Council. To back up> this Council, there are twenty-four entities which offer their services as> requested. These entities faithfully watch and have been called the> Guardians.13 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber419]The third time we see the words paired is in Session 10, Question 9. A very longand complex answer is given to the question “When a graduation occurs [and an]entity or entities move [at] the end of a cycle from one planet to another, bywhat means do they go from one planet to the other?” The answer uses difficultjargon to explain how the soul of the person is carefully studied to determinethe exact amount of progress that was made across multiple incarnations. Thenthe quote reveals that the greater essence of that person “chooses the moreappropriate new environment for either a repetition of the cycle or a movingforward into the next cycle. This is the manner of the harvesting, guarded andwatched over by many.”14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber420] This passage, again,ended by saying that this harvest or Ascension process is “guarded and watchedover by many.”We see this pairing again in Session 50, Question 5. The Ascension process isagain discussed, in regard to people who are not spiritually aware enough tounderstand karma and other related teachings. Watchers are beings who areguarding and helping these people, as follows:> There are those whose lessons are more random due to their present inability> to comprehend the nature and mechanism of the evolution of mind, body, and> spirit. Of these we may say that the process is guarded by those who never> cease their watchful expectation of being of service. There is no entity> without help.15 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber421]The most elaborate quote that alludes to the title of Watchers is in Session 51,Question 1. The core of the question that was asked was “Is it necessary forentities to supervise the harvest [i.e., Ascension], or is it automatic? Couldyou answer this, please?” Ra’s answer was:> In time of harvest there are always harvesters. The fruit is formed as it will> be, but there is some supervision necessary to ensure that this bounty is> placed as it should be, without the bruise or the blemish. There are those of> three levels watching over harvest.> > The first level is planetary and that which may be called angelic. This type> of guardian includes the mind/body/spirit complex totality or higher self of> an entity, and those inner-plane entities which have been attracted to this> entity through its inner seeking.> > The second class of those who ward this process are those of the Confederation> who have the honor/duty of standing in the small places at the edge of the> steps of light/love so that those entities being harvested will not, no matter> how confused or unable to make contact with their higher self, stumble and> fall away for any reason other than the strength of the light. These> Confederation entities catch those who stumble and set them aright so that> they may continue into the light.> > The third group watching over this process is that group you call the> Guardians. This group is from the octave above our own, and serves in this> manner as light-bringers. These Guardians provide the precise emissions of> light/love in exquisitely fastidious disseminations of discrimination so that> the precise light/love vibration of each entity may be ascertained.> > Thus the harvest is automatic, in that those harvested will respond according> to that which is unchangeable during harvest. That is the violet-ray> emanation. However, these helpers are around to ensure a proper harvesting so> that each entity may have the fullest opportunity to express its violet-ray> selfhood.16 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber422]THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERSThe material in Watchers II again made it clear that a great deal of work wasnecessary to store enough genetic material, over time, to rebuild an entireplanet and its people on a new sphere. In a hypnotic session from November 6,1992, Betty found out that the Elders—tall beings with white hair—control theGrays through their eyes and their brains. The eyes of the Grays were describedas being like cameras that the Elders can see through remotely. However, theGrays are much more sophisticated than simple cameras, as they are indeedliving, walking beings in their own right.17 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber423]Then on page 167, an Elder describes the Grays as their “Remote imagingsurrogates. [The Elder said] they are connected to [the Grays] in a way, withbio-electric mind projections.”18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber424] Immediatelyafter I got sober, I started having strong thoughts about extraterrestrials, andby February of 1993, I had my NASA disclosure, which threw me into a world ofnonstop research. This created a major quantum leap forward in my spiritualprogress. Now that I was reading this book and connecting it with the Law ofOne, I felt I was gaining an even greater appreciation of how all the pieces fittogether.On page 105 of Watchers II, the Elders described themselves as “ambassadors of‘Oh.’” This was the name they gave for the One Infinite Creator, and it soundsthe same as someone chanting the Aum, which the Hindus believed was the sound ofGod. Later, on page 134, one of the elders explained that the “Oh” is theinternal, external, eternal presence.19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber425] TheElders also identified themselves as masters of rings, cycles, and orbs.20[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber426]As I read this, I got the idea that one Elder could send out and monitor theactions of multiple Grays at once, perhaps hundreds of them. This way, the roteand mundane work of genetic sampling and preservation could be conducted overthe course of centuries of our time, without the Elders needing to be involvedin every single step of the process. When I discussed this with Corey Goode, hesaid that both positive and negative groups of extraterrestrials create and useGrays to do work for them. Robots cannot be used owing to an ongoing problemwith a predatory artificial intelligence that we have discussed extensively inour articles, lectures, and television shows. This is also discussed to somedegree in my previous book, The Ascension Mysteries. This consciousness is thetrue essence of Lucifer, which the Law of One refers to as the “LuciferianForce,” and it is ultimately in complete control of the Draco Reptilian negativeETs. Since Grays are biologically based, the problem with artificialintelligence taking over can be subverted. On page 155 of Watchers II, Bettysays the same thing, namely that both positive and negative Watchers use Graysto do their work.21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber427]HISTORICAL APPEARANCES OF GRAYSOnce we go back through history and begin looking for possible examples of Graysappearing in various accounts, we will not be disappointed. Though the nameskeep changing, the underlying story line is remarkably consistent withmodern-day abduction and contactee reports. Much of the data Fowler draws uponto make this argument comes from the classic book Passport to Magonia by JacquesVallée.22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber428] For many centuries, humans have hadexperiences highly similar to modern-day abduction reports with nonhumanentities called fairies, gnomes, elves, and demons, among other names.23[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber429]According to Fowler, the Middle Ages also had many popular beliefs and storiesof sexual interaction between nonhumans and humans. During this time, there wasa prevailing belief in the existence of male incubi and female succubi who hadsexual interaction with human beings. Walter Evans-Wentz, an expert on fairyfolklore, believes the fairies who were reported to be enticing people in thenineteenth century are similar if not identical to the succubi of the MiddleAges.24 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber430] Many modern-day abduction experiencesdo have a sexual component, where sperm samples are obtained from men, and womenend up being impregnated, and the developing embryo is removed and nurturedoutside the womb shortly after gestation begins. It is again important toremember that a majority of contactees report, while under hypnosis, that theyremembered having chosen to participate in this program before they were born,and they felt very honored to be involved in helping to ensure the continuityand future of the human race, regardless of what may happen on planet Earth.One book Jacques Vallée quotes from on this subject is Evans-Wentz’s TheFairy-Faith in Celtic Countries: Its Psychological Origin and Nature, publishedin 1911: “This sort of belief in fairies being able to take people was verycommon. . . . A man whom I have seen, Roderick MacNeil, was lifted up by thehosts and left three miles from where he was taken up.”25[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber431] Vallee reported that these historic contacteereports also included amnesia, just like we see now. On page 87 of Passport toMagonia, Vallee writes, “The mind of a person coming out of Fairyland is usuallyblank as to what has been seen and done there.”26[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber432]Another case of what appears to be a typical abduction from a Gray was preservedin a book from 1891, entitled The Science of Fairy Tales: An Inquiry into FairyMythology by Edwin Sidney Hartland. In this book, Hartland quotes from a Swedishbook published in 1775. The Swedish book in turn quoted a legal statement fromApril 12, 1671, by Peter Rahn, who was the husband of a midwife. Peter Rahnswore under oath that his wife was taken to fairyland by a dwarflike entity tohelp out in a childbirth.27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber433] The quote revealsthat the being who did this was> a little man, swart of face and clad in grey, who begged the declarent’s wife> to come and help his wife then in labor. The declarent, seeing they had to do> with a Troll, prayed over his wife, blessed her, and bade her in God’s name go> with the stranger. She seemed to be borne along by the wind.28> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber434]This has all the classic elements of the abduction scenario, since at timeshumans from Earth witness births taking place in a contact experience.We also find out that according to the prolific paranormal researcher John Keel,similar stories were reported by Ella E. Clark in her Indian Legends from theNorthern Rockies. These legends spoke of three-foot-tall entities who wereabducting children. The beings could also make themselves invisible, just as wesee in modern reports.29 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber435] Additionally, theanthropologist Brian Stross found stories of little men from the Tzeltal Indiansin Chiapas, Mexico. They called these beings the ihk’al. The beings apparentlyhad a device on their back that allowed them to fly. They would occasionallykidnap women and force them to bear children.30[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber436] Let’s also not forget that the Australianaborigines have multiple cave paintings of beings they call the Wandjina, whichlook almost exactly the same as typical Gray ETs. These beings again were seenas having great mystical significance.TIME-BENDING PHENOMENAJacques Vallée also reported similar abduction stories from European and Chinesefolklore that involve time-bending phenomena. A person may disappear for weeks,months, or years, but has no sense of duration when they return.31[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber437] Getting back to the mythologist EdwinHartland’s classic 1891 Science of Fairy Tales, Vallée quotes him describing afarmer’s son named Gitto Bach who had vanished and reappeared:> During two whole years nothing was heard from him; but at length one morning> when his mother, who had long and bitterly mourned for him as dead, opened the> door, whom should she see but Gitto with a bundle under his arm. He was> dressed and looked exactly as when she last saw him, for he had not grown a> bit. “Where have you been all this time?” asked his mother. “Why it was only> yesterday I went away,” he replied.32 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber438]One fascinating time-travel story in Watchers II involves an incident that tookplace in a night border patrol group from Chile. A glowing object descendedbehind a small hill on the border of Chile and Peru. Corporal Armando Valdes,the patrol leader, went over the hill to take a look. He came back in fifteenminutes with a dazed stare on his face. He now had visible beard growth, and hisdigital watch was found to be five days ahead of everyone else’s time.33[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber439] Another similarly fascinating example camefrom Dr. Leo Sprinkle, who investigated the classic Casey County abduction case.Louise Smith from Liberty, Kentucky, went through a typical Gray abduction, andafter it ended, she reported that the minute hand on her watch was spinningnearly as fast as the second hand.34 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber440]Betty Andreasson’s own husband, Bob, was able to recall under hypnosis thatwhile his experience was taking place in the astral, his body was almostcompletely motionless in the car he had been taken from. It was frozen in time,and he was told that he would be brought back in his astral form just splitseconds after he left. Under hypnosis, he said, “There is almost no time passingwhere the bodies are. . . . I didn’t understand that. . . . Time is nothing.”35[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber441] This discussion of contactee reports happeningin an out-of-body experience, complete with amnesia afterward, got me thinkingmuch more deeply about the many strange events of my own childhood, including myastral projection at age five. Corey Goode and other insiders have reported thissame ability for members of the secret space program to travel through time asdesired, though they must be extremely careful to avoid creating paradoxes, asthis can destabilize the very fabric of their existence. In Bob Luca’s ETcontact, he was also shown a vision of planet Earth. He saw dark spots oncertain parts of the planet, and the beings told him that he would understandwhat this meant in time.36 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber442]BETTY ANDREASSON, COREY GOODE, AND THE BLUE SPHERESNothing surprised me more as I was going through the final stages of writingthis book than reviewing the contact experience Betty Andreasson Luca had in thesummer of 1989. This was the exact same time frame when I had started practicinglucid dreaming and having amazing waking contacts with Elder-type humans onboard a giant spaceship. Again, at the time, I did not think any of this wasother than my fertile imagination. What I found in reviewing Betty’s contactfrom this same period was an astonishing correlation with what happened to CoreyGoode beginning in 2015.Corey reported being contacted by a small orb of blue light. It would zip aroundhim in his room until he stood at attention and indicated that he was ready. Atthis point, the orb would suddenly widen and go around his entire body. Once itdid, he would be transported to a new location, after which the orb would eithershrink or disappear. These contacts brought him face-to-face with “Blue Avians”who eventually revealed themselves as incarnations of the same Ra that wrote theLaw of One. I had suspected this was going on well before he got the finalconfirmation from them. Corey Goode also claimed to have met with beings exactlyfitting the description of Dr. Brown’s Midwayers and Betty Andreasson Luca’sElders.Getting back to the main feature of Watchers II, in the summer of 1989, Bettyfelt the urge to get up out of bed and go outside.37[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber443] She walked into the woods and saw a blue orb.The orb then expanded to the size of her entire body and she found herselflevitating inside it. This is precisely the same as what Corey Goode reportedhappening to him.38 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber444] This was mind-blowing, andI took a picture of Betty’s illustration and sent it over to Corey. He wasequally impressed. In this event, Betty also saw clusters of pastel-coloredlight orbs in the trees, each of which was the size of an orange. The blue orbeventually took her onto an extraterrestrial mothership. Once she startedwalking around, the blue orb transformed back into a tiny blue light thatfollowed her for a period of time.39 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber445] This,again, is precisely what Corey Goode reported happening to him on multipleoccasions since 2015, well before either of us knew or remembered anything aboutthis report from Betty.As Betty’s experience went on, she found herself walking through a forest withstrange and beautiful light effects. This mirrored experiences Corey had in theunderground cities of the Anshar. Once Betty finished her trip through thismystical forest, she again found herself inside a blue orb.40[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber446]At this point, she had still encountered only extraterrestrials that looked likeGrays. When she asked them about the blue sphere that was following her around,this was what she said:> Those . . . orbs—he called them orbs—they are record keepers of intelligence.> They can become small as what we know as atoms, or they can become large, but> they each are intelligent, just as the earth and the moon and the sun are> intelligences and all the planets are intelligent. They have an intelligence> of their own. They’re living.41 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber447]This was precisely the same thing Corey Goode was told—namely that the orbs hewas interacting with were living and intelligent beings with awareness and asense of purpose about what they were doing. I was delighted to see this levelof specific correspondence between the different contactee reports.As Betty’s experience continued, she attempted to understand where the crystalforest she had just passed through was actually located. She was told that“there is a place on this very Earth that you do not know of.”42[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber448] This doesn’t precisely indicate that thehidden location was inside the Earth, but obviously we have explored everythingthere is to see on the surface. Many other insiders have independently producedthe same information about beautiful, seemingly outdoor natural environmentsinside the Earth, and I do discuss some of these accounts in The AscensionMysteries.Betty didn’t actually encounter one of the human-looking Elders directly untilpage 89 in Watchers II, while she was on a cigar-shaped mothership. She reportedthem as having whitish-colored hair, pale white skin, and long white robes thatnearly touched the ground. She also claimed to have seen people like thembefore, but this was the first time we encountered these memories of hers in thebooks. On page 115, she noted that all of them looked male, but one of thebeings told her “we are neither male or female here.” This was about the onlydiscrepancy I could find between Betty and Corey’s reports. When I asked Coreyhow this might have happened, he said that the Anshar are far more “balanced” intheir “masculine-feminine polarity” than people on Earth. Corey definitelyencountered both men and women, as well as people who looked like everydifferent race of humans we see on Earth today. He did say that the men seemedmore effeminate, in general, than what we are accustomed to seeing in people onEarth at this time.Another very interesting vision is given to Betty starting on page 119, whichwas perhaps intended to help her feel more comfortable with the relationshipsbetween the Elders and the people in her church. She saw the minister’s wife inher church being telepathically spoken to by an Elder. The wife began speakingin tongues. The minister of the church was then touched on the shoulder byanother Elder, and this allowed him to be able to interpret what his wife wassaying.CREATING LIGHT GRIDS OF SACRED GEOMETRYFor me, the true grand finale of Betty’s visions in the book, which made me longto reconnect with the old man and his friends, appears on page 126. Three Eldersstood together in a triangular pattern. They reached their arms out to oneanother and touched their palms together, so their arms formed a triangle. Then,they began meditating and chanting. Betty was astonished to see a triangle oflight form between the three of them as they did this. Each corner of thetriangle emerged from the third-eye centers of the beings, meaning that eachbeing’s forehead had two lines of light coming out of it. The lines connectedinto a perfect triangle. An additional circle of light formed in the middle ofthis triangle, perfectly centered.Then, once this light grid was stable, three more Elders entered the circle,bringing it to a total of six people standing side by side, equidistant from oneanother and pressing their palms together. The second three Elders formed anadditional triangle that was upside down from the original, forming a perfectStar of David pattern in the positions of their arms and the lines of light thatthey then manifested. This also caused another circle of light to form aroundthe entire group, in addition to the ring of light that was still inside theStar of David.43 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber449] As strange as this may sound,I actually cried when I read this. Some part of me seemed to have a distantmemory of working with light like this, and creating grid patterns with the helpof others working together as a team.Now the entire Star of David light grid began levitating into the air, above thebeings who had generated it. The pattern then shrank and collapsed into itscenter, forming a violet-colored ball of light.44[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber450] Betty was able to carry this ball with her asone of the Elders took her on an interesting adventure, where she againteleported to various locations. The light was used to help people who were sickor in pain, and it was used to successfully drive off dark entities who wereapparently trying to steal a man’s soul as he lay on his deathbed. As I rereadthis account and considered the endorsement it received from the Law of Oneseries, I considered that Betty had witnessed the birth of one of thesespherical beings of light. This was also a fascinating use of sacred geometry tocreate a type of living being. In this same experience, Betty was taken to see“the light” of the One Infinite Creator, which threw her into a state ofunspeakable joy. This is identical to the reports of thousands of people whohave had near-death experiences, or NDEs, and is mirrored in the reports fromthe three hundred individuals in the Thomas E. Bullard abduction study.A blue orb took Betty back to the Earth at the end of this marvelous experience,again paralleling Corey Goode’s own reports.45 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber451]Fowler’s book also reported the results of his own father going through aregression for an apparent contact experience. In his father’s regression, hesaw the exact same type of beings that Betty had seen, wearing white robes andhaving blond or white hair.46 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber452]As we head into the next chapter, we will explore the final events in my lifethat led up to my own telepathic contact originating. It was clear at times thatI was speaking with beings Dr. Brown would call the Midwayers, Betty would callthe Elders, insiders would call the Tall Whites, and Corey would call theAnshar. I also got to meet Dr. Scott Mandelker, who wrote the book that awakenedme to the fact that I was an extraterrestrial soul, as well as Dr. CourtneyBrown, at a UFO conference in Connecticut. Additionally, I was nearly recruitedfor a strange program that used psychics, by a man who claimed to work for adefense contractor. Less than a month after this conference, my contactbegan—and my life was forever transformed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREETHE CONTACT BEGINSAs the year 1996 rolled on, I became very aware that my dreams were encouragingme to seek out a direct telepathic contact with my Higher Self, in the classicstyle of the Edgar Cayce Readings. There were a number of other beautiful dreamsand synchronicities during this time that I will have to save for the next book.This included one dream where I found myself flying up through a spectacularvortex of light emanating from the moon, in what appeared to be a very vividprophecy of the Ascension event. I finally quit my job at the day treatmentfacility on July 23, 1996, and didn’t land a stable job again until November. AsI reviewed the dreams from this period for the first time in 2019, I had avariety of astonishing time-loop phenomena to the present. The dreams knew whatI was doing, where I was living, who I was living and working with, and evenvery specific things about the objects and situations surrounding me. Although Ihad many other experiences with time loops in the past, I’d never had this manybefore.A BROTHER IN SYNCHRONICITYI ended up joining Richard C. Hoagland’s discussion forum to seek community andbegin sharing my findings with others. Admittedly, I was trying to catchRichard’s attention, and it took four years of dedicated work before he actuallystarted to interact with me directly. I had a variety of weird and wonderfulexperiences with synchronicity as I posted these writings. Each post wasassigned a seemingly random number, and I was not paying attention to it when Iwould hit SEND. Nonetheless, almost every time I posted something, I was gettingundeniable numerical synchronicities. Some people on the board simply could notaccept that this was really happening, no matter how many times I documented it.I printed out records of everything I posted at the time, back in 1996, andstill have all of them in my files.There was another man on the forum who was equally interested in dreams,synchronicity, and crop circles. His name was Joe Mason. Joe and I beganspeaking to each other in the forum and comparing notes. He wrote about aphenomenon he had experienced since 1990, which he called the Dream Voice. TheDream Voice messages were audible sentence fragments that came to him in themorning when he was first waking up. He usually would get only one sentencefragment at a time.The most important aspect of the technique is that you listen carefully andwrite down whatever you hear, no matter how weird it is. You do not attempt toanalyze the content in any way—you just document the results. This is exactlythe same thing that the remote-viewing protocols teach you. This contact againcame to Joe during the same time I began having lucid dreams and BettyAndreasson Luca remembered her experiences with the Elders. The messages wereinvariably written in a strange, encrypted language style that used dreamlikesymbols to convey meaning. Several of them had provocative hints about thecoming Ascension event. Here are just a few of Joe’s original results from hiswebsite that I find interesting:6. Sept. 90—We are still apes! The great cycle is not over yet. We will becomeMan at the end of the cycle.19. 4–25–91—I am the Christ that gives the hyperactive square of intelligence.35. 5–18–91—All that exists is God manifesting himself. To say otherwise is ablasphemy.60. 7–1–91—Chocolate versus vanilla. Racism makes about as much sense.138. 9–22–91—The natural flow of things is abundance and joy.222. 12–28–91—I was there, and then not there. In short, there is no beginningor end.236. 2–9–92—(something about) the plan of the gods had “gone wrong” in makinghumans, but a higher god had done this for a challenge for them to “repair.”257. 4–16–92—A member of a UFO group will get in touch with you inSeptember . . . (Note: In September a man wrote a letter [to Joe] who wasresearching dreams about UFOs and aliens.)292. 6–5–92—We have some very convincing material, especially the incrediblecurriculum on Jesus Christ.350. 7–20–92—Each of us is a puzzle piece, and he’s an exact frequency thatmatches us.366. 8–10–92—We each have an Eagle and small hawk. Listen to it.387. 8–20–92—From dee back of dee statue of Liberty to dee front of everythingelse. . . . [Note: After I began working with Joe Mason in 1996, he ended upgetting together with Dolores Finney, who went by the name Dee. This messageappeared to predict her arrival four years in advance.]398. 8–27–92—I don’t care how big a scoundrel he is, he is a human being andthus part of all.401. 8–29–92—Some young people are cutting their strings (?) and going over tothe coop, where the source is.418. 9–12–92—The sun will get hot, and here we go again.441. 10–3–92—A concrete bridge should be poured all in one piece.450. 10–10–92—All people would begin to feel the healing energy.THE NATIONAL UFO CONGRESSOn October 12, 1996, the annual National UFO Congress conference was being heldin New Haven, Connecticut, at the North Haven Holiday Inn. I found out aboutthis only by calling the phone number in Dr. Mandelker’s book, in the hopes ofreaching out to him to share the results of my own awakening after reading hisbook. Dr. Mandelker personally answered the phone, and let me know he would bespeaking at this conference. I immediately said I would find a way to get there.I knew that speaking at events just like this was my future. I needed to getmyself there and try to get some recognition and guidance as to how to breakinto the scene. I also wanted to speak with Dr. Mandelker directly about whatwas happening to me, and ask him if he thought I had what it took to become afull-time UFO researcher. I ended up having to borrow two hundred dollars fromEric’s girlfriend to be able to go.Antonio found out about this just three days before I was scheduled to leave,and he yelled at me in a highly angry and abusive manner. For well over a halfan hour, it dragged on, in front of Eric and his girlfriend, and they rarely, ifever, came to my defense. In his thick Spanish accent, Antonio berated me. “Youhaven’t had a steady job for months now, David. What the hell do you think youare doing borrowing and spending someone else’s money? And for what? To go andsee a Goddamn UFO conference? Where nobody knows anything? You have everythingyou need here. If you have any questions about UFOs you can ask me. You don’tneed these people. All they are doing is making money—and now they’ve trickedyou into stealing from other people to pay for it! You are not going. This isridiculous. You either need to go upstairs, get that money and pay her back,right now, or at least promise us that you will use this loan for somethingreasonable, like paying for food and rent. You need to get a life, David!”As Antonio was laying into me, a curious feeing of absolute calm, inner peace,and firm strength coursed through me. I had looked over at the sign in ourapartment that said CHATEAU BULLSHINSKI and felt a sense of deep knowing thatthis exact experience I was now having was part of the initiation of living inthe Metaphysical Resort. Life is a tapestry of good and bad, ups and downs, joyand disaster, pleasure and pain, just like the Bible quote from Ecclesiastes hadsaid about life and death. Life. He told me I needed to get a life. That was theanswer.“Antonio, with all due respect, I AM getting a life. I have invested way morehours of my life into this world, which people are exploring at this conferenceand others like it, than anything else I have ever done. I can’t keep workingdead-end jobs like this. That’s no life. I have read over three hundred booksnow—three hundred—and nothing is stopping me. I even tried to go to graduateschool for this, got the whole thing paid for, and they turned me down. If theyhad said yes, I wouldn’t be here right now, Antonio—I’d be a graduate student inColorado. I will get a job after this event and I will pay her back. She gave methis money of her own free will because she believes in me, even if you don’t,and I have the right to use it however I choose. I am not telling you what youshould do with your future, so don’t tell me what to do with mine.”Antonio did back off after this, and Eric and his girlfriend did not take hisside once we stopped fighting. It was all very intense, but I got through it,and a few days later, I had driven to North Haven and was staying in a cheaproom in the same hotel where the conference was. By this point, I had finallyfinished working through all four volumes of the Law of One series, which was noeasy task, and I brought Book One with me to start reading it again from thebeginning. This conference was irresistible to me, as it had both Dr. ScottMandelker and Dr. Courtney Brown on the list of speakers. In fact, Dr. Brown wasscheduled to speak immediately before Dr. Mandelker. It was almost too good tobe true.A VOTE OF CONFIDENCEOnce I got there, Dr. Mandelker agreed to meet with me, but since he had acareer as a professional therapist, he wanted it to happen in the guise of apaid one-hour session. I told him I had very little money, and he said he workedon a sliding scale and gave me a small price that I could afford. My entiresession essentially revolved around one question: Did he think I had what ittakes to be a professional UFO researcher? Could I build an audience, get a bookdeal, and achieve enough success to end up speaking at events just like this? Tomake the case, I laid out all the evidence. I talked about having read overthree hundred books on the subject. I mentioned that I had now become a scholarof the Law of One series, his favorite source text, and had worked through allfour of the books in meticulous detail. I described how I had discovered manyconnections between the Law of One and other bodies of information that no onehad ever seen before, at least in terms of anything I could find online or inbookstores.And I let him know that I was a successful graduate of the challenge he posed inhis book. I had passed the Wanderer Questionnaire with flying colors, twelve outof twelve. I had an amazing Bible quote come through me from automatic writing,and whoever or whatever fed me that quote knew exactly what was going on in mylife. I had prayed to know if I was indeed an extraterrestrial soul, and theanswer came the next morning in a fantastic UFO dream from my housemate. Thesame old man who had appeared in my dreams throughout my entire life was nowshowing up in other people’s dreams, and his message was clear: “It is veryimportant that you know that he is one of us.” Yet, I knew nothing about the UFOconference world. I had no idea if I could break into it or how I could makethis work. I asked Dr. Mandelker, point-blank: “Do you think I have what ittakes? Can I do this, or should I listen to my housemate Antonio and just get ajob?”Dr. Mandelker replied, “I absolutely believe in you, David. You have one of themost remarkable Wanderer stories I have ever heard. You are clearly operating ata genius level as an intellect, and you are a highly prolific researcher. Veryfew of the people speaking at this event have done as much research andfact-finding as you have. I think you do need to get a job, in order tostabilize yourself, but you can also use that structure to buy yourself sometime. Once you dig yourself out of this current crisis, I think the main thingyou need to do is just start giving back to the world. Take the things you arelearning, put them together, and get them out there. Learn how to make awebsite, as I’m sure you’re smart enough to figure out. Once you put informationout there, anyone will be able to find it. Then you can start trying to getyourself on some radio shows. Perhaps you’ll even make it onto Art Bell one day.You can do this, David. You absolutely can. I believe in you, even if no oneelse does.”I nearly cried when I got such a glowing endorsement from a man I saw as a trueidol at this point. Our session was over, but the message came through loud andclear. Just over four years later, Dr. Mandelker and I would end up cohosting agrant-sponsored seminar tour together entitled “The Time of Global Shift.” Scottand I became good friends, and we would trade off Law of One quotes that we hadmemorized verbatim in the Q&A section. “The Time of Global Shift” tour ended upbeing the first well-paying conference job I ever had. Once all this started, Ialso got my first full-length appearance on the Art Bell show with Scott onApril 30, 2001, and we managed to cover a wide range of fascinating materialabout the coming Ascension.Later that same day, after I had this life-changing vote of confidence from atrue hero of mine, it was time to see “the best of the best” in action. Dr.Courtney Brown’s talk began immediately after my session ended and I had to rundown there to make it on time. I happened to be carrying my copy of The RaMaterial, Book One of the Law of One series, when I went. Dr. Brown spent almosthis entire talk time describing remote viewing, how it worked, and why it was soaccurate. He quickly ran out of time, as I believe he was given only one hour tospeak. He hardly got to cover any of the conclusions from his research.Nonetheless, he had given out some amazing teasers. Dr. Mandelker was onimmediately after him. There was barely enough time in between for anyone toeven make it to the bathroom.Dr. Brown’s talk was so captivating that this very large audience almostcompletely cleared the room to go chase him down, ask him questions, and buy hisbooks. I knew I had to be there for Dr. Mandelker, for even though Dr. Brown’sbook was important, Dr. Mandelker had awakened me to being a Wanderer andbrought me to the Law of One series. By the time Scott got on stage, there washardly anyone left in the room—perhaps a total of about forty people at themost. People were thinking Scott was going to tell them about UFOs, but insteadhe gave us a truly profound analysis of Law of One spirituality, showing how ittied together with Buddhist concepts of centering your mind fully in thepresent. He said it was very likely that everyone in this audience was aWanderer, and if you want to find the answer, all you have to do is look withinyourself, meditate, and show the universe that you are a genuine seeker, with anhonest desire to know the truth. It seemed obvious that he was taking themes wehad discussed in our meeting from the day before and working them into his talk.At some point, he mentioned the Law of One series, and said that he felt thiswas our most powerful resource in exploring the truth. He then called me out byname and asked me to come up and show everyone the book. I was not at allexpecting this, but Scott gave me an incredible gift by doing so. I did not sayanything, but now I was standing in front of the entire audience and showingthem what the book looked like. I also threw some humor in, holding the book asif I were selling it on a game show. People loved it.THE POWER IS WITHIN YOUAs soon as Dr. Mandelker’s talk was over, I rushed out of the room. I had to seeif Dr. Brown was still available for me to talk to. I went to the book-signingtable and no one was there. All his books were gone. I ran over to the frontdesk, described Dr. Brown to the clerk, and asked if he had seen the man. Theclerk told me, “Yes, he just checked out. He’s out on the front curb waiting fora taxi cab right now. If you run, you might still have a chance to catch himbefore he leaves.” That was all I needed to hear. I sprinted down the hall attop speed to meet another one of my biggest heroes. Remarkably, I found Dr.Brown sitting on his suitcase on the curb, all by himself, looking exhausted. Noone else had followed him out there, so I was able to talk to him without anyinterruptions whatsoever.I could see he was wiped out, and after having met so many rock stars as a kid,I knew the best thing I could do would be to stay very calm, ask him a fewquestions, and let him talk. There was so much I wanted to tell him, but nowjust wasn’t the time. One of the questions I asked was “Well, tell me this. Howhas it changed you, to know that within your own mind, you have the capacity togather all of this fantastic information?”“Well, it certainly wasn’t easy,” Dr. Brown responded. “I would have to say thatit turned my whole world upside down. People just aren’t supposed to be capableof doing things like this, and yet there it is. I can sit down any time I wantand violate all of our known scientific laws with nothing more than two numbers,a few pieces of paper, and a pencil.”“Right! Right!” I agreed. “Well, you have discovered so much new informationthat I have to admit that your book is the best thing to come around in UFOlogyfor years.”Dr. Brown replied, “And this is just the beginning. There is so much out therefor us to explore; we have to just start by figuring out what questions we needto ask.”At some point, I asked him what he thought it would take for theextraterrestrials to want to reveal themselves to us. “We are the ones who needto change,” he said. “All we see in movies are ‘evil aliens’ that we end upfighting and killing. Yet, as I have seen, we are being visited by trulywonderful people who have been watching, guiding, and protecting us formillennia. They are more than happy to reach out to us, but we have to take thefirst step.”Much like in that iconic opening scene from Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet, Dr.Brown’s taxi pulled up at this moment, and I had to say goodbye to him. Ithanked him for taking the time to talk to me. As the driver packed his suitcaseinto the trunk, he replied, “You’re welcome, David. Just remember that thepotentials that you have within your own mind are more extraordinary than youcould ever even believe.”“I will, Dr. Brown. I will remember. Thank you.” He entered the taxi and left.As soon as I went back inside and headed over to the conference room, a fewpeople recognized me as “The Guy with the Book” from Dr. Mandelker’s talk. Theystarted asking me questions about the Law of One series, and I answered them tothe best of my ability. Within minutes, I had attracted a crowd of at leastfifteen people, who were all leaning in and listening attentively to every wordI said. Their eyes were wide. The more they asked, the more they realized that Iknew. After several minutes, one guy told me, “They need to invite you to speakhere, David. You know a lot more than most of the people at this thing, andyou’re also a much better speaker. This information is amazing, and the worldneeds to know about it. You have somehow found the deep spiritual core of theUFO phenomenon, and where it is taking us as a planet and a species. I’ve neverheard anyone else talk like this before. It’s amazing.” Everyone around him wasnodding their heads and agreeing with him. I thanked him and asked them all to“put in a good word for me.”THE FINAL TEMPTATIONLike these people said, I wasn’t terribly inspired by many of the otherspeakers. I ended up spending a lot of time at the round tables in the meetingrooms next door. There I got to meet another one of my heroes, Dr. MichaelHesemann, who wrote The Cosmic Connection, which was a far-reaching andfascinating book.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber453] Dr. Hesemann’s conclusionwas that the Earth was going through a profound metamorphosis that would changewho and what we are. He also believed that crop circles were giving us ongoingsymbols of this change in progress. He gave multiple examples of formations thatmirrored ancient illustrations of the pregnant mother goddess. He argued thatthe Earth was the pregnant goddess, and she was going to be giving birth to anew humanity. The world would be transformed into a paradise, without war orfear or pain, and we would have remarkable new abilities. Dr. Hesemann and I hada terrific conversation about all of this, and there wasn’t one empty seat atour table.One of the things I told everyone about was my original NASA disclosure from1993. This was still a year before Colonel Philip Corso came out with The Dayafter Roswell, which precisely validated everything I had heard.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber454] I talked about how crashed extraterrestrialtechnology had been reverse-engineered into so many things we now took forgranted, like LED lights, fiber optics, infrared night vision, lasers, Velcro,Teflon, Kevlar, and computer chips. As I was saying all this, I noticed that astudious-looking man who had come and sat down right next to me was paying veryclose attention. He was wearing a brown suit with a brown vest, a whitebutton-down shirt, and a tie. He had small glasses that were balanced on the endof his nose, and long professor-style gray hair with a bald spot on top. “Yourfriend sure found some good information,” he told me. He was speaking about myfriend in college who gave me the NASA disclosure. “I am genuinely impressed.”This admittedly triggered great curiosity. How did this guy know that thecollege professor was telling the truth? I asked him who he was and what he wasdoing here at the conference, since he admittedly looked a little out of placewith his dressy clothes. He told me his name, which I have long since forgotten,and told me that one of his jobs was a college professor. Then he told me healso did independent freelance work for various aerospace defense contractors.He gave me some specific names of big companies that most UFO buffs would easilyrecognize.With total confidence, I bravely replied, “I know these companies. I’ve read allabout it. You guys pose as independent corporations, but you’re really justowned by the military. And they in turn are owned by a very interesting andsecretive worldwide organization that I have just started learning about, whichhas deep ties to the spiritual traditions of various ancient civilizations. Sohere’s what you guys are up to, based upon what I have now learned. You getthese no-bid government contracts to work on projects that are drasticallyoverpriced. Then you take all that extra money and funnel it into the goodstuff—black projects that are so classified that We the People never get to heara word about anything. All you guys are really doing is hiring yourselves. Youjust have to make it look like you are paying independent companies so thepublic doesn’t get wise to what you are doing.”He replied, “Well, you’re a very knowledgeable young man, uh . . .” He carefullyscrutinized my name tag through the glasses on the end of his nose. “. . . DavidWilcock. Let me ask you a question, and I know this might sound odd. Are you anartist or a musician?”“Both,” I responded. “I just got my bachelor’s degree last year and I minored injazz performance as a drummer. I was somewhere between the second or third bestdrummer in the entire jazz program.”The professor said, “I am actually not in the least bit surprised. Look, David,your friend gave you a lot of good information, but there is much, much more foryou to know. I would love to tell you all about it, but we can’t do it here. I’mgoing to head over to the buffet and why don’t you show up in a few minutes andmeet with me privately? You won’t be disappointed.” Then, he suddenly got up andleft.Not too long after this, another guy, wearing a green T-shirt, came and sat nextto me. “Did that guy just ask you to go and meet with him alone?” he asked me.“Yes, he did,” I replied. “How did you know that?”The man answered, “It’s the government. They send these guys out at everyconference. They are recruiters. They are looking for people just like you.”I was quite surprised when he said this. “For what?” I asked.“Did he just ask you if you are a musician?”I was shocked. “My God, yes, he did! How could you know that?”He replied, “I am a part of the Pine Bush UFO group. We have other witnesses whohave privately come forward after getting recruited by these guys. Youdefinitely do not want to go talk to him.” When I asked him why, he said, “Theyare looking for musicians because they discovered that these people make thebest psychics. They bring you in and get you to sign a massive legal documentthat says you can never say a word to anyone about what you are doing. Thedocument literally spells out that they can kill you if you break the contract.Then they get you working on various psychic projects that can include remoteviewing and connecting with extraterrestrials telepathically, but these ETs arenot the good guys. The work is very exhausting and people burn out within two orthree years. Once they have used you up, they kick you out and break all theirpromises about the money you are going to receive. If you try to do anything orcomplain about it, they threaten your life . . . and they are absolutely seriousabout it.”This warning was more than enough to convince me not to go talk to theprofessor. A few years later, I would hear about the testimony of Dan Sherman, asoldier for the US Air Force who worked in an identical-sounding program for theNSA called Project Preserve Destiny.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber455] I wasnow very well aware that I had found myself in a war between positive andnegative extraterrestrials. We human beings were the proxies for this war, withboth sides working behind the scenes to steer us in the direction they felt wasmost beneficial. I was having powerful contacts with benevolent, positiveextraterrestrials throughout my entire life, and they definitely were telling methat I could enter into direct telepathic contact with them. The dreams andsynchronicities made it crystal clear that all this was building up tosomething. I therefore decided to take Dr. Mandelker’s advice and pursue this onmy own rather than joining an organization where I would end up working forsomeone else. I needed to preserve my own destiny and not get entangled in sucha potentially threatening situation. Less than a month later, my own telepathicET contact would begin.Shortly after I returned home from the conference, on October 18, 1996, Ifinally got a letter from my biggest hero at the time, Richard C. Hoagland.Although it was nice to finally be acknowledged, he wasn’t terribly supportive.Hoagland said that all I was doing was combining other people’s research. Hefelt that if I really wanted to contribute to the community, I needed to startdoing my own independent research. Once I generated my own data, I could buildmy own platform and make a name for myself. I did see the logic in what he wassaying, and the best chance I had to build up my own material was to somehow tryto make direct telepathic contact with extraterrestrials.BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONAt the same time, my everyday life was racked with stress and pain. I had beenlargely unemployed since I left my job with the UARC Day Treatment Center inJuly. I had to borrow seven hundred dollars from my grandparents just to barelysurvive, and I was out of time. I ended up applying for another job that wassimilar to UARC on November 5, 1996, and got an interview the next day. At theexact moment I pulled into the parking spot for the interview, my odometer read128888—a rare and meaningful quadruple-digit synchronicity. I was clearlygetting told that I needed to take the job if they offered it to me.I visited the facility the next day, November 7, and was offered a job. Thatnight, I called Yumi on the phone, since we were still in occasional contact,and told her what was going on. I was admittedly feeling vulnerable and not atall happy about taking on another job like this. She was very cold to me andmade it clear that we would never again be together. Although she didn’t admitit, I strongly suspected that she had gotten together with someone else, andthat was fine. This ended up being the last time we ever spoke to each otheruntil I briefly met up with her on a tour of Japan in 2002. The next morning, Icalled the company back and accepted their job offer. My starting date was setfor Monday, 11/11, 1996. I laughed to myself about the synchronicity but did notsay anything to the company representative, as I didn’t want to sound weird. Iknew I wasn’t going to be stuck in this job. It was more a transitional step asI was building myself into a career as a full-time UFO investigator.The next day, November 9, I finally followed up with Joe Mason—the dream andsynchronicity researcher I had met on Richard Hoagland’s forum. He had given mehis phone number and asked to talk, and that night I gave him a call. Thatconversation proved to be one of the most mind-blowing experiences I had everhad. Joe had found incredible connections between the Bible, crop circles,synchronicity, Ascension, and this curious phenomenon he called the Dream Voice.His life was filled with one mind-boggling synchronicity story after another,just like mine. He had gotten deeply involved in analyzing the exactmeasurements and symbolic meanings of crop circles, and was having dreams andsynchronicities that were telling him how it all fit together.The crown jewel of Joe’s work was the Dream Voice. He told me that when youfirst wake up in the morning and can remember your dream, you will hear a“still, small voice” in the background. It will fade in and out. Your job issimply to listen to it, and make no effort to analyze or understand it. Simplylisten, and no matter how weird or crazy it may sound, just write down exactlywhat you hear. He had experienced very interesting Ascension-themed messagesthis way, as well as a variety of prophecies that proved to be accurate. As hewas telling me all this, I was struggling to stay awake. We ended up speakinguntil five in the morning. I took pages and pages of notes, and was strugglingto write down everything that Joe was saying even while I was barely conscious.BREAKTHROUGH TO CONTACTThe next morning, November 10, 1996, I woke up totally exhausted. I struggled toremember my dream, but it slipped through my fingers. However, I was still in avery deep trance state. And I realized I could still hear what sounded like JoeMason’s voice talking, just like in our call from the night before. This was theDream Voice! It was happening. I had heard things like this for many years as Iwas waking up, thinking it was just my imagination, and I had never bothered totry to write them down before. Now I decided to try. I ended up filling severalpages, sentence by sentence. No matter how weird or cryptic anything sounded, Ijust wrote it down exactly as I heard it. And I kept going and going and goingand going. Finally, after what seemed like well over an hour, I decided it wastime to stop. I had to start a new job the next day and I was also veryinterested to see what I might have written. I had no idea what I was going tofind, as I had followed the remote-viewing protocols and simply wrote it alldown without any conscious understanding, emotional attachment, or analysis.The results were nothing short of spectacular. They spoke in a dreamlikelanguage of symbolism. Some of the sentences were completely encrypted and madeno sense at all, but I was surprised at how many of them were understandable.There were multiple symbolic references to Ascension, using the same biblicallanguage of farming and the harvest that I had seen in the Law of One. Therewere also clear indications that dark forces were trying to prevent us fromgraduating. Here are some key excerpts:> Does the Farmhand have enough manual labor? The Bible, just analyze it. I’m> too proud of you! . . . Hold it. The religions I am concerned with will be> someday lighted, and we will go on to greater heights as a conglomerate being> in the cosmos. . . .> > [Your] country [and] continuity [is being] shaded by an invisible hand which> controls the sound in the lower ear. [It is] the sound of Hades. It massages> the temples. A book called The Greek Mythologies. Tombstone. [We are] talking> about a 70-mph wind from everyplace. Pause for the government’s actions to be> completed. Needless to say, the point we’re in is in the middle of Al-Tamin.> Register, we’ve got to that. The meaning being that, it could be better, for> there is sometimes touch and significant contact with the devil. [There is] a> different way of doing it for those without much to say.4> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber456]Before we go on here, I just now looked up Al-Tamin, for this was one of thereferences I never understood at the time. I had heard the term and wrote itdown phonetically. The main search result I got was Al-Tamim, which is an areaof northeastern Iraq. Only the last letter is different, and they soundidentical, so I simply didn’t spell it right. As it says in the EncyclopaediaBritannica, “[Al-Tamim’s] capital, Kirkūk, is one of the largest oil-producingcentres in Iraq, and has oil pipelines that connect it with Tripoli (Lebanon)and with Yumurtalik on the Turkish Mediterranean.”5[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber457] Therefore, the reading was making a directreference to the presence of the US military in Iraq, and all the wars we werefighting over oil. This would include the re-invigoration of the Gulf War onIraq and Afghanistan after 9/11, which at this point was still five years away.Thus, the reading described that as a result of the US’s military occupation ofAl-Tamim, “it could be better, for there is sometimes touch and significantcontact with the devil.”Now let’s continue with more of this groundbreaking first session:> I am impressed with that which [you,] the vehicle, have designed—nature,> motivation, motivational programs. With humans and all that, they [the> extraterrestrials] make a special return . . . The longest I’ve ever seen of> that is the coverage of evolution. [It is] also a million years, which> encompasses everything—German, Spanish, etc. . . . One of our women, Theresa,> a sibling inoperative—the Christian, psychically. It was rough—they “nailed> this in” (the sin), you know. I think a lot of people jump to their> conclusions in silence. That’s what the trinity is. . . . 6> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber458]This passage proved to be one of the most fascinating prophecies from the firstsession. The reading clearly seemed to be referring to Mother Teresa, and thebeings identified her as “one of our women.” The references to her being “asibling” and “the Christian” were further clues that they were referring toMother Teresa. Then they said that she was “inoperative” and “it was rough.”This message came through on November 10, 1996, and less than two weeks later,on November 22, 1996, she had a heart attack.7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber459]She was readmitted to the hospital with chest pains and breathing problems thatday, and died of a massive heart attack less than a year later, on September 5,1997. This was only six days after the tragic death of Princess Diana, andsuggested some higher force of synchronicity was again at work. This stunningprophecy of Mother Teresa’s heart attack was a profound wake-up call. Once itcame to pass, I could no longer deny that I was experiencing an authenticcontact with higher intelligence.The next excerpt from this initial session begins with the strange nameAnanawanda. This seemed to be a veiled reference to various religions. I hadalready seen more than one allegedly channeled book that had called Jesus by thename Sananda, and that seemed to be a strong part of the message. In fact, I doseem to remember hearing it originally as Sananda, and then being worried that Iwas understanding the words too much—so I asked for it to change:“The devotees of Ananawanda are pathetically bonded from high school on to theeclipse-conjunction. The rivers do such a thing in Italy, you know; it relies onthe Germans to get it out.”8 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber460] This was anotherveiled reference to the Vatican, which as I later would learn is the spiritualheadquarters of the Illuminati. During World War II, Italy was on Hitler’s side,and was running as a fascist dictatorship under Mussolini. When the reading said“it relies on the Germans to get it out,” this seemed to imply how Hitler wasused to enact the Vatican’s plans for world war, since he had Mussolini’ssupport. After World War II, everyone loved to jump on Hitler, which is verywell deserved, but Italy almost entirely got away with a free pass and nofurther scrutiny. Then as the reading goes on, they appear to be referencing aprior catastrophe that greatly damaged life on Earth and required genetictinkering to ensure that humanity survived:> An iceberg landed on the ocean, with such a suddenness that the oceans> exploded. Water rose many feet in the air. The inbreeding took care of that,> the weird stuff.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber461]This next passage clearly uses a Law of One metaphor of Ascension, byreferencing the “reaping” that occurs at the time of harvest, as Ra calls it.They also refer to a “vortex of light four times as big,” which could easily bea reference to the anticipated solar flash event: “If you look at the reapingcurve, you see a vortex of light four times as big. [It is] centered around themoon and Jupiter—a wild conjunction.”10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber462] Thereading finally ended with the following passage, which was highly interesting:> I love it when people refer to the Midwestern Atlantis. There are also> formations in the desert you should know about, in Chichen Itza. After I’m> done, you should take a walk to them. You can go with your mind, you know?> Check it out. I must go now. Peace be with you in the Light of everlasting> Love.11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber463]This was a clear invitation to study astral projection and get myself to haveanother genuine out-of-body experience. Right as I was reading these words anddrinking in the gravity of what I was being told, the phone started ringing.There was an incredible feeling of energy on this call. The sound of the ringingseemed to reverberate through my entire body, mind, and spirit.As I reached out for the phone, I honestly wondered if it would be Joe Mason onthe other line, asking me something like “Did you just get all of that?”Instead, it was the guy with the green T-shirt from the Pine Bush UFO group, whoI had just met a month ago at the conference. At the very beginning of the call,he introduced himself, reminded me who he was, and then said, “I’ve just beeninvited to a seminar on how to do astral projection. It starts today and it’sright down here in Pine Bush. Do you want to go?” This was a relatively shortdrive from where I lived in Rosendale. “My God,” I responded. “You have no ideawhat has just happened to me, or how amazing it is that you just asked me that.I have just downloaded pages and pages of written material from some kind ofextraterrestrial intelligence. And right at the end, it was inviting me to studyastral projection. That’s what I was just reading as you called me.”This was before the era of electronic navigation. I got so lost in trying tofind my way to the venue where the class was being held that I ended up havingto turn around and drive home. I later would learn that this man had negativeintentions of his own, and my guides were protecting me by ensuring that I nevermade it to the meeting. It took only a few more telephone calls before Iunderstood that this was not a person I wanted to be in contact with. None ofthat really mattered, as I had just broken through and made contact. Thematerial was incredibly fascinating, rich and deep. It will obviously takeanother book to unpack what happened to me, with all the transcripts, in orderto give this discussion the depth and quality that I like to use for somethingthis important.I didn’t pull anything in on the day I started my new job, 11/11, but I was ableto get another reading the day after. I woke up to the clock saying 5:55, whichwas a great start. Among other things, this reading said:> A plugged-in discussion with your family and friends for you. You were lonely> at age five. The little bits and pieces come together, and I mean that quite> literally. . . . Hello, David. Plan B. It’s been a very long time. We’ve built> and destroyed civilizations. . . . As the process goes around, there are> ascensions, and a new cycle begins. Sometimes you will be receiving a spectrum> of anecdotes instead of the real thing. Speaking of the tones inside of your> body, they’re in there, but you can’t quite know them yet. It takes thought> and discipline. [David looks at clock, is running late.] We will not do> anything to put you at risk. Go wash up. We will not influence the distance of> the human body—it must be done from within. I was talking to another guy at a> staff meeting the other day and he said the same thing. So you’ve got to> listen to the new schedule, try on different parts. See what you like; you’ll> be pleased. Irrigation they didn’t even know about in the year 3020 BC.12> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber464]In another session from November 16, they said:> Who do you think we are? Space aliens? Wrong. That’s the one thing about our> service is that we need to help. . . . Please don’t forget the crystal—it is> the technology of your own family. We will also be there on Sunday, the day of> rest. You will thank us then.13 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber465]Violence ended up breaking out at work on November 18, and a staff person wasbitten. I was the first one to intervene and do a bite release, as I had beentaught and certified to do at my other job. This resulted in a bitter andultimately hopeless argument, since this facility had never wanted to use SCIPtechniques. SCIP stands for Strategic Crisis Intervention and Prevention, and Iwas trained in it from my prior place of employment. One of the things we weretaught to do was to perform “takedowns,” where we safely get the person to theground with their arms wrapped around them so they cannot do further harm. Myreading from the following morning showed that the beings were clearly upsetabout what had happened and felt I was too reactive in how I had handled thesituation:> You being attacked is nonsense. You have to learn to use substantial> self-control. This symbolism is for your own good. . . . This can be> double-sided. Where you work, you need to put a lot of effort in. Move as> quick as you can through the Church. Centering around Christmas and the New> Year, you’ll be ready for a change.14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber466]This proved to be another remarkably accurate prophecy. I was indeed working ina church recreational building, and the reading said, “Move as quick as you canthrough the Church.” I ended up being forced to leave the job within the exacttime window that the reading had named, although I took the final step ofquitting before they could fire me. Shortly after this incident, on November 22,I took my break time at work to meditate deeply and see if I could pull in areading. This ended up being the only time I ever did a reading at a job. Thewords were inspiring and beautiful, and here is what they said:> Believe it when I tell you the end is coming. The end of organized> materialism. You’ve got to listen to your own inner voice. Nothing else will> do. The voice of your ego will destroy you. These things are to be discussed,> not repeated. The things you think of will come from higher and higher places.> To facilitate this transition demands concentration and respect, an easier job> than one might imagine. Be fruitful in your life and do not fall prey to the> forces which conspire within you to bring you down. Know that salvation> awaits. The Green party lends its archetypes to your aid. Be friendly unto> thyself, and know that you are one with God.15> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber467]The reference to the Green party was obviously a dreamlike symbol, indicatingthat the beings I was speaking and working with were at the fourth-density,green-ray level of consciousness. I reread these words many times and was veryuplifted by them. I kept the notebook with me wherever I went, and new passageswere continually being added to the collection."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURA REMARKABLE DISCOVERYEvery morning, I would have to wake up early, before my alarm went off, try toremember my dream, listen to the Dream Voice, document its results, and thenrush to take a shower, eat something, and head out the door with just enoughtime to make it to work. Every minute counted. Unfortunately, there were somepeople who refused to even go the speed limit on Route 32, which I again had tonavigate every morning on the way to work. Once someone slowed too much, theycould easily create a long line of cars with angry drivers just like me behindthem, but they didn’t seem to care. Although Route 32 was a winding road, therewere places where you could legally pass. I was regularly trying to go as fastas I could, since I was always running late. On multiple occasions, I tookdangerous risks to try to get around them because I felt it was better thanfeeling trapped.I did notice a series of warnings coming in about this in various readings. Theystarted in a cryptic fashion, but got more and more obvious. Little did I knowthat history was going to repeat itself. The beings were going to repeat a priorlesson by setting me up with another car crash, almost exactly one year later.This time, they would very precisely predict the event in advance, but withwritten words instead of dreams. Here is a list of the prophecies that weresuggesting I was getting myself in trouble, beginning with the date:11/16/96: For the tumors, you must let us know. Collections will be threethousand dollars . . . A collection of money challenges . . . I really encouragethe New York Local State of Awards. I feel guilty as an accountant [for you,when you go] chapter 7. You do want to help us, don’t you?11/19/96: You can stay up all night, or use your greeting cards. Use thegreeting cards, clean out your room and all will be written out in the secondact. I wouldn’t like to be out this afternoon if I were you. It just doesn’tseem right to me. You know who walked in the last time.11/20/96: We need two more people. More importantly, people have a habit.Important things need to be done with them. You’ll work on it and get it done.Drive carefully. Don’t do anything overboard. Pull up as much money as you can;it’s more of a community lesson than anything else.11/23/96: A staff person is going to sit down with you. No more BS channeling.You have to tone your voice. Evidently you know where your passport is, so useit. . . . Life is beautiful. It’s not that hard, I just want you to understandwhat the process is. You’ve got five more staffings/stackings to go. I stoppedsinging a long time ago. When I sing now, I find there are not so many playersaround me. . . . I have a dream for you. Lie back and relax and we’ll bring itin. [The dream featured me establishing direct two-way telepathic communicationwith Jesus. He was standing there and speaking to me directly as I heard thewords. We were having a relaxed, friendly conversation about how I couldcontinue to develop the ability to hear what he was saying telepathically. Ithen found myself playing music on stage. The reading then continued.]What you are being shown is that you have a sandwich in the fridge that is goingto be cut down into slices. There are stressed-out people and they wantattention. Good—you ARE listening to me! Listen to immediacy. When we bump intoeach other, I will spend just enough time to ask you a few questions. In theLight, you have the most candid footing. . . . Soon we will sit down and beginto redirect your thoughts. What I don’t get is why you are so against the idea.It isn’t part of the test for you to ignite the Source in flames. It’s been solong since we’ve been interrupted that off the top of my head I can think of noreason for your reluctance. We went a little nuts in the fridge, but were taughtsomething in the freezer. Branch out your control to all aspects of your life.Be aware that your trouble has not completely ended; the cards have shown you.[This was a reference to a Tarot card reading I had done for myself recently.][Question: “Tell me of my true home and from where I came.”] Ah, the woodward.Ah, beautiful, a place of light and of forever. A place you will be returning toso quickly. Just go through the steps to get there. It sounds easy, and it isyou who makes it difficult. [Question: “What about Dr. Courtney Brown’s remoteviewings of the Grays? Are they actually working for good, or what?”] You willrecall our friend talking about the Pleiades. [This was a reference to anotherinspirational book I had read, Patricia Pereira’s Songs of the Arcturians.1[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber468]] Lots of energy is coming in, and it isneither good nor bad. These concepts of duality are part of the prison ofthird-density existence. [The Grays] have been moving around for quite a while.We’re not talking about that. I’m going to get there soon enough. There are morepressing matters. We must focus on the urgent situation now before you. Godknows how long it has taken us to decide when to do this with you. And anotherthing, you really ought to wear more blue; it suits you quite well.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber469]Although that last sentence sounds like a joke, they were again speaking insymbolic dream language. By asking me to “wear more blue,” they meant that Ishould spend more time with my higher chakras—light blue and indigo—active. Thatwould mean being far more meditative and “tuned in” to universal energy, peace,and love throughout my daily existence.Now let’s continue. Here we get references to my “playing Virgo too loud.” Theastrological sign of Virgo is associated with being analytical, perfectionistic,critical, and judgmental, among other things.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber470]I certainly did have a desire to have a “perfect” drive to work, and could nothandle someone going below the speed limit. The reading also indicated anupcoming mistake that would involve the state police, which this crash certainlydid.11/24/96: You played Virgo too loud. It doesn’t matter, as long as youunderstand that this is the answer to the state police. Again, it is as much mymistake as yours. Your family: That would be a good idea. A nice thing to lookat. It is in my cards for the New Year. I’ve orchestrated the next 10 yearsstarting from now. We’ve discussed it, and you know this is true. . . . Asconcerns astral travel, be aware that others will be waiting for you, and youshould not walk into it blindly. You’ve already had Quality Assurance sayingthat you were messed up. Just be patient and still, knowing that you were borninto the seventies and lived throughout the nineties. The color pink on apaintbrush—you want to use wide strokes. You’ll see me doing this too. Someonewrote me a letter saying you were the most vicious man alive. We disagree withthis, but driving badly and staring at women in lust will not elicit favorableresponses. Go to sleep now and rest.11/25/96: The Father/Son confuses you. Merely stated, it implies that women arein charge of the world. You’d be a totally different person if that were thecase. You made a point of being nuts when you left, [actually, when you] removedyourself. Why do you think we ran into the cops that day? These actions must bebalanced, you know. . . . Be aware of the tandem about to erupt. . . . Heavenand Earth will not be possible until you get this stuff done. Treat everythingwith the utmost seriousness.”4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber471]This next excerpt from November 28 explains that the part of me that can indulgein negativity, here referred to as Lucifer, is always waiting to be awakened andactivated, as with all of us. Their obvious goal is to discourage me from doingthat, and “let sleeping dogs lie,” as it were, by simply stepping over this partof myself and moving on. A reference is also made to alcohol, suggesting that Iwas behaving much like a drunk driver on the road—which would be another exampleof “awakening Lucifer.” On the positive side, I was being told that once Iworked through these personal problems, I could have a career as a UFOlogist,including radio appearances.11/28/96: Lucifer seems to be sleeping on the floor. Perhaps you’d like to givehim a walk, or step over him again. Any assignment we give you could be anytimein the next seventeen months. Don’t go anywhere. National Public Radio,Radiology may not be far behind. You’re going to lose respect if you listen tosome jackass and hinge everything on that. Patience, again. It doesn’t look likeyou’re sleeping there too long. What kind of drinks do you have? You know it’soff-limits, right?5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber472]REMARKABLE PROPHECIESThe next reading, from November 30, 1996, predicted my upcoming job with GaiamTV, which ran from 2013 to 2018, when I finally resigned. The depth and clarityof the prophecy was utterly astonishing once I eventually realized what it wassaying. This reading came in after I had traveled back up to my mother’s housefor Thanksgiving break, and I published it on my website three years later, in1999. I have also included a time-stamped reference from April 9, 2001, to showthis came in long before I started the Gaiam TV job:11/30/96: You’re probably one of very few people in the club who can understandThe Ra Material. You’re fat enough in the mouth; you need to wash it down. Upagainst the wall, now you’re looking for it. It reminds me of when we wouldtouch base before. You went on a diet. Establish your horizons and ask yourselfa question: “Do I like to sit in school?” You can pick an answer. If no, startto study. Take notes.There is no need for a planned sacrifice. Apples and oranges can be a pair, youknow—if that lands national. Saturn returns, it can’t possibly be HomeopathicTV. Think of Art Bell doing yoga. Maybe something will come of it, maybe someother time. Another period of snow before vacation; you can come inside. Don’tbe a slave; slaves do the work of many for the pay of few. It’s easy to latch onto that feeling of powerlessness. Don’t worry, we have some crazy little dreamswaiting for you. The following weekend, we’re going to have a special function.6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber473],7 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber474]It is easy to miss this prophecy if you don’t understand the context. I visitedGaiam in January 2013 after being invited to appear as a guest on George Noory’sshow, Beyond Belief. George was the replacement for Art Bell after hisresignation from Coast to Coast AM. Gaiam at the time was most well-known forselling yoga products in Whole Foods, and this reading had said, “Think of ArtBell doing yoga.” Right before that sentence, it said, “Homeopathic TV,” and thename of the company I started working for was Gaiam TV. My show with Georgebecame the highest-rated program on the network, and led to my beginning withone weekly show, Wisdom Teachings, and later a second show, which became CosmicDisclosure once I brought in Corey Goode to share his fascinating information.I later realized that Corey Goode’s arrival in 2015 was predicted in the abovepassage as well, when it said, “Apples and oranges can be a pair, you know, ifthat lands national.” Corey and I were certainly opposites, and the phrase“apples and oranges” is a popular American saying to illustrate how differenttwo people can be. Regarding the idea of our work “landing national,” Gaiam didend up buying prominent front-page ads on Drudge Report, arguably the biggestnational news site of all, right during the highly contentious 2016 presidentialelection. This dramatically helped to raise awareness of the reality of theSecret Space Program, and pave the way for later disclosures that have not yethappened at the time of this writing but are highly anticipated.Another intriguing synchronicity was that once I began flying out to Boulder towork for Gaiam, I usually stayed in the same house that Chogyam Trungpa hadlived and died in after he founded the Naropa Institute. It was interesting thatNaropa had only recently rejected me when this prophecy came in, but once thetime loop was completed, I found myself staying in the founder’s house. A goodpart of The Synchronicity Key was written there, as well as many, if not most,of my slides for Wisdom Teachings. The house had become a sanctuary in theastral plane for ghosts, many of whom I met in my dreams. A large number ofthese people had died under very traumatic circumstances, such as the Holocaust,and they appreciated the calm and soothing energy that the house provided, suchas from group sound healing ceremonies conducted there every month, and othersuch events.Yet another remarkable time-loop synchronicity associated with this prophecy didnot occur to me until after I finished and submitted the first full draft ofthis book on Saturday, November 16, 2019. That same day, I got on a plane andflew out to the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas to meet my friend Steven Tyler, thelead singer of Aerosmith, who I have known for seven years but rarely get to seein person. My wife and I spent time with him in his dressing room before thatevening’s performance. The November 1996 reading said, “Don’t worry, we havesome crazy little dreams waiting for you. The following weekend, we’re going tohave a special function.” I had always wondered about the phrase “crazy littledreams,” and now I realized it was a reference to three of the biggest Aerosmithsongs: Crazy, Dream On, and Rag Doll, where Steven sings “Daddy’s little cutie”in the chorus—thus explaining the presence of the word little. The “specialfunction” on the “following weekend” was the meeting I had with Stevenimmediately after adding these prophecies into the book and finishing it—almostexactly twenty-three years after the information had originally come through.THE COMING CAR CRASHThe quality of the delivery was improving by the day. Here are some excerptsfrom December 2 that again alluded to the upcoming crash, but were alsocomplimentary of the work I was doing in the greater sense.12/2/96: In your cap and gown, think about what you are shopping for, for amoment; aquamarine, the colors of the spectrum. . . . Many people feel they arelost. It’s quite appropriate in this society, though. How do you think I feelabout it? I never say anything to cause this. . . . This is my speakerphone;this is something you can watch. It will be around for many years. We need somepurchasing orders bad. Silence is your greatest ally. . . . We have almostdetermined the breadth of your ancient knowledge to have. It’s a lot to writeabout. . . . For this month, there will be lots of surprises; Habitu.8[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber475]Before we go on, this passage proved to be quite astonishing. Later that sameday, I was driving in the van for work. I was on a new street and passed arestaurant I had never seen before. The name of the restaurant was Habitu. Irecognized the word immediately, opened up my notebook, and read it in awe.Shortly after this point, I asked about various dreams I was receivingsuggesting that they might be steering me into having a girlfriend. The firsttwo sentences of the answer were “Linear tube thought. This thought answer willbe stated with Paul.” By this point, I had just started recording the messagesinto a tape recorder and then transcribing them by hand into the notebookafterward. Just one page after I wrote those words in the notebook, I discoveredthat my brother’s friend Paul had written a message to me in the notebook andnever told me about it. This was another astonishing synchronicity in the earlydays of the phenomenon. As the reading continued, it gave a powerful messageabout changes we have yet to see in our future at this time.We have always tried to give you direction without pushing or forcing. Thereceipt of a female into the life processes could be most extraordinary. Thepatriarch is winding down, landing with such a force in each stanza. More andmore, the barriers are toppling. Those who have faith in the one capitalizing onthe shopping [are misguided.] We all know by now that this is a malevolent forcethat will soon disintegrate. . . . Just analyze the diagrams [in] the Bible.Murder is still being sung in the hearts of foul men. Save thyself up on theriver. Know that the decades of tyranny are over. Accept that circumstances havechanged. There is a new understanding now that is being brought out into thelight. People will not be the same; with the speed of thought, they will fly andtravel. The reason [we are telling you all this] is for YOU to provide acloaking mechanism, when all goes platinum. It will divide the Mormon records asthose of the Church, as usual.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber476]The statement “when all goes platinum” could well be a reference to theanticipated solar flash event. The idea of providing a “cloaking mechanism” forthis event appears to be a reference to light-body activation, after which timepeople “will fly and travel . . . with the speed of thought.” The next reading,from December 3, included another warning about the upcoming car crash that Idid not see at the time. It was slightly disguised by talking about a stain onthe side of the road, and the idea of encountering Saturn, the planet of trialsand tribulations.12/3/96: It’s such a mess when you’re dividing. A loose stain on the side of theroad. Go inside and look around. Look at yourself [and] see what you mightfind. . . . Saturn will be opening itself up to you shortly. . . . You can callme Bitches’ Brew. . . . In unison, the voice of the Creator sings out, but whoshall decode the signal? Continued assumptions prove incorrect. It is our pledgeto be of assistance despite the circumstances. Those who learn the truth ofreligion will find themselves in an inverse position to the dictates ofsociety. . . . It is about to be centralized again; I am sorry. Discussionsreminiscent of our talk so long ago. The memories come quickly, like fleetingghosts.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber477]I found it very mysterious that this source was telling me that these“discussions [were] reminiscent of our talk so long ago,” since I had onlystarted doing this practice within the last three weeks. Were they talking abouta past life? I was not sure. The next reading came in that same night, at 7:26P.M. As I was sitting in the house after work, I very clearly heard, “Go get apiece of paper.” I then started writing down what I heard, and this is a partialtranscript of the result, which gives undeniable hints that those who Ascendwill have the power of levitation:A new thought is enveloping you. Obscured by the obstructions in your mind, yetrapidly coming into focus. A Christmas tree, its parlances to behold.[“Parlance” means “a way or manner of speaking.”11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber478]] I have a feeling you’re not alone in this;the children will understand the new standard. Obscure light refractions arediffusing into the population. The mirror is kept gleaming brightly. In theforest of thought, the storm is dissipating, as a free expression of thoughtcomes to the mind, flowing and dancing freely like a magical sprite. The cloaksthat have enveloped us will be cast away, for there is a new shade under thesun. Those with wings shall soar above.Abstract thoughts and notions are brought with serendipity into the arena ofbelieving. The vines in the musty forest provide anchorage to higher levels.Above the tree line, one sees a most beautiful splendor. He who is pure in heartwill have no difficulty attaining this, for it is one body, one mind, one soul,and the abstract thoughts and notions of the past will be shed away like an oldskin. Swiftly come the messengers of destiny, bringing with them the notions ofa new age. It is but for you to perceive it that it may become reality. Thedimension of thought runs deep—its length and breadth cannot be measured by yourthree-dimensional instruments. Its scope is historic in ways you cannot evencomprehend. The abysmal failures and longings of the past will no longer holdsway over you. Confused in a box, many will open to new surprises. Thoughtpatterns are divided among the many from the One. Those abuses of intellect willfade away.Your shirt. Your underwear. A jacket. How fitted for a king . . . The abstractnotion that one can survive without words is not a myth, but reality. Thetechnological abuses of Earth’s history will fall away. I’m so forgetful; Igrabbed the bottle of shaving cream when I wanted to reveal something else. Yourpurple head will glisten. What you choose to believe is for you to decide. Thechoice is around you, and you may drink of it. No one survives in the pathwaysof the dead. If you believe there is only one mind, how can there be twodifferent people? This communication grows thin. Duty stands before you, and youmust embrace it. Fear not, for God is with you in the Light and love of infinitecreation.12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber479]The next day, Wednesday, December 4, was when the most important prophecy of myupcoming car crash came in. Let’s begin just by reading what it said, and thenwe will analyze it.12/4/96: Have some tea . . . My gift to the world will be a 3 1/2-by-11 sheet ofpaper. Expect it on Friday. This runs counter to earlier systems of thought. Wecan work on visual sites. 90 minutes till 10:00.13[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber480]Though this may seem deceptively simple, it proved to be a stunning prophecy.That same Friday, I was driving on US Route 9W to Poughkeepsie in the midst of afreezing-cold blizzard for my training to become “med certified.” The cars aheadof me came to a sudden stop out of nowhere, and I slammed on the brakes. My carslid forward nearly thirty-five feet through the slush, and I gently tapped thebumper of the car in front of me, leaving a dime-size dent. The woman insistedon having the police arrive. The passage began by saying, “Have some tea,” andsome of the emergency personnel were drinking hot tea after they arrived inorder to stay warm. The state police officer wrote me a ticket for the accident,which was on a 3 1/2-by-11 sheet of paper, and the reading said, “My gift to theworld will be a 3 1/2-by-11 sheet of paper.” The time he assigned to thecollision was 8:30 A.M, which was indeed “90 minutes till 10:00.” This accidenthappened almost exactly one year after my previous one, with a difference ofonly twelve days. I had a hard time understanding how this accident could be a“gift to the world,” but in hindsight, this event did help me to become far moreconsiderate of others and thereby further activate my own Ascension process.Based on the context, this reading also could be a 9/11 prophecy. First of all,the 9/11 event is always written as the numeral 9, a slash, and then the numeral11. In the reading, I was told that the source’s “gift to the world” would be a3 1/2-by-11 sheet of paper. The measurements of the paper had a slash in them,followed by 11. Additional support was given when the time was marked as “90minutes until 10:00.” If we eliminate the zeroes, this passage fixed thenumerals 9 and 1, the two key numbers in 9/11. This may all seem like a reach,but not when we see what came in that same Friday. Other 9/11 prophecies alsocame in later on that were far more precise, and I featured several of them inThe Synchronicity Key. And let’s not forget that the Great Pyramid itself, whichmay have been built as far back as 10,490 BC, seems to have a very impressive9/11 prophecy built into the stonework of the pit in the Subterranean Chamber.On that same day, Wednesday, December 4, 1996, I asked my source a question. Iwoke up with a dream the morning before that I had not actually documented andwritten down, since I was focused on pulling in the readings and was in a hurryto leave the house. In that dream, I was seeing spectacular images ofMayan-style pyramids, roads, and buildings that were submerged at the bottom ofthe ocean. This was far more beautiful and spectacular than anything I had everseen or read about in any books on ancient civilizations. I wanted to ask why Ihad been shown this amazing vision, and what it meant for me. Here was theanswer, which included additional obvious prophecies of the coming car crash. Iwas running late, not sticking to a schedule, and would end up crashing my cardue to slippery road conditions. The reading even says, “The path is slippery”and “Make sure your seat belt is buckled in,” so again, they clearly knew whatwas about to happen:Nothing is forever. The reason why you have such difficulty with that is thatyou were passed up. It’s time for another cycle to go around. Come with me, andI will show you the way to the Light. The path is slippery, so one must runcarefully. . . . It is important that you stick to a schedule. We’re a littleout of range timewise. Eventually, there will be more for you. . . . I’ll checkagain to make sure your seat belt is buckled in. Trust your instincts above allelse, for they will not fail you. It’s terrible; it’s so far away. You haveKaraoke in your hand. In working on advancements, some times it is necessary tofall asleep. The supervisor will see you again. Cloudy glasses, you’re fine;it’s similar to what happened before.14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber481]Much of this passage was prophetic of the crash. In the spiritual sense, I hadfallen asleep. The windshield was indeed cloudy that day, hence the reference to“cloudy glasses.” This crash was indeed “similar to what happened before,” sinceI had been through a well-prophesied karmic car crash the year before. The line“the supervisor will see you again” indicated how this was a disciplinaryaction, just like I would go through at work if I was called into a meeting withmy supervisor. Now let’s continue:But seriously, you have to start thinking of the world. You don’t have to, butit has suffered long enough. . . . The whole residence is on strike. You’ve gotit named; you have me, I am peaceful and PhD. Your cap and gown can be prettyexciting, as long as you clean it every once in a while. Your work showspromise; new thoughts and information will be arriving to you soon. It’s time todo some shopping, shopping for lunch specials. Which one do you want,Christina? . . . I’ve been here for a long time, and I know you pretty well bynow. Don’t forget that there are starving kids, Afrikaan, African. It’sbasically a series about the hopes and doubts of living and growing up inAmerica. Look to the end of the book for some insights on that one.15[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber482]The metaphor of “shopping for lunch specials” had to do with the creation ofwork that would feed others spiritually. By calling me Christina, the source wasreferring to how my feminine Christ self was now awakening. The idea of“starving kids” was a reference to all the people who have never really felt anysense of absolute proof of a higher, positive spiritual power in the world. Andthe last sentence, “Look to the end of the book for some insights on that one,”has another very obvious time loop to my present as I write these words. I am atthe very end of the book now, and am trying to make sure that some of the mostimportant messages from these early readings make it into this book before I runout of pages. I had to laugh when I reread those words as I was putting thischapter together. Even well into the creative process for this book in thesummer of 2019, I did not realize that the moment the readings started wouldonly appear at the very end.The reading continued with the surprise discovery that I was speaking with afemale entity, and that the man I had been hearing from before was apparentlyher supervisor. As I heard these words, I was also shown a vision of a female ina white robe, which again is exactly like the Midwayers, Elders, or Anshar:You know I’m late, Dave. I’m supposed to be sitting right next to my supervisorat this point. [Voice was of a grandmotherly woman.] Did you assume that I wasmale this year? Wrong again. The birth of stars; you must check yourmessages. . . . You need to go to the bathroom now, and get changed for work.Peace be with you in the Light of everlasting Love.16[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber483]The next day, Thursday, December 5, featured additional prophecies of the nextday’s car crash that I completely did not understand at the time. This includeda mention of “private dummies,” which appears to be a veiled reference tocrash-test dummies, as well as “rescue squads” and the idea that a “tragedy” wascoming:12/5/96: Letting go of something important . . . It’s only being scheduled insome ways so you can understand procrastination. I do this to involve thenotions of my peers in caring for you. . . . Private dummies adorn yourcollection. When the answer is so simple, it is also so terrible; still, when Ithink about it, it would be nice if I had more than one hope. Dream; you mustput a stop to this sleep deprivation. If you were to land a new job, you mightcalm down a little bit. To not stop looking might be good for you. If you talkto your friends about it, they could help you in Highland [a town not far fromRosendale]. It’s all mixed up; right now, I’d rather not talk about it.The missing pieces fit together, and then again, sometimes they don’t. Thinkdeeply about what you are planning on embarking on. Many great rescue squadshave come into being. Their illustrious voices sing high the praises of theCreator. To give you details at this point would be redundant. You scared methis summer; I was working very diligently to find a table for you. You needlittle or no prompting in order to get through most things; that’s why it wassuch a tragedy. One must see that you cannot live only on hummus. [I was on avegan diet and often ate chips and hummus when I should have had a more balancedmeal.] Jeopardizing your health had severe consequences. You lied to me aboutcertain things, and that was hard to compensate for. And the truth is, some ofit goes way back to the mind essence of what I was saying before. Truly thehighest order is to know one’s self. Everyone has a similar weakness. . . . Itis aesthetically pleasing for me to see you growing, and I know that one day wewill integrate in views together as One. I know that you are going to finishwith accolades and high honors. . . . Peace be with you in the Light ofeverlasting Love.17 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber484]9/11: THE GREATEST SCIENCE FICTION STORY EVER TOLDNow we have finally reached the morning of Friday, December 6, 1996. This iswhen I had my strongest 9/11 prophecy, including the actual numerals 911, aswell as a passage with the ironic joke that “CBS and ABC give it adequatecoverage.” Obviously, the news coverage of 9/11 was far more than adequate—itwas a nonstop inundation of images of mass destruction for weeks and weeks onend. Once we see this in context, the many other statements in this reading notonly apply to my going through a personal “dark night of the soul” and healingprocess—they also indicated that a similar collapse would happen with thepatriarchal negative elites who have dominated our planet for centuries, if notmillennia. The “negative elite” were very likely involved in planning andcarrying out 9/11, as many scholars have argued, and as I discuss in TheAscension Mysteries. Nine-eleven actually represented a defeat for them, as Iargued with historical cycle analysis in The Synchronicity Key. At times I willpause this reading and step in for commentary as we go along.12/6/96: Under the aegis of friendly planetary transformation, the talk showhost has got a new one. They’re all special effects, designed to ride thelightning bolts. That’s one way of losing their cookies is to get realsyndicated. It’s doctor-recommended; who is going to ask the pediatrician? Whois going to look at the self with tangible results? Self-awareness is the key tobuilding a foundation. If you’re on the floor, you might have to postponethings.18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber485]Once we see the prophetic references to 9/11, we can understand what thispassage is talking about. First of all, this tragedy did create years’ worth ofconversation for talk-show hosts. This included the idea that 9/11 was an insidejob. Less than two years after the 9/11 event, I read intelligence leaks fromthe investigator Sherman Skolnick, saying that the buildings were brought downby low-yield mini-nuke devices, according to his insiders. Here is a quote fromSkolnick that was published on April 4, 2003: “In 1992, members of ourinvestigative group spent about four months extensively interviewing MichaelRiconoscuito. Described by those who knew him well as a weapons and electronicgenius, which we verified he is/was, he ran afoul of the American CIA because hedivulged to a Congressional Committee the dirty business of Daddy Business andothers in the ‘spook’ industry. [The federal jails, in various places in thisnation, have put away by frame-ups, several former CIA pilots who blew thewhistle on dope shipments, CIA covert operators and such, all on the outs withthe spy cartel, and put in jail on long sentences. Riconosciuto was framed up ona twenty-eight-year rap.] As we confirmed, Riconosciuto helped invent anddevelop a sub-atomic weapon he and others called ‘blue lightning.’ . . . If thetruth about ‘blue lightning’ comes out, will ordinary Americans find out whatreally took down, as by controlled demolitions, the World Trade Center twintowers and WTC Building 7 in Manhattan, September 11, 2001?”19[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber486]According to my insider Pete Peterson, the Blue Lightning devices are only aboutthe size of the top joint of your thumb, and they are referred to as “fifth-gennukes.” The code name of Blue Lightning was used because of the visible blueenergy they give off. And this reading said, “they’re all special effects,designed to ride the lightning bolts.” I found this very interesting indeed. AsSkolnick’s insiders revealed, the collapse of the Twin Towers was indeed an actof “special effects,” caused not by typical jet-fuel burning but the “lightningbolts” from the Blue Lightning weapon.This passage also said that this catastrophe was ultimately“doctor-recommended,” as it was necessary for the positive beings to allow us togo through this process in order to realize the true darkness in our world. Onlythen would we be emboldened enough to rise up against it. Now let’s pick it upwith the very next words they spoke, after I asked a question that proved to beirrelevant to their greater point. Notice that the next line says, “These vitalmatters have been recorded in stone.” It was only as I was writing this chapterthat I understood this line was referring to the Pyramid Timeline. We havediscussed the very precise prophecy of 9/11 in the timeline, where, in PeterLemesurier’s words, “the bottom will fall out of the world,” and we enter whatGreat Pyramid researchers call the Pit of Hell on Earth. As we remember,Lemesurier expected this to happen in 2004, but by his own logic, we can alsobackdate it by three years, which fixes this event to 2001.These vital matters have been recorded in stone. Fear not; the breath of theInfinite is about to be born again. It’s no problem when you know what you aredoing. The oddest part about this is its connection to the Church. Discoveriesin the caves will be changing all of that so soon. If a person is sick, theyneed constant attention. If a person is real sick, they need to collapse. In asmaller church, prayer is a very strong system. I’m aware of myself choosingattractive names, which is not good. You know it’s Christmas when Joshuapresents himself to you.20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber487]Before we go any further, the above passage is talking about the fall of thepatriarchy, and personifying it as if a single man was going through this.Multiple insiders would later tell me that the negative elite are directly tiedto the Church, since the Vatican is their spiritual headquarters. The readingindicated that this patriarch is “real sick” and “needs to collapse.” As thepassage continues, the metaphor of the collapsing patriarchy continues—and thenwe get the now-legendary 9/11 prophecy. It begins by outlining that the wholestory line was a fraud. In fact, the reading referred to it as “the greatestscience fiction story ever told.”Sometimes a habit must be dropped cold turkey in order to leave it. Allpleasantries have been exhausted; there is no other way for the energy to flow.The patriarch must be denominated. It’s the greatest science fiction story evertold. Someone comes in—Rescue 911. CBS and ABC give it adequate coverage. Acast-iron fence is wrought around the victim’s body. He likes to do that. Animpenetrable wall needs only be potentiated by positive energy. . . . Theessential concept will be felt so strongly that it cannot be ignored. In thecontext of the rest of the people, the material you present is truly a magicalgift. . . . Peace be with you in the Light of everlasting Love.21[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber488]This passage talks about how “the patriarch must be denominated.” The worddenominated is a humorous play on words, for a politician needs to be nominatedby his or her party to run for president. This was another clue that the USgovernment itself was at least partly involved in the planning of 9/11. The“habit” that this patriarchal cult has had of dominating the planet “must bedropped cold turkey,” just like I had to drop my habit of running late andspeeding on the roads. Then we have a direct numerical reference to 9/11 as“Rescue 911.” Again, we see the ironic joke that “CBS and ABC give it adequatecoverage.” This made no sense for my little personal car crash, but perfectsense for 9/11. Then it said, “A cast-iron fence is wrought around the victim’sbody.” Indeed, the support beams of the World Trade Center were made of steel,and wrought iron is a form of iron that has been made stronger by being heatedand then worked with tools. After the World Trade Center fell, a small area ofsteel beams remained standing. This was the “cast-iron fence” that was “wroughtaround the victim’s body.”The reading also indicated that this event would not be doom and gloom: “Animpenetrable wall needs only be potentiated by positive energy.” In this case, astrong part of that positive energy is our collective desire for freedom andliberty. This type of a disaster creates prayers that authorize the benevolent,angelic extraterrestrial Guardians and Watchers to be allowed to do far more tohelp us than they otherwise would have been able to carry out. And indeed, thereading then says, “The essential concept [of our collective desire for freedom]will be felt so strongly that it cannot be ignored.”When we look back to the Pyramid Timeline, we see that not everyone has to enterthe Pit. By simply seeing it in front of us, and the trap that it represents, wecan turn back, retrace our steps, and then travel up through the Well-Shaft.This delivers us directly up to the entrance to the Ascending Passage, at AD 33in the Pyramid Timeline—right at the moment when Jesus achieves Ascension.Lemesurier revealed that the Pyramid Timeline is a metaphor for the spiritualjourney we all go through, and on that level the timing is not fixed. We allhave the opportunity to Ascend if we will it to be, mainly by ensuring that ourwaking focus is on love and acceptance of others, rather than manipulation andcontrol.One last prophecy I will share in this chapter came in just fifteen days later,on December 21, 1996. With the benefit of hindsight, this again appeared to be adirect prophecy of 9/11, and the “scoundrels” who were secretly responsible forplanning it:12/21/96: Remember when I told you about the scoundrels? On the good side of it,there’s always a way out. . . . Spirit authorities are connected, but they won’tdirectly intervene without good reason. When people disappear in the buildings,sometimes you have lost them. Getting closer to that state known as sleep, thatstate known as New York.22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber489]This reading directly mentioned New York, and mentioned how “people disappear inthe buildings” and “sometimes you have lost them.” The beginning of the readingagain clearly implied that this was done by “the scoundrels.” The implicationhere is that the 9/11 event and other such engineered catastrophes willultimately cause “spirit authorities” to “directly intervene,” so that “on thegood side, there is always a way out.” Although we have yet to see this prophecyfully realized at the time of this writing, I am ever hopeful and confident thatwe will. I will close this chapter with two more readings that came in as of1998 and made the message even clearer. These were documented on my website in1999, well before 9/11 ever took place. The first reading is referring to adream I had just dictated, where I did indeed see a 9/11-style “airborneexplosion” that damaged a skyscraper-type building.7/1/98: We understand that these are very distressing circumstances, and wouldremind you that the tectonic shifts involved in the upcoming changes also makeNew York a particularly undesirable target location [to live in]. . . . In thefollowing dream the cycle was completed by the appearance of the airborneexplosion. This also was interwoven with the more long-term [solar] effects ofthe Ascension, but the bomb aspect was correctly given, and needs to beaddressed at this time. This is coming in the form of an ongoing jihad, whichdoes not want to be acknowledged to the people by your government. Yet, there isevery reason to believe that it is progressing, and that New York is the numberone target for any such actions. Let us all hope together that this prophecyshall fail to come to pass.7/9/98: [The 1993] World Trade Center bombing really shook things up. The nexttime one tries something like this, it will become a much larger story, if thedetails are worked out properly.23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber490]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVECONCLUSIONExcept for the last passage from December 21, 1996, and the two passages from1998, all the readings we just reviewed happened less than a month after mycontact started. Many hundreds of pages of beautiful, lyrical passages flowedthrough me. To properly review everything that happened, and all the astonishingfuture prophecies that these readings gave me, I will need to write at least onemore book. In all honesty, it will probably take more than one volume just tocover the basics to a level where I will feel satisfied.STUNNING PROPHETIC ACCURACYDuring the years of 1996 to 2000, where I recorded my own voice every morning todictate my dreams and readings, I would often sit down to transcribe a stack ofas many as four or five ninety-minute cassette tapes of material that I haddictated but hadn’t yet had the time to write up. In almost every case where Idid this, the readings were describing what had happened to me right before Isat down. Since there are hundreds of pages of readings and we are now in thefinal chapter, I will speed up the timeline and review just a few examples fromwhat I lovingly call the “Greatest Hits Collection.” These prophecies will bewell known to readers who followed my website within the first few years afterits debut in February 1999, although I have now gone back to the archives anddug out specific details that I never published back then.One of the most fantastic prophecies I ever received came in on Christmas Day1996. Eric had become aware that he wanted to break up with his girlfriend, aJapanese exchange student he got together with shortly after Yumi and I pairedup. As I told him all the stories of what was happening with the readings, andread him some of the words, he asked me if I could pull in any information forhim. That was all it took. What follows is just a short excerpt of what we got,with the key prophecy included.12/25/96: Coming in to sight is a big boost. . . . Your life is geared to befull of information. Sit down, I suggest you use it. A lot of times, I will endup smiling; I almost rubbed it off on you. . . . You keep saying to try a littleharder, but the decision is already set in stone, so why wait? However, you havemy admonitions regarding [not breaking up during] Christmas and the vacation.Give yourself some breathing room within the time frame to allow her to easeinto it herself. . . . However, trust your feelings. If you can’t wait, thenthere’s no sense in holding it inside. You knew this months ago. It is nice tosee you aligning with your true path. Don’t tell me you don’t think this isgoing to work. Nonsense. You are more than ready to take that chance, and [she]is good and ready to leave you.You may be interested to know that student loans will come through. You shouldvisit New Paltz. Life will change; life in a conservatory . . . People on alesser path will not know the richness that awaits you. So soon will you return.I never complained about the foreign assignments I was given, however I realizedwhen they had followed their due course. It is important that you see that thisexperience will give her a more balanced approach to life. Recognize thesynchronicity between the relative birth and death times of your and David’srelationships. Two years, two months.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber491]Eric and I read over these and other words in the reading and studied themintensely after they came through. It was indeed true that both ourrelationships ended up lasting two years and two months. However, a much greatersurprise was still in store for us. I did tell Eric that the sentence in thesecond paragraph of the transcript originally had been “You may be interested toknow that your student loans for New Paltz will come through.” Since I knew Erichad graduated from New Paltz and was now earning a master’s degree from SUNYAlbany, I broke the normal remote-viewing-type protocols and allowed myconscious mind to get in the way. I asked for the sentence to be rewordedbecause I was genuinely afraid I was getting bad information. However, no matterhow often I asked, all I could get was the slightly different version that wesee in the transcript above.Roughly two weeks later, Eric walked into the Schoolhouse and was extremelyserious when he told me, “You need to sit down. You’re not going to believethis.” I laughed at first, but he was not smiling, so I did what he said. “Youremember that reading you got for me about New Paltz?” he asked me.“Of course,” I replied.“Get this,” he said. “My mother just got a call from the bursar’s office at NewPaltz. They were moving their office from one room to another. One of the lastthings they had to move was a file cabinet. As they pulled the file cabinet awayfrom the wall, they found an envelope behind it. Inside that envelope was aStafford Loan check, made out to me, for nine hundred dollars. David, the checkis still good! She just put it in the mail and we will have it tomorrow. Now wecan pay the rent!”I was absolutely flabbergasted. Despite the fact that we both held jobs, we hadrun out of money—and desperately needed $867 to pay the rent. We had no idea howwe were going to get it. “My God, Eric. I remember! In that reading they did foryou, they said, ‘You may be interested to know that your student loans for NewPaltz will come through.’ We desperately need 867 bucks, and now you find acheck for 900! It’s unbelievable! We’re saved! How in the world were the beingsable to do that?”THE CAYCE CONNECTIONAs the year 1997 rolled on, I became increasingly convinced that I needed tomove to Virginia Beach, the home of the Edgar Cayce Readings. Cayce had foundedthe Association for Research and Enlightenment, or ARE, and it was still runningon the North End of the beach. My reasons for wanting to move were twofold. One,Cayce had readings that said Virginia Beach was a “safety land,” where thedamage from catastrophic earthquakes, tsunamis, and the like would be much lessserious.There was a notorious Cayce reading from an entity calling itself Halaliel thatsaid California was going to sink into the ocean in 1998. This obviously did nothappen, but with all the accurate prophecies I was experiencing in 1997, I didnot want to take a chance.The ARE would later release publications explaining that Halaliel was a“trickster entity” that Cayce called in by allowing himself to be angry at hisdetractors. Thanks to the Law of Free Will, Cayce’s own negativity forced hissource to allow this entity to have a chance to speak—and thus produce messagesof doom. Cayce’s group soon chose not to invoke Halaliel, and were thencongratulated for having made the right choice. In reading 262-57, on January 7,1934, when the group finally asked who Halaliel was, Cayce’s source said, “Onein and with whose courts Ariel fought when there was the rebellion in heaven.Now, where is heaven? Where is Ariel, and who was he? A companion of Lucifer orSatan, and one that made for the disputing of the influences in the experiencesof Adam in the Garden.”2 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber492] This reading may havebeen implying, in a veiled manner, that at some point Halaliel had aligned withLucifer.This type of interference problem was discussed in Session 12, Question 15, ofthe Law of One, as follows:> It is entirely possible for the untuned channel, as you call that service, to> receive both positive and negative communications. If the entity at the base> of its confusion is oriented towards service to others, the entity will begin> to receive messages of doom. If the entity at the base of the complex of> beingness is oriented towards service to self, the crusaders, who in this> case, do not find it necessary to lie, will simply begin to give the> philosophy they are here to give. Many of your so-called contacts among your> people have been confused and self-destructive because the channels were> oriented towards service to others but, in the desire for proof, were open to> the lying information of the crusaders who then were able to neutralize the> effectiveness of the channel.3 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber493]Sadly, even a channel as renowned as Edgar Cayce was not exempt from thishappening. As of 1997, I had every reason to think that this prophecy of aglobal disaster in 1998 might still come true, and I believed in the value ofthe “safety land” prophecies. My second reason for going to Virginia Beach wasthat the ARE had a graduate program in metaphysics with a school they calledAtlantic University. Therefore, I could go to the “safety land” and still get aneducation, even if nothing happened in 1998.In mid-1997, I went onto the ARE website to see if they had any satelliteoffices closer to my home, where I could get more information. They had only onelocation in all the Northeast, and it happened to be in Marbletown—literally thenext town over from Rosendale! It was less than a ten-minute drive from myhouse, door to door. The guy who was running it was named Skip Weatherford. Isoon came over to visit him and he was fascinated with my story, which he saidsounded very similar to that of Edgar Cayce. Not long after we started workingtogether, he gave me a hypnotic regression to see if I could find any additionalinformation about a possible past life in Atlantis. While under hypnosis, I hadfuzzy memories of being a prominent leader during that time. In the regression,I realized that I had become karmically bound to the Earth as a result ofmistakes I had made in that lifetime. Specifically, I remembered having afeeling of intellectual superiority, and having too much pride in myaccomplishments. This was a key factor that apparently led to my having tocontinually reincarnate on Earth for the following twelve thousand years.In my second session with Skip on May 22, 1997, very strange things happened.When I was doing readings at the time, I would put a quartz crystal under myleft hand and a palm-size, triangular amethyst cluster under my right hand. Inthis session with Skip, as soon as my right hand hit the amethyst cluster, athin line of blue electricity shot out from the wall and touched the crystal.The line was slightly bent in the middle and it was perhaps six inches long. Idid not get shocked when it hit the crystal. Skip saw it and was as surprised asI was.Once I was under hypnosis, the beings came through and began speaking to Skipdirectly. At a certain point, he became aware that all he had to do was think ofhis next question, and the source would begin answering it. He finally mentionedthis out loud and wanted to know how it was possible. My eyes suddenly openedand I looked at him with pupils that were dilated completely black. I turned myhead, and with an emotionless, almost robotic delivery, my voice said, “It is byvirtue of the oneness of consciousness that I can do this, as you well know.” Iwas aware enough to notice that he was quite surprised, but was able to hold thetrance state, which was unusually intense in this session.As I left his house to go home, the clock showed 3:33. Immediately after I lefthis house, the power went off and stayed off for exactly one hour. I was proudof myself for whatever had just happened, and I drove too fast on the way home,out of excitement. A police officer pulled me over, giving me a healthy reminderthat I was still subject to the Law of Karma and I needed not to be cocky.Thankfully, the officer let me go with a warning because I was so apologetic,almost on the brink of tears, and explained to him that I could not afford topay a ticket.STRAP ON YOUR PARACHUTE HATAs the year 1997 went by, and the readings kept dazzling me with one accurateprophecy after another, I became fairly certain that I was going to move toVirginia Beach. Eric ended up trying out the Dream Voice technique on his own asof September 24, 1997, since I had thoroughly explained the protocols to him andhe was interested. The file with his readings in it is dated October 17, 1997,and it has lived in the Documents folder of every computer and hard drive I’veever owned, making it easy to forensically prove its authentic dating. Ericpulled through twelve different sessions from September 24 until October 17 thatsounded much like my own did. The first words Eric ever got were, “Myconsciousness is being traced on the inside. Hi, my name is Mike, what’s yourname?” Based on my own contacts as well as those of Edgar Cayce, this may havebeen a hint that the source speaking was not just “Mike,” but Archangel Michael,who had also spoken through me at times. Then on September 26, Michael said, inpart, “What are we come for? We have been with you since June. Welcome to oursun. This is our planet, welcome.” The next day, Michael asked Eric, “What isthe most powerful thing you’ve ever done?” Then on the twenty-ninth, among otherthings, Michael said, “Dave as the wolf.” This seemed to be prophetic of myupcoming move, where I would have to go out on my own to Virginia Beach as the“lone wolf.”Michael got oddly political on the thirtieth, where Eric heard a repeating versefrom the KISS song “God of Thunder,” which was apparently intended to symbolizethe Illuminati in Eric’s reading: “I am the lord of the wasteland . . . I usethe darkness to please me . . .” Then the reading itself soon said, “Russia ishard to define. He’s afraid. . . . How can one feel so intransigent?Technically, it is the Democrats who underscore the White House. This is becauseof the rules of the game as we know them.”This seemed highly prophetic, since I reread this again for the first timeduring a final editing pass for this book on January 18, 2020. I read Michael’sprophecy right in the midst of a massive impeachment drama, where the Democratsare desperately trying to remove the president, after three years of arguingthat Russia had interfered in the 2016 election—such as in the Muellerinvestigation. Eric’s reading said, “Russia is hard to define. He’safraid. . . . How can one feel so intransigent?” This clearly seems to be aboutthe president and his troubles with the alleged election interference fromRussia, which has indeed been “hard to define” and would naturally cause him tofeel afraid for his presidency. This was followed by “How can one feel sointransigent,” and the word intransigent means “a person who refuses to agree orcompromise, as in politics.”4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber494] Eric’s sourcethen said, “Technically it’s the Democrats who actually underscore the WhiteHouse . . . because of the rules of the game as we know them.” The Democratshave clearly been intransigent, as has the president himself, causing a majorstandoff.Other Michael passages from October 5 also now sound prophetic, as I reread thisfor the first time while writing the book. It also had strange encryptedlanguage that doesn’t necessarily make sense, as will happen when you follow theprotocols properly.> In some distant city, one dares to attack the Pope, but is caught unawares.> Coming to a sense of what ONE is about. Remember, it is not the user, but the> finisher. Go along (with) Tompkins’ grandson. Refracting our troubles abroad> by using some “grand device” for the destruction of worth like none has ever> seen before. Yield in your heart, not your mind. Believe in the ONE, all else> is futile. Sunspots appear as historic sites. What else would you expect? This> is not a bi-matrix anymore. Sign-off: Law School. Goodbye.This again was in 1997, and at the time of this writing, the papacy is indeedunder attack like never before with sexual abuse scandals. William Tompkins didnot appear as an insider until 2016, and he verified everything Corey Goode andmy other insiders were telling us. Michael appears to be referring to me here as“Tompkins’ grandson,” and it is true that Tompkins and I became very closebefore his death at age ninety-four. Eric and I did not know anyone with thelast name of Tompkins, so this was another of many cryptic passages when itfirst came in. The “grand device for the destruction of worth” seemed to be areference to the 2007–2008 economic collapse prophesied in the Great PyramidTimeline, and the hardship our world has endured since then, where ordinarypeople never really recovered financially from the damage. I considered at thetime this reading came in that “Law school” was a reference to the Law of One.On October 7, Eric pulled in language that was surprisingly spiritual-sounding,since Eric was not religious in his waking life: “Hello, here we are again myfriend. It is all ONE and nothing at the same time that we follow. Won’t youjoin us? Simply this: who is a rightful heir of our legacy? Don’t you know? Fallinto step behind the master and you will relish the joys of the eternal bliss.Fear not, we are all ONE, no exceptions.” A few lines later, the source beganspeaking in German, at a level that was far beyond Eric’s waking ability andrequired him to use a dictionary to translate it: “Wir sind gerechnet. Allessind unflugende wirtinhausen Sagen (und) lachen wir du komm(s)t mit uns nachheilige Lande, sofor(t)! . . . Ans werkende kamin. So ist alles fertig? Gut.Geben Sie mir bitte ein wunderbares todsprungen Pater.”Eric’s translation of this, which was part of a larger passage in German, cameout as, “We are just and fair. Everything[one] is fleeing the landlady’s house.We say and laugh—or we say laughingly: You will come with us to the Holy lands,immediately! . . . To the working fireplace. Is everything finished [ready]?Good. Please give me a wonderful godfather that has sprung from death.” Ericused a dictionary to find the most precise meanings of each word, in context,and thus his version is slightly different than a machine-generated translation,such as you might get from Google Translate. The voice then reverted back toEnglish, and said, “Ha! It is I, your long-lost friend Martin.”Eric did not know anyone named Martin in his waking life, and he felt betrayedby Martin’s words, as the “lady’s house” that “everyone” was “fleeing” fromclearly represented the Schoolhouse. Eric did not want me to move out, but bythis point he was well aware that I had received prophecies urging me to do so.My readings had already guided me to work a season at Mohonk Mountain House, agorgeous five-star Victorian resort hotel. For a certain period, I had reallyloved it, but I eventually burned out from answering the nonstop calls we weregetting in Reservations for fall-foliage weekends that always sold out over ayear in advance. The only way I could stay on past October would be to work theswitchboard, and I just couldn’t cope with the idea. I knew it was “now ornever.” Eric’s reading proposed a toast to “the working fireplace,” as yetanother sign that it was time for me to leave Mohonk. Every room had a workingfireplace, and I included this in each conversation I had with a prospectivecustomer. The idea of “going to the holy lands” was similar to my idea of movingto Virginia Beach, since the Cayce readings saw it as a “safety land” frompotential Earth Changes.Eric’s 1997 readings also seem to have other time-loop prophecies to our ownpresent. Certain passages seem to refer to the Alliance in the US military andintelligence communities that I have been writing so much about on my websitesince 2009—a group that clearly seems to be opposing the so-called Illuminati.This is part of what came in on October 7, 1997: “Greed is an unquenchablethirst. Let go of your false hopes and ambitions. Weed out all propaganda. Lifeis yours for the taking. Martin Schauerkoff, Lieutenant. [This is a likelyreference to Norman Schwarzkopf, a top US military general.] His word wasgospel. Treat him like a brother even though he is a bastard. God bless themall.” This reading seems to be confirming that the Alliance is doing its best toweed out all propaganda and expose those who have an unquenchable thirst forgreed. Many people have a negative view of the military at this time, but thereading encourages to treat people in the Alliance as our brothers nonetheless.A brief excerpt of a passage Eric pulled in on October 13, 1997, further alludedto the Alliance’s plans to majorly restructure the financial system to make itfair, and implies that these benevolent, angelic extraterrestrials have somehowhelped to ensure this would come to pass: “Gone are the days of simple materialpursuits. We must now teach the world how to play fair. . . . Politics unheardof: Campaign Finance Reform. Something to avoid, it causes breast cancer. But wenever raised any pigs.” In context, this again suggests that the Alliance willcreate massive, sweeping changes in our society. There was also a stunninglyaccurate message for me in other parts of this passage, which I have notincluded here. This prophecy was time-looped to my immediate present, just likehow we saw the coordinates to the 2019–2020 impeachment crisis. Although thisdata is too personal to include and analyze, I am quite amazed by what it said,as it is extremely relevant and helpful within my immediate present situation.Now let’s go back in time just a bit, to September 23, 1997. A reading thatmorning clearly seemed to be telling me I needed to move. Among other things itsaid, “The point is, if you are going down in this area, you are going to haveto wear a parachute hat. Virginia would be a good time.” I couldn’t help butunderstand this one and it knocked me out of trance, so on the tape I then said,“The implications of what you just said are rather stunning. My mind is a littlebit reeling; I am sorry that it is taking me a while to get back into this[trance state.]”5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber495]Then the next morning, on September 24, 1997, at 6:40 A.M., the very first wordsI pulled in from the reading were, “A priest, living in the vernacular [native,indigenous] state. He only beckons for the truth of one thing; wisdom. His manylives have affected him deeply, and that is okay. He still yearns for that whichhe sees in the distance; a new tomorrow, unfettered by the concerns that sodeeply affected him in the past. He prepares himself for a time where there willneed to be a much greater focus on the issues at hand than there currently is.”6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber496] This seemed very prophetic, and clearlyreferred to my having had multiple past lives that affected me very deeply,including that of a priest. I fell back asleep and woke up again at 8:00, aftera very intense dream that convinced me I had to make the move to Virginia Beach.At some point in this dream, I became lucid, and I strongly asked to meet thesource of my “Dream Voice,” as I was calling it at the time. I found myself in astrange, roomy Victorian house that had wind blowing through it. Then I met awoman my own age who, in retrospect, was the spitting image of my wife,Elizabeth. We had immense romantic feelings for each other, but then shewandered off. When I found her again, she was sitting at a desk in a room thatlooked just like my junior- and senior-year dormitory, where I began regularlywriting my dreams down in 1995. There was a guy seated at the other desk who Idid not recognize. This strange plot twist caused me to become angry, since Ihad asked to meet my source and wasn’t being heard—so I yelled out, “Isn’t theresomeone around here who knows what the hell is going on?”I then walked back out into the hallway and saw a different woman standingthere. She had long, slightly graying hair, and was wearing what looked to be afaded purple hippie dress. She had very insightful, penetrating blue eyes, and Iwas immediately comforted by her. She looked at me and she said, “You know youhave to move, don’t you?” I was a little suprised and did not know what to do orwhat to say, but she kept staring at me. I finally blurted out, “Oh, okay, Iunderstand.” I was in a complete state of shock. I then felt influenced to turn,and it felt as though the flow of time was frozen in place, and I was in betweentwo moments. I was in a long and rather wide hallway with a variety of doors onboth sides that all looked slightly different, each with their own decorations.I got the feeling that I was right near the sea, and all the way in the back Icould see a doorway with stairs leading down.A really attractive girl with wavy blond hair appeared at one of the doors,which I now can see was an obvious manifestation of my future wife, Elizabeth.She immediately asked me where I was from, and for some reason I said,“Blooming-town” instead of Bloomington. The Schoolhouse was indeed in a littletown called Bloomington, immediately next to Rosendale. The girl then laughedand said, “So, you’re from Blooming-town, huh? That means you’re blooming,doesn’t it?” I got the nature of the metaphor and laughed along with her. Theneverything went white, and I had a complete phase shift into a whole differentsituation. I was hovering in the air and observed myself as a seven-year-oldboy, where I began doing psychic experiments with my friends in second grade. Inthis case, my seven-year-old self was dressed in a little gray three-piece suit,and I was speaking to some other kids about ESP in a lecture format, completewith a kid-size podium. I kept hearing a soft, gentle motherly voice that wasapparently trying to communicate with my young self telepathically as I spoke,apparently without success. She kept saying, “Diamond . . . Diamond David?” butmy younger self did not seem to be able to hear her. This section was obviouslyprophetic of my future career, where I would often dress up in suits and educateaudiences about the ESP events from my youth, among many other topics.NOW WHO’S THAT?Along with Eric’s reading in German, which he admittedly felt betrayed by, Iknew this lucid dream message from the old woman was the final sign I needed. Icalled the ARE in Virginia Beach and connected with local members who could helpme when I arrived. Just days before I was scheduled to leave, Skip phoned me. Hetold me I had to come over to his house, right now. I had plenty of work to doto get ready to move, so I really didn’t want to go. Skip told me it wasextremely important that I come over, right now. I finally relented, got in thecar, and drove over. When I walked inside, Skip had a magazine in his hand. Hehad taped a piece of white paper over the cover of the magazine and had cut arectangular-shaped hole in the middle of the paper. With a huge, swoopingmovement of his arm, he dramatically and loudly slapped the magazine down on thetable and pointed at it. “Now who’s that?” he asked me. Inside the cutout was aportrait of a face that looked exactly the same as mine. It was so similar to methat apart from the strange, antique-looking white collar, I could easily havethought it was a picture of me.At the same time, I could tell that someone had traced over the picture with acolored pencil to bring out some additional details, in an early, manual versionof Photoshop. The ARE had a magazine for its members entitled Venture Inward,and I had seen other copies of the magazine at his house before. As the silencehung in the air and I continued looking at the picture, I realized this wouldhave to be what Edgar Cayce looked like as a young man. It was a picture on thecover of Venture Inward magazine! The colored pencil enhancement technique hadalready been used on other covers I had seen. I had to say something, so Iblurted out, “That’s Edgar Cayce.” Skip put his hand on his hip, cocked hishead, and smiled widely. “Who else does it look like?” he asked me. “It’sincredible, Skip, I have to say. That’s my face. What in the world is going on?That’s MY FACE!”He answered, “You’re right, David. Your face looks exactly the same as EdgarCayce’s face did when he was your age. And look at you. Now you’re doingreadings that are very similar to what he was doing. I don’t know if you’vestudied all the research on reincarnation, but there are scientists like Dr. IanStevenson who have shown that each time we come back, our faces look the same asthey did before. Dr. Stevenson studied many hundreds of children, mostly in theMiddle East, who could accurately remember details of their past lives.7[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber497] They could bring back names, places, specificdetails of what was on the walls inside a house, and in some cases even solvemurders—and get their former killers to confess. I’m telling you, David, I’venever seen anything like this. Your faces are almost identical. I think you areEdgar Cayce! You have to be! And now you’re about to move to Virginia Beach.Think about it!”A GROUP OF GERMAN STEEL HELMETSOn October 20, 1997, with only seven hundred dollars in my wallet, I threweverything I owned into the Subaru, gave away all my furniture, and made thelong, twelve-hour drive down I-95 from Rosendale to Virginia Beach. Eric and Iwere forced to end our lease of the Schoolhouse, because otherwise we would haveto financially commit to a full year. Our landlady did start showing ourapartment to prospective new tenants on October 4, 1997, before we had evenmoved out. By this point, Eric already had gotten a job with the HuguenotHistorical Society, and actually moved into the upper floor of their librarybuilding. This fulfilled the prophecy he had gotten from my source on ChristmasDay, when it told him, “Life will change; life in a conservatory.” This hadappeared right after the prophetic line that told him, “Your student loans forNew Paltz will come through.”The first place I stayed in Virginia Beach was a condominium on Old Great NeckRoad, which was off of Great Neck Road, with a woman named Linda. I seemed toremember seeing “Great Neck” appear in one of my readings, which turned out tohave arrived on July 20, 1997. Linda also had a housemate named Dennis, who hadbeen a professional wrestler on television with the stage name Dr. Doom. Themorning after I arrived, I sat down on her white leather couch and my eyesimmediately locked on to the bookshelf. I could hardly believe what I saw. Therewas a book sitting sideways on the shelf entitled The History of the GermanSteel Helmet: 1921–1945. I immediately knew something wonderful had happened.The day before the words Great Neck came through, on July 19, 1997, I had pulledin a brief phrase that sounded like it was in German. I wrote it outphonetically as “Skar-stal-ded.” I had no idea what it meant, so I asked Eric totranslate it for me. He felt I must have been hearing Scarstahldig, which meant“a group of German steel helmets.” Now I was looking at this prominentlypositioned book about the history of the German steel helmet—and I was living onOld Great Neck Road, off of Great Neck Road. When Dennis came home, I told himwhat had happened. I showed him the printed proof of the prophecy, since I hadcreated hard copies of everything before I left. He was astonished. “I collectGerman steel helmets as an investment,” he said. “I have one of the largestcollections of them in the world. It might be the largest.” We were bothastonished. Even more strangely, later that same year, his storage unit wasbroken into and someone stole the entire collection.THE GANG’S ALL HEREI started meeting members of the ARE and Cayce enthusiasts, and they were allamazed at my story—and particularly with the facial similarity. It created quitea buzz in the community. I soon moved in with a man named Jim who owned a smallfarm, and had been best friends with Edgar Cayce’s secretary, Gladys Davis. Jimwas a huge Cayce fan. Over many years, Gladys had told him just about everythingthere was to know, including many of the more obscure stories that were notcommonly known. Over the course of several months, I got to learn a wealth ofinformation about the Cayce Readings that went well beyond what most peoplecould have gathered without extensive research. Jim had a book entitled EdgarCayce’s Photographic Legacy, and he was convinced that we would find pictures ofpeople in Cayce’s inner circle that matched up with the people who were closestto me in my own life. It didn’t take long at all to discover that Cayce’sfather, Leslie “the Squire,” looked exactly like my father—and my father wouldonly ever buy men’s clothing at a place called the Squire Shop in downtownSchenectady.I saw an immediate facial match between Wesley Harrington Ketchum, the firstperson who got Cayce to bring his readings out to the world, and my brother,Michael. Cayce’s wife, Gertrude, was the spitting image of my friend Angelica,who had grown up in Muktananda’s ashram. My former housemate Eric was somewhatsimilar-looking to David Kahn, one of Cayce’s best friends, but not as stronglyas the other matches I found. My college buddy Chris looked nearly identical toCayce’s main financial backer, Morton Blumenthal, who ultimately had a hugefalling-out with Cayce and his team. Last, my best friend from high school,Jude, looked almost exactly the same as Morton Blumenthal’s very spirituallyminded brother, Edwin.Since then, I have identified others as well, including Cayce’s wife’s cousinStella, who looks exactly the same as my friend Sun. Best of all, Sun named hercat Stella Blue, and was directly responsible for introducing me to my wife,Elizabeth. I also discovered that Gladys Davis had reincarnated as a friend ofmine, but she never wanted to go public with the story and never has. Myhousemate Jeff, who I lived with for many years in Topanga, California, ended uplooking exactly the same as one of Cayce’s main supporters, Linden Shroyer. Hewas the first to spot this connection by blurting it out as a joke while we wereflipping through the Cayce photo book, right while I was showing Sun her precisesimilarity to Stella. Jim was also able to identify multiple passages in theCayce readings where Ra was mentioned as a separate entity from Ra-Ptah. Thisincluded readings number 996-002, 444-001, and 5756-10. Ra was further indicatedas being a separate entity from “the priest,” which was a reference to Ra-Ptah,in 2067-001 and 3347-001. Lastly, the phrase “those of Ra,” clearly indicating agroup of beings, appears in 294-152, 378-014, 897-001, and 219-001. Most Caycescholars believe that Ra and Ra-Ptah were the same being, but these passagesclearly reveal that this is not the case.WITH THE ANSWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITYAs the facial similarities started rolling in, and the stories began connecting,Jim started pressuring me very strongly to do a reading where I would just askthe question, point-blank. I was truly terrified of this, because I knew whatthe implications were. Being Edgar Cayce reincarnated was bad enough, for itmeant my life was destined not to be private. I would almost certainly beobligated to share all this with the world, and it would be very controversial,to say the least. However, the far greater conflict was in the fact that EdgarCayce’s own readings had said he was the Atlantean priest-king Ra-Ptah, whobuilt the Great Pyramid. The Law of One series had explained how Ra-Ptah’smistakes had altered the course of history toward the negative. It was veryclear that if I was Edgar Cayce, then I would also have to be Ra-Ptah. And, if Iwas indeed Ra-Ptah, that meant I had some serious karmic restitution that wouldneed to be made to the world for the bad decisions I had carried out in thatlifetime. Furthermore, I knew people would have a hard time with this. I wouldbe laughed at, scorned, and ridiculed on a massive scale. The whole idea wasabsolutely terrifying, but I still felt I needed to get the answer.On the morning of November 26, 1997, around 7:25 A.M., I finally “popped thequestion.” Here was what happened as I transcribed it, where I was coming out oftrance to ask questions and then descending back into it to get the answers.Notice that the very first words were “table rock.” This could be a metaphor ofthe Great Pyramid with its flat, tablelike top:> Q: I would like to incubate a question on identity here, related to Edgar> Cayce.> > A: Table Rock. This is our boss. We will have to move over, as he is in> charge. What we are doing here is staring each other in the face. Sometimes,> you will need to do that. It should be very easy to take a guess at this> point, but with that guess comes responsibility; enormous responsibility.> Furthermore, as you are well aware, your connection with us will need to be> dramatically strengthened. In short, David, the answer is yes; you will need> to review the whole life and see the parallels.8> [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber498]This was profoundly upsetting to me on multiple levels. I had seen certainpeople try to say they had been someone prominent in another lifetime, and Iwould always cringe. However, I had to admit that this was a compelling case. Myface looked the same as Edgar Cayce’s face, I had an undying interest in AncientEgypt, I had all these dreams in 1995 that seemed to relate to the life ofRa-Ptah, and I was pulling in psychic readings that were similar to Edgar’s. Ibelieved in this strongly enough to move to Virginia Beach with only sevenhundred dollars. Yet, even with all the evidence, I did not want to be thisperson. I had been through ridicule and bullying my entire life. The last thingI wanted to do was to endure even more of it. Even more disturbing to me was aprophecy Jim identified in Cayce Reading 294-151, which seemed to predict thatCayce would have reincarnated and discovered his former identity as of1998—which at this point was just over a month away. The prophecy read, “Is itnot fitting, then, that these must return? As this priest may develop himself tobe in that position, to be in the capacity of a LIBERATOR of the world in itsrelationships to individuals in those periods to come; for he must enter againat that period, or in 1998.” No pressure! I carefully pointed out to Jim thatthe reading said Cayce’s reincarnation “may develop himself” to be a liberator,not that he would be the liberator. Jim also revealed that in Many Happy Returnsby William Church, on page 226, Cayce had a dream where he had returned toVirginia Beach in a future lifetime—and now here I was in Virginia Beach,putting all these pieces together just a month before 1998. Another Cayce dreamin Many Happy Returns said that he would be surrounded by many of the samepeople who had been with him in his previous life at this time. The sense ofobligation and stress that these passages put on my shoulders was considerable,since at the time I did not have a website and was almost completely obscure onthe internet.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber499],10[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber500]Only a month or two later, Jim got the idea that I should compare the positionsof the planets when I was born to the positions when Edgar Cayce was born. I hadan astrology software program on my computer that allowed me to create aBi-Wheel, where you can see how two charts overlap.As soon as I ran the Bi-Wheel between myself, at March 8, 1973, 11:16 P.M. inSchenectady, New York, and Edgar Cayce, at March 13, 1877, in Hopkinsville,Kentucky, I was completely shocked. All the inner planets were sitting inexactly the same positions, and all the outer planets were in perfect angularrelationships to one another. When I saw this, I literally became sick to mystomach and ran into the bathroom, thinking I was going to throw up. I clutchedthe sides of the porcelain with both hands. I managed to keep it down, but Ibroke out in a cold sweat, my heart was pounding, and I was hyperventilating.This was the Point of No Return. I knew now that reincarnation was the mostlogical explanation for all of these connections. I did not want this life. Idid not want to be this person. Now I knew that I had an immense responsibilityto try to right the wrongs I had created, and I would invariably end up havingto tell the world about this reincarnation story.THE MEANING OF THE LEEK AND “EC 40 57”It was at this point that I realized Jim was regularly buying exactly the sametype of leeks that featured in my terrifying dream where I was about to meet myUFO double. Yet, instead of this just being a case of having an extraterrestrialsoul, it was actually something far more controversial. Cayce’s readings hadreported multiple past lives that were illustrious, to say the least. Thisallegedly included Ra-Ptah, a Persian priest-king named Ujhlt (pronouncedYOOLT), Pythagoras, the biblical King David, and the biblical author of thegospel of Luke.However, apart from these amazing-sounding incarnations, Cayce also hadapparently been a security guard who committed suicide, which had a profoundlynegative effect on him, as well as spending his two most recent lives as a mannamed John Bainbridge, who the readings described as an alcoholic, gambler,womanizer, and “wastrel.” He liked this life so much that he reincarnated againas his own grandson. This was a curious plot twist, because shortly before Ileft the Schoolhouse, Eric had a very powerful dream where all the AmericanFounding Fathers had reincarnated as these guys who were overweight alcoholics,sitting in front of a TV, eating snacks and drinking beer. Eric’s dream wasgiving a potential clue into my own multi-incarnational history, as well as asimple statement of fact: high-profile lifetimes can cause amazing spiritualdamage that requires multiple additional lifetimes to work off, just like Raexplained in the Law of One series, such as with the story of Moses.Once I realized I might be Edgar Cayce reincarnated, many puzzle pieces began tofit together. Cayce’s ESP was developed through hypnosis, and as soon as I wasold enough to read adult books at age seven, I started researching ESP andhypnosis. Cayce used his ESP for healing, and when I was eight years old, Istuck an American Lung Association Christmas sticker with the 1981 date on it atthe beginning of the chapter heading in the ESP book entitled “Your HealingPower.” I soon went back and looked at the original phrase I had gotten from theautomatic writing that started all this. The first two letters, EC, werecapitalized, unlike a normal Bible quote. Edgar Cayce’s name has the same twocapital letters for its initials, and Cayce usually referred to himself as EC inhis own writings. Both Cayce and I were born in the Year of the Ox, hence the“oxen” at the end of my original message. Now my curiosity was ignited. I wantedto find out if the second part of the message, “40 57,” had a meaning that I hadoverlooked, other than being a Bible quote. What if these represented ages inCayce’s life where important crisis points had happened, just like what I hadgone through with losing my job and then my grandmother getting rushed to theemergency room during Thanksgiving?Jim had enough Cayce books on hand that it was easy to find the answer. In thebiography There Is a River, we learn that when Cayce turned forty, the year was1917. Cayce saw the start of World War I, and most of his entire Sunday Bibleschool of young men were taken away by the draft to fight what was by far thedeadliest war in human history up until then. This was obviously a difficultevent in Cayce’s life—the loss of those whom he had been caring for, and theworld descending into what the Pyramid Timeline described as the dawning of theera of hell on Earth. There was the “40” in my original message.When Cayce was fifty-seven, the year was 1935. Between the ages of forty andfifty-seven, Cayce had seen the rise and fall of his professional career withhis Cayce Hospital. Morton and Edwin Blumenthal, two brothers from New York whogot very rich from the business and financial advice of Cayce’s readings, hadfunded the Cayce Hospital. However, the Blumenthals failed to listen to theadvice of the Cayce Readings and refused to pull all their money out of thestock market, as advised, in 1929. The Great Crash happened soon afterward, andthe Blumenthals lost almost everything. The Cayce Hospital collapsed soon afterit had started, and the patients had to be turned away, facing a very uncertainfuture. Until then, the Cayce Hospital had seemed like a godsend, where Edgarcould do his readings, receive a steady salary, and treat his patients withcomplete legitimacy. His dream had come true. Established doctors hadunderwritten his credibility and all the legal loopholes had been closed, sothere was no risk of any government trouble. This loss haunted Cayce for therest of his life. He was still feeling the sting of defeat a few years later,when his whole family was arrested in Detroit for practicing medicine without alicense. This was in December 1935, when Cayce was fifty-seven years old. Therewas the “57” in my original message!The synchronicity was even stronger because when this message came in throughautomatic writing in 1995, I had also just “lost the hospital” in my ownlife—that is, my job working at the ward. Plus, Cayce’s arrest in Detroit at agefifty-seven had occurred exactly sixty years earlier, almost to the week, fromwhen I was fired from the hospital and did the automatic writing. Thesynchronicity of all these connections was nothing short of staggering. Iclearly seemed to be repeating karma from Cayce’s life on a very precisecycle-based system of some kind. Eventually, I wrote The Synchronicity Key, anentire book on time cycles like these.The numeral 60 is a basic “harmonic number” that we see in the cycles Idiscussed. As an example, the Age of the Zodiac, 2,160 years, is one of the mostfascinating examples of history repeating itself. In the book, I give a wealthof evidence that key events from the Roman Empire precisely reappeared as UnitedStates history, exactly 2,160 years later. Key figures in both timelinesreincarnated, such as the Carthaginian warlord Hannibal reincarnating as Hitler.Their faces are nearly identical, except that Hannibal has a full beard. And the2,160-year cycle can also be broken up into 36 smaller repeating units of60-year cycles. Patterns of events are not random; they repeat in these cycles.I was now seeing a dramatic example of it in my own life, complete with thefacial similarity—and it all traced back to the very first reading I had everobtained.Both ages forty and fifty-seven involved a cycle of humiliation and loss inCayce’s life, similar to the total ruin that I now felt of losing my ownhospital job and getting reprimanded. I had also been beaten up by the systemfor trying to help other people, just like what happened to Cayce when he wasarrested. And last but not least, the house number of the place I was livingwith Jim when I discovered these connections was 2280. This is the exact samenumber you get if you multiply 40 by 57. I was truly astonished at theconnections, since the Bible passage from Ecclesiastes also spoke to preciselywhat I was going through in my life at the time, while additionally beginningwith the synchronicity number 2:22.A STUNNING RETURNBy the following year, in 1998, I had moved more than once, and in May I wasrenting a room in a house that was just a block or two away from the AREheadquarters. My friend Chris moved in during the middle of the month. As areminder, Chris was the spitting image of Morton Blumenthal. By this point, myreadings had repeatedly confirmed that Chris was Blumenthal’s reincarnation. Thebeings told me I had to go and turn myself in, and reveal the full story to themanagement of the ARE. They also told me that if I didn’t actually go throughwith this, it was the equivalent of a spiritual felony—just like I would becommitting if I failed to tell the world about this story. I knew I was going inat a great disadvantage. I was not an unconscious channel in this lifetime. Iwas not having entire conversations with people in foreign languages while undertrance. I was not performing “health readings” with an encyclopedic knowledge ofobscure medical terms. The people at the ARE would obviously want to see all ofthese things in full display or else they would never be convinced. Based on theprinciples in the Law of One series, it was obvious that in the modern Internetera, it would violate free will if I were able to perform these types of feats.The Law of Confusion needed to be preserved. I had come in as a differentperson, with a different mission and different corresponding talents, both onthe personal and the intuitive side. The Cayce Readings had indicated that Iwould be more like “the priest” Ra-Ptah in this lifetime than Cayce himself.On May 16, while working the front desk at a local hotel, I found a largediamond on the floor after a woman had come behind the desk to make a call.Everyone had left by the time I found the precious jewel. I turned the diamondback into the hotel I was working at, hoping they could get it to her. Chrisended up calling me “Diamond David” after this, without knowing that this wasexactly the same name the old woman used in my lucid dream where she told me tomove to Virginia Beach. The readings assured me that I had done the right thingby turning the diamond in, even though I very desperately needed money. I quitmy job at the hotel soon afterward, as they had worked me on a constant schedulethat alternated between morning, evening, and overnight shifts, every day, forover two weeks straight. My sleep patterns were completely destroyed, and I wastotally exhausted.I had called ahead to the ARE, told them who I thought I was, and set up ameeting on May 29 to go over the evidence. Chris quickly decided that VirginiaBeach wasn’t right for him, and he moved out on the same day my meeting wasscheduled. Chris and I had a major argument in the checkout lane of a grocerystore, just hours before I first visited the ARE, which made me very tense. TheCayce Hospital, of course, was the building that Blumenthal had financed beforehe had a falling-out with Edgar Cayce, and this would be the first time I sawthe hospital in my current life. Once Blumenthal pulled out his money, Caycelost control of the hospital and soon became destitute.As I prepared to walk the short distance over to the ARE, I was incrediblynervous and my hands were literally shaking with fear. I had printed out a copyof the combination chart, showing the astonishing linkage between the positionsof the planets at the time of Cayce’s birth and the positions at my own birth.And of course, I was walking in with my face, which was nearly identical lookingto that of Edgar Cayce at the same age. Portrait artists had already confirmedthat this near-perfect facial similarity was authentic. A surviving recording ofCayce’s voice also sounded just like my own, albeit with a southern accent.Lastly, ever since I went to Colorado, I had carried my toothbrush, toothpaste,nail clipper, hairbrush, and other toiletries in an inexpensive Buxton nyloncontainer I had gotten as a Christmas gift. For whatever reason, just as I waspreparing to go to the ARE, I felt compelled to clean out the container.I lifted the empty bag and something fairly large and heavy shifted inside. Icould clearly hear and feel it slide from the front of the bag to the back. Whatin the world could it be? There was a zipper on the side that I never used, andI unzipped it and looked inside. Much to my amazement, there was my lost quartzcrystal! It was the same crystal I had carried with me since junior high school.It was the same crystal that fell and cracked, leaving a smooth, wavy surface,after I had my worst fight with Yumi. I took it to symbolize my own fracturedsoul, and all the pain and trauma I had been through. It was the same crystal Ihad felt guided to throw into the Flatirons as I stood before the most beautifulview I had ever seen, in Boulder, Colorado. It reminded me of the diamond I hadjust given away, but it was far more precious to me on a sentimental level.Suddenly, I realized what had happened. I never had the strength to throw thecrystal after all. I still wanted to keep it with me, even if it was broken. Onthe day I was in the youth hostel, I was in a rush to pack and leave. Forwhatever reason, I had unzipped my bag and put the crystal in the side pouch.The crystal had sat in there every morning, undetected, as I moved back in withmy mother. I had it in Adam’s bathroom when I was sleeping on his kitchen floor.I carried it with me every time I went to the shared bathroom at theboardinghouse when I returned to New Paltz. I kept it sitting on the countertopnext to the shower the whole time I lived in the Schoolhouse. It drove with meto Virginia Beach and sat in every bathroom of every house I had rented. I neverthought I would see it again. I believed it was gone forever. And now, here itwas. This was truly one of the most astonishing synchronicities I had ever had,particularly because of the timing and the gravity of what I was about to do,just hours before Chris was moving away. I burst into tears and held the crystalnext to my heart. Even if the ARE wouldn’t accept me—and I already knew theywouldn’t—I knew the truth.It didn’t matter who I was before. It didn’t matter whether I was a prominentspiritual leader or an impoverished farmer. It didn’t matter if I was rich orpoor, tall or short, heavy or skinny, ignorant or intelligent. Based on what Iknew from the Law of One, all that really mattered was that I knew the truth. Iwas living in a dream. The world we think we know is an illusion. We becomeentranced with the illusion. We want to see more, do more, live more, and lovemore. We grasp at the material world as if it can somehow ease the hunger painswe feel for true spiritual nourishment. Eventually, the materialistic pathcollapses. We have a Dark Night of the Soul. The habit patterns and addictionsthat had papered over the pain we feel in our hearts no longer work anymore. Westand up, dust ourselves off, and walk away from what doesn’t work for us. Welearn to make healthier choices. We learn that it is okay to love ourselves andto share that love with others.No longer do we need to live in fear, pain, misery, and terror. No longer do weneed to feel abandoned by a God that seems completely indifferent to us. Nolonger are we alone in the universe, stranded on a tiny blue planet that isslowly decaying into an eventual gravitational collapse and thermal death. As weawaken in the dream, we recognize the ultimate truth: There is only One of ushere. We are—you are—the Creator. That is all you ever have been, all you arenow, and all you ever will be. And that means everyone else is worthy of love.They are equals. We are above no one and below no one. We are all humble seekerson this path. We will do what we can to help ourselves and to help others feelloved. We try our best to practice forgiveness, compassion, patience,responsibility, duty, and honor. We can learn to see self and other as One.Ultimately, we need to meditate on the greatest truth: There is no self, thereis no other. There is no time. There is no space. There is no before or after.There is only Awareness. It is here. It is now. It is everyone and everywhere.It is our true identity—and it is what we feel when we are truly inspired andfilled with love.PEOPLE DIDN’T HANDLE IT VERY WELLA reincarnation story like this may help to serve as a reminder of this greaterreality that we are all taking part in. Let’s not forget that in Session 1,Question 10, of the Law of One series it says, “We do not consider that aseparation exists between the consciousness-raising efforts of the distortionwhich you project as a personality and the distortion which you project as another-personality.” For this same reason, in Section 10, Question 14, the Law ofOne series advises us to “Gaze within a mirror [and] see the Creator.” We arealso encouraged to see the Creator in all others, and in the universe thatsurrounds us.Over the years, I found that hardly anyone in my personal or professional lifecould handle it. The facial similarity, the astrology, the reincarnated familyand friends, the time-bending power of the readings . . . it was all just toomuch. I was subject to every imaginable type and variety of projections fromothers. In one conversation, or one written exchange, I could go from someoneseeing me as their Divine Animus to their Shadow. And then, since they hadn’thealed this part of themselves, they would confront, attack, argue, castigate,yell, scream, cry, make threats, attempt blackmail, and do their very best tosabotage my life, my peace of mind, my happiness, my finances, and my freedom.It happened so regularly that it was truly disheartening.All of this reached a crescendo after the book I cowrote with Wynn Free, TheReincarnation of Edgar Cayce?, was released on March 11, 2004. My contributionsconsisted of two work periods where I added certain specific details, taking nomore than a day or two of my time in each case. Part Two was a selection of myreadings, and Part Three I wrote on my own. The following year, in 2005, I madean appearance at the Conscious Life Expo in Los Angeles, California, where Ipresented the material and sold the books. A former colleague came up to mytable and repeated death threats to my face that he had already sent to meearlier in several emails. An intuitive had told him that if I didn’t stoptalking about this reincarnation story, God was going to kill me. This was theonly time I ever truly yelled at someone after I became a public figure. I threwthe books on the ground and regretted my outburst immediately. The organizer ofthe expo was able to get us together a couple of years later and I did apologizeto him for what had happened.This same year, Richard Hoagland took me under his wing as an apprentice andurged me to drop the whole Cayce story. People just couldn’t handle it and itwouldn’t do me any good. I then dedicated myself more strongly than ever topursue the “hard science,” since this is the arena in which much of the battleis being fought. Richard’s first “assignment” to me was to write InterplanetaryDay After Tomorrow, a master document outlining conclusive NASA evidence thatour entire solar system is going through a massive energetic buildup.11[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber501],12 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber502],13[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber503] The sun and planets are all becoming brighter,hotter, and more magnetic. This is a very dramatic and physically measurableprecursor to the coming solar flash. I expanded greatly upon this information inThe Source Field Investigations.Skeptics can immediately denounce anything they don’t agree with by calling it“pseudoscience” and invoking the will of the collective authorities as if itwere the will of God. Yet, I knew the world was being run by an elite cabalwhose members were hiding spectacular amounts of paradigm-shattering informationfrom us—on every level. They set it up this way to benefit themselves. Bykeeping us believing that we are in a spiritually dead and materialisticuniverse, they can hide the truth of our greater divinity.I decided that if I did have any connection to this seemingly mythical Atlanteanpriest-king Ra-Ptah, I had a great deal of karmic restitution to pay. My workpivoted to disclosure. I focused on revealing suppressed scientific truths. Ifound more and more whistleblowers who shed light on the awesome size and scopeof the Secret Space Program—where we, as humans, are already a Galactic race.The knowledge is simply being withheld from us. Furthermore, beginning onFebruary 26, 2007, I decided to take everything I knew about the Illuminati andtheir plans to destroy the lives of billions of people and go public with it.The first article I wrote like this was called “The Revealing: Endgame of theNew World Order.”14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber504] This soon became one of mymost frequent areas of concern, and I feel that I have made great contributionsin this and other categories. And in all honesty, I will often go for weeks at atime, if not months, without ever thinking about this reincarnation case. Irarely, if ever, mention it in my articles, conferences, television episodes, orbooks. I just want to focus on doing the best I can in this lifetime, withoutcomparing myself to anyone or anything else. This was by far the most difficultbook for me to write, and it took me almost three years to process and heal fromthe trauma enough to finish it. I was only able to bring myself to write aboutthe Cayce connections at the very end of the creative process, just days beforehanding in the final draft.I also want to point out that angelic beings like Ra can only help us as much aswe ask them to, through our own free will—such as through prayer and meditation.This prayerful request is referred to as “calling,” and the word appears in 719different passages throughout the Law of One series.15[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber505] Most important is the “Law of Squares,” whichreveals that each additional person who starts praying for help creates anexponential increase in what these higher forces are then authorized to do forus. This is explained in the first eight questions of Session 7, as well as inother areas throughout the material.16 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber506]Therefore, we can never under-estimate the value of calling upon the higherforces to help us out in whatever way we feel is appropriate, and particularlyfor the biggest problems we face in the world. Prayers for the negative do notbenefit from this exponential doubling effect, as we see in passages such asSession 24, Question 8—and thus the calling for the negative is “not nearly asgreat” as what we see for the positive.17 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber507]PROPHECIES OF THE DEFEAT OF THE NEGATIVE ELITEThroughout the year 1999, I began publishing each new reading on my websitealmost as soon as it came in. I did not, however, include a reading from January3, 1999, in which I was told that the ultimate source inspiring my work was thesame Ra that had transmitted the Law of One. My material was not as rigorous asthe Law of One since it had to filter through my conscious mind, but the sourcedid say, “Do not doubt yourself in knowing that you have indeed produced muchcomparable material with us.” A greater excerpt of this passage was eventuallypublished in The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?, and appeared in a sample chapteron my website.18 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber508]I did publish many readings in 1999, including a very remarkable transmissionthat came in on June 17, which ended up having a blatant prophecy of thefollowing year’s election crisis as well as 9/11. I published it on June 23,1999, and was able to locate a time-encoded snapshot of it on Archive.org fromNovember 28, 1999, which categorically proves that this reading came in wellbefore the 2000 election crisis and 9/11.19 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber509]Early along, the source said, “The vice president looks at this as being partlyhis own authorship, while not realizing that he is completely naked. The interimperiod decides the next victor.”Over a year later, we had an election crisis between former vice president AlGore and Texas governor George W. Bush. There was indeed an “interim period”after the November 7, 2000, election of thirty-six days before the “victor” wasdeclared, since the race was apparently so close.20[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber510] It was only the Supreme Court that finallydecided in favor of Bush, even though it was later determined that former VP AlGore had actually won more votes. After the election, Gore tried to politicallymanipulate the situation, which the reading said was his thinking the crisiscould be handled with “partly his own authorship.” The reading then said Goredid not realize he was “completely naked,” implying the system was rigged andthere was no way he could ever have prevailed.Let’s now pick up with the same reading a bit later. Bear in mind that with thislevel of stunning prophetic accuracy, it is likely that the other portions ofthe reading are equally serious.> When you look at it strictly from a higher-dimensional perspective, there is a> certain quantitative value of negative energy that exists on the planetary> sphere at present. This needs to be counterbalanced, for as we move closer and> closer to the vernal point, or the conjunction of the solar cycle that we have> spoken of, there is then no further wiggle room, so to speak. As this energy> continues to expand, it produces an increasing stress upon the Global Grid> mechanism of energetic vibrations. And this does then directly create a host> of internal stresses, the product of which is the polar realignment at some> distinctive point in linear time. In order to redirect your thoughts, we scan> the most immediate circumstances that are likely to occur in your future. And> with this knowledge, we suit ourselves up with the forethought and the> awareness that you can be healed, that we can enact change within your life.> > Higher and higher the chariot raises in the sky, and it will be seen by all.> The buildings will be smoking, the people will be crying, and at that point it> will already have been done. There will be other stages of it, of course, but> this is an important point.21 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber511]This last passage is a clear reference to 9/11. The planes are referred to as“the chariot,” indicating that they would be used as weapons of war, and would“be seen by all.” Then it spoke very frankly in saying, “The buildings will besmoking, the people will be crying, and at that point it will already have beendone.” There is no valid skeptical explanation that can “debunk” a prophecy likethis, particularly since we can prove it appeared on my site well over a year inadvance of the election crisis.Other readings I published from my source predicted a sequence of events thatseemed unthinkable at the time. Events like 9/11 were very upsetting, but aresistance would appear that would prevent this nefarious group from fulfillingits plans of total world domination. I was told that “a new agreement would bereached in terms of international finance.” I was also told that there would be“something like a coup over the military-industrial complex.” It also said that“government is in for a massive cleaning,” and “at first [this event] will beinterpreted as chaos and disorder.” In addition to the wonderful freedom thatsuch a sequence of events would provide for us, the readings also made it clearthat these events would help to create a mass spiritual awakening unlikeanything we have ever seen before. At the time I am finalizing this book inNovember 2019, these prophecies have not yet come true, but there are intriguingsigns of future success that I have covered extensively in my articles, videos,films, and elsewhere. Let’s now read these prophecies, which we again can easilyprove I posted online in 1999, shortly after they arrived. It is my sincere hopethat by the time this book is released, we will already have observed some verysignificant new developments in these areas.10/4/99: The Big Brother scenario is indeed real, and Big Brother is counting onus to not expose these truths as they have already been done. The subjugation ofthe populace warrants their ignorance, and if they are to become smarter aboutwhat is happening to them, they might actually begin doing something about it.Indeed, as we have already said, it is precisely the focus of experience thatthese [New World Order] individuals are now going through that will give them somuch more to lose when the final steps into the basement are then made, and anew agreement is reached in terms of international finance.So, if you can think in terms deeper than those portrayed in the media, you willsee that there are indeed some serious thugs on the loose here. When we speak oftheir plans of world domination, we are speaking of something that they dobelieve can and will be accomplished. We are here to tell you that just theopposite is going to happen. In their strive and quest for power, they will loseall that they had already gained, and gain nothing new.22[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber512]This reading was originally uploaded to my website on November 3, 1999, underthe title “Stock Market Crash!” You can see a time-stamped copy of it onArchive.org at this next reference.23 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber513] Theearliest surviving version now on Archive is from March 11, 2000. The day afterthe above passage came through, I had another reading that went into even moredetail. It was October 5, 1999. This reading was published on November 5, 1999,in an article entitled “Alcoholism and Politics Give Way to Fourth-DimensionalGovernment,” as well as in Part One of an article entitled “The GreatAwakening.”24 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber514] You can see a time-encodedsnapshot of the original post on Archive.org from November 28, 1999.25[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber515]10/5/99: Once you start binding the loose bits and pieces together, you can seehow all this is leading toward something like a coup over themilitary-industrial complex and its stranglehold over this story regarding UFOsand the like. . . . The question then, is, “What would you do if the SaintBernard comes to you with the whiskey under his neck in your final moments,giving you another chance?” How would you approach these systems when this samephenomenon is going to be happening to them?. . . . We are not about to issue ablanket condemnation of government as a whole. However, what we do see is thatgovernment is in for a massive cleaning. There are some whose strength willbenefit from this, but at first it will be interpreted as chaos and disorder.You yourself, the reader of these words, do have the opportunity to choose notto behave in such a manner at the time that this guidance is given. We are nottalking about fascist Nazi concentration camps that will be created and thelike. No, rather what we are discussing is the systematic breakdown of existingorders in order to make way for changes that will result. . . . When you havehooked up the cables and the wires to the ivory tower, and continued to watchwhat it is that is being pandered to you through the media and so forth, you aregoing down an empty road. Like the gigantic rain forests, the aspects of societythat represent the positive and the spiritual motivations seem to continue to bemowed down by the public opinion as it is contorted to be believed through themedia. . . .We are tired of the house of delegates as well. That is the reason for theexplicit political content of this dream [David had before this reading]. . . .The idea of this transformation of your society is indeedall-encompassing. . . . We now know what to expect and how we will get there.David has embraced these mission parameters, just as you must embraceyours. . . . And so, for the thinking person, the question becomes this: What doI do when I want to eventually re-sculpt society to the way that it should be?We advocate that you take some serious time in contemplation of these matters.26[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber516]JUST BE NICEI want to thank you for reading this book and continuing to support this workthrough whatever means you feel are appropriate. The Ascension teachings arealmost absurdly simple. According to the Law of One, if you want to graduateinto your new life as an angelic being, all you have to do is Just Be Nice. Dr.Scott Mandelker and I would always joke about this at our conferences. Look atyour thoughts about yourself and others. If those thoughts are even slightlyover 50 percent oriented toward love, patience, forgiveness, and kindness—whatthe Law of One calls “service to others”—you are cleared for takeoff. If morethan 50 percent of your thoughts and actions are geared toward negative emotionssuch as manipulation, control, jealousy, anger, rage, and fear, then you havesome work to do . . . but there’s still time to change the road you’re on.And in response to the inevitable question of when the great multidimensionalsolar event is anticipated to take place, the “best guess” from Corey Goode’ssources, as well as from certain dreams I have had, is that we won’t have towait much longer than somewhere between 2029 and 2031. The reason for this isthat apparently the physics of this event will allow it to happen only at eithera solar minimum or a solar maximum. These dates again are precisely mirrored inthe Great Pyramid Timeline, adding extra intrigue to the investigation.The giant spheres that Corey was shown in his visions have apparently held offthis event so that we all have more time to prepare for it. I have also seenvery clearly that only the most negatively polarized individuals will choose tostay on the Earth in physical form as these changes occur. In this way, they canrelease a great deal of karma in a short time and, hopefully, at least begin thepath of restoring their own karmic balance. For the majority of people who aregoing to have to repeat the cycle, they will likely experience a relocationevent, just like we see in Dr. Courtney Brown’s remote viewing. And I don’t knowabout you, but I am very tired of reincarnating in third density—dealing withanger, depression, sadness, loss, betrayal, fear, violence, terror, and pain.The Law of One series clearly indicates that even fourth-density life is onehundred times more harmonious than life in 3-D. You get to have all theabilities of a superhero as you develop into this new being, with full memoriesof your past lives and the ability to help people like never before. If all Ihave to do is spread love and peace to get there, I’m ready. Let’s do this!ACCEPTANCE OF A NATURAL EVOLUTIONARY EVENTThe solar flash is a natural event and we can’t change it. We can shrink interror, ask “the authorities” to save us, and get desperate, or we can simplytrust that the bizarre psychic events that have happened to many differentpeople, like what I outlined in this book, are meant to show us that we areheading into a benevolent, positive transformation. It is a true Graduation forthe Earth itself, and all its people—wherever they may go. This was exactly whatwas coursing through my mind during the second LA earthquake I went throughwhile writing this book. I had just decided to meditate, lying down on my bed. Iwas in a highly elevated spiritual consciousness. I breathed deeply and feltmyself connecting with the Earth—understanding its pain, its fear, and itslonging for a new tomorrow. A dog had been wailing and screaming in a strangeway outside for several minutes, and had finally stopped.As I tuned in to the Earth, I heard a sound come rushing up from behind me. Itwas an impulse traveling through the Earth at a very fast speed. I saw it movinglike a shock wave. I heard it rush toward me at what seemed like at least fivehundred miles per hour. It sounded like a massive bowling ball rollingunderground. As it hit the house, the paintings shook, and that’s when I knewsomething was going on. This was not just a meditative effect. As I was lyingthere in bed, the entire room started shaking. It got worse, and worse, andworse. I felt the consciousness of the Earth and the certainty of our Ascension.I honestly felt tuned into the Earth’s consciousness, as if I was making adecision right then as to whether or not now was the right time. I then realizedthat we were not ready for this just yet. It wasn’t time. Then I realized that Iwas not really the Earth—I was David Wilcock, lying on his bed, and I needed toget the heck out of there! I got up out of bed and ran downstairs to try to getout of the house before it all fell on me. By the time I reached the front door,the shaking had stopped. Nonetheless, I was happy to see that I was indeed readyfor the “final test”—to face any such changes with confidence and peace, knowingthat our friends will be standing by ready to get us wherever we need to go whenthis event finally happens.The Law of One series makes it clear that our focus should be on “seeking theheart of the self” rather than in trying to find a safety land and thinking thatwe need to try to physically survive the Earth Changes. This is in Session 14,Question 14, and then a follow-up answer in Session 15, Question 14:> The harvest is now. There is not at this time any reason to include efforts> along these distortions towards longevity, but rather to encourage distortions> toward seeking the heart of self, for this which resides clearly in the> violet-ray energy field will determine the harvesting of each mind/body/spirit> complex. . . . 27 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber517]> > You have been given information upon healing, as you call this distortion.> This information may be seen in a more general context as ways to understand> the self. The understanding, experiencing, accepting, and merging of self with> self and with other-self, and finally with the Creator, is the path to the> heart of self. In each infinitesimal part of your self resides the One in all> of Its power.28 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber518]I now leave you with four summary statements from the Law of One and two Biblequotes. The first statement was made in the very first session of the Law of Onethat started the entire series, as this really is the core of the message—andthe key to Awakening in the Dream:Let us for a moment consider thought. What is it, my friends, to take thought?Took you then thought today? What thoughts did you think today? What thoughtswere part of the original thought today? In how many of your thoughts did thecreation abide? Was love contained? And was service freely given? You are notpart of a material universe. You are part of a thought. You are dancing in aballroom in which there is no material. You are dancing thoughts. You move yourbody, your mind, and your spirit in somewhat eccentric patterns—for you have notcompletely grasped the concept that you are part of the original thought.29[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber519]We can only ask each group to consider the relative effect of philosophy andyour so-called specific information. It is not the specificity of theinformation which attracts negative influences. It is the importance placed uponit.This is why we iterate quite often, when asked for specific information, that itpales to insignificance, just as the grass withers and dies while the love andthe light of the One Infinite Creator redounds to the very infinite realms ofcreation forever and ever, creating and creating itself in perpetuity.Why then be concerned with the grass that blooms, withers, and dies in itsseason only to grow once again due to the infinite love and light of the OneCreator? This is the message we bring. Each entity is only superficially thatwhich blooms and dies. In the deeper sense, there is no end to beingness.30[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber520]> I tell you, if [my disciples] keep silence, the stones will shout aloud.—Luke> 19:40As I do these things, so shall you do them—and greater things.—John 14:12We cannot offer shortcuts to enlightenment. Enlightenment is of the moment,[and] is an opening to intelligent infinity. It can only be accomplished by theself, for the self . . . but who can know when an entity will open the gate tothe present?—Law of One, Session 17, Question 2In forgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of action, or what you callkarma.—Law of One, Session 17, Question 20"},{"pageContent":"NOTESCHAPTER ONE 1 [09_Chapter_One_Introduct.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber0].

On April 6, I waspermitted to add this final page on the last day before printing began. InChapter 24, page 479, under “The Coming Car Crash,” I quoted from a reading onDecember 3, 1996. After “[These] discussions [are] reminiscent of our talk solong ago. The memories come quickly, like fleeting ghosts,” the original readingthen said, “By 2010, germs will have rid the earth of many problems.Overpopulation is nothing to scoff at.” You can go back to Archive.org capturesof the site in the Notes section and see this passage from as far back as 2000.This passage always disturbed me and I thought it was bad data, so I did notinclude it in this book. However, at the time of this writing I have done fiveYouTube videos on the pandemic, with a total of 3.5 million views and nearlysixteen hours of content. I argued that this may be a man-made virus—released toslow or prevent the unsealing of thousands of indictments against top Deep Statecriminals.The prophecy gives us the year 2010, which is only one digit away from 2020: 20minus 1 is 19. The Deep State’s apparent agenda for potentially releasing“germs” like this is to combat overpopulation, but the reading actually impliesthat the Deep State will be defeated, not the people. Hence it says that “germswill have rid the earth of many problems,” meaning the problems caused by theDeep State. “Nothing to scoff at” sounds like “nothing to cough at,” and theCOVID-19 virus creates a dry cough that produces “nothing,” as in no mucus.Furthermore, “scoff at” sounds roughly like “covid.” When we add have rid fromthe previous sentence after the word germs, SCOFF HAVE RID contains the lettersCO V ID in them, and 20 minus one is 19. What deeper problems will COVID-19 endup ridding us of on Earth? At the time I write this, I do believe I know theanswer. Also notice that after the deleted portion on page 479, the readingsaid, “It is about to be centralized again. I am sorry.” This appears to be thebeings apologizing for how this crisis would temporarily centralize power andcontrol by forcing everyone to stay home, greatly disrupting the economy."},{"pageContent":"Penguin Random House Next Reads logo [../images/next-reads_logo.jpg]WHAT’S NEXT ONYOUR READING LIST?Discover your nextgreat read![http://links.penguinrandomhouse.com/type/prhebooklanding/isbn/9781524742034/display/1]Get personalized book picks and up-to-date news about this author.Sign up now.[http://links.penguinrandomhouse.com/type/prhebooklanding/isbn/9781524742034/display/2]"}]
